          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: The Indo-US nuclear deal is likely to be signed in Washington on October 13 between US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, sources said.         
	US President George W. Bush is expected to sign the legislation passed by the US Congress into law next week.         
	Mukherjee, after meeting Rice yesterday, had said that once the US signed the nuclear bill, the deal would be signed by both countries on a mutually agreed date.         
	India is waiting for Bushs signed statement to clarify some of the concerns that came up during the US legislative process. Delhi insistence came in the way of the deal being signed during Rices visit.        
	Delay not setback        
	The failure to ink the deal during Rices India trip was not a setback but only a procedural matter, minister of state for external affairs Anand Sharma said today.        
	The government never said that the deal would be signed during the visit of Rice... It was a creation of the media. Its a matter of procedure.... There is no setback to the deal, Sharma said.        
	The deal was proceeding as per plan, he said, adding: The historic deal will be signed after George Bush gives his assent to the Congress legislation on the subject.

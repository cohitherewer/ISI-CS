          MUZAFFAR RAINA                           Amarnath protesters during a demonstration in Jammu on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Srinagar, Aug. 19: The body leading the Amarnath land protests has agreed to sit for talks with a four-member panel set up by Jammu and Kashmir governor N.N. Vohra.        
	We have accepted the invite in principle and will set up a committee for the talks. We will announce the committee tomorrow at a news conference, a spokesperson for the Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti said today.        
	The four-member panel formed by Vohra had proposed a five-point agenda for the talks.        
	Raj Bhavan spokesperson Madan Mantoo said the first point would be to work out an arrangement for use of the disputed land by the Amarnath shrine board during the yearly yatra.        
	The state cabinet had on May 20 decided to divert 39.88 hectares to the board. The order was revoked on July 1 after protests in Kashmir. But this led to protests in Jammu that are still continuing.        
	On the agenda is also an assessment of the total land the board needs and plot availability at various locations.        
	The third issue would be to work out a mechanism on how the board should run the Amarnath pilgrimage.         
	The committee will also discuss the boards reconstitution as well as its role according to Section 16 of the Jammu and Kashmir Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board Act. Finally, it will discuss ways to further strengthen the functioning of the board.        
	We hope the Samiti will not lose more time in coming out with an acceptable resolution regarding all the issues in the larger public interest and for peace in the state, Mantoo said.        
	The Samiti has asked BJP leaders L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh to stay away from a rally on August 25 in a move to keep the agitation above party politics, a PTI report said.        
	BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad had yesterday announced that the party leaders would address the Jammu rally organised by the Samiti.        
	But since the Samiti has members from various parties, it appears to want to keep its agitation above party politics.         
	The BJP, however, claimed that Advani and Rajnath would address the agitators on a later date.        
	Curfew was relaxed today for varying periods in Jammu, Samba, Udhampur and Kishtwar districts, but nearly two lakh people thronged various police stations and courted arrest demanding restoration of the land to the shrine board.

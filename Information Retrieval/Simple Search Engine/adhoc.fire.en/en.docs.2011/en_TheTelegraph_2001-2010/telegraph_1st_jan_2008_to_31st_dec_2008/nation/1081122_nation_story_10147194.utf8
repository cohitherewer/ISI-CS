          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 21: Delhi High Court today stayed a court martial against a lieutenant general facing corruption charges against whom the army was set to begin proceedings next week.         
	Lt Gen. S.K. Sahni, who retired in 2006, would be the first military officer of such a high rank to face a general court martial for corruption.         
	In September last year, the general was ordered to report to Jalandhar for disciplinary proceedings after a court of inquiry found he had cheated on at least two counts. But Sahni obtained a stay order then, too.        
	This time, the army had ordered a general court martial to be convened from November 24 after the first stay order was lifted. The high court has stayed it till January 7.

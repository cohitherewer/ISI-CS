                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Maya better than most for PM: Bardhan 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan is not ruling out Mayavati as a future candidate for Prime Minister.        
	She is better than most who want to become the Prime Minister, the Left veteran said, asked whether he saw the BSP chief as a candidate for the top job.        
	But he maintained that it was too early to talk about projecting her as leader of the third alternative being worked out. It will be a natural leader. The leader of the biggest party in the group can become the leader, Bardhan said after a three-day meeting of the CPI national council.        
	However, if the current Left-backed alliance of 10 parties becomes a political formation, the BSP is likely to emerge as the biggest in terms of MPs.        
	Bardhan said the current combination of parties was that of the economically exploited and socially oppressed, and the future of the group appeared optimistic.        
	The Left is not isolated. The future of the new group, consisting of 10 parties who are opposed to both the Congress and the BJP, looks optimistic, Bardhan said.        
	The 10 parties, he said, had rallied on a common platform on issues like the nuclear deal and price rise. It can grow into a real alternative, Bardhan was quoted by PTI as saying.        
	Efforts are also on to include Jayalalithaa, though Bardhan remained non-committal on whether the ADMK boss would join the group. She can come... anyone can come.        
	Bardhan appealed to parties that were with the Congress or the BJP to rethink and reconsider their relationship and join the combination which is coming up.        
	He said the coming together of the Left parties, BSP and the UNPA was a very positive development. These are the political and social forces which can emerge as a potential force to challenge the bipolarity in our polity.         
	Bardhan, however, refused to comment on the spat involving the Speaker. I will not say anything as long as he remains the Speaker, he said.

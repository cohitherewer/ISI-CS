                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Alva case in Antony court 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Alva: Under scanner                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 7: Margaret Alvas show of rebellion has been referred to the Congresss disciplinary action committee, headed by defence minister A.K. Antony.        
	The matter has been referred to the committee, chief spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said of Alvas public accusation yesterday that party cartels had sold tickets before the Karnataka elections in May.        
	The committee has not been given a deadline for action. It could serve a show- cause notice asking Alva why she made the statements that had embarrassed the Congress before the make-or-mar Assembly polls this month.        
	The absence of a timeframe is one way of giving the controversy a decent burial while keeping up the impression that insubordination will not be accepted, however senior or loyal the offender.        
	Alva, 66, had also accused the Congress of adopting double standards in giving tickets to relatives of leaders and said paratroopers from Delhi, with no idea of ground realities, had decided who was a winnable candidate.        
	Alvas son Nivedith had sought nomination from one of two seats in Karnataka but was refused on the ground that he could not win either.        
	The outburst five months later was sparked by the nomination of 24 relatives of leaders, including the sons of Motilal Vora, Arjun Singh and Sis Ram Ola, in the coming elections.        
	Such grievances ought not to be aired in public. We can understand there are emotional moments. I am sure all her grievances can be considered in sufficient forums in the party, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said.        
	Alva left for Mizoram, a state she is in charge of as general secretary, which goes to the polls at the end of the month. But her outburst has put a question mark over her continuation in the post.        
	Sources said the party veteran had undermined her case by keeping quiet in meetings of the central election committee, of which she is a member, when it finalised the names of candidates. They said she argued not from a position of principle but partisanship because she repeatedly charged the leaders with overlooking her sons claim.

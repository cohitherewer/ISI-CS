          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: The CPM today gave its reasons for asking Somnath Chatterjee to step down as Speaker, saying his presiding over the trust vote had seriously compromised the partys position.        
	In an article in mouthpiece Peoples Democracy, the party rebutted arguments from constitutional and legal experts that the post of Lok Sabha speaker is above parties.        
	They have been citing the British precedent whereby a person who becomes speaker severs their relations with the party to which they belong, the article said.        
	The party argued that the situation in India was different. After a person ceases to be the speaker, he or she resumes the political activities on behalf of their party. We have a number of former speakers who are active in politics with party affiliation. One of them, Shivraj Patil, is also in the Union cabinet.        
	The CPM said that after it pulled out of the government, the continuance of Somnath Chatterjee as the speaker became untenable as he is a member of the CPI(M).        
	According to the article, the politburo took the stand that Chatterjee should step down before the trust vote session began on July 22. The central committee endorsed the stand. Chatterjee was informed about the decision on July 20 but he refused to comply.        
	The CPI(M) had decided to vote against the Manmohan Singh government and to work for its defeat. Somnath Chatterjee, as a Party member, by presiding over the session where the trust vote was taken in the Lok Sabha, had seriously compromised the position of the Party.        
	The article said the politburo had unanimously decided in its meeting on July 20 that Chatterjee should be expelled immediately after the Lok Sabha session if he did not comply with its direction.

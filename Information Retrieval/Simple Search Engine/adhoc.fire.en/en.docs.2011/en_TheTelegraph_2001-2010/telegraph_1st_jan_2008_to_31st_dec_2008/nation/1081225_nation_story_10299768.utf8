	Patna, Dec. 24: A state based solely on agriculture, Bihar witnessed a tide of anger over the closure of all its 15 sugar corporations during the 15 years of Lalu-Rabri regime.         
	What replaced the only viable industry in the sugarcane-rich state was a spate of kidnapping (conducted almost in a trade-like manner) that flourished under the patronage of dons-turned-politicians.         
	This human trade that proved to be a nightmare for industrialists and professionals, has fizzled to a great deal in the Nitish Kumar regime.         
	Nobody is lamenting the demise of this industry, remarked director-general of police (DGP) D.N. Gautam (in picture) while releasing a comparative analysis of crimes between November 2001 and 2008 here today.         
	According to official statistics, till November this year Bihar has witnessed 55 kidnappings in comparison to 385 in 2001, 396 in 2002, 335 in 2003, 411 in 2004, 251 in 2005, 194 in 2006 and 89 in 2007. Nitish Kumar had taken over the states mantle in November 2005.         
	The DGP attributed the political establishment-backed police measures as the reason for the demise of the trade. In fact, what marked the beginning of the end was the quashing of the Rs 250cr kidnappers or goonda bank in Naugachhia, Bhagalpur, Kursela and Purnea on the Bihar-Bengal border in early 2006.         
	Manned by syndicate of gangs, the bank had 22 branches equipped with computers and phones. Officials granted loans to people at the rate of 4 per cent per month. In the event of the customers failure to pay back, operatives would kidnap customers or relatives to extract the double of what he had been paid.         
	The banks managers included Bhola Mandal alias Chhota Pehalwah, Arun Mandal and Sikandar Mandal  all wanted men.         
	However, according to police records the kingpins were Siwan don cum RJD MP Mohammand Shahabuddin, suspended JD(U) MLA Sunil Pandey, RJDs Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav, JD(U) MLA Munna Shukla and LJP MP Surajbhan.         
	These dons-turned-politicians are now behind bars either convicted or facing trials under speedy trial measures that the government has initiated through fast-track courts.         
	Shahabuddin and Sunil Pandey have been punished with life sentences for kidnappings or murders. Policemen, previously wary of laying hands on powerful peoples representatives, worry no more.         
	Traders, industrialists and professionals, too, admit that they are more relaxed now. I and people like me do feel a more relaxed nowadays as threats appear to have lessened, said Patna orthopaedic surgeon Dr Bharat Singh. He should know, as he was a victim in 2002.

	New Delhi, Feb. 1 (PTI): An insurance company is not obliged to pay compensation if an insured has suppressed or failed to disclose facts relating to a policy, the Supreme Court has said.
    
	Where there has been a suppression of fact, acceptance of the policy by an officer of the insurance company would not be binding on it, the court said, dismissing an appeal by M/s Sea Lark Fisheries. 
    
	United India Insurance Company had repudiated the claim on a fishing vessel that sank in 1980 on the ground that the firm did not say if the vessel was being operated by a technically-qualified master.
    
	The court said as an insurance contract was governed by a statute, non-disclosure of facts would render it invalid.

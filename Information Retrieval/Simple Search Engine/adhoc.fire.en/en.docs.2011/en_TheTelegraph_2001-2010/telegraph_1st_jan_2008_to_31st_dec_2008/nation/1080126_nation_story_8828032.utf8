     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 25: He is not the King Khan or the AB Baby, but people flocked to catch a glimpse of Uttar Pradesh don Brajesh Singh after the news of his arrest spread like wildfire through the capital. 
    
	The fact that Singh had made the states capital his home for the past three years aroused curiosity and many headed straight for Kharavela Nagar police station last evening for a glance of the most wanted man. 
    
	The police had to chase people away while talking Singh out of the station. By the time he was ready to be taken to the local court through the busy streets, some three platoons of police personnel joined the ride.
    
	Because Orissa is a peaceful state, the sensational news certainly came as a bolt from the blue  others reasoned that Orissa was probably a preferred destination because it was more peaceful than anywhere else. 
    
	Brijesh was operating from IRC village area here before shifting to Bomikhal about a year-and-a-half ago and was running a real estate business. The police now plan to dig deep into his business to find out his local associates. 
    
	A police search at his Bomikhal home has yielded cash amounting to Rs 6.61 lakh, a pistol and 40 rounds of live ammunition. Besides, 13 credit cards and a large sum of foreign currency were recovered from his Krishna Plaza apartment. 
    
	A mobile as well as two motorcycles has been seized. Search is on and more is likely to be found, said DCP Amitabh Thakur.
    
	Meanwhile, Brijeshs partners, in the real estate trade, remain absconding. His real estate firm Bindhyanchal Real Estate Developers and Property Limited has at least six apartments to its credit in the capital city alone, while many more are in different stages of completion. 
    
	Brijesh reportedly came to Bhubaneswar in 1997 and stayed at Neelchakra Apartments for two years before moving to Calcutta where he stayed in Salt Lake till 2003. In 2003, he returned to Bhubaneswar and started his real estate business.
    
	There has been a series of accidental arrests in Orissa in the past few days  the last one of Bangladesh gangster, Arman Aslam, from a Puri hotel. Aslam reportedly paid a rent of Rs 6,000 for his in Maitri Vihar home. He also ran businesses here. Besides, Arman had invested in a hotel and a restaurant in Puri and was planning to buy property for himself.

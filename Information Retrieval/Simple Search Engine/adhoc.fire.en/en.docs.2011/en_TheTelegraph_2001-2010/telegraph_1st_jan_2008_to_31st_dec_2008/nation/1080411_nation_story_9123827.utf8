          AMIT ROY                               
	London, April 10: Aditya and Megha Mittal, the proud parents of two young daughters, the younger less than a year old, have made a staggering 15million donation to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, it has been announced in London.         
	A statement from Great Ormond Street said: This is the largest single donation to the hospital.         
	It was unable to respond to queries from the curious British press why Lakshmi Mittals son, who is president and chief financial officer on his fathers ArcelorMittal steel group, had chosen the hospital for such a generous donation.         
	Although this has been not independently verified by The Telegraph, UK tabloid newspapers, including notably the Mail on Sunday, are going on the assumption that Aditya and Megha may have personal reasons to be grateful.         
	In a statement, Aditya and Megha Mittal said: We believe that the Great Ormond Street Hospital does outstanding work in the field of childrens health. Through this contribution, we hope that more children will be able to access appropriate medical care.         
	The hospitals chief executive, Dr Jane Collins, warmly welcomed the donation.

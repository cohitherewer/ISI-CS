The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US praise for Indian workers
                                                                                                               US praise for Indian workers
                            
	Washington, March 11 (PTI): Over 100 Indian workers, who revolted against their employer in Pascagoula, Mississippi, after being forced to work in inhuman conditions, were praised for standing up to their rights by activists.         
	They claimed that the abuse, which the Indian workers faced, was reported last year also.        
	 We look up to the workers from India who have taken the initiative, organised themselves and stood up together and pursued this issue, Bill Chandler, executive director of the Mississippi Rights Alliance, said. He added that the incident reflected the failure of the guest worker system which is vulnerable to abuse.        
	 He alleged that the exploitation of foreign workers was rampant in Mississippi.

	Beckham bungee    
	 Auckland, Dec. 8: David Beckham took a dive when he performed a spectacular bungee jump during a tour of New Zealand, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The England player smiled as he took the plunge off Auckland Harbour Bridge on the North Island. He dived 130ft to end up being doused in the water up to his waist, for what was the first bungee jump the 33-year-old has ever done.      
	Beckham did not seem worried before the jump, even sending a text message from the bridge. Then he stripped off his top to get ready for his soaking, performing the jump in just jeans and a pair of white trainers.    
	Foul fine    
	 London: A man has been fined 80 for swearing at his own television while drunk, reports The Daily Telegraph. Plumber Martin Solomon, 62, was heard by neighbours as he shouted foul and offensive language at his TV, magistrates in Stroud, Gloucestershire, heard. His ranting put him in breach of an anti-social behaviour order which had been imposed at an earlier hearing. The court heard that his neighbours in Stroud  among them two children aged two and 11  were disturbed from their sleep and upset by the language.    
	Icon salute    
	 Washington (Reuters): Rock roll legends, singers and stars of Hollywood and Broadway were saluted on Sunday for their lifetime contributions to American culture with a gala performance attended by President George W. Bush. Song and screen icon Barbra Streisand, country music legend George Jones, film star Morgan Freeman, choreographer Twyla Tharp and musicians Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of the British rock band The Who were honoured with performances by friends and contemporaries.    
	Deaf kiss    
	 Beijing (Reuters): A young woman in southern China has partially lost her hearing after her boyfriend ruptured her eardrum during an excessively passionate kiss, local media reported on Monday. The 20-something girl from Zhuhai, in southern Guangdong province, went to hospital completely deaf in her left ear, the China Daily said, citing a report in a local newspaper. The kiss reduced pressure in the mouth, pulled the eardrum out and caused the breakdown of the ear, the paper quoted a doctor surnamed Li as saying. The womans hearing will return to normal after about 2 months.

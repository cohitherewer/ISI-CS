	Fired by jets    
	 London, Sept. 26 (Reuters): Swiss airline pilot Yves Rossy became the first person to fly between France and England today with a jetpack strapped to his back.      
	The pilot, who normally flies an Airbus airliner, swapped the planes controls for four jets attached to a wing on his back to get across the Channel.      
	The simple kerosene-burning jet turbines propelled him the 35km between Calais and Dover at speeds of up to 200kmph. The journey took just under 10 minutes. The 49-year-old Rossy, who calls himself Fusion Man, ignited the jets inside a plane before jumping out more than 2,400 metres above ground.

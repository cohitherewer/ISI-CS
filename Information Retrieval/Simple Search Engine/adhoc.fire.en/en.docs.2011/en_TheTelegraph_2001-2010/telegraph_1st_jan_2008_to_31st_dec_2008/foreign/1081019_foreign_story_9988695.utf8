                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Coffee can give women smaller cup
                            
	London, Oct. 18 (PTI): Ladies, please note  drinking coffee in moderation may be OK, but downing more than three cups daily can shrink the size of your breasts, a new study has revealed.        
	Researchers in Sweden have carried out the study and claimed that women who take more than three cups of the caffeine-fuelled drink a day could see their bra size drop, the Daily Star reported.         
	Tests by cancer researchers found half of all women have a gene linking breast size to coffee intake.        
	Nearly 300 women were quizzed but Helena Jernstroem of Lund University, said women should not worry too much. She explained: Coffee-drinking women do not have to worry their breasts will shrink to nothing overnight. They will get smaller, but the breasts arent just going to disappear.        
	Anyone who thinks they can tell which women are coffee drinkers just from their bra measurements will be disappointed. There are two measurements for a bra  the cup size and the girth, so you wouldnt be able to tell.

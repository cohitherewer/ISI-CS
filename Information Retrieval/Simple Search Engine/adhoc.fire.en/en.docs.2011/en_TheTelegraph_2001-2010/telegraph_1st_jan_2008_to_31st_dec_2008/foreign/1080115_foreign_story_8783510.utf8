	Los Angeles, Jan. 14 (Reuters): If a movie wins a Golden Globe, but theres no ceremony, does the prize still count?
    
	Thats the issue faced by the Hollywood studios behind such films as Atonement and Sweeney Todd, which lost their moments of glory yesterday to the Hollywood writers strike.
    
	Globe organisers were forced to cancel their usual NBC broadcast after the actors union said it would boycott the event in deference to striking writers. A 30-minute news conference was held instead, with the winners announced by a revolving cast of TV gossip show reporters.
    
	Thats a poor promotional platform for films that would have benefited from primetime exposure during an alcohol-fuelled, three-hour broadcast packed with celebrities.
    
	Certainly it takes away the visibility from us and everybody, which is too bad, said Jack Foley, president of distribution at General Electric Companys Focus Features, which released best-drama winner Atonement.
    
	Its a big, huge commercial. There are no two ways about it.
    
	Last year, 20 million viewers tuned in to the show.

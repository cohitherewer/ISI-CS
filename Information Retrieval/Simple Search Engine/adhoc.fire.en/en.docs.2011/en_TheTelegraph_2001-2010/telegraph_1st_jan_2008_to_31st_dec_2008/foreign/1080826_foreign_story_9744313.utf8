          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, Aug. 25: Pakistans former Premier Nawaz Sharif today withdrew support to fledgling coalition government, which collapsed the five-month old alliance a week after resignation by former President Pervez Musharraf.         
	We have decided to quit the coalition for repeated violation of commitments made by our partner Pakistan Peoples Party on restoration of judges, Sharif told a news conference after meeting of his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).         
	Sharif also nominated retired supreme court chief justice Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddqui as his party candidate to run for President parallel to PPP, who named its co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari as presidential candidate.         
	We were forced to withdraw support to coalition after we did not find any ray of hope, said Sharif, who had earlier given a Monday dealine to the PPP for restoration of at least 60 judges deposed by Musharraf after imposing emergency in the country on November 3, 2007.         
	Ignoring PML(N) latest deadline, the PPP conveyed to the top leaguers that restoration of judges would not be possible by Monday.         
	Sharif also complained that his party was not taken into confidence when Zardari was nominated for presidential slot and a schedule for election to the countrys top office announced for September 6.         
	 He said that Zardari betrayed him after committing to re-instate judges 24 hours after resignation of Musharraf. This situation forced the party to quit and field its own presidential candidate.         
	He is the best choice quot; the two-time former industrialist premier said of Siddiqui, who had refused to take fresh oath of allegiance to Musharraf in 2000 and decided to resign instead as chief justice.         
	We will continue struggle for re-instatement of judges and restoration of a genuine democracy in the country, he said.         
	 The PPP and P ML(N) had agreed to form coalition government in March after agreeing to restore the judges within one month of coming into power through a parliamentary resolution.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cuba loosens hotel controls
                                                                                                               Cuba loosens hotel controls
          
	Havana, March 31 (Reuters): President Raul Castro rsquo;s government lifted an unpopular ban on Cubans staying at resort hotels reserved exclusively for foreigners today in a new step to ease restrictions in the communist state.  
	Since Raul Castro succeeded his ailing brother Fidel Castro last month, Cuba has ended restrictions on Cubans buying computers, DVD players and cellular telephones. Cubans can now stay at our hotels, said the Cuban manager of a small state-run hotel in colonial Old Havana.   
	Managers at five-star hotels run by foreign hotel chains, such as Sol Melia and Accor , Europes largest hotelier, confirmed Cubans will be able to stay at any hotel if they can afford the hard currency prices. Cubans can also rent cars and use facilities that were previously off-limits to them, including the best beaches enjoyed by foreign tourists in Varadero, Cubas prime resort.         
	The ban on staying in hotels was a major source of frustration for Cubans since their country opened up to tourism in the early 1990s and gave rise to criticism of Cuba for having an economic apartheid system.

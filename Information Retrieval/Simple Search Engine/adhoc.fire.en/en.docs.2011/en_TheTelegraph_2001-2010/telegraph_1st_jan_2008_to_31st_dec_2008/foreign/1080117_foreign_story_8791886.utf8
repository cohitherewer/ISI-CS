 - 200 militants charge base
                
	Dera Ismail Khan (Pakistan), Jan. 16 (AP): In a major battlefield success, Islamic militants attacked and occupied a Pakistani military fort on the Afghan border, officials said today. 
    
	Seven Pakistani frontier guards died in the assault and 20 were listed as missing.
    
	Army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said 50 attackers died in the surprise attack on Sararogha Fort in South Waziristan last night. The casualty figure could not be independently confirmed, and in the past the rebels have dismissed government claims about their losses as heavily inflated.
    
	About 200 militants charged the fort from four sides, Abbas said. They broke through the forts wall with rockets.
    
	Fifteen members of the 42-man Frontier Constabulary garrison reached safety in Jandola, an army base about 35 km east of the occupied British-era fort. Another 20 were still missing, Abbas said.
    
	This is the first time militants have managed to isolate and capture a strongly defended government position since October when they seized several isolated police stations and small military posts in Swat valley, another volatile region in the countrys north. The government has since recaptured the valley. The attack comes as Pakistan is reeling from a series of suicide attacks in which about 400 people have perished. They include former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto who was assassinated on December 27.
    
	The Pakistani army has deployed nearly 100,000 troops with heavy artillery and Cobra helicopter gunships to the border regions to try to block cross-border infiltration by Taliban militants fighting US and Nato forces in Afghanistan. 
    
	Analysts said the setback at Sararogha demonstrated that President Pervez Musharrafs government was failing to contain a growing Islamist insurgency ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for February 18. 
    
	This is a huge loss, said Talat Masood, a retired general and now a political analyst. The militants are now challenging the army openly. They have become very bold and are consolidating their positions.
    
	Local tribesmen were increasingly joining Taliban forces from across the border in Afghanistan, he said. Even if they dont support Taliban per se, they are now siding with them.

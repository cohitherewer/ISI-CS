	Madrid, Jan. 23: A Spanish magazine has published an exclusive picture of Carla Bruni lying provocatively on floor cushions wearing only a pair of black leather boots.
 
	The Italian supermodel turned singer and companion to the French President Nicholas Sarkozy is pictured preserving her modesty with her arms folded across her chest. 
 
	In another black and white photo posted on blogs, Bruni is shown completely topless. It appears that both photos were taken from the same set, although their origins are unclear.
 
	The less explicit image, published in the February edition of DT, a glossy mens magazine, will do little to dispel the rumour that the couple have wed in secret.
 
	Questions will no doubt be asked why Bruni, 40, who in a recent interview said she was not married mdash; yet was pictured wearing a wedding band. 
 
	A spokesman for the magazine could not confirm when exactly the image was taken but said it was before news of her relationship with the French President was officially confirmed. 
 
	It could have been as early as last August, said Maria Sanchez, from the magazines publisher Focus. 
 
	She said the image was one of a series taken in a photoshoot by New York agency Art amp; Commerce.
 
	 The short text accompanying the striking image does not mention Brunis relationship at all and instead concentrates on her success as a model and singer: she has released two albums. 
 
	The image was published as an opinion poll revealed that the vast majority of French people are sick of hearing about the romantic escapades of their President. 
 
	The TNS Sofres poll for La Croix daily said 93 per cent of people thought the media had dedicated too much space to Sarkozys private life, while 52 per cent thought too much space was given to covering his political actions. 
 
	Sarkozy has rarely been off the front pages of newspapers and celebrity magazines in recent months following his divorce from his second wife Cecilia in October and his subsequent liaison with Bruni.
 
	The Presidents own popularity ratings have fallen sharply over the past two months, with voters apparently turned off by the wall-to-wall coverage of his love life and anxious for more action to combat their daily economic problems.

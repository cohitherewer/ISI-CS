          PETER WALLSTEN, DAVID ZUCCHINO AND BOB DROGIN                        Obama, McCain: Contradictory reactions in hard times				                                             
	Washington, Oct. 12: For months, Mark Wagner stuck by John McCain, even as the economy stalled and other Americans came to blame Republican leadership. Then, about three weeks ago, the deepening economic downturn pushed him to reconsider.        
	Now, the Florida salesman and staunch Republican has abandoned the GOP ticket. Sarah Palin, he thinks, looks under-equipped to be Vice- President. And McCain, he says, displayed an unsteady response to what may be a global economic depression.        
	The financial crisis has turned the last three weeks into a crucial and possibly decisive period in the presidential contest  a time when many Americans have taken a new look at each candidate and then moved towards Democrat Barack Obama.        
	Like a wave, the crisis has washed over other factors in a contest that had seemed to be a dead heat, moving enough voters to give the senator from Illinois a consistent lead in polls nationwide.        
	Republican officials in several states say they fear voters have judged McCain and Palin harshly in how they reacted to the financial downturn. Obama, meanwhile, now looks like an acceptable alternative to many voters who had been hesitant to pull the lever for him because of concerns about his untraditional background and relatively recent appearance in national affairs.        
	If you looked at some of the decisions that Obamas made, and the consistency and levelness that hes had in these trying times over the past few weeks, in my opinion hes blown McCain away, said Wagner, 47, of Tampa.        
	Voters who have been blaming Bush and Republicans in general for the financial crisis now seem to be tying it around McCains neck as well.        
	Mark Souder, an Indiana Republican, said he was looking at an Obama tide in his district and wondering about his own reelection: Can I withstand a firestorm?        
	The impression of McCain on the economy is that he wanted more deregulation than Bush at a time that voters are demanding more help from the government, he said. Souders home state has not picked a Democrat for President since 1964.         
	In the end I think McCain will carry Indiana. But if you are fighting for Indiana, you are in trouble.

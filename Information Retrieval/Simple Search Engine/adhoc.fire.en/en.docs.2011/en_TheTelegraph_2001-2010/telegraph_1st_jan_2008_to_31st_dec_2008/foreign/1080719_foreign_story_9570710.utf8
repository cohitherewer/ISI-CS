	Salma ties    
	 New York, July 18 (AP): Salma Hayek has called off her engagement to French businessman Francois-Henri Pinault, her representative said today.      
	The couple announced their plans to wed in March 2007 and welcomed a daughter, Valentina Paloma Pinault, several months later. We are sad to announce the engagement of Salma Hayek and Francois-Henri Pinault has been cancelled, publicist Cari Ross said in a statement. There will be no further comment.

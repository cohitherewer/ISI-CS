The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Chaudhry insists he is still chief justice
                                                                                                               Chaudhry insists he is still chief justice

	Quetta, April 1 (AP): Pakistans deposed chief justice claimed today that he was still the legal head of the supreme court and hailed the election defeat of President Pervez Musharrafs allies as the end of one-man rule.        
	I am still the chief justice of the supreme court as per the Constitution and nobody can bar me from discharging my duties, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry said at a lawyers convention in Quetta.        
	In his first prepared speech since his release from house arrest last week, Chaudhry insisted that his removal during emergency in November was illegal and denounced those who then accepted positions at the court as illegitimate.        
	The judges who refused to swear a fresh oath of office during the emergency claim that we are all the judges of the courts, and those people who took the oath... are not legal and constitutional judges, Chaudhry said.        
	He added that the results of the February parliamentary elections changed the countrys culture.        
	Who did this? This is done by you people and the people of the country. The message is clear that in future everything will be constitutional in the country and there will be no more one-man rule, Chaudhry said.        
	The parties of assassinated Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif swept to power in elections supposed to complete Pakistans return to democracy after eight years of military rule.        
	Their coalition faces the tough task of dealing with mounting economic problems and Islamic militancy spreading from the lawless mountains along the Afghan border.        
	A bomb and gun attack on a road in the northwestern Swat valley today wounded eight tribal leaders, one of them fatally, as they headed for talks with the army.        
	Haider Khan Hoti, the new chief minister of North West Frontier province, said today that authorities there favour dialogue over the regular military operations ordered by Musharraf.        
	Some army attacks on militants linked to the Taliban and al Qaida have caused civilian casualties. Many Pakistanis argue that has fanned extremism. The new government says it will negotiate with militants willing to give up violence.        
	There is no more room for any further bloodshed and destruction, Hoti, a member of a secular Pashtun nationalist party, said after provincial lawmakers elected him unopposed.        
	Use of force should always be the last option to solve problems but unfortunately during the past several years it had been the governments very first option, he said.        
	The chief minister urged the international community to understand that the provinces people are not terrorists.        
	We dont want suicide jackets, bullets and guns for our children. We want books, we want pens and a better future, Hoti said.        
	The new federal government is devoting much of its energy to clipping Musharrafs powers, who stepped down as army chief in November and whose re-election as President the previous month is deeply disputed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Russian forces to withdraw
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Russian forces to withdraw
                            
	Tbilisi, Aug. 17 (Reuters): Russia announced it would begin withdrawing forces from Georgia tomorrow after a war that dealt a humiliating blow to the Black Sea state and raised fears for energy supplies to Europe.        
	Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, whose failed invasion of the pro-Russian breakaway region of South Ossetia triggered a Russian backlash that shocked the West, called for international monitoring of the pullout.        
	I think the world should watch, he told a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Tbilisi. Merkel said the world would indeed be watching for Russia to withdraw quickly under the terms of a six-point peace plan brokered by France.        
	Russias defence ministry, underlining continued high tension between the two countries, said Georgia was planning a major provocative act in the city of Gori, captured by Russian forces on Tuesday as they fanned out from the disputed region into the Georgian heartland.        
	It said Georgia was forming bands of mercenaries who would be given Russian uniforms and told to loot and pillage.        
	Georgia issued a swift denial. Such a provocation would only be staged by the Russian side, with the aim of keeping Russian military units in the conflict zone, the Georgian interior ministry said in a statement.        
	Russian troops remained in position around Gori, which commands the approaches to South Ossetia and the main east-west highway and should be central to covering a Russian withdrawal.        
	Major-General Vyacheslav Borisov, now a familiar figure touring the area of his command around Gori in a Georgian four-wheel-drive, could not say when he would be moving out.        
	We were the first in, so well be the last out, Borisov said at the roadside near Gori.        
	There was no sign of shooting and troops appeared relaxed.        
	President Dmitry Medvedev, in announcing the pullout from midday tomorrow during a telephone conversation with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, also gave no firm deadline for completion of the withdrawal.        
	A Georgian official accused Russian forces of destroying Georgian television and radio transmitters in the Gori region and installing their own.

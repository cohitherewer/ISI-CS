The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China faces unrest risk
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             China faces unrest risk
                              Zhou: Bleak prospects                            
	Beijing, Dec. 5 (Reuters): China risks massive social turmoil as the economy slows and the number of angry jobless grows, a leading Communist Party scholar has warned, urging the government to focus spending priorities on job creation.        
	Zhou Tianyong, a researcher at the Central Party School in Beijing, forecasts the reservoir of poor, jobless workers and farmers will climb as nations growth rate slows to about 7.5 per cent next year, its slowest pace for many years.        
	Writing in the China Economic Times yesterday, Zhou warned that the resulting strains between rich and poor could erupt into unrest that will test the ruling communist partys grip.        
	The redistribution of wealth through theft and robbery could dramatically increase and menaces to social stability will grow, he wrote in the Chinese-language newspaper issued by a state think tank.This is extremely likely to create a reactive situation of mass-scale social turmoil.        
	The Central Party School is the premier training ground for emerging leaders and Zhou has been an outspoken advocate of political liberalisation and more equitable development.        
	His views do not reflect leadership policy. But they suggest real worry in elite circles about threats from flagging exports and spreading factory closures.        
	Chinas annual GDP growth slowed to 9.0 per cent in the third quarter, from 10.1 per cent in the second, and some forecasters see growth slowing to a dangerously low 7.5 per cent next year.        
	Zhous bleak assessment appeared on the same day that Beijing and Washington concluded their latest economic dialogue. But he saw little hope in holding out for a rapid US recovery.        
	In his survey of Chinas prospects, Zhou argued that the governments artificially low count of urban unemployment  about 4 per cent now  had bamboozled leaders into underestimating threats to social stability from slowed growth. The real rate of urban joblessness grew to 12 per cent this year, he estimated, warning it could climb to 14 per cent next year.

          CHRIS HASTINGS                          Daniel Craig as Bond in a scene from Quantum of Solace                                  
	London, Nov. 2: He is known for his licence to kill, but James Bond has now, it seems, been issued with a licence to sell.         
	To mark the release of the new film, Quantum of Solace, Britains most famous secret agent has been recruited to endorse an extensive range of products from lottery tickets to lager, in deals worth around 100 million.        
	Industry experts say the number of official 007-themed ads and tie-ins is unprecedented and have voiced concerns of overkill, warning that the films producers could be in danger of damaging the Bond brand.        
	The list of firms which have signed lucrative deals to use catchphrases, music, logos and images associated with the character, as well as the films stars, features some of the worlds biggest businesses: Coca Cola, Ford, Heineken, Barclaycard, Sony, Sony Ericsson, Virgin Atlantic, Camelot, Omega, Bollinger, Smirnoff, Orbitz and Avon.        
	Lucy Barrett, the editor of the magazine Marketing, said: I think it is overkill this time around. There is just simply too much of it. I couldnt believe it when I saw the ad for Barclaycard. I thought what does that have to do with James Bond? As far as I know a Barclaycard doesnt even figure in the film.        
	Gordon MacMillan, the editor of Brand Republic, the leading website for the advertising, marketing and PR industries, said the product placement and the campaigns  which give the film free publicity  could be worth up to 100 million.        
	James Bond is one of the biggest movie franchises there is and companies obviously want to be associated with him. Not only have these brands paid millions to be associated with this film, they are also providing advertising for it which is itself worth millions. You could be talking of a total package of more than 100 million when you also factor in the product placement deals.        
	It is extremely excessive this time around and there is a real level of frenzy. There is a danger that these campaigns could detract from the films. Some of the products have just got nothing to do with Bond and dont fit his suave image. Would a Bond girl really wear Avon? I doubt it. And Bonds favourite drink is not Heineken.        
	Most of the new campaigns started appearing last week in the run up to the release of the new Bond adventure, which opened on Friday with a record one day take of 5 million.        
	Some of the products at the centre of the campaigns actually feature in Quantum of Solace and are part of the product placement deals. Ford, Virgin Atlantic and Sony Erricson all feature in the film.        
	Michael G. Wilson, the co-producer and co-owner of the Bond franchise, said they were not paid by the companies using Bond in their ads.        
	But he admitted that the film benefited from the campaigns in the form of free advertising.                    THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

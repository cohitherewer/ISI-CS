The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cherie tough talk for Michelle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cherie tough talk for Michelle
          RACHEL L. SWARNS                            Cherie, Michelle: Like the Back Seat                                 
	Washington, Nov. 24: It was tough-love talk from one high-profile professional mother to another, only this hard-hitting counsel did not come in a phone call or a letter. It appeared in The Times, London, this month under the headline: My advice to Michelle Obama: Learn to Like the Back Seat.        
	The pointed words came from Cherie Blair, a lawyer, mother of three and the wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Brace yourself for big letdowns in your life as First Lady, she warned Michelle Obama, a lawyer, mother of two and the wife of President-elect Barack Obama. You have to learn to take the back seat, not just in public, but in private, advised Cherie Blair.        
	When your spouse is late to put the kids to bed, or for dinner, or your plans for the weekend are turned upside down again, you simply have to accept that he had something more important to do.        
	It is something of an irony that in these days of pushing for equality those of us married to our political leaders have to put their own ambitions on hold while their spouses are in office and keep their views to themselves, Cherie Blair continued. I, at least, had my career. That is not an option for Michelle Obama.         
	The unsolicited advice reflects the passionate debate stirring among working mothers here and abroad as they watch Michelle Obama finalise her transition from hospital executive to self-proclaimed mom-in-chief in the White House. While she has publicly embraced her soon-to-be assumed role as First Lady, many women remain deeply divided over whether she will become a pioneer or a dispiriting symbol of the limitations of modern working motherhood.        
	The discussion has bubbled up on blogs, Internet magazines, television interviews and radio talk shows among ordinary women and some prominent ones. The issue is argued with particular intensity, not simply because Michelle Obama will be the first black woman in the position, but also because she had maintained a career and put it on hold to help her husband campaign for the presidency.

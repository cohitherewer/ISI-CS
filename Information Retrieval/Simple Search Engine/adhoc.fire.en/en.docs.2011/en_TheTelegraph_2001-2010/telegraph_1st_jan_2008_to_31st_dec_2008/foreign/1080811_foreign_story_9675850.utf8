	Bangkok, Aug. 10 (Reuters): Ousted Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra will not return to Thailand again, a pro-Thaksin MP said today, suggesting the billionaire had flown to London from Beijing in violation of his bail terms.        
	Thaksin was due to return to Bangkok today but MP Pracha Prasobdee told reporters at the airport he had spoken to a Thaksin aide who said the former Prime Minister would be making a statement via the foreign media at 9am from London. That is about the same time Thaksin and his wife are meant to report to the courts under bail conditions set in various corruption cases against them.

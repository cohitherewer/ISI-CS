                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       McCain in fresh comeback bid
                                          McCain: Last  throw  of dice?      
	Virginia Beach, Virginia, Oct. 13 (Reuters): US Republican presidential nominee John McCain today sought to assure supporters he could come back to defeat Democrat Barack Obama in the face of drooping poll numbers and doubts in his own party.        
	My friends, weve got them just where we want them, McCain told a rally in the battleground state of Virginia as he attempted to breathe new life into his campaign after a two-week tailspin due largely to his reaction to the US financial crisis.        
	With three weeks to go until November 4 election day, McCain awoke to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that had him down 10 points to Obama, 53 per cent to 43 per cent, and showed McCain was stalled or losing ground on a range of issues.        
	Illinois senator Obama has surged based on his steady response to the Wall Street crash, with polls showing he is more trusted by Americans to handle economic issues, and McCains standing has suffered as a consequence.        
	We have 22 days to go. Were 6 points down. The national media has written us off. Senator Obama is measuring the drapes, McCain told thousands of cheering supporters in Virginia Beach, joined by his vice-presidential running mate, Sarah Palin.        
	Obama, in Toledo, Ohio, laid out what he called an economic rescue plan for the middle class that would include a 90-day foreclosure moratorium for some homeowners and limited penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts this year and next.        
	He would also give businesses a new American jobs tax credit for each new employee they hire in the US over the next two years.        
	We can restore a sense of fairness and balance that will give every American a fair shot at the American dream. And above all, we can restore confidence  confidence in America, confidence in our economy, and confidence in ourselves, he said in speech excerpts released by his campaign.

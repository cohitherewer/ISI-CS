	Beijing, April 22 (Reuters): China has cancelled media access to the departure of the Beijing Olympic torch from Everest North Base Camp before an attempt is made to take it to the top of the worlds highest mountain early next month.        
	Non-Chinese media approved to report on the attempt to take the torch up Everest were told today, the day of their scheduled departure, that the trip had been postponed and partly cancelled.        
	The Beijing Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG) said unsuitable weather in the Himalayan region of Tibet had forced them to put the trip back until Saturday at the earliest.        
	Officials also said the media would no longer be at North Base Camp when the climbing party left with the torch for the summit.        
	It has been cancelled for both Chinese and international media, Shao Shiwei, deputy director of BOCOG media department.         
	Instead, the media will leave Beijing at the same time as the torch leaves Base Camp and go straight to Everest via Lhasa.

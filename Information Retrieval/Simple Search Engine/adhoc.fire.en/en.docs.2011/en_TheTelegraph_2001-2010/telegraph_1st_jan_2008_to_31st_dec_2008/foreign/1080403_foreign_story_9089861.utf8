	Freak show    
	 Chicago, April 1 (Reuters): A transgender man who kept his female reproductive organs despite his transformation is now five months pregnant and will appear on Oprah Winfreys television show, the talk show said yesterday.      
	Im a person and I have the right to have my own biological child, Thomas Beatie, of Bend, Oregon, said in excerpts from the show.      
	Sceptics questioned whether the story was an April Fools hoax, but the Chicago-based talk show said Winfrey interviewed Beatie, his wife Nancy and their obstetrician along with friends of the couple. Beatie also did an interview with People magazine.      
	Beatie and his wife Nancy recount how she was unable to conceive because of a prior hysterectomy, according to the excerpts. If Nancy could get pregnant, I wouldnt be doing this, Beatie said.    
	David talk    
	 Burbank, California (AP): David Beckham got to know one of his neighbours on national television on Tuesday night. Since moving to Los Angeles to play for the Galaxy, Beckham has lived in the same neighbourhood as Jay Leno, host of the The Tonight Show. On Tuesday, they traded jokes about driving themselves places and life with a constant paparazzi presence on Lenos late night show. Beckham apologised for the paparazzi hanging around the neighbourhood, but also said American celebrity photographers have been kind to us compared to those in Europe who are constantly trailing the soccer star.    
	Arms man

Executors found an arsenal of weaponry and assorted goods at the mans two-storey home in the western city of Aachen, police said on Wednesday. There were 71 guns  one for each year of his life, police said. He also had 41 cases of ammunition and five walking sticks fitted with retractable blades.    
	Velvet split    
	Los Angeles (Reuters): Four founding members of the rock band Velvet Revolver said on Tuesday they were splitting with the groups troubled singer, Scott Weiland, citing his increasingly erratic behaviour. The announcement came in a terse statement from the groups management company.

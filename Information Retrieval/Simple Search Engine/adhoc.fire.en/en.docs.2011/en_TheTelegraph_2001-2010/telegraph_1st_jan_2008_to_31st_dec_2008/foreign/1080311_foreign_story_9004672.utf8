The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama rejects dream ticket

	Washington, March 10: Barack Obama yesterday rejected Hillary Clintons suggestion that he stand as her Vice-President on a Democratic dream ticket.        
	After bouncing back from defeats last week to claim an easy victory in Wyoming at the weekend, Obama said: You wont see me as a vice- presidential candidate. Im running for President. We have won twice as many states as Senator Clinton, and have a higher popular vote, and I think we can maintain our delegate count.        
	In an interview with KTVQ television he added: What Im really focused on right now, because all that stuff is premature, is winning this nomination and changing the country, he said. Clinton has repeatedly hinted that Obama could join her on her ticket as a way of ending the current impasse over the nomination.        
	Obama lost the popular vote in the big states of Texas and Ohio last Tuesday and later had to jettison a foreign policy adviser after she called Clinton a monster.         
	Clinton and her husband Bill have talked up the idea of a joint ticket in recent days. The former First Lady said on Friday that it might be possible some day, while the former President has gushed about its advantages.        
	I know that she has always been open to it, because she believes that you can unite the energy and the new people hes brought in, he said.

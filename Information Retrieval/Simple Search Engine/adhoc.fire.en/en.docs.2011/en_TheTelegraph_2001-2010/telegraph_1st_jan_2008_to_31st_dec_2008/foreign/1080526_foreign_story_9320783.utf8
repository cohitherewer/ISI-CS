	Kathmandu, May 25 (AP): A 76-year-old Nepalese man reached the summit of Mount Everest today to become the oldest person to climb the worlds highest mountain, mountaineering officials said.        
	Min Bahadur Sherchan reached the 29,035-foot summit early in the morning with his climbing guides, said Nepals tourism ministry official Ramesh Chetri.        
	Sherchan is just 25 days from his 77th birthday, Chetri said.        
	He beat the record set last year by Japanese climber Katsusuke Yanagisawa, who scaled the peak at age 71. Sherchan was in good health and was descending from the summit, Chetri said.        
	The former soldier has climbed smaller mountains before his Everest feat and has been an active sportsman, Chetri said.        
	He said about a dozen climbers were reported to have scaled Everest today following one of the busiest weeks in the mountains climbing season.        
	A veteran Sherpa guide scaled Everest on Thursday for a record 18th time. Appa, who like most Sherpas goes by only one name, reached the summit along with several colleagues.        
	He was among more than 80 climbers to reach the summit that day  the largest number ever on a single day from the Nepalese side of the peak.        
	Mountaineers were able to resume Everest expeditions on May 9 after the government lifted a temporary ban ordered to prevent any protests against Chinas rule in Tibet during an ascent by Chinese climbers carrying the Olympic torch.        
	The Chinese torch team scaled the summit on May 8  from the northern Tibetan side of Everest  and Nepal lifted the ban a day later.

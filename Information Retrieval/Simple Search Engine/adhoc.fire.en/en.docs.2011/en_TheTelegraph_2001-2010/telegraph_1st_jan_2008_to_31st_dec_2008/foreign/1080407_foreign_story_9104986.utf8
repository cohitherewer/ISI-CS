          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	London, April 6: After todays Olympics protest in London, Tibet is now likely to replace Iraq and Afghanistan as the major foreign policy issue confronting western governments.         
	But if there is violence as the Olympic torch makes its way through other cities, including Delhi on April 17, many governments will have to reassess whether they can afford to send official delegations to China.         
	Significantly, Gordon Brown, who has announced he will go to Beijing, refused to hold the Olympic torch today. He looked distinctly uncomfortable when he came out to pose with the torch alongside Tessa Jowell, the cabinet minister with responsibility for the Olympics.         
	Brown has sought refuge in the Dalai Lamas words by arguing: The Dalai Lama himself has said that he does not want to see a boycott of the Olympics and that is why I have said, as the host country for the 2012 Olympics that is coming up, that I will attend the Olympics as I hope many others do.         
	Brown first greeted the torch behind Downing Streets closed steel gates in front of a vetted crowd as though ashamed of what he was doing.         
	The distinction that Jowell made may not be appreciated by British voters.         
	She said: It is absolutely not an endorsement of the Chinese government or any of the aspects of the Chinese government that in this country we find completely unacceptable. This is an endorsement of the Olympics, what the Olympics mean to athletics, to sport around the world, the principles that the Olympics stand for. It is not an endorsement of the politics of China.         
	However, her criticisms of China indicated that British policy may be shifting: I hope that the message that will go round the world is that, yes, there are many citizens of the UK who feel very strongly about Chinas human rights record, there are people in the UK who feel very strongly about the importance of dialogue with the Dalai Lama, and that in the UK we cherish the right to lawful and peaceful protest which, by and large, is what we have seen today.         
	The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, said that it was wholly inappropriate for Brown to greet the torch and called on him to stay away from Beijing unless China changed its policies. One shouldnt be naive. Of course there is politics in this.         
	One of Browns own MPs, Labour former sports minister Kate Hoey, reflected on the fact that Tibet is becoming the number one issue in Britain, especially among young people.         
	She said that the passage of the torch through London was a complete farce and accused the prime minister of being very, very mild with China over Tibet. He is not even coming out publicly and saying I think what China has done inside Tibet is abhorrent. He has got to do that. I am absolutely appalled by this.         
	If the Dalai Lama receives a warm welcome when he arrives in London next month  as he is almost certain to from ordinary members of the public  it may force Brown to take a fresh look at Britains China policy.         
	China is too big and powerful an economic power to be dealt with in the way Brown has responded to Robert Mugabes Zimbabwe. But having made a mistake in supporting Tony Blair over the Iraq war, Brown will be careful not to make the same error over Tibet.         
	Almost without noticing it, Tibet has become the biggest foreign policy issue in Britain. And the torch travels through other countries, there is no guarantee that the protests will not become violent. As it is, the Chinese government has expressed fears about possible suicide bombings.         
	Brown, lagging in the polls behind the Tory leader David Cameron, may be persuaded to take a harder line against China if this improves his chances of closing the gap.

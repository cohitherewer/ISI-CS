The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gandi statue debate in UK
                                                                                                               Gandi statue debate in UK
          AMIT ROY                               
	London, Feb. 12: Lord Richard Attenborough has expressed doubts whether erecting a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Leicester is necessarily the best way of remembering the father of the Indian nation.         
	The idea that Leicester, where 30 per cent of the citys 280,000 population, is Asian  most of them are Gujaratis  has been championed by Keith Vaz. He has been MP for Leicester East for 20 years and last year introduced Shilpa Shetty, winner of Celebrity Big Brother, to his constituents.         
	Now, he feels the East Midlands city is ready for a statue of Gandhi and has backed his proposal by tabling a Commons early day motion signed by 23 other like-minded MPs.         
	That this House supports the campaign for a statue of Mahatma Gandhi to be erected in the City of Leicester; believes that Leicester, as a leading multicultural city, would be the ideal place to celebrate the life and work of Gandhi, states the motion. It adds: (That this House) notes that he was a leading figure who promoted non-violent resistance and inter-cultural co-operation.         
	As director of the film, Gandhi, Attenborough, is now considered a sage on all matters concerning the Mahatma.         
	He did not oppose the erection of a statue but pointed out: He was one of the major people who ever lived and should be revered, not necessarily with a statue but as a man who once, when asked about his message, said, My life is my message.         
	Vaz was quoted as telling a newspaper: Gandhis philosophy of brotherhood amongst those of different religions and ethnicity should be honoured and celebrated in the diverse community of Leicester.   
	A statue will be an excellent symbol of his and Leicesters commitment to diversity. It would be a good tourist attraction.

          JOHN MARKOFF                          Colombian students learn how to use computers in Tumaco. (Reuters)                                  
	San Francisco, Dec. 6: Internet security is broken, and nobody seems to know quite how to fix it.        
	Despite the efforts of the computer security industry and a half-decade struggle by Microsoft to protect its Windows operating system, malicious software is spreading faster than ever.         
	The so-called malware surreptitiously takes over a PC and then uses that computer to spread more malware to other machines exponentially. Computer scientists and security researchers acknowledge they cannot get ahead of the onslaught.         
	As more business and social life has moved onto the Web, criminals thriving on an underground economy of credit card thefts, bank fraud and other scams rob computer users of an estimated $100 billion a year, according to a conservative estimate by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.         
	A Russian company that sells fake anti-virus software that actually takes over a computer pays its illicit distributors as much as $5 million a year. With vast resources from stolen credit card and other financial information, the cyberattackers are handily winning a technology arms race.         
	Right now the bad guys are improving more quickly than the good guys, said Patrick Lincoln, director of the computer science laboratory at SRI International, a science and technology research group.         
	A well-financed computer underground has built an advantage by working in countries that have global Internet connections but authorities with little appetite for prosecuting offenders who are bringing in significant amounts of foreign currency.         
	That was driven home in late October when RSA FraudAction Research Lab, a security consulting group based in Bedford, Massachusetts, discovered a cache of half a million credit card numbers and bank account log-ins that had been stolen by a network of so-called zombie computers remotely controlled by an online gang.         
	In October, researchers at the Georgia Tech Information Security Centre reported that the percentage of online computers worldwide infected by botnets  networks of programmes connected via the Internet that send spam or disrupt Internet-based services  is likely to increase to 15 per cent by the end of this year, from 10 per cent in 2007.         
	That suggests a staggering number of infected computers, as many as 10 million, being used to distribute spam and malware over the Internet each day, according to research compiled by Panda Labs.        
	Security researchers concede that their efforts are largely an exercise in a game of whack-a-mole because botnets that distribute malware like worms, the programmes that can move from computer to computer, are still relatively invisible to commercial anti-virus software.         
	A research report last month by Stuart Staniford, chief scientist of FireEye, a Silicon Valley computer security firm, indicated that in tests of 36 commercial anti-virus products, fewer than half of the newest malicious software programmes were identified.         
	There have been some recent successes, but they are short-lived. On November 11, the volume of spam, which transports the malware, dropped by half around the globe after an Internet service provider disconnected the Mycolo Corporation, an American firm with Russian ties, from the Internet.         
	But the respite is not expected to last long as cybercriminals regain control of their spam-generating computers. Modern worms are stealthier and they are professionally written, said Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer for British Telecom. The criminals have gone upmarket, and theyre organised and international because there is real money to be made.        
	The gangs keep improving their malware, and now programmes can be written to hunt for a specific type of information stored on a personal computer. For example, some malware uses the operating system to look for recent documents created by a user, on the assumption they will be more valuable.

	The severity of the situation was driven home not long ago for Ed Amaroso, AT amp;Ts chief         
	security official. I was at home with my mothers computer recently and I showed her it was         
	attacking China, he said. Can you just make it run a little faster? she asked, and I         
	told her Ma, we have to reimage your hard disk.               
	Beyond the billions of dollars lost in theft of money and data is another, deeper impact.         
	Many Internet executives fear that basic trust in what has become the foundation of 21st         
	century commerce is rapidly eroding. Theres an increasing trend to depend on the Internet         
	for a wide range of applications, many of them having to deal with financial institutions,         
	said Vinton G. Cerf, one of the original designers of the Internet, who is now Googles         
	chief Internet evangelist.               
	The more we depend on these types of systems, the more vulnerable we become, he said.               
	The United States government has begun to recognize the extent of the problem. In January,         
	President Bush signed National Security Presidential Directive 54, establishing a national         
	cybersecurity initiative. The plan, which may cost more than $30 billion over seven years,         
	is directed at securing the federal governments own computers as well as the systems that         
	run the nations critical infrastructure, like oil and gas networks and electric power and         
	water systems.               
	That will do little, however, to help protect businesses and consumers who use the hundreds         
	of millions of Internet-connected personal computers and cellphones, the criminals newest         
	target.               
	Despite new technologies that are holding some attackers at bay, several computer security         
	experts said they were worried that the economic downturn will make computer security the         
	first casualty of corporate spending cuts. Security gets hit because it is hard to measure         
	its effectiveness, said Eugene Spafford, a computer scientist at Purdue University.               
	He is pessimistic. In many respects, we are probably worse off than we were 20 years ago,         
	he said, because all of the money has been devoted to patching the current problem rather         
	than investing in the redesign of our infrastructure.              
	The cyber-criminals appear to be at least as technically advanced as the most sophisticated         
	software companies. And they are faster and more flexible. As software companies have         
	tightened the security of the basic operating systems like Windows and Macintosh, attackers         
	have moved on to Web browsers and Internet-connected programs like Adobe Flash and Apple         
	QuickTime.              
	This has led to an era of so-called drive-by infections, where users are induced to click         
	on Web links that are contained in e-mail messages. Cyber-criminals have raised the ability         
	to fool unsuspecting computer users into clicking on intriguing messages to a high art.               
	Researchers note that the global cycle of distributing security patches inevitably plays to         
	the advantage of the attacker, who can continually hunt for and exploit new backdoors and         
	weaknesses in systems. This year, computer security firms have begun shifting from         
	traditional anti-virus program designs, which are regularly updated on subscribers personal         
	computers, to Web-based services, which can be updated even faster.               
	Security researchers at SRI International are now collecting over 10,000 unique samples of         
	malware daily from around the global. To me it feels like job security, said Phillip         
	Porras, an SRI program director and the computer security expert who led the design of the         
	companys Bothunter program, available free at www.bothunter.net.              
	This is always an arm race, as long as it gets into your machine faster than the update to         
	detect it, the bad guys win, said Mr. Schneier.

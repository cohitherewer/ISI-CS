	Beatles tape bid    
	 Toronto, Aug. 8 (Reuters): A Canadian businessman had the winning bid for a newly discovered mid-1960s recording of the Beatles singing at least one previously unreleased tune and joking around during the session.      
	Gino Olivieri of Montreal snapped up the long reel-to-reel tape for 9,800.

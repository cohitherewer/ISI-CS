                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Russia defiant over Georgia
                            
	Gori (Georgia), Aug. 14 (Reuters): Russian troops and armour moved in or around at least three Georgian towns today, ignoring demands by US that Moscow respect Georgias territorial integrity.        
	Reuters witnesses saw Russian troops in the key central Georgian town of Gori and outside the western town of Zugdidi. Residents in the Black Sea port of Poti saw a Russian incursion. In Moscow, the Russian general staff said it was legitimate for Russian peacekeepers to be in Poti and for what it termed reconnaissance parties.

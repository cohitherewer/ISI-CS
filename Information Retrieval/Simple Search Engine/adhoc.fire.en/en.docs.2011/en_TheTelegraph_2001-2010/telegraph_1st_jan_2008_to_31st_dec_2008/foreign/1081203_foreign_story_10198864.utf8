	Bangkok, Dec. 2 (Reuters): Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat was banned from politics for five years and his party disbanded today, spurring anti-government protesters to end their blockades of Bangkoks airports.        
	Peoples Alliance for Democracy leader Sondhi Limthongkul said they would start pulling out of Suvarnabhumi and Don Muang airports at 0300 GMT tomorrow. Weve finished our duty, said Sondhi. The airports operator said it would decide tomorrow when passenger flights in and out of the capital could resume.

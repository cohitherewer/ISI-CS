	Dhaka, Dec. 24 (Reuters): Bangladesh deployed some 6,000 elite soldiers who fanned out across the country today as intelligence reports warned that the main contenders in a December 29 election may be targeted by Islamic militants.        
	Former Prime Ministers Begum Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina, whose parties are frontrunners in the December poll, have said their lives are at risk.        
	Security fears increased after officials seized live grenades and a bomb with a timing device near a spot where Khaleda had addressed one of her several campaign rallies yesterday.        
	Outlawed Islamist groups, including the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, blamed for bomb attacks in 2005, have threatened the politicians with strikes ahead of the election.

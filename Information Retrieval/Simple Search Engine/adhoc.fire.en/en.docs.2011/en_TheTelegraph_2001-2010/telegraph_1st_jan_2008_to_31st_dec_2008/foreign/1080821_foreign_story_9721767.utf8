	Los Angeles, Aug. 20 (Reuters): Oscar-winning film star Elizabeth Taylor is back home and doing well following a recent stay of several weeks in a Los Angeles-area hospital for unspecified reasons, her spokesman said yesterday.        
	Publicist Dick Guttman said he had no further details other than to confirm a report on the website for People magazine quoting a friend of the 76-year-old actress as saying she had resumed normal activities.        
	Taylor is at home and happy  and busier than ever, the unidentified friend told People.com. Shes living her life. Shes been having dinner with friends. Shes working. Sources did not say when exactly the 76-year-old was discharged.

          JOHN MARY                          A priest offers puja in Obamas honour at a Dhanwantari temple in Coimbatore. Telegraph picture                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 30: Barack Obama has found unexpected allies in a Coimbatore temple at a time US white supremacists seem to be plotting his death.        
	Priests at a Dhanwantari shrine in the Tamil Nadu town are holding special pujas and yagnas every day so that Obama has a stress-free, successful campaign and a long life and defeats his enemies.        
	The temple has been offering mainly elaneer dhara (tender coconut juice) and performing the Mrutyunjaya Homam  meant to ward off threats to life  and Shatrusamhara (defeating enemies) Puja.         
	As for the Democrat candidates victory in the election, almost all the astrologers associated with the temple  part of the Arya Vaidya Pharmacy medical complex  have predicted that its inevitable.        
	The prayers are meant to ensure Obama does not suffer on account of tension, written into his genes, explained P.K. Krishna Kumar, managing director of Arya Vaidya, which owns an ayurvedic hospital and medicine stores. Because of the moon influence, he is susceptible to waxing and waning. The special prayers began on September 30 and will go on till polling closes in the US on November 4.        
	The Mrutyunjaya Homam is dedicated to Shiva, the main offerings being the durba grass, believed to purify blood, and the herb amrita for intractable diseases. Hymns are sung to Mrutyu, the god of death, praying for a long life.        
	The Shatrusamhara Puja looks to thwart conspiracies and ensure success, and is performed when a powerful enemy is destroying ones mental peace.        
	American police this week charged a neo-Nazi group with plotting to kill Obama and 87 other African Americans. Kumar said the unearthing of the conspiracy vindicated his selection of the two yagnas.        
	He added that the Shatrusamhara was being done to eliminate the evil and not the evildoer.        
	Kumar said the temples astrologers had been given Obamas essential birth details but not told who he was. They said the candidate was self-made, and that he was famous but came from a humble background. A gifted speaker, he reaches a high position after passing through intense misery.        
	Astrological websites are already charting Obamas progress. One says: Vyaazha (Jupiter) spell 2003-08 marked by tension. Change in job profile occurs during 2008-09. Good time for karma and suits Obamas persona for a politician. He will reach top administrative position.        
	Asked why there were no pujas for Obamas rival John McCain or the running mates, Biden and Sarah Palin, Kumar said: Its my personal decision, a gesture towards a kindred soul. Obama has charisma. He needs all our support and how else could I extend it from thousands of miles away than through this spiritual offering?        
	If Obamas running mate Joe Bidens warning comes true, the Coimbatore priests will have more work on their hands.         
	Americas enemies will test Obama with an international crisis within six months if hes elected President, Biden recently said.

	Hendrix guitar    
	 London, July 16 (Reuters): One of Jimmy Hendrixs favourite guitars, set alight on a London stage more than 40 years ago and thought to have been lost forever, is to be auctioned later this year.      
	The guitar, a 1965 Fender Stratocaster, was famously doused with lighter fuel and set alight by the rock legend during a one-off performance at Londons Finsbury Astoria.

	Islamabad, Feb. 23 (AP): Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leaders today vowed to curtail some of President Pervez Musharrafs broad powers, including his right to dismiss parliament.        
	The PPP  once headed by assassinated former Premier Benazir Bhutto  won parliamentary elections this week following a year-long political crisis that saw the imposition of emergency rule, the purging of the judiciary and the rounding up of hundreds of Musharrafs opponents.        
	Those challenges have been coupled with rising militant violence in Pakistan, especially in the northwest, where al Qaida and Taliban-linked militants operate.         
	PPP leaders were considering various proposals in closed-door talks through the weekend. Though it was not immediately clear when a decision would be reached, PPP leaders indicated they would push to strip the President of the right to dismiss parliament.        
	The participants ... vowed to work for the restoration of theparliamentary supremacy by undoing undemocratic provisions under which elected parliaments have been dismissed, the party said in a statement.        
	The head of state has the power to dissolve parliament under an article of the Constitution first included under the late President Zia ul-Haq. The article was removed after Zias death in 1988 but reinstated under Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup.              
	Bhuttos party won the right to pick the new Prime Minister by finishing first in this weeks balloting, claiming at least 87 of the 268 contested seats. The PML-N of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif trailed in second place with 67 seats, while the pro-Musharraf party took only 40 seats.        
	Bhuttos husband, Asif Ali Zardari, and Sharif agreed on Thursday to form a new government. Together, the two parties have 154 seats  sufficient to govern but not enough to impeach Musharraf.        
	More than 20 senior cabinet ministers lost their seats, further exposing Musharrafs eroding popularity. But the ruling party reiterated today it would work hand-in-hand with the new government.        
	We would like to support a future government on a national agenda, above party lines, said Mushahid Hussain, its general secretary, adding the focus should be on issues like fighting terrorism, education, health, welfare, justice and rights of women and minorities.

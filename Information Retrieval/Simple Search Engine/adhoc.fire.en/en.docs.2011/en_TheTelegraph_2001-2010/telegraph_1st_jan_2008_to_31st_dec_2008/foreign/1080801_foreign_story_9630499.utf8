	London for oil    
	London, July 31: A wealthy Arab sent his Batman Lamborghini on a 6,500 mile round-trip to London for an oil change  at a cost of more than 23,000, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The 190,000 vehicle travelled on a scheduled flight from Qatar to Heathrow, and was flown back to West Asia after the service.       
	The Murcielago LP640, a two-seater coupe, features in the latest Batman film The Dark Knight. Fittingly, the name of the vehicle means bat in Spanish.      
	The cars 6.500 miles journey sparked outrage from environmental groups, who said the owner  thought to be a Sheikh  had a carbon crater rather than a carbon footprint.      
	The car cost 3,552 to service at an approved dealer, plus around 20,000 to freight to Britain and back.

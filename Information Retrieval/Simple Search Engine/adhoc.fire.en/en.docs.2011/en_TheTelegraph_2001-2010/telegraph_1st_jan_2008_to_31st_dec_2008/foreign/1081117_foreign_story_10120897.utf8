	Colombo, Nov. 16 (AP): Sri Lankas air force pounded the Tamil Tiger rebels main northern defence line today, a day after government forces dismantled the last rebel stronghold on the islands west coast, the military said.        
	Fighter jets bombed the Tamil separatists defence line in the Muhamalai area of Jaffna peninsula, north of the rebels de facto state, military spokesperson Briadier Udaya Nanayakkara said.        
	He said the jets also hit rebel artillery and mortar positions in retaliation for rebel shelling of soldiers yesterday. Nanayakkara said details of damage and casualties were not immediately available.        
	Yesterday, the military announced it had dismantled the last rebel defence on the islands west coast and secured a land route to government-held Jaffna.        
	It was a key victory for the military, which has vowed to finally defeat the guerrillas by years end.        
	The military has had no land link to the northern peninsula for more than a decade, forcing the government to depend on boats and aircraft for access. The main highway to the peninsula remains under rebel control.        
	Nanayakkara said the peninsulas main military base no longer falls within the rebels artillery range because of yesterdays gains. Nearly 40,000 soldiers are believed to be housed on the base.        
	President Mahinda Rajapaksa hailed the militarys triumph in a televised speech yesterday and urged the rebels to lay down their arms and surrender.        
	Separately yesterday, army troops destroyed 16 rebel bunkers in the Mullaitivu district and fought a series of battles in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi, inflicting heavy casualties on the guerrillas, a military statement said today.        
	It said soldiers also suffered minor damage, but did not provide specific casualty details.        
	It was not possible to contact rebel officials for comment because most communication lines have been severed. Independent accounts are difficult to obtain from the battlefield because most journalists are barred from the war zone.        
	The Tamil Tigers have fought since 1983 to create an independent state for the countrys ethnic minority Tamils, who have suffered marginalisation by ethnic Sinhalese-controlled governments.        
	More than 70,000 people have been killed in the violence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kathmandu paralysed by strike
                                                                                                               Kathmandu paralysed by strike
                            
	Kathmandu, Feb. 13 (Reuters): Hundreds of schools and shops were closed and roads remained empty in Nepals southern plains today at the start of a strike by ethnic Madheshi groups to press for regional autonomy.        
	Violent ethnic protests in the region last year claimed at least 45 lives, throwing a shadow over Nepals peace process after a decade-long civil war with Maoist rebels ended in 2006.        
	Three Madheshi groups, saying they represent the dominant ethnic community of the fertile Terai plains also called the Madhesh, have called the indefinite strike aimed at blocking roads to Kathmandu and other hilly areas of landlocked Nepal.

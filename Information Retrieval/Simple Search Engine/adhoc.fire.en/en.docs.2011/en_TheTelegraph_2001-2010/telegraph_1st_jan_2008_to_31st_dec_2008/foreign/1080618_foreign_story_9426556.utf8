	London, June 17: A Muslim teenager has been awarded 4,000 for hurt feelings after the owner of a hair salon refused her a job because she wears a headscarf.         
	Bushra Noah, 19, told a tribunal she was devastated at being turned down for a job as a stylist at a trendy hair salon, and claimed she was a victim of religious discrimination.        
	But salon owner Sarah Desrosiers, 32, told the hearing in central London that it was an absolutely basic job requirement for stylist to have their own hair on show.        
	I never in a million years dreamt that somebody would be completely against the display of hair and be in this industry, she said. I dont feel I deserve it. I feel it is a bit steep for what actually happened. Its really scary for a small business.        
	The hearing was told that Noah, 19, of Acton, west London, got an interview for a job as a junior assistant at the Wedge salon in Kings Cross, central London. But when she arrived for interview in May last year she claimed Desrosiers was clearly shocked that she wore a headscarf. Noah had told the tribunal: Desrosiers stated that as it was a hair salon it was essential that I did not wear a headscarf. She then said how uncomfortable she felt with me being around.

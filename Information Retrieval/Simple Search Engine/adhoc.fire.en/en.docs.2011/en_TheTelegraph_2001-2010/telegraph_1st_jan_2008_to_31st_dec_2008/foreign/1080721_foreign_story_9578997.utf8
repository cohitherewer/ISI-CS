	Kathmandu, July 20 (PTI): A local political party here has claimed that the two Nepalese arrested in India in the Aarushi murder case were falsely implicated, and threatened to raise the issue in the Himalayan nations parliament.        
	Rashtriya Jana Morcha (RJM) chairman Chitra Bahadur K.C. alleged that Krishna Thapa and Raj Kumar were falsely accused by the CBI in the twin murder case and his party  which has four members in the house  will raise the issue in the parliament.        
	RJMs general secretary and former parliament member Dilaram Acharya alleged that a conspiracy was hatched by the CBI to give Rajesh Talwar, Aarushis father and an accused in the case, a clean chit. There was a plot to involve innocent Nepalese house workers in the case, he said.        
	Acharya said his party will approach the Nepal government and the national human rights commission to save the duo.         
	Mulprabah Akhil Bharatiya Nepali Ekta Samaj, a New Delhi-based organisation of Nepalese-origin people, is taking up the issue with the Nepal government and the Nepalese embassy in the Indian capital, he said.        
	The organisations chairman Giridhari Lal Neupane will address a press meet in Butawal, a western Nepal town, tomorrow to raise the issue, Acharya added.

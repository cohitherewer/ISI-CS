	Galveston (Texas), Sept. 12 (Reuters): Hurricane Ike moved today within 24 hours of striking the densely populated Texas coast near Houston with a possible 6-metre wall of water in what may be the worst storm to hit Texas in nearly 50 years.        
	Ike was a Category 2 storm with 168kmph winds and likely will come ashore early tomorrow as a dangerous Category 3 storm on the five-step intensity scale with winds of more than 178kmph, the National Hurricane Centre said. The National Weather Service warned that persons not heeding evacuation orders may face certain death.

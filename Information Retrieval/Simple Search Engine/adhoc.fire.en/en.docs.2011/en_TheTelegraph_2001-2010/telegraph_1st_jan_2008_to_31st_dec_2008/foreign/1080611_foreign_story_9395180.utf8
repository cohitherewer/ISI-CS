	London, June 10: John McCain says he is turning to Google to help him in his bid to find the ideal running mate for President.         
	The Republican candidate joked to a small crowd of fundraisers in Virginia that he was using the Internet search engine to research his list of potential Vice-Presidents.        
	You know, basically its a Google, McCain said, to laughter, when asked how the selection process was going during a $10,000-a-head luncheon in Richmond.         
	Vice-Presidential candidates are subjected to rigorous screening to determine their ability to help  or hinder  a candidates chances of winning the White House.         
	While speculation builds over who the Arizona senator will select as his number two, McCain says he still had some time to complete the search.        
	Given his age  McCain will be 72 on inauguration day  many have suggested he will look to a younger running mate. Last month, the senator, who wrapped up his place on the top of the Republican ticket earlier this year, stoked interest with a barbecue at his Arizona home attended by three potential candidates, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, Florida governor Charlie Crist and Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal, who is just 36.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Protests over fuel prices in Europe
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Protests over fuel prices in Europe

	Marseille (France), June 2 (Reuters): Truckers, taxi drivers and fishermen in several European countries blockaded refineries and docks and kept trawlers in port today in protests against high fuel prices.        
	In France, fishermen joined truckers and taxi drivers blocking access to the Total refinery at La Mede, around 30 km west of the southern port of Marseille.        
	Police intervened to break up another protest by truckers and farmers outside an oil depot at Frontignan in the southwest.        
	Its an act of desperation. We cant keep up with the prices, said Jean-Paul Lombard, head of a transport firm. Until the government has listened, we wont move.        
	There were other actions in several other French cities, with slow-moving convoys of truck drivers bringing traffic to a standstill in so-called snail operations. The protests have continued for more than two weeks in France and spread to other European countries including Spain, Italy, Belgium and Portugal.        
	Protesters have urged the government to help cut the cost of fuel and have called for measures ranging from capping sales tax on fuel to introducing a special rate for professions that depend on fuel or cutting some employers social security costs.        
	The French government has floated the idea of a Europe-wide cap on sales tax levied on fuel but other European leaders meeting in Frankfurt to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the European Central Bank warned against big tax cuts.        
	The issue has nonetheless grabbed the attention of governments and policy makers with the head of the International Energy Agency declaring today that an energy revolution was needed to increase efficiency and cut demand.        
	That will be of little comfort to European fishermen facing fuel costs that have spiralled by 240 per cent since 2004 as crude oil prices have risen over $135 a barrel in recent weeks. Portuguese fishermen kept their boats at the docks for a fourth day today.         
	In Asia, Pakistani government employees protested against rising fuel costs in Lahore while Malaysia prepares to embark on a revamp of its fuel subsidy scheme this week that may lead to higher petrol and diesel prices later in the year. In Beijing, fuel shortages reached the heart of Chinas capital as energy majors cut output to limit losses from low state-set pump prices.

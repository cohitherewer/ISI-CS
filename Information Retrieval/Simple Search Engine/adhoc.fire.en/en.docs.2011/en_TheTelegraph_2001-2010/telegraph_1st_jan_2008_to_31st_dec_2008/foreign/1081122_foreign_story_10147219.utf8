	London, Nov. 21: President-elect Barack Obama is on track to nominate Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state as early as next week, according to reports.         
	 One week after the former rivals for the White House met secretly to discuss the idea of Hillary Clinton becoming the nations top diplomat, the two sides were moving quickly towards making it a reality, barring any unforeseen problems. Obama is on track to nominate her after next Thursdays Thanksgiving holiday, a transition aide has said. He added that the two camps have worked out financial disclosure issues involving Hillary Clintons husband, former President Bill Clinton, and the complicated international funding of his foundation that operates in 27 countries.        
	The aide said Obama and Hillary Clinton have had substantive conversations about the secretary of state job.         
	Hillary Clinton has been mulling the post for several days, but the transition aides comments suggested that Obamas team does not feel she is inclined to turn it down.         
	Some Democrats and government insiders have questioned whether she is too independent and politically ambitious to be an effective secretary of state. But Obama is said to admire her talents and experience, as do many other Democrats. A senior adviser to Obama said the President-elect believes Hillary Clinton would bring instant stature and credibility to US diplomatic relations and that the advantages to her serving far outweighed potential downsides. Hillary Clinton would have to surrender her Senate seat to take the job.         
	Phone data viewed        
	Telecommunication giant Verizon Wireless said last night that a number of its employees had accessed and viewed Obamas mobile phone account without authorisation.        
	The company said all employees who accessed the account were immediately put on leave with pay. The firm said it was evaluating the circumstances of each employees access to the account to determine appropriate action. We apologise to President-elect Obama and will work to keep the trust our customers place in us every day, chief executive Lowell McAdam said.

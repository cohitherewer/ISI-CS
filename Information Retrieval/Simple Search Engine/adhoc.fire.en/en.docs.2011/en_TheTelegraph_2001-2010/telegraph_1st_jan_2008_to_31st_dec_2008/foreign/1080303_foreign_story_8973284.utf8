	Peshawar, March 2 (AP): A suicide bomber blew himself up at a peace meeting of tribal elders in northwestern Pakistan today, killing at least 40 people and injuring more than 100, witnesses and officials said.        
	Thousands of people were attending the meeting when the blast took place, interior ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema told state-run Pakistan Television.        
	He said five tribes called the meeting to finalise a resolution that would punish anyone who sheltered or helped militants, including al Qaida, Taliban and other foreign extremists.        
	Alam Khan, a tribesman who attended the meeting, said a young man walked up to a group of elders and blew himself up.        
	It was a huge explosion and left body parts and blood scattered on the ground, said Ramin Khan, another participant who received injuries to his left leg and face. He and others hurt in the attack were brought to a hospital in Peshawar.        
	The attack took place near the predominantly tribal town of Darra Adam Khel in North West Frontier Province, about 40 km south of the provincial capital, Peshawar.        
	Dr Hamid Afridy, the areas chief medical officer, said he counted 40 bodies, some with severed limbs and mutilated faces, at the site.        
	We have dispatched more than 100 injured to ... hospitals in Peshawar and Kohat town, he said, adding he feared the death toll could rise as many of the injured were in critical condition.        
	Pakistan Television said the suspected bombers severed head was found.        
	Television footage showed blood, shoes and caps littering the bombing site  a tree-lined ground amid wheat fields that is only a few meters away from brick houses.        
	It was the third suicide bombing in as many days in northwestern Pakistan, where security forces are battling pro-Taliban militants.        
	On Friday, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the funeral of a slain police officer in Mingora town in Swat Valley, killing more than 40 people and injuring at least 60. The next day another suicide bombing in nearby Bajur killed one person and wounded 19, mostly security personnel.        
	Fridays bombing was the bloodiest attack in the Swat Valley since militant followers of a pro-Taliban cleric, Maulana Fazlullah, grabbed control of large parts of Pakistans restive northwest, an apparent reflection of how President Pervez Musharrafs government has lost control of parts of the region.

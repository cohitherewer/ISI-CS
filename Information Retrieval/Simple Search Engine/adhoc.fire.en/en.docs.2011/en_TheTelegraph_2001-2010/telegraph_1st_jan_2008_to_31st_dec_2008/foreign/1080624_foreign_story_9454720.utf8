The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Republicans will stoke racial fears: Obama
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Republicans will stoke racial fears: Obama
  - THEYRE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE YOU AFRAID OF ME          TOBY HARNDEN                          Bitter battle                                        
	Washington, June 23: Senator Barack Obama has told supporters that Republicans will stoke racial fears in an attempt to stop him becoming the first black President of the US.         
	We know what kind of campaign theyre going to run, the Illinois senator said at a fundraising event in Jacksonville, Florida.         
	Theyre going to try to make you afraid of me: Hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name. And did I mention hes black?         
	Polls show that Obama is now the clear front runner for the White House, leading in national opinion polls by an average of nearly six percentage points. A Newsweek poll released yesterday put him 15 points ahead.         
	More crucially, he also has narrow leads in battleground states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri, New Hampshire, Colorado and Virginia.         
	Figures released at the weekend, however, showed that Obamas prodigious fundraising tapered off somewhat last month, when he raised $21.8 million, just $100,000 more than Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee.         
	Obama has raised a record $296 million thus far, compared to McCains $122 million. He has opted out of public funding, which comes with a spending limit, in anticipation of raising much more than the $89 million ceiling his opponent, who will accept public funds, will have to abide by.         
	The Democratic and Republican candidates currently have almost the same amount of cash in their coffers available  just over $30 million. Obama, however, is expecting a surge in funding from mega-rich supporters of his vanquished Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.         
	During his long primary campaign against Clinton, Obama made few references to his race until the furore over anti-American comments by his then pastor Jeremiah Wright forced him to address the issue with a major speech.         
	But his advisers believe that potential racism should be tackled head on in Novembers general election against McCain and is anticipating racially-tinged attack advertisements from groups allied with him.         
	He remains vulnerable on the experience issue while many Americans have suspicions he is lacking in patriotism  both major potential handicaps against McCain, 72, a Vietnam hero.         
	By linking these issues with race, Obama could help give legitimate criticism the taint of racism. Some Republicans reacted angrily to his Jacksonville remarks, accusing him of himself playing the race card.

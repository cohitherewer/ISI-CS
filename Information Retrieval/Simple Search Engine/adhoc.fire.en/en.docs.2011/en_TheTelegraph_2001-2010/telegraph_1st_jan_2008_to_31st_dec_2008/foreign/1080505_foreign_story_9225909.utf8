	London, May 4 (AP): British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said today concerns about rising food, utility and gasoline prices contributed to his partys worst local election results in 40 years.        
	Brown responded today to reports that the outcome has shaken confidence in his leadership of the Labour Party.        
	The party took only 24 per cent of the vote in local elections in England and Wales on Thursday, which were capped by Labour losing control of Londons City Hall to Conservative candidate Boris Johnson.         
	I feel responsible. There are no excuses on my part at all, Brown told the British Broadcasting Corporation.        
	Responding to criticism about his personality, Brown who is often described as dour, admitted he was not as outgoing as some voters might like.        
	I think its true that I am a more private person in a public arena, he said.        
	However, he said he refused to believe that voters had abandoned him and insisted he remains the best leader for his party.        
	I come from a pretty ordinary background.... I understand what people are thinking and I understand what people are feeling and I believe that Im the right person to take the country through these difficult times, he told BBC television.        
	He said his government must now show a clear and unequivocal plan to deal with the economic downturn.        
	What people are most worried about  and I do understand this and I feel the hurt they feel  (is that) petrol prices are going up, food prices are going up, they are worried about utilities bills, they are worried about their standard of living, there is an uncertainty about the economy, he said.

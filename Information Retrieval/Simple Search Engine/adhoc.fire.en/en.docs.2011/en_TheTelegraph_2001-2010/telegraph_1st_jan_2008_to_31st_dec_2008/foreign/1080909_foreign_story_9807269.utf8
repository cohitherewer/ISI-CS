	Greedy gulp    
	 London, Sept. 8: A dog swallowed its owners mobile phone whole, only to find it really didnt agree with him, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Nero, a Doberman-Great Dane crossbreed, found his eyes were bigger than his stomach when he snatched a Nokia mobile phone from his owners hand and swallowed it.       
	The giant canine paid the price for his greedy nature, when he was the subject of a major operation leaving him with a large scar and ten stitches on his belly.       
	Neros owner, Marie Matthews, 67, from Valhalla in Pretoria, South Africa, said her daughter, Driekie Boojens, was busy feeding Nero when he snatched the phone from between her fingers and swallowed it whole.     
	Text trap    
	 London: Language experts and ecologists have joined together to help police catch criminals by reading their text messages, reports The Daily Telegraph. They are adapting methods of studying ocean life to identify anonymous text authors by their spelling, grammar and syntax of words used. Police have used the method in murder cases but it has to be tested further before courts can accept it as routine evidence.

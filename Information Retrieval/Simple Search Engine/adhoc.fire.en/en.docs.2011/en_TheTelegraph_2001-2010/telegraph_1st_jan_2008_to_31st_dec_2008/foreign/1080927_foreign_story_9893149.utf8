          JESSICA SALTER                              
	London, Sept. 26: The daughter of the radical Islamic cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed has admitted that she works as a topless pole dancer in nightclubs.         
	Yasmin Fostok, 27, who is a single mother, admitted that she performs in London bars and nightclubs. Fostok, who lives in Catford, South London, said: I dont get on with my dad. I dont agree with his views  I just get on with my life and that is it.         
	She has changed her Muslim name Youssra to Yasmin, dyed her hair blonde and has a three-year-old son who was conceived during an arranged marriage to a Turkish man which has since collapsed.         
	She told the Sun: I dont normally do topless work but Im willing to go topless if the venue is right.         
	Her father, who has been living in Lebanon since he was exiled from the UK three years ago, said he had no idea about her job. He said: If this is true I am deeply shocked.         
	She was brought up properly in the Muslim faith but she is free to make her own choices in life. But I am still shocked.         
	I havent spoken to her for a long time, because I believed she was living with her family in Turkey. But I knew nothing of this.         
	She should not seek forgiveness from me, she should seek forgiveness from God.         
	If she has done these things she will be judged on Judgment Day. But God will forgive her anything except becoming a non-Muslim.         
	 Fostok grew up in North London and was a devout Muslim as a teenager, wearing a veil and covering herself from head to toe. Her father sparked outrage for his preaching of hate when he praised the 9/11 bombers and said he would never condemn Osama bin Laden or any Muslims.

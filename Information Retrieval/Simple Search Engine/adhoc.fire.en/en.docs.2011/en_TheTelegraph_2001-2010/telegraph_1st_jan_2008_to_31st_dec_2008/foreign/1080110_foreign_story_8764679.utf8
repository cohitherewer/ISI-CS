	Tokyo, Jan. 9 (Reuters): In his latest movie role as the bloodthirsty Sweeney Todd, Johnny Depp compares the flavours of different types of human flesh.
    
	But the actor says his own would taste of frogs legs.
    
	In Tokyo for the Japan premiere of the film, which has been nominated for four Golden Globes, Depp was asked to imagine what he would taste like to a cannibal. Frogs legs, he told giggling reporters, adding that the taste might be a little bitter. I would suggest deep-frying, he said.
    
	Movie director Tim Burton thought for a while before saying he would taste of chicken, but Sweeney Todd producer Richard Zanuck had no hesitation in characterising his own flavour. Shark! he replied to laughter. In the movie, Depp plays a London barber who lures victims to his shop, where they are murdered and made into meat pies.

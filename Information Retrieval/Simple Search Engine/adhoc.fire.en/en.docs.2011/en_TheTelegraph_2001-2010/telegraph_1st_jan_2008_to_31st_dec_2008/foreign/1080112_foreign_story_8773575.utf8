	Kathmandu, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Nepal will hold its first national elections in nearly nine years on April 10, the government said today, capping a peace process with the Maoists after a long civil war.
    
	The twice-delayed elections will establish a special assembly which is meant to write a new constitution for Nepal, formally declare the country a republic after more than two centuries of royal rule and replace the current interim parliament.
    
	This time the elections will not be postponed under any circumstances, minister for labour and transport Ramesh Lekhak told reporters after a cabinet meeting.
    
	But analysts said challenges remained, not least because the government has little control of parts of the fertile southern plains bordering India, which have seen serious unrest over the past year.

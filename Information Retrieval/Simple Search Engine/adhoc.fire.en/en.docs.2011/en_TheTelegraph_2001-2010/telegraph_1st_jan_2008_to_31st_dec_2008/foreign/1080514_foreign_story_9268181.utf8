The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sharif ministers quit cabinet
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sharif ministers quit cabinet

	Islamabad, May 13 (AP): Ministers from the party of fromer Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif resigned from Pakistans cabinet today, shaking the fragile coalition government that took power just six weeks ago.        
	Sharif announced yesterday that he was pulling his ministers from the government over its failure to meet a promise to reinstate judges ousted by arch-rival President Pervez Musharraf.        
	But Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilanis office said he did not immediately accept the nine resignations and that a decision on them would come after his partys leader, Asif Ali Zardari, returned to Pakistan.        
	Sharifs withdrawal raises the prospect of the fledgling government collapsing, casting Pakistan into political turmoil just as it faces mounting economic woes and tries to maintain a fragile truce with Islamic militants along the Afghan border.        
	Sharif said his party would remain part of the ruling coalition, which is led by the party of Zardari, the widower of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Zardaris party expressed respect for the decision and said the parties remained close.        
	But a spokesman for Sharif sharpened the tone today, accusing members of Zardaris Pakistan Peoples Party of serving the interests of Musharraf by blocking the judges restoration.        
	Such loyalists of Musharraf are to be blamed for our decision to quit the Cabinet, Sadiqul Farooq said.        
	He claimed that Zardari aides had secret contacts with Musharraf.        
	Zardari party spokesman Farhatullah Babar denied there had been any back-channel contact with Musharraf and insisted his party remained committed to restoring the judges.        
	He said Zardari would return to Pakistan from overseas late today, meet party leaders and hold talks with Sharif at a later date.        
	Musharraf imposed emergency rule and purged the supreme court in November to forestall a ruling on his eligibility for office.        
	The coalition which came to power after routing Musharrafs supporters in February parliamentary elections vowed to reverse his crackdown. But the two leading parties have failed to agree just how to reinstate the judges despite weeks of wrangling. Sharif insists a parliamentary resolution and a simple order from the government would suffice to bring back the justices.        
	But Zardaris party argues that the law must be changed first to accommodate those judges installed by Musharraf after the purge  an attempt to make sure they do not resist the change. It is also seeking a package of judicial reforms to prevent the judges from getting involved in politics.        
	A permanent split in the coalition would boost Musharraf. Opposition parties aligned with the President have signalled their readiness to join a new coalition with the PPP if its alliance with Sharif breaks down completely.        
	The two main coalition parties are not natural partners. Bhutto and Sharif fought mercilessly for power during the 1990s, a decade associated with rampant corruption and government incompetence that paved the way for Musharrafs 1999 military coup. However, both suffered under the former army strongman.

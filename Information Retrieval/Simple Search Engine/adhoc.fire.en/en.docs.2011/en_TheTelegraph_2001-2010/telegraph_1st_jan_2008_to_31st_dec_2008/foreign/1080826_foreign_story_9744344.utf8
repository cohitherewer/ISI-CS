	Rushdie gossip    
	 Edinburgh, Aug. 25 (AP): Salman Rushdie says his mothers gossip had a strong influence on his literary career.      
	Rushdie says his mother was a world class gossip and that it was from her that he got a feel for talking about secrets.      
	He says things got to the point where she threatened to stop passing him rumours because they kept cropping up in his books.      
	The 61-year-old novelist says he got into writing because he wanted to bring storytelling back to literature. In a talk at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, the author said yesterday that his second novel, Midnights Children, would have never existed if not for his upbringing in India.    
	Jolie boost    
	 Paris: Multi-millionaire film stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have become eligible for 1,400 a month in French child benefits to help support their six children, reports The Daily Telegraph. The sum is part of a financial package waiting for them at Brignoles Town Hall, close to their manor house home in the south of France. While it is highly unlikely that they will claim the money, it shows off the generous subsidies available to families in France, where many benefits are not linked to income. Jolie, 33, gave birth to twins Knox and Vivienne on July 12, joining the couples adopted children, Maddox, 6, Pax, 4 and three-year-old Zahara, who are adopted, and their biological daughter Shiloh, who was born in Namibia two years ago.

	London, June 6: Keira Knightley is in talks to star as Eliza Doolittle in a film remake of My Fair Lady.         
	The 23-year-old actress would take on the role of the Cockney flower girl memorably portrayed by Audrey Hepburn in the 1964 classic.        
	Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who has brought the musical version to the West End and Broadway, is to co-produce the big screen update for Columbia Pictures.        
	It will use the original Lerner and Loewe songs and retain the Edwardian London setting.        
	The film will go into production in 2010 and casting has yet to be announced, but Knightley is said to be in negotiations over the role. Kenworthy would not confirm the rumour but said: The casting of Eliza is crucial, and we are currently in discussion with a major star to play the role.

	Bottom bother    
	 London, May 7 (Reuters): Detectives said today that they were hunting a man who has been grabbing the bottoms of women and girls during a year-long campaign in Manchester city centre.      
	The man, aged in his late 20s or 30s and described as Turkish or Greek-looking, mainly strikes between 7 and 8 am, sneaking up on his victims from behind and grabbing their backsides, police said.       
	So far he has indecently touched 19 victims, aged from 13 to 43.

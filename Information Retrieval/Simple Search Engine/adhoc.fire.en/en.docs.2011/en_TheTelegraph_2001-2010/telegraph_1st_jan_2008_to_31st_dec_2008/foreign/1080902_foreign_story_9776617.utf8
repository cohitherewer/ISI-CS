          MICHAEL D. SHEAR                        Sarah Palin and (below) her daughter Bristol. (AFP, AP)				                                       
	St Paul (Minnesota), Sept. 1: Alaska Governor Sarah Palin announced today that her 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, was pregnant and planned to have the baby and marry the father.        
	Our beautiful daughter Bristol came to us with news that as parents we knew would make her grow up faster than we had ever planned, Palin, the presumptive Republican vice-presidential nominee, said in a statement issued by Senator John McCains presidential campaign.        
	Were proud of Bristols decision to have her baby and even prouder to become grandparents.         
	As Bristol faces the responsibilities of adulthood, she knows she has our unconditional love and support.        
	The stunning revelation comes less than a week after McCain introduced Palin as an all-American mother with five children. Her biography  which includes her giving birth to a son, Trig, with Down Syndrome in mid-April  has been a touted as a key part of her appeal, especially to conservatives.        
	Almost since the day Sarah Palin was named as McCains running mate, rumours have circulated on liberal blogs raising questions about whether Bristol Palin was actually Trigs mother.        
	The statement today appeared designed to rebut that rumour. The McCain campaign confirmed that the daughter is five months pregnant, which would make it impossible for her to have delivered a baby in April.        
	It was completely fabricated rumours that were being spread around by liberal blogs to smear our candidates, a senior McCain aide said.        
	The campaign said today that senior McCain aides knew of Bristols pregnancy before the senator announced his selection of her as his vice -presidential nominee last Friday. They said that knowledge did not disqualify her in the senators eyes. In announcing his choice, McCain called the first-term governor a a devoted wife and a mother of five and a reformer who shares his maverick streak.        
	She is someone who grew up in a decent, hardworking, middle-class family, whose father was an elementary school teacher and mother was the school secretary, McCain said in his introduction.         
	They taught their children to care about others, to work hard and to stand up with courage for the things you believe in.        
	Palin said of her selection: Some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly, and this is certainly the case today.        
	In the statement issued yesterday, Palin pleaded for privacy and understanding, identifying the father only as Levi.        
	Bristol and the young man she will marry are going to realise very quickly the difficulties of raising a child, which is why they will have the love and support of our entire family, she said. We ask the media to respect our daughter and Levis privacy as has always been the tradition of children of candidates.        
	Senior McCain adviser Steve Schmidt warned Democrats not to try to use the revelations to their political advantage: If anyone tries to politicise this, there will be a backlash. One thing I think everyone agrees on is let the kids alone.

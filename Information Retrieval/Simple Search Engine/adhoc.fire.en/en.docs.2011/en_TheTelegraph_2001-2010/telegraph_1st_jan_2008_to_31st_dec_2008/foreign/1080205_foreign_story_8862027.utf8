	London, Feb. 4 (Reuters): Had a heavy weekends drinking? Been to some wild parties?
    
	Dont be tempted to boast about it on social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, or worse provide pictures of yourself behaving like a complete buffoon.
    
	For would-be employers could be digging for digital dirt. Readily available  and possibly embarrassing  information is just a mouse click away. The best advice is  dont put anything on your profile you wouldnt want you mother to see, said Andy Powell, director at the international recruitment agency Badenoch amp; Clark.
    
	He warned social networking devotees not to post pictures of debauched parties, to go easy on details of romantic trysts and never to complain about their current job or boss.
    
	More and more recruiters are taking note of Net reputations, Powell said.
    
	The social networking site Viadeo ran a survey which found that one in five employers were already using the Internet to search for information on candidates, he told Reuters.
    
	Our advice is to exercise caution, he said.Be careful about the more trivial stuff  photos of you in a drunken state, talking to friends about how you dislike your employer.
    
	Badenoch amp; Clarks own research, which marked the fourth anniversary of Facebooks launch, showed that almost two thirds of British executives  62 per cent  were signed up to social networking sites.

	Colombo, Jan. 12 (AP): Government soldiers and Tamil separatists fought a series of gunbattles in Sri Lankas embattled north, leaving 95 militnts and one soldier dead, the military said today.
    
	Troops clashed with Tamil Tiger guerrillas on several fronts yesterday in Vavuniya district, just south of the rebels de facto state, killing 39 insurgents, a defence ministry official said.
    
	Fighting in Vavuniya also left one soldier dead and 21 wounded, the official said on condition of anonymity. Separate fighting in nearby Mannar district killed 17 rebels, while three more rebels died in clashes on the Jaffna peninsula, he said.
    
	It was not possible to independently verify the militarys claims because the fighting took place deep in the jungles of the north, and access to the area is restricted. Both sides often release inflated casualty figures for their opponents while lowering their own.

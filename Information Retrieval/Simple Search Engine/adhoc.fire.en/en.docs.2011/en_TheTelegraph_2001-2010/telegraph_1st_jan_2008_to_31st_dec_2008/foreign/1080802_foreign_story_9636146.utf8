	Washington, Aug. 1 (Reuters): A US government scientist who apparently committed suicide this week was close to being charged in connection with a series of deadly anthrax attacks in 2001, federal law enforcement officials said today.        
	They confirmed news reports that identified the man as Bruce Ivins, 62, who worked for the last 18 years at government biodefence research laboratories at Fort Detrick, Maryland, northwest of Washington, DC.        
	The officials said Ivins took an overdose of painkillers over the weekend and died on Tuesday in an apparent suicide. The anthrax was sent through the mail to media organisations and politicians shortly after the September 11 attacks.

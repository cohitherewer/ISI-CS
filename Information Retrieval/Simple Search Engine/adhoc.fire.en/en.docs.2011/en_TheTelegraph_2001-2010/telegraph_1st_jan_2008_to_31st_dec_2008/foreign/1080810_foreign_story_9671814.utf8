          ISAMBARD WILKINSON                          Honourable exit                                  
	Islamabad, Aug. 9: Pakistans all-powerful army chief will ask President Pervez Musharraf to resign from office within a week, a senior government official claimed today.         
	The claim was supported by a former military aide to the President who said that the armys leadership wished Musharraf to be spared the humiliation of impeachment.         
	The civilian government intensified an attritional, seven-month long power struggle with the presidency when it announced earlier this week that it is to begin impeachment proceedings against Musharraf on Monday.         
	The twin arbiters of power in Pakistan, the army chief of staff, General Ashfaq Kiyani, and America, which has provided $12 billion in military aid to the country in the last six years, have publicly declared themselves to be neutral on Pakistans domestic politics. However a senior official from the ruling government coalition partner, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) said that the army has whispered in Musharrafs ear that it is time to leave.         
	Over the next few days they will make it clear to him [Musharraf] that a protracted battle [against impeachment] is not in Pakistans interests, he added. Yesterday, Pakistans political class had an ear strenuously cocked for hints as to which way the army will move as Kiyani spent a second day in conference with his senior commanders.         
	The former military aide to Musharraf said: The army is neutral but is expecting him to resign. It will then influence his honourable safe passage as the armys senior leadership would not want him to be punished. The PPP government official said that his party had given an assurance of indemnity to the President.

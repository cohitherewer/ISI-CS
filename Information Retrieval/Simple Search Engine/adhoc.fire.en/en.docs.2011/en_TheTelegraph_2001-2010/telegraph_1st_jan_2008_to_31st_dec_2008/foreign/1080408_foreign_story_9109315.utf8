The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Airline quality falling
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Airline quality falling
                            
	Washington, April 7 (AP): Late flights and lost bags, to say nothing of higher fares, are making air travellers grumpy, an annual survey of airline quality says.        
	The industry posted declines last year in every area of the Airline Quality Rating, amid rising fuel prices, safety problems and bankruptcy filings that shut down three carriers last week alone.        
	The biggest change was in the rate of consumer complaints, up 60 per cent overall. The rate more than doubled at US Airways and Comair, and rose for 15 of the 16 airlines included in the study. The exception was Mesa Airlines.        
	On-time arrivals dropped for the fifth straight year, with more than one-quarter of all flights late, according to the survey. The rates of passengers bumped from overbooked flights and bags lost, stolen or damaged also jumped in 2007.        
	The trend is bad and it doesnt look like it gets any better, said Dean Headley, an associate professor at Wichita State University and co-author of the study being released today.        
	The survey results mesh with the spate of problems that have beset US carriers, starting with surging fuel costs, Headley said.        
	ATA, Aloha Airlines and Skybus stopped flying just last week because of financial pressures. Major airlines have slashed jobs and passenger amenities while adding fees for second bags, travelling with pets and booking tickets by phone.        
	It is not surprising that people responded to higher prices and more frequent delays by complaining more, Headley said.        
	Six airlines  Frontier, Northwest, SkyWest, Southwest, United and US Airways  showed declines in every area in the survey, although Southwest still had the best on-time arrival mark at 80.1 per cent.        
	The Dallas-based carrier also had the lowest rate of consumer complaints, 0.26 per 100,000 passengers. Still, the airline has not been immune from problems. It is fighting a record $10.2 million fine from the Federal Aviation Administration for continuing to fly dozens of Boeing 737s that had not been inspected for cracks in their fuselages.        
	American, Delta and United airlines recently cancelled flights to perform unscheduled inspections of certain aircraft, and US Airways found problems on some Boeing 757s after a wing part on one of its planes fell off during a flight.

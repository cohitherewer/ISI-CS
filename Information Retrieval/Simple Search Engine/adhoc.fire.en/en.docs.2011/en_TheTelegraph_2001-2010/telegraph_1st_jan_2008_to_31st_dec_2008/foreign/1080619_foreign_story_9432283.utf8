	Fort Madison (Iowa), June 18 (Reuters): The swollen Mississippi river ran over the top of at least nine more levees today as floodwaters swallowed up more US farmland, feeding inflation fears as corn prices soared to record highs.        
	Volunteers and aid workers were piling sandbags up and down the most important US inland waterway to try to protect more levees and thousands of acres of prime crop land threatened as the rivers crest moves south after last weeks torrential rains.        
	Their misfortune had been our fortune. Id rather it hadnt come at the expense of others. But it is what it is, Steve Cirinna of the Lee County Emergency Management Agency said of the levee breaches, which lowered the river.         
	The slow-rolling disaster, the worst flooding in the Midwest in 15 years, has swamped vast sections of the US farm belt and forced tens of thousands of people from their homes.        
	LeRoy Lippert, chairman of emergency management committee for Des Moines county, Iowa, said volunteers and aid workers in the town of Burlington filled 2.5 million sandbags in the past week before the river crested. All systems are holding right now. Were in a watch and wait mode with our levees. The situation has stabilised in the last 24 hours, Lippert said.        
	The Army Corps of Engineers, which operates river locks and dams, said 19 levees along the Mississippi had failed with the latest levee breaks near Meyer, Illinois, and north of St Louis, Missouri. The corps has identified 26 levees protecting about 285,000 acres of cropland that were already under high water or at high risk of flooding.         
	Among the most fertile farms in Iowa and Illinois have land that lies in the Mississippi rivers vast flood plain.         
	Some of the richest farmland is to be found between the river and the bluff and we aim to protect it, said Lippert.         
	Estimates are that 5 million acres across the Midwest have been ruined and will not produce a crop this year. That has sent US grain and livestock prices soaring, the latest inflation jolt for an economy already struggling to absorb record oil and energy prices.        
	Iowa and Illinois usually produce one-third of all U.S. corn and soybeans.

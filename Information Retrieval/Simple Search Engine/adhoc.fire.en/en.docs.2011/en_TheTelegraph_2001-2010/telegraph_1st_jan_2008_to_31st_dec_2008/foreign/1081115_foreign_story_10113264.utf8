          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, Nov. 14: A Canadian woman journalist has gone missing in the insurgency-hit tribal belt of north-west Pakistan. Initial investigations suggested she had been kidnapped by the Taliban.        
	Beverly Giesbrecht, 52, who had converted to Islam in 2001, was last seen in the Jani Khel area of Bannu district, close to the restive North Waziristan tribal region.        
	The incident comes six years after Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl was kidnapped and beheaded in Karachi by Taliban militants.        
	Giesbrecht, also known as Khadija Abdul Qahaar, runs the website jihadunspun.com that offers news on the Islamic world.        
	Administration officials in Bannu town said she was filming a documentary when she disappeared. Police suspect she has been abducted by Taliban militants who took her to North Waziristan.        
	Giesbrecht went missing along with three locals, including her driver, on Tuesday and we fear she has been kidnapped, an official said on condition of anonymity.        
	He added that the administration was in touch with tribal elders in North Waziristan.        
	According to media reports in Pakistan, Giesbrecht was kidnapped at gunpoint while travelling in a taxi with her translator and guide.        
	The Canadian high commission told The Telegraph that it had seen reports about Giesbrechts disappearance.        
	We do not know exactly what happened to her because she did not get herself registered with the embassy, high commission spokesperson Anjum Nida Rahman said.         
	Our government has approached Pakistani authorities and the police to trace the journalist, she added. The high commission is working with Pakistani officials and pursuing all appropriate measures.

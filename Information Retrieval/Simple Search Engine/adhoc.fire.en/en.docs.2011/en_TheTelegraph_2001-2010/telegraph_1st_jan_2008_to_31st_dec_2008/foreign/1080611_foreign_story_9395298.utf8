                              Fresh trouble                            
	Dhaka, June 10 (PTI): Bangladeshs military-backed government has imposed a gag order on former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina till she leaves for the US and denied her permission to visit the grave of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, her party claimed today.        
	The government yesterday announced that it will allow Hasina to travel abroad for medical treatment 11 months after the Awami League chief was arrested under its massive anti-graft drive.        
	The government does not want her to talk to anyone in public before she leaves the country, a senior party leader, who wished to remain anonymous, said.        
	 Authorities have nearly finalised formalities to send the 60-year-old former Prime Minister for treatment in the next two days, officials and party sources said.        
	They added that a special Singapore Airlines flight was arranged to fly her out tomorrow evening.        
	However, the Daily Star newspaper quoted highly placed sources in the interim government as saying that the ailing leader could leave the country on June 12.        
	 Awami sources said Hasina wanted to visit her ancestral home to offer prayers at her fathers grave in southwestern Gopalganj before leaving for the US.         
	However, the government urged her to go straight to the airport from the jail and board the plane.        
	 Deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui visited Hasina at the makeshift jail in the parliament complex yesterday. Siddiqui said he had not received any administrative order on her release.         
	The court yesterday excluded Hasina from personal appearance at a hearing involving four graft charges while police returned her passport which was seized after her arrest on July 16 last year.        
	 The former Prime Minister will fly to the United States of America any day, Hasinas counsel Fazle Noor Tapash told reporters yesterday.        
	 Hasina suffered a major ear injury during a 2004 grenade attack on her rally by suspected Islamic militants that left over two dozen people dead.         
	She was admitted earlier at a city facility under custody for various problems including fluctuating blood pressures, eye complaints and cardiac complications.        
	 On April 18 last year, the interim government had barred her from returning to Bangladesh while she was on a tour of the the US and Britain.

          MATT RICHTEL AND ASHLEE VANCE                          Start-up woes                                  
	San Francisco, Oct. 26: It is the black hole of the digital age  the three minutes it can take for your computer to boot up, when there is nothing to do but wait, and wait, and wait some more before you can log on and begin multitasking at hyper-speed.        
	Some people stare at their screen and fidget. Others pace or grab a cup of coffee. Half the time, I go brush my teeth, said Monica Loos, 40, who is starting a business selling stationery online from her home in San Francisco.        
	Now the computer industry says it wants to give back some of those precious seconds. In coming months, the worlds major PC makers plan to introduce a new generation of quick-start computers, spotting a marketing opportunity in societys short attention span.        
	Its ridiculous to ask people to wait a couple of minutes, said Sergei Krupenin, executive director of marketing of DeviceVM, a company that makes a quick-boot program for PC makers. People want instant-on.        
	Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Lenovo are rolling out machines that give people access to basic functions like email and a web browser in 30 seconds or less. Asus, a Taiwanese company that is the worlds largest maker of the circuit boards at the centre of every PC, has begun building faster-booting software into its entire product line.         
	Even Microsoft, whose bloated Windows software is often blamed for sluggish start times, has pledged to do its part in the next version of the operating system, saying on a company blog that a very good system is one that boots in under 15 seconds.         
	Today only 35 per cent of machines running the latest version of Windows, called Vista, boot in 30 seconds or less, the blog notes. Apple Macintoshes tend to boot more quickly than comparable Windows machines but still feel glacially slow to most users.        
	There is nothing new about frustration with start-up times, which can be many minutes.         
	But the agitation seems more intense than in the pre-Internet days. Back then, people felt less urgency to log on to their solitary, unconnected machines. Now the destination is the vast world of the web, and the computer industry says the fast-boot systems cater to an information-addicted society that is agitated by even a moment of downtime.        
	Yet it is a condition that the technology industry  with smartphones and other always-on gadgets  helped create, said Gary Small, a professor at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at the University of California, Los Angeles.         
	Our brains have become impatient with the boot-up process, Small said. We have been spoiled by the hand-held devices.        
	PC makers are not merely out to ease our data anxieties with the new machines. They want to help themselves, too. The industry has grown so competitive, and profit margins so thin, that each company is looking for any advantage it can trumpet. Computer makers say the battle for boot-up bragging rights could resemble the auto industrys race to shave tenths of a second from the time it takes a car to go from 0 to 60 miles an hour.

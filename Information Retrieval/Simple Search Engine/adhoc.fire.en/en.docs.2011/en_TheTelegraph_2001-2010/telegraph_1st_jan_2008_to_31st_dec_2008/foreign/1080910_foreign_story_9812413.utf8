The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kim may have had stroke: US
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kim may have had stroke: US
                            
	Washington, Sept. 9 (Reuters): North Korean leader Kim Jong-il may have had a stroke within the past couple of weeks, a US intelligence official said today.        
	It does appear that Kim Jong-il has suffered a health setback, potentially a stroke, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.        
	She said there have been no signs of a change in governing power and that assessing whether Kim was still capable of governing would call for a lot of speculation.         
	Kim failed to appear at a triumphal military parade today celebrating North Koreas 60th birthday. South Koreas largest daily, the Chosun Ilbo, said Kim, 66, and suspected of suffering from chronic illness, collapsed last month, citing a South Korean diplomatic source. Kim, as leader, attended the parades for the 50th and 55th anniversary of the state.

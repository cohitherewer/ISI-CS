          PATRICK SAWER                           Keith Richards                                  
	London, June 22: There arent many weddings were the fathers look just as cool as the younger guests  but this was a Rolling Stones affair, after all.         
	Keith Richards sported his familiar pirate look, replete with green headscarf, while the brides father Ronnie Wood, 61, wore the kind of suit so skinny that only a living rock and roll legend could get away with.         
	Woods daughter Leah was resplendent in a pre-Raphaelite-inspired gown with pleated bodice and billowing skirt.         
	Wood, a 29-year-old model who also sings in a rock band, married Jack MacDonald, a television producer and her boyfriend of 11 years at Southwark Cathedral, close to the banks of the Thames in London.         
	Celebrity royalty turned out for the ceremony.         
	Mick Jaggers ex-wife Jerry Hall was there, as was his daughter Jade Jagger. Model Kate Moss attended with her boyfriend Jamie Hince.         
	The couple arrived five minutes after the bride, with Moss receiving a loud cheer from the congregation.         
	Cilla Black arrived on the arm of TV comedian Paul Grady.         
	The cathedral was decked out in mixed summer flowers, with lilac orange and white blooms.         
	But the loudest cheers were reserved for Richards and Wood, who drew applause from both those old enough to remember the Rolling Stones in their prime and those young enough to still rank them among the greats.

	Cairo, Sept. 22 (Reuters): Masked kidnappers have seized 19 hostages including western tourists on safari in a remote desert border area of Egypt and whisked them over the frontier into Sudan, Egyptian officials said today.        
	The kidnapping was the first of its kind in Egypt in living memory, although Islamic militants have hit the countrys tourist industry in recent decades.        
	They have been kidnapped and they have been moved outside the Egyptian borders by four criminals who have kidnapped them, tourism minister Zoheir Garrana told Reuters. This is a gang act (by) masked men.        
	Security sources said the kidnappers were asking for 6 million euros to free the hostages, identified as five Italians, five Germans, a Romanian and eight Egyptians. They said there was no sign militant Islamists were involved. Italian President Giorgio Napolitano was following the situation with great concern, his office said in a statement.        
	Egypts army scoured the border area today for the tourists, who were believed to have been seized on Friday from a safari near where the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya meet.        
	The state-run Middle East News Agency reported that the group had spent the night of September 16 in a hotel in Dakhla oasis in Egypts Western Desert before heading out towards the Gilf al-Kebir national reserve. They had been due to reach another oasis on Saturday to end their tour, but never made it. Garrana said authorities learned of the kidnapping after a tour operator called his German wife and told her he was being held hostage with the group.         
	Gilf al-Kebir, the area where the tourists were seized, attracts adventure travellers with bleak desert scenes including a massive crater and the Cave of Swimmers, whose prehistoric paintings were made famous by the 1996 film The English Patient.        
	Garrana told Egyptian television the kidnappers were most likely Sudanese.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China busts Olympics, plane plots
                                                                                                               China busts Olympics, plane plots
                            
	Beijing, March 9 (AP): Chinese police have busted a terror plot targeting the Beijing Olympics. In a separate incident, a flight crew foiled an apparent attempt to crash a Chinese jetliner.        
	Wang Lequan, a top Communist Party official in the far western region of Xinjiang, said today materials seized in a January 27 raid in the regional capital, Urumqi, suggested the plotters planned specifically to sabotage the staging of the Beijing Olympics.        
	Their goal was very clear, Wang told reporters at a meeting of Xinjiang delegates in Beijing.        
	Wang cited no other evidence or sources of the information and earlier reports on the raid had made no mention of Olympic targets.        
	Speaking at the same meeting, Xinjiangs governor said a flight crew prevented an apparent attempt to crash a China Southern flight from Urumqi to Beijing on Friday. Nur Bekri did not specifically label the incident a terrorist act, saying it remained under investigation. No passenger was injured and the police were investigating, he said.        
	The incidents may give greater force to Chinas arguments that extreme measures are necessary to ensure social stability and the safety of the August Olympics, already the focus of negative publicity from the regimes critics.        
	While deadly violence is less common in China than in many countries  Beijing bans virtually all private gun ownership  officials were quick to assert that a deadly hostage drama involving 10 Australian travel agents last week was not an embarrassment in the run-up to the Olympics.        
	The hostage-taker was shot and killed by a police sniper after an almost three-hour standoff in the northern tourist hub, Xian. The hostage-takers motive was not known.        
	Chinese forces have for years been battling a low-intensity separatist movement among Xinjiangs Uighurs, Turkic Muslim people who are culturally and ethnically distinct from Chinas Han majority. Iron-fisted Chinese rule has largely suppressed the violence, however, and no major bombing or shooting incidents have been reported in almost a decade.        
	China has ratcheted up anti-terror preparations ahead of the Games, with the nations top police officials last year labelling terrorism the biggest threat facing the event.        
	Although terrorism experts say the threat is not high given Chinas tight social controls, they warn that Beijings counterterrorism capabilities are weak, especially in intelligence gathering and analysis.        
	Earlier reports said the police found guns, homemade bombs, training materials and extremist religious ideological materials during the January raid in Urumqi, in which two members of the gang were killed and 15 arrested. Authorities have not identified those killed and arrested or their specific targets.        
	The Global Times newspaper published by the Communist Party had earlier said the group planned bombings and other violent terrorist incidents for February 5, the last business day before the start of the Lunar New Year holiday.

                              Minghella                            
	London, March 18 (AP): Anthony Minghella, a screenwriter, opera director and Oscar-winning filmmaker of The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley and Cold Mountain, has died unexpectedly at the age of 54.        
	Minghella died today of a haemorrhage, five days before the British TV premiere of his final film: The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency. Spokesman Jonathan Rutter said Minghella died early today at Londons Charing Cross Hospital. Rutter said Minghella was operated on last week for a growth in his neck. He said the operation seemed to have gone well. At 5 am today he had a fatal haemorrhage.        
	Britains arts community reacted with shock to the loss of one of its best known figures. Tributes poured in from people as diverse as movie star Jude Law and former British Premier Tony Blair. Law, who appeared in three of Minghellas films, said he was deeply shocked and saddened at the loss of a friend.        
	He was a sweet, warm, bright and funny man who was interested in everything from football to opera, films, music, literature, people and most of all his family whom he adored and to whom I send my love, said Law.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Obama rejects debate, says he is not ducking

	Washington, April 28: Barack Obama has rejected Hillary Clintons challenge to hold a 90-minute debate without moderators, insisting that he needs more time to meet working-class voters before next weeks crucial primaries in Indiana and North Carolina.        
	Obama was widely judged to have performed poorly during the last debate between the two Democratic candidates.        
	Some of the voters who gave Clinton a nine-point win in Pennsylvania last week said that the debate had been a factor.        
	Im not ducking, Obama told Fox News. Weve had 21 [debates]. For two weeks, in two big states, we want to make sure were talking to as many voters on the ground.        
	Acknowledging he had work to do to win over white, working-class voters, he added: Ive got to be knocking on more doors. Ive got to be hitting more events.        
	Obama has a virtually insurmountable lead among pledged delegates  the nomination races most important yardstick as they are allocated according to votes.        
	This means Clinton badly needs Obama to make a major mistake  something that could be forced in the unpredictable environment of a debate.        
	As the clear front-runner, he is trying to avoid risks, whereas for her any gamble is worth taking at this stage.        
	To keep her White House hopes alive, Clinton must win in Indiana where opinion polls are finely balanced. Issuing her challenge, she said: Im offering Senator Obama the chance to debate me one-on-one, no moderators. Just the two of us going for 90 minutes asking and answering questions. Well set whatever rules seem fair.        
	But Robert Gibbs, Obamas spokesman, rejected the idea, saying: Over the next 10 days, we believe its important to talk directly to the voters of Indiana and North Carolina about fixing our economy, cutting the cost of health care and ending a war in Iraq that never should have been authorised in the first place.        
	Bill Clinton said last week that Obama was afraid to debate his wife because he knew that she had superior command of policy detail.

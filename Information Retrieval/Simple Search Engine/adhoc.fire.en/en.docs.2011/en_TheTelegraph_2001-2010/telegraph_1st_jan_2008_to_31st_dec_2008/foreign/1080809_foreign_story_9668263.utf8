	London, Aug. 8: Software developers have found a line of code buried in the iPhones operating system that could enable Apple to remotely delete applications stored on the device that it no longer approves of.         
	The discovery of a so-called kill switch comes as Apple is embroiled in a controversy over the removal of several applications from its iPhone Application Store.        
	The App Store is an online shop that allows iPhone users to download new software and programmes to their handset. Applications have to be pre-approved by Apple before they can be sold through the store.        
	The potential kill switch was discovered by Jonathan Zdziarski, an independent iPhone developer. He said the code could in theory prompt the iPhone to download a list of malicious applications, and match it against programmes installed on the phone. This has led to speculation that Apple could then use this list of blacklisted apps to delete any that it deems unsuitable.

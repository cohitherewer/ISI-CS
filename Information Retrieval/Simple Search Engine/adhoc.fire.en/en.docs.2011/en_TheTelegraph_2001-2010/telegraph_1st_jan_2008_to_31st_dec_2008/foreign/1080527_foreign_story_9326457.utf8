	Voice arrest    
	 Tokyo, May 26 (AFP): A Japanese plumber was arrested for calling a toll-free number around 500 times so he could hear a taped female voice, police said today.      
	Hiroyuki Nomoto, a 38-year-old Tokyo resident, was arrested on suspicion of obstructing the business of the company, a food firm based in Takasaki, north of the capital.      
	The company has the number for 24-hour order-taking with a female voice. He said he wanted to hear a womans voice, a police spokesperson said.      
	The company paid the call charges, which amounted to 3.8 million yen (Rs 1.6 million) for the call time of 3,100 hours, the official said.    
	Camel race     
	 Berlin: Every sport has its bad losers, but in this one even the winners got the hump. Camel racing, a hugely popular sport in the Arab states and Australia, seems to be taking off in Germany, of all places.       
	 In the Orient Race, in Berlin, spectators saw thirty camels (and dromedaries) and their uncomfortable jockeys hurtle at speeds of up to 40kmph, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The winner will pocket 4,000 euros and the satisfaction of knowing that his or her humpbacked hot-rod is the fastest camel in Germany.

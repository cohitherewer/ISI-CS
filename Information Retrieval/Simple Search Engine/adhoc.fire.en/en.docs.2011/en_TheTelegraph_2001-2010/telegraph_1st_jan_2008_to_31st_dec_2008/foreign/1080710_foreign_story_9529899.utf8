	Islamabad, July 9 (Reuters): About 2,000 Islamist women gathered at the radical Lal Masjid in the Pakistani capital today and vowed to raise their children for holy war, days after a suicide bomber killed 18 people after a similar rally.        
	Chanting slogans, burqa-clad women, some with babies, listened to fiery speeches from the daughter of the mosques jailed cleric on the eve of the anniversary of a commando raid on the complex in which more than 100 people died.        
	Our mujahideen laid down their lives for the enforcement of the Islamic system in Pakistan. We are left behind to carry forward their mission, the daughter of cleric Abdul Aziz told the tightly-guarded rally in the mosque compound.        
	Several thousand men attended a similar rally on Sunday to mark the anniversary of the July 10 commando raid that ended a week-long siege which began when gunmen from the mosque clashed with police.        
	Shortly after the Sunday rally ended, a suicide bomber attacked police who had been guarding the gathering killing 18, all but three of them policemen.        
	The attack highlighted the danger posed by militants in Pakistan, where a new coalition government has been preoccupied with what to do with the unpopular President Musharraf.        
	The blast in the centre of the capital also compounded gloom on Pakistans financial markets, where stocks have been sliding because of economic worries and the rupee has set new lows.        
	But there was no trouble today as the clerics daughter, who did not identify herself, told the crowd to steel their families for holy war. We should prepare our children and men for jihad, she said.        
	The crowd responded with shrill chants of we are ready and al jihad.        
	Aziz was caught during the siege last year trying to slip through a cordon dressed in a womans burqa. His brother, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, who was also a mosque cleric, was killed.        
	Ghazis widow, identified as Umm-e-Hassam, said President Pervez Musharraf should be punished for ordering the crackdown: This man is the enemy ... I want this man to be severely punished before I die, she told the rally.         
	The Red Mosque and an adjoining womens madarsa had for years been a bastion of militant support in Islamabad and the clerics and their followers had waged an increasingly defiant campaign to enforce Taliban rule.

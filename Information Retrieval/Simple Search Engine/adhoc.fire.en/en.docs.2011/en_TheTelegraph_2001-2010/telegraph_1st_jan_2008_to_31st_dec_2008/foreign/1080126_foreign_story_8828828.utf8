               Second coming
              
	Washington, Jan. 25 (AP): Former World Bank chief Paul Wolfowitz will head a high-level advisory panel on arms control and disarmament, the state department said yesterday.
    
	The move by secretary of state Condoleezza Rice marks a return to government for Wolfowitz, a conservative with close ties to President George W. Bushs White House. Wolfowitz was replaced as World Bank chief in June, after a stormy two-year tenure. His leadership was undermined by a furore over a hefty compensation package he arranged in 2005 for Shaha Riza, a bank employee and his girlfriend.
    
	Wolfowitz will become chairman of the International Security Advisory Board, which reports to the secretary of state. The panels duty is to supply independent advice on arms control, disarmament, nonproliferation and related subjects to the secretary.
    
	The portfolio includes commentary on several high-profile issues now before the administration, including pending nuclear deals with India and North Korea.

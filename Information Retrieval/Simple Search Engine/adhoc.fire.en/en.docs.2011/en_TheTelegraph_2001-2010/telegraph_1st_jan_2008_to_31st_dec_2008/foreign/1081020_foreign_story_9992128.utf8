	Washington, Oct. 19: President George W. Bush has announced plans to host an emergency summit of leaders from the worlds top economies to map out a response to the global financial crisis, urging a renewed effort to secure the basis of democratic capitalism.        
	The objectives set for the summit are every bit as far-reaching as those of the 1944 landmark meeting in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, attended by 44 Allied nations to remake the global financial system after the Great Depression.         
	But while that earlier gathering was devoted to coordinating monetary policy and setting up an international currency exchange system, the summit announced yesterday at Camp David would aim to overhaul the regulatory framework for global finance.        
	The agenda would address a wide range of challenges such as increasing the transparency of markets, revising the rules that govern the flow of investment around the world and improving oversight of big banks, ratings agencies and hedge funds, a senior White House official said.         
	Bush warned, however, that these reforms should not come at the expense of free markets.        
	Any initiatives that come out of the summit would do little to ease the immediate situation. But the conclave could give Bush a chance to put his stamp on the global financial system before his term ends.         
	A joint statement issued after a meeting of Bush, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and European Commission President Jos Manuel Barroso at Camp David said the European Union, France and the US had agreed to hold a series of summits on addressing the challenges facing the global economy, starting with one in the US soon after the US elections.        
	The aim of the first summit would be to review progress in the current crisis and to seek agreement on principles of reform needed to avoid a repetition and assure global prosperity in the future, the statement said. Later summits would be held to implement whatever agreements were made at the first.        
	The meetings would involve emerging economic powers previously excluded from similar talks as well as those that have dominated the global financial system over the last half century, White House officials said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pilots in rare protest over pay
                            
	Beijing, April 5 (Reuters): Pilots flying for a subsidiary of China Eastern Airlines turned back midflight to southwestern Chinese airports earlier this week in a rare strike to protest lower pay and other conditions, state media reported today.        
	Organised labour strikes are unusual in China, where there is only one legal, government-backed union. Seventeen flights returned to their departure airports in Yunnan province after takeoff on Monday and Tuesday, in a protest by pilots of China Eastern subsidiary Yunnan Airlines.

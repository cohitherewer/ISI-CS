	London, June 24 (AP): Nearly 40,000 travellers will remember President George W. Bushs stopover in London. Their flights were cancelled or delayed at Heathrow Airport to accommodate him, according to British Airways.        
	BAA, the airport owner, confirmed today that 32 arrivals and 36 departures, mostly British Airways flights, were cancelled on June 15, when Bush arrived and the following day when he left. BAA had no figures on delays related to the Presidents visit.        
	The company said Heathrow typically handles 1,300 arrivals and departures per day. Baa, the airlines and other business partners at Heathrow did everything in their power to minimise disruption at the airport during George Bushs presidential visit, BAA said.

	Dead man spotted    
	London, Sept. 4: A man who cremated a body believing it was that of his father has been reunited with him eight years later after seeing him alive on television, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	 Renehan spotted his father, John Delaney, by chance on a programme about missing people. Unknown to his family, Delaney had spent the intervening years living in a care home just a few miles away from them, using a new name because he could not remember his own.       
	Police have apologised for an extraordinary series of errors which led to him being declared dead and an unidentified man being cremated in his place.       
	Delaney, now 71, was reported missing in April 2000 after he failed to turn up at a hostel in Oldham, Greater Manchester, where he was staying. When he turned up just nine days later, six miles away, he was admitted to hospital and seen by a police officer who failed to make proper checks of records.

	London, June 18 (PTI): A Muslim shop assistant who wrote extremist poems, dubbing herself as the Lyrical Terrorist, has won an appeal against her conviction.        
	Pakistan-origin Samina Malik penned lyrics entitled How to Behead and The Living Martyrs while working at WH Smith at Heathrow till recently. She also possessed a document entitled The Terrorists Handbook.        
	The 24-year was found guilty in December under the Terrorism Act 2000 at the Old Bailey and given a nine-month jail sentence.        
	But the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips, quashed the conviction yesterday. He said: There is a very real danger the jury became confused and the prosecution have rightly conceded that this conviction is unsafe.

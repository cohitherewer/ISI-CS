	Tokyo, June 8 (Reuters and AP): A man who said he was tired of life went on a stabbing rampage today in a crowded Tokyo shopping street, killing seven people and wounding a dozen others.        
	The man drove a rental truck into a crowd of pedestrians at lunchtime and then walked down the street knifing passers-by in Akihabara district, known for its discount electronics and maid cafes.        
	I came to Akihabara to kill people, Kyodo news agency quoted the attacker, Tomohiro Kato, as telling police. I am tired of the world. Anyone was OK. I came alone.        
	A Tokyo police spokesperson said at least seven people had been killed and 12 wounded.        
	The man jumped on top of a man he had hit with his vehicle and stabbed him with a knife many times, Kyodo quoted a 19-year-old witness as saying. Walking towards Akihabara station, he slashed nearby people at random.        
	The dead were six men aged 19 to 74 and a 21-year-old woman, the news agency said.        
	As well as electronics, Akihabara has become known in recent years as a centre for Japans expansive nerd culture of video games, comic books and outlandish fashion  including street performers and cafes with waitresses dressed as French maids.         
	The police said the man had been arrested, and television stations showed a slight, blood-splattered 25-year-old being herded into a police car.        
	Witnesses said the rampage was stopped when a policeman armed with a gun confronted the man, who NHK television said was shouting as he cut down his victims.        
	The street, usually crowded with tourists and locals seeking cheap gadgets, was cleared by the police, who searched for evidence amid pools of blood.        
	The rampage came on the seventh anniversary of a massacre at a Japanese primary school, when a knife-wielding janitor and former mental patient killed eight schoolchildren. He was later executed for the killings.        
	Todays attack paralysed the district and sent thousands of Sunday shoppers into a panic. At least 17 ambulances rushed to the scene, and TV footage showed rescue workers tending to victims in the street.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | AQ Khan denies nuke bomb links
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AQ Khan denies nuke bomb links
                              Pure lies                            
	Islamabad, June 17 (Reuters): Pakistans disgraced top nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan denied today that he was the source of sophisticated warhead designs found on the computers of Swiss smugglers.        
	A nuclear watchdogs report that the designs were found on the smugglers computers has spurred fears in the US and elsewhere that atomic secrets may be quickly spreading.        
	The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) said in a report released this week that Swiss investigators had found the encrypted designs in 2004 on the computers of three Swiss smugglers associated with Khan, who headed work on Pakistans nuclear programme.        
	But Khan, who has been kept under house arrest in Islamabad since 2004, denied that the designs came from him. Its pure lies and nonsense. Its part of Americas campaign to pressure Pakistan, Khan told Reuters by telephone. Still admired by many Pakistanis as the father of the countrys atomic bomb, Khan confessed on television in early 2004 to selling nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea and Libya.        
	But in recent interviews he has recanted, saying that he only took the blame in return for assurances by President Pervez Musharrafs government that were never honoured. Musharraf did grant Khan a pardon but kept him under house arrest. The scientist said he had expected to be rehabilitated and allowed to travel freely in Pakistan.        
	The designs on the Swiss computers were smaller and more sophisticated than one Libya bought from Khan and would fit on a ballistic missile, the ISIS said. These would have been ideal for two of Khans other customers, Iran and North Korea, it said.        
	But Khan said he and his Khan Research Laboratory (KRL) had worked on simple weapons design, not sophisticated ones. What we developed in 1983 was a simple, functional weapon and after that neither I nor KRL worked on it, he said.        
	It served our purpose, we stopped working on it ... we did not go for advancement nor did we have the facility to do that, he said. Its rubbish. We did not work on any improvement or so-called miniaturisation.        
	Pakistan says it considers its investigation of Khan to be closed. US investigators looking into nuclear proliferation want to question Khan but the government has blocked access to him, saying it has shared information gleaned from him with the UN.

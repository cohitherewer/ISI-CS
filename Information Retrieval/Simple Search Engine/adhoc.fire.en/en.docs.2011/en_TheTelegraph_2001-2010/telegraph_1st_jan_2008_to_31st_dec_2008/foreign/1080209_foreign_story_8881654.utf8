	Baton Rouge (Louisiana), Feb. 8 (AP): A young woman killed two female students in a classroom at a technical college today, then killed herself, police said.        
	The students apparently were shot in their seats in the second-floor classroom at Louisiana Technical College, Sergeant Don Kelly said. Officers ran into the building within four minutes of the first emergency call, which came at 8:36 am, he said.        
	There was mass pandemonium, people running, Kelly said. One officer  the first into the classroom  told me he could still smell gunpowder.        
	The students names and ages were not immediately released, and it was not clear whether the shooter also was a student.         
	The school offers classes in a dozen subjects including early childhood education, practical nursing, drafting and welding.        
	Students had to stay in their classrooms for about two hours before being released for the day, said Louis Davis. He said he was taking a test for an automobile technology class when a teacher said to stay in the classroom because theres been an incident.        
	He said they were allowed to leave after a police officer asked them brief questions. School administrators and campus police did not return calls or emails.

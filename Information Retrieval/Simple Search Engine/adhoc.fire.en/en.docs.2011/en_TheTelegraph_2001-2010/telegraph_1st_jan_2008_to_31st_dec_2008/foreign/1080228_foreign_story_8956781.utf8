The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jackson told: Pay up or ranch will be sold
                                                                                                               Jackson told: Pay up or ranch will be sold
                              Never never land                            
	London, Feb. 27: Michael Jacksons sprawling Neverland Ranch will be auctioned off next month unless the singer pays off a $24.5 million loan, it has been reported.        
	Fox News cited official documents showing that the 2,800-acre ranch in Santa Barbara would be sold at auction next month unless the singer pays up. The auction of Neverland Ranch would include all personal property, including the merry-go-round type devices        
	The auction sale would include the house and all personal property, including furniture and all merry-go-round type devices, rides and games, the report said.        
	In 2006, authorities ordered the property to be boarded and fined Jackson for failing to pay his employees or maintain proper insurance.        
	Jackson has not lived in Neverland since June 2005, when he was acquitted of sexual molestation charges.        
	A notice of trustees sale was filed against Neverland Valley Ranch on Monday but no further details were available.        
	Foxs website said the five-page document stated that Jackson was in default of a deed of trust and Unless you take action to protect your property it may be sold at a public sale        
	If Jackson, 49, is forced to part company with Neverland it will mark the end of an era for the eccentric pop star, who bought the property in 1987.

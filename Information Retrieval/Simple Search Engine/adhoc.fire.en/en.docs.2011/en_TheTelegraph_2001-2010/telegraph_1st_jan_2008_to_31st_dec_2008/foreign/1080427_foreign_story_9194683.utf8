	London, April 26 (Reuters): Grammy-winning singer Amy Winehouse was cautioned for assault and released without charge today after spending the night in custody, police said.        
	A man said he was assaulted in the early hours of Wednesday in north London and the singer presented herself at a central police station in central London yesterday for questioning.         
	Winehouse admitted common assault after slapping a man with her open hand and accepted the caution, her spokesman said.

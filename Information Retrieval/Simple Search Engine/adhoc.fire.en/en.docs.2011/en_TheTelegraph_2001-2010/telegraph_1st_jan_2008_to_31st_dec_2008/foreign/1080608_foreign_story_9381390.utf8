	Kuala Lumpur, June 7 (Reuters): Malaysians have turned to the Internet to vent their anger at one of the biggest hikes in fuel prices, and some are using it to rally support against the measure in a country with tight restrictions on street protests.        
	Much of the rage was directed against Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, already fighting for political survival since leading his ruling coalition to its worst election showing in March.        
	We used to think you were nice. Now you are just nasty, plain nasty, read a post from someone calling himself a hungry Malaysian on rockybru.blogspot.co, arguing there was going to be less food on the table for millions of poor people.        
	A post on apanama blog said: It was a matter of time before Abdullah was given the proverbial pink slip in UMNO or the United Malays National Organisation. Some have taken the battle into the governments camp. A hacker tried to deface the official website of the Prime Ministers office.

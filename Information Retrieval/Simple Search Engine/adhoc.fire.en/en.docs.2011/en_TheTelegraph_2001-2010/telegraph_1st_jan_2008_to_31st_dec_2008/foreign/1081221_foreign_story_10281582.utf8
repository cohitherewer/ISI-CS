          TIM SHIPMAN                           Palin: In spotlight                                  
	Washington, Dec. 20: Sarah Palin, the Alaska governor and former Republican vice- presidential candidate, was facing fresh embarrassment over her family after her daughter Bristols future mother-in-law was arrested on drug charges.         
	The swoop by Alaska state troopers on Sherry Johnston threatened to mar the birth of Bristol Palins first grandchild, due this weekend. Johnston, 42, is mother of Levi Johnston, the self-confessed redneck who is the father of Bristols child and is due to marry her next summer.        
	Johnston was taken into custody on Thursday at her home in Wasilla, Alaska, where Palin used to be mayor and still lives, and was charged with six counts of misconduct involving a controlled substance.        
	Officials in Alaska said that the arrest was connected with the strong prescription painkiller OxyContin. In addition to possession charges, Johnston faces a felony charge usually related to selling or manufacturing the drugs.        
	The arrest followed an undercover narcotics investigation, but law enforcement officials refused to say whether it was underway when Palin burst onto the national political scene in August after Republican presidential candidate John McCain selected her as his running mate.        
	From the beginning, her colourful family was in the spotlight.        
	Palin, a mother of five, was forced to reveal that her eldest daughter Bristol was pregnant during the Republican convention in September in order to silence rumours that her 17-year-old daughter was actually the mother of her own son, Trig, who was born with Downs Syndrome earlier this year.        
	A spokesman for Palin said the arrest was not a state government matter and declined to comment further. The arrest comes at an awkward time for Palin, who is trying to rebuild her national political credibility after polls suggested her harsh rhetoric on the campaign trail alienated floating voters.        
	Johnston was released on $5,000 bail and is due to appear in court on January 6.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

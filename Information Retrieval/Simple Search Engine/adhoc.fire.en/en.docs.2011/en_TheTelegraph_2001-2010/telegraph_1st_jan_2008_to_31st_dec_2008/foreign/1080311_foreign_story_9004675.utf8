The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pervez reaches out to bloc
                                                                                                               Pervez reaches out to bloc
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                          Lawyers protest against President Musharraf in Karachi. (AP)                                  
	Islamabad, March 10: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf today reached out to the new coalition signalling smooth and cordial relations, a day after they set the stage for a confrontation by deciding to reinstate sacked judges.        
	Separately, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari revealed at a party meeting that he had decided to take over as the Prime Minister of Pakistan, The News daily said today.        
	Pushed to the backfoot after the PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) hammered out a coalition, Musharraf said he will not adopt a path of confrontation with the new government and hoped that this will be reciprocated by the two parties.        
	The danger for Musharraf is that the reinstatement of the sacked judges could pose a direct threat to his future as they could rule against his re-election as President .        
	After Zardari and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif signed an agreement to form a coalition government yesterday, Musharraf called a meeting today which was attended by his close aides and constitutional experts at Rawalpindi.         
	It was decided to have smooth and cordial relations with the new government and not adopt a path of confrontation, the Dawn news channel said quoting sources.         
	The winning parties should avoid confrontations with the state institutions and let the system run in accordance with the Constitution, sources quoted the President as saying.         
	The News today said that Zardari reportedly shared the multi-million dollar secret with his party MPs from Hyderabad on Saturday night . The PPP co-chairman told the MPs that he would appoint a Prime Minister from Punjab for 90 days and become Premier after contesting elections.         
	The PPP senior vice-chairman and one of the candidates for the post of Prime Minister, Amin Fahim, told the paper that he too had heard from partymen that Zardari had decided to become Prime Minister.         
	However, Fahim said until he hears about the decision from Zardari, the PPP leader would not give any reaction.        
	The News said this is Zardaris third major decision on the Prime Ministers post in the last 60 days. First, he announced Fahim as Prime Minister, then he changed his mind and started talking about a Premier from Punjab after backing Yousaf Raza Gillani, Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Ahmed Mukhtar.        
	 Now, finally he is believed to have decided to become the candidate for the top post, after pitting the top four leaders against each other.        
	The four, otherwise shrewd, politicians were made to fight against each other so that, instead of getting united against Zardari, none of them could pose any challenge when the co-chairman named himself as the Prime Minister, the daily said.        
	The paper added that Zardari had decided to take over as Prime Minister in deference to the demands of the Sindhis who feel that the Prime Minister should be from their province.        
	At Saturdays meeting, Zardari sought the opinion of MP Fahmida Mirza who, along with many others, immediately endorsed the co-chairman. They felt that his decision may stop the rift in the party which had became obvious after four contenders laid claim to the post.

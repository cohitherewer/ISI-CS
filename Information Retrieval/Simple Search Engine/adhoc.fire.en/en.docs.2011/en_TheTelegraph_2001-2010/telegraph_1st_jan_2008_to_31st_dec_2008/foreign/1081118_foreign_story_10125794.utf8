	London, Nov. 17: There is a lot riding on the success of Nicole Kidmans sweeping new epic film Australia.         
	Billed as a cross between Out Of Africa and Gone With The Wind, the three-hour romantic adventure is expected to revive the flagging fortunes of the countrys film and tourism industries, as well as impress and entertain moviegoers.         
	Australia, which is reported to have cost 77 million to produce, is set during World War II and tells the story of English aristocrat Lady Sarah Ashley, played by Kidman, who travels to Australia when she inherits a cattle farm.         
	To keep her farm, she must drive a hard of cattle across the harsh but beautiful Australian interior, joining forces with a cattle drover, played by Hugh Jackman, and a young Aboriginal boy.         
	Geoff Brown, executive director of the Screen Producers Association of Australia, said the industry hoped the Baz Luhrmann-directed film would draw investors and moviegoers back to Australian movies after a string of bleak, box-office flops.         
	This is a truly cinematic film, a real epic, filmed in 1940s style. We just havent had the opportunity to show our wares on this scale before, he said.         
	This is the marketing tool for Australian film. Its an Australian film from beginning to end, shot in Australia with an Australian cast, crew, special effects, lighting, even director, and we are seeing this as a calling card to the world.        
	Tourism Australia has spent $32 million on an advertising campaign and promotions linked to the film, aiming to make Australia a coveted destination as the global financial crisis hits tourism, as Crocodile Dundee did in the 1980s.         
	The campaign received a major boost last week when talk show host Oprah Winfrey described it as the best movie Ive seen in a long, long, long, long time.                             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

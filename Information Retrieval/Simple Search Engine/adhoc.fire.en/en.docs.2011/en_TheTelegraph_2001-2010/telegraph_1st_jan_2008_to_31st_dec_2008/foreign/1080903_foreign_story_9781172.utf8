	Speedy solution    
	London, Sept. 2: Residents of a country village are attempting to find a local solution to the problem of speeding motorists by putting up warning signs in the regional dialect, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Drivers entering Wiveton in north Norfolk are now met with signs asking them to Slow You Down. The winding road through the village, which lies between the holiday resorts of Blakeney and Holt, has seen regular accidents caused by speeding drivers, but residents were reluctant to spoil the picturesque village with a clutter of conventional speed warning signs.       
	Their unconventional solution has been praised by language campaigners fighting to preserve the countys vernacular.       
	The 60mph road is winding and narrow as it twists between pretty flint-faced cottages, then breaks into a sharp bend near the pub and church, where there have been regular accidents.     
	Ash stones    
	Chur, Switzerland (Reuters): Diamonds really are forever. Algordanza, a small company based in the mountainous southeast of Switzerland, uses the ashes of dead people to make diamonds as a permanent memento for their nearest and dearest. And with prices starting at less than 5,000 euros ($7,488), the jewels are not solely the preserve of the jetset. Some people find it helpful to go to the cemetery and grieve, and they leave their grief in the cemetery, said Algordanza Chairman Veit Brimer. There are some people who, for whatever reason, do not want to have this farewell. Astonishingly these are mainly Christian people.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Judges return on May 12
                            
	Islamabad, May 2 (Reuters): All the Pakistan judges deposed by President Pervez Musharraf during emergency rule last November will be reinstated on May 12, the leader of the second largest party in the ruling coalition government said today.        
	I want to inform the entire nation that on Monday, May 12, 2008, all deposed judges will be restored, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N), said in a televised news conference from Lahore.        
	Sharif held talks with Asif Ali Zardari, leader of her Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), in Dubai on Wednesday and yesterday to try to resolve differences over the reinstatement of 60 judges who refused to endorse Musharrafs emergency rule on November 3.        
	Sharif said the anti-Musharraf alliance, whose election victory in February destroyed the Presidents parliamentary support, intended to stick together. We are in strong favour of keeping this coalition for the sake of country, he added.

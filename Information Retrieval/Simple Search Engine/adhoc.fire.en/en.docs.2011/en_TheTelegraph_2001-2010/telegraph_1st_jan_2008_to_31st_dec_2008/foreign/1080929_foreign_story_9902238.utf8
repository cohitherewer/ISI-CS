	Beijing, Sept. 28 (Reuters): Chinas three astronauts landed safely back on earth today after a 68-hour voyage and a monumental space walk that showcased the countrys technological mastery and was hailed as a major victory by its leaders.        
	Their sacred vessel spacecraft parachuted down to the steppes of northern Inner Mongolia region at dusk, and doctors rushed to open the capsule and check the men as they readjusted to gravity and recovered from the punishing return journey.        
	Zhai Zhigang was the first to emerge and was helped to a nearby folding chair, where he was greeted with flowers and applause. He said he was proud of his motherland after completing his mission.

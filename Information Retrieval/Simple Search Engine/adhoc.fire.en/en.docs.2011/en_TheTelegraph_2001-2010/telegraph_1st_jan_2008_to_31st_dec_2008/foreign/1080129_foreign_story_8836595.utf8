The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Killer storms choke China
                                                                                                            Killer storms choke China
                            
	Beijing, Jan. 28 (Reuters): Brutal winter weather across China today stranded hundreds of thousands of people and choked energy flows, claiming a rising human and economic toll that pummelled local stock prices ahead of the Chinese New Year.        
	At least 24 people had died in two weeks of accidents due to snow, sleet and freezing cold across central, eastern and southern China, regions used to milder winters, Xinhua news agency said.        
	Many highways, railways and airports were paralysed, especially in the east, with officials in Hunan, Jiangsu and other provinces calling the snow and cold the worst in decades, and snow and sleet were set to continue tomorrow.        
	The bad weather has hit as tens of millions of Chinese head home to celebrate the Lunar New Year, starting on February 7 this year, a human tide that strains transport at the best of times.        
	China also counted the economic cost from stalled production and shipping and the power brownouts across more than half the nations 31 provinces. The main Shanghai stock index plunged 7.19 per cent, its fourth biggest drop this decade, as investors added the weather woes to gloom about inflation and the global economy.

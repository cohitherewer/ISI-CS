	Spearing ahead    
	 London, Oct. 14: Britney Spearss new music video Womanizer has recorded seven million hits in 48 hours, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The video is directed by Joseph Kahn, the man behind the clip for Britneys earlier release Toxic. The raunchy single portrays Spears in various states of undress, while she is also seen dressing up as a secretary, a roller-skating waitress and a chauffeur. The video has been viewed millions of times on YouTube since being uploaded at the weekend. There are high expectations Womanizer will confirm Spears comeback following a troubled few years, during which she suffered a nervous breakdown. The singer won three awards at the MTV VMAs last month. Her new single is the first from her forthcoming album Circus, which will be released later this year.    
	Pants sack    
	 Juba, Sudan (Reuters): A senior official in south Sudan who ordered a crackdown on young women wearing tight trousers has been sacked, officials said recently. Police arrested scores of women  many on their way home from church  in the capital Juba last week on charges of disturbing peace. Officers said their choice of clothing proved they belonged to youth gangs.

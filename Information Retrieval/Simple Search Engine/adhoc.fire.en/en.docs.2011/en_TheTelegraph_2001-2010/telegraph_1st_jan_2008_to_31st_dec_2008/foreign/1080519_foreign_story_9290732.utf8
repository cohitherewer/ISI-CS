	Cat and mouse    
	 Tirana, May 18 (Reuters): A cat chasing a mouse in Tiranas main power station caused a 72-hour blackout across parts of the Albanian capital recently, the electricity company said.      
	A cat and a mouse ran into the high-voltage cables, a company spokesperson said, showing pictures of the electrocuted animals. We took pictures because weve never had anything like this.    
	Deer gore     
	 Sydney (Reuters): An Australian man was gored in the thigh on Friday by an amorous stag after entering a deer paddock near Sydney in the middle of the breeding season. The 26-year-old ignored signs on the paddock gate warning people to keep out and was charged by the stag. It was the middle of the rut (breeding season), that is why the animal was acting like it did, Barry Hibbard, the farm owners husband said.    
	Heart hurt     
	 Ottawa (Reuters): A Canadian man who asked his lover to carve a heart-shaped symbol on his chest during a rough sex game almost died when she accidentally pressed too hard and punctured his heart, a newspaper said recently. The Winnipeg Free Press said the 25-year-old woman had been sentenced to three years probation after she pleaded guilty to assaulting the man in February 2007. The 24-year-old man was initially given little chance of survival but made a full recovery and is backing the woman. Both had been drinking heavily and engaging in rough sex when he asked the woman to carve the symbol, the paper said.

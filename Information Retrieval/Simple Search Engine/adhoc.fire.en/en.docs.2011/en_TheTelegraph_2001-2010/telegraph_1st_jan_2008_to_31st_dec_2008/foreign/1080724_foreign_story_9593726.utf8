	London, July 23: A climate change activist attempted to superglue himself to Gordon Brown after he was invited to Downing Street to receive an award for his protesting work.        
	Dan Glass, of the campaigning group Plane Stupid, tried to attach his hand to the Prime Ministers suit as the pair met at an event to recognise the contribution of the voluntary sector.        
	The 24-year-old then demanded to know why the government was refusing to meet residents opposed to plans for a third runway at Heathrow airport.        
	We cannot shake away climate change like you can just shake away my arm, the protester said, before the Prime Minister wrenched his sleeve away.        
	Downing Street laughed off the stunt, and said there had never been any threat to Brown. A spokesman said: As far as we are concerned, nothing really happened.        
	There was a light-hearted and not particularly successful demonstration at a reception that was being hosted at Downing Street.        
	Speaking afterwards, Glass, from Barnet, north London said he had smuggled five pouches of glue into the building in his underwear, before smearing the adhesive onto his left hand.        
	I just glued myself to him and after 20 seconds he tore my hand off  it really hurt. He had to give it a couple of tugs before it came away, he said. He was just grinning about it. He didnt seem to take me seriously.        
	The protester said he was given a round of applause by the audience as he urged the Prime Minister to change his mind on Heathrow expansion.        
	Glass had been invited to Downing Street to receive an award from the Sheila McKechnie Foundation for his protesting work with Plane Stupid.         
	Police said there had not been any security breach, as Glass was invited and did not cause any damage.

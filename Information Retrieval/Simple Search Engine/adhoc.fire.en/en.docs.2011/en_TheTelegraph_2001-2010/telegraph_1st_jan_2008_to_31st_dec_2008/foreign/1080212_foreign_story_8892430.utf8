The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Paparazzi scared UK actress
                                                                                                               Paparazzi scared UK actress
                            
	London, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Actress Sienna Miller told a court today of her terror as paparazzi chased her car across London after she left a trendy club.        
	The 26-year-old said she had tried desperately to evade the photographers to stop them learning her new address. Giving evidence for 30 minutes, Miller said photographers darted in and out of traffic and nearly blinded her driver by taking flash pictures.        
	The paparazzi cut up cars and buses and dangerously overtook on blind corners in a bid to grab another picture, she told West London Magistrates Court. I felt scared and threatened. Their actions were aggressive, to say the least, Miller told the court.        
	I believed it was particularly frenzied on this occasion because they did not know where I lived and they were particularly keen to find out so they could follow me more and get the pictures they wanted.        
	Dressed in a dark grey mini-skirt suit, Miller gave her testimony just hours after she missed out on a prize at the British film awards.

          ALASTAIR JAMIESON                          Palin: Rambling response                                  
	London, Oct. 1: Sarah Palin is facing fresh embarassment after failing to name a single newspaper or magazine she has read about world events.         
	The Republican vice-presidential candidate was asked repeatedly what news sources she read to keep abreast of current affairs.         
	Her faltering performance came in the latest instalment of her cringeworthy interview with CBS News presenter Katie Couric. Last week she was seen rambling in response to Courics questions about the threat posed by Russia.         
	Presidential candidate John McCain has been forced to step in and defend Palin, insisting she is ready for the White House and claiming she is underestimated.         
	McCain said: I remember Ronald Reagan was a cowboy, President Clinton was governor of a very small state that had no experience either. I remember how easy it was going to be for Bush One to defeat him.         
	The point is I have seen underestimation before and I am very proud of the excitement Governor Palin has ignited.         
	In the latest clip, which is already being viewed on video-sharing site YouTube, Couric asks: When it comes to establishing your world view, I was curious, what newspapers and magazines did you regularly read before you were tapped for this to stay informed and to understand the world?         
	Palin replies: Ive read most of them, again with a great appreciation for the press, for the media.         
	Couric: What, specifically?        
	Palin: Um, all of them, any of them that have been in front of me all these years.         
	Couric: Can you name a few?         
	Palin: I have a vast variety of sources where we get our news, too. Alaska isnt a foreign country, where its kind of suggested, Wow, how could you keep in touch with what the rest of Washington, DC, may be thinking when you live up there in Alaska? Believe me, Alaska is like a microcosm of America.

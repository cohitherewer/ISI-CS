	Lahore, Aug. 17 (AP): Saira Liaqat squints through her one good eye as she brushes a womans hair. Her face, most of which the acid melted years ago, occasionally lights up with a smile. Her hands, largely undamaged, deftly handle the dark brown locks.        
	A few steps away in this popular beauty salon, Urooj Akbar diligently trims, cleans and paints clients fingernails. Her face, severely scarred from the blaze that burned about 70 per cent of her body, is sombre. Its hard to tell if shes sad or if its just the way she now looks.        
	Liaqat and Akbar are among Pakistans many female victims of arson and acid attacks. Such tales tend to involve a spurned or crazy lover and end in a life of despair and seclusion for the woman.        
	These two instead became beauticians.        
	The women cant escape the mirrors or pictures of glamorous models that surround them, but they consider the salon a second home and a good way to make a living. The two also serve as reminders of that age-old lesson on beauty  a lesson that, needed or not, they learned the hard way.        
	Every person wishes that he or she is beautiful, says Liaqat, 21. But in my view, your face is not everything. Real beauty lies inside a person, not outside.        
	They do it because the world demands it,Akbar, 28, says of clients. For them, its a necessity. For me, it isnt.        
	Liaqat and Akbar got into the beauty business in Lahore thanks to the Depilex Smileagain Foundation, an organisation devoted to aiding women who have been burned in acid or other attacks.        
	About five years ago, Masarrat Misbah, head of Pakistans well-known Depilex salon chain, was leaving work when a veiled woman approached and asked for her help. She was insistent, and soon, a flustered Misbah saw why.        
	When she removed her veil, Misbah felt faint. I saw a girl who had no face.        
	The woman said her husband had thrown acid on her.        
	Misbah decided to place a small newspaper ad to see if others needed similar assistance. Forty-two women and girls responded.        
	Misbah got in touch with Smileagain, an Italian nonprofit that has provided medical services to burn victims in other countries. She sought the help of Pakistani doctors. Perhaps the biggest challenge has been raising money for the cause, in particular to build a special hospital and refuge for burn victims in Pakistan.        
	Her organisation has about 240 registered victims on its help list, 83 of whom are at various stages of treatment.        
	The victims Misbah has helped need, on average, 25 to 30 surgical procedures over several years, but she soon realised that wasnt enough. Some, especially those who were outcasts in their families, had to be able to support themselves.        
	To her surprise, several told her they wanted to be beauticians. And I felt so sad, Misbah says. Because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin.        
	She helped arrange for 10 women to train in a beauty course in Italy last year. Some have difficulty because their vision is weak or their hands too burned for intricate work. But several, including Liaqat and Akbar, are making their way in the field.        
	The salon in Lahore is not the usual beauty parlour. There are pictures of beautiful women on the walls  all made up, with perfect, gleaming hair. But then theres a giant poster of a girl with half her face destroyed. Help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors, it says.        
	Working for the salon is a dream come true for Liaqat, whose mischievous smile is still intact and frequently on display.         
	Akbar, the more reserved one, also carries out many administrative and other tasks for the foundation. One of her duties is collecting newspaper clippings about acid and burn attacks on women.

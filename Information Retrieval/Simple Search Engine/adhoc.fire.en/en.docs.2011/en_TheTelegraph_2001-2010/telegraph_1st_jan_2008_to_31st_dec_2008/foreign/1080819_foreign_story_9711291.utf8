	London, Aug. 18: Harrods is recalling hundreds of teddy bears that contain potentially harmful levels of formaldehyde.         
	 Tests on the 2008 Christmas toy showed there was too much of the chemical, which has been linked with cancer, in the bears foot pads.         
	The Knightsbridge department store admitted the teddy bears did have a higher than normal level of formaldehyde which could cause skin problems. Toddlers with sensitive skin are particularly at risk.         
	Formaldehyde, which is used as an embalming fluid, can trigger headaches, a burning sensation in the throat and difficulty breathing if it is inhaled in high concentration. It has also been identified as a possible cause of cancer.

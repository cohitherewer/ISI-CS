The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Qaida taunts US over economic crisis
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Qaida taunts US over economic crisis
                                  
	Cairo, Oct. 4 (AP): A prominent American member of al Qaida pointed to the current US economic troubles as proof that Muslims were on the verge of victory.        
	In a 30-minute English video message, California-native Adam Gadahn today urged Pakistanis to unite against their government and US forces and taunted Americans over their economic crisis, relating it to their military interventions.        
	The enemies of Islam are facing a crushing defeat, which is beginning to manifest itself in the expanding crisis their economy is experiencing, said Gadahn, in a clip of the message distributed by the SITE Intelligence Group, a Washington-based monitor of militant websites.        
	A crisis whose primary cause, in addition to the abortive and unsustainable crusades they are waging in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq, is their turning their backs on Allahs revealed laws, which forbid interest-bearing transactions, exploitation, greed and injustice in all its forms.        
	 Gadahn, 29, grew up in Riverside county, east of Los Angeles.         
	He was indicted by a federal grand jury in Santa Ana in 2005 and charged with one count of treason and two counts of providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organisation.        
	The FBI says Gadahn moved to Pakistan in 1998 and attended an al Qaida training camp six years later, serving as a translator and consultant to the group.        
	Gadahn also called on Pakistanis to put aside their ethnic differences and unite to establish an Islamic state. Al Qaidas media arm, al-Sahab, is using English-language videos to address Muslims in Pakistan who are not likely to speak Arabic.        
	Gadahn went on to warn Pakistanis to continue to fight their government which, according to him, bows to American interests.        
	This is Gadahns first video appearance since January 2008, quashing rumours that he died in a US air strike that killed another al Qaida leader.

	Atlanta, April 2 (Reuters): Nine-year-olds at a school in the US state of Georgia brought a broken steak knife, handcuffs and electrical tape to school in a plot to injure their teacher, authorities said yesterday.        
	Teachers at Center Elementary School in Waycross, Georgia, uncovered the plot on Friday when a pupil reported that a child in the third grade had brought a weapon into the school. The plan was to handcuff the teacher, put tape over her mouth and hit her over the head with the paperweight, police said.

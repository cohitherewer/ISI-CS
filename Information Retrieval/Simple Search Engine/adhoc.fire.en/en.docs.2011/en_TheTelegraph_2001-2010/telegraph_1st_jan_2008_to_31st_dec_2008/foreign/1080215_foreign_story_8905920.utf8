The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Quality still in films: Redford

	Barcelona, Feb. 14 (Reuters): Actor and filmmaker Robert Redford praised popular video-sharing websites such as YouTube but said quality content still came from real films.        
	I am on the side of content. Technology needs it but what separates the wheat from the chaff is quality, Redford said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona yesterday. YouTube and stuff like that are democratising but there is a lot of junk out there. Redford and telecoms industry association GSM launched a project in November 2006 to make short films for mobile phones. So far, the Oscar-winning Redford, 71, said, five films had been made.        
	Redford, who founded the Sundance Film Institute to encourage independent filmmakers, said he watches films on his mobile and said art and technology need not exclude each other.        
	The more art blends itself with technology, the more it will drive it, Redford told Reuters. Redford said while entertainment on mobile phones could have an isolating effect, he was convinced people would always look for and need social interaction. There are all kinds of uses for cellphones but they are just another form of human connection, Redford said.        
	Asked which film had lately made a lasting impression on him, Redford named the 2007 film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. The film describes the life of a 43-year-old man after a stroke leaves him paralysed with his only remaining means of communication the blinking of his left eyelid.

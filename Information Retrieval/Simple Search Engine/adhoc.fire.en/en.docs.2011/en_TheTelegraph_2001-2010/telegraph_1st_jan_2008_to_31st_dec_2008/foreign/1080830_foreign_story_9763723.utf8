          MATTHEW MOORE                          Deadly error                                  
	London, Aug. 29: An obituary of very-much-alive Apple founder Steve Jobs has been accidentally published by the respected Bloomberg business news wire.         
	The story, marked Hold for release  Do not use, was sent in error to the news services thousands of corporate clients.         
	The stock obituary was published momentarily after a routine update by a reporter, and was immediately deleted, Bloomberg said.         
	Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, but there is no suggestion that the news wire has recent news on his health. Most media organisations regularly update their pre-prepared obituaries of newsworthy figures. The obituary contained blank spaces for Jobss age and cause of death to be inserted.         
	The opening sentence described Jobs as the man who helped make personal computers as easy to use as telephones, changed the way animated films are made, persuaded consumers to tune into digital music and refashioned the mobile phone.         
	The 2,500-word piece also included praise for Jobs from his rival Microsoft boss Bill Gates, details of his rise from college drop-out to technology billionaire, and a list of his family survivors.         
	Details of friends and colleagues of the Apple founder to be contacted by Bloomberg in the event of his death were also published with the obituary.         
	Bloomberg, which was founded by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and prides itself on its accuracy and transparency, later published a note acknowledging the storys retraction on its wire.         
	An incomplete story referencing Apple Inc. was inadvertently published by Bloomberg News at 4:27pm New York time today, the message read. The item was never meant for publication and has been retracted.         
	A Bloomberg spokeswoman said: This was a routine update of a biography by the obits department, meant for the internal system and not meant for publication. It was momentarily posted on the external wire, in error, and immediately deleted.        
	Jobs has been reluctant to publicly discuss his health, but recently denied claims that his cancer had returned.

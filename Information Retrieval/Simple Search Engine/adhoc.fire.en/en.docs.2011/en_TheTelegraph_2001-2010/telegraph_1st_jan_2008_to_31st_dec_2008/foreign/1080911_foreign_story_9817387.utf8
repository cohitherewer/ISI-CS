The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | ElBaradei to quit in 2009
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ElBaradei to quit in 2009

	Vienna, Sept. 10 (Reuters): UN nuclear watchdog chief Mohamed ElBaradei, a Nobel laureate who has probed a rash of alleged atomic bomb programmes, plans to leave office after his third term expires next year, officials said today.        
	ElBaradei has overseen International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) efforts to have Iran, Syria and before them North Korea and Libya come clean about their nuclear activity but clashed with Washington over how tough to get, particularly with Iran.        
	An IAEA memo circulated to the agencys 35-nation Board of Governors on September 5 and released today said ElBaradei would not be available for a further term in office after his third, four-year term expired on November 30, 2009.        
	ElBaradei took charge in 1997 of the then obscure IAEA, which monitors nuclear activity to uphold the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and was re-elected twice by the board, lastly in 2005 when he and the agency were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This was after years of IAEA sleuthing that helped bring to light illicit nuclear weapons programmes in Libya and North Korea and secret Iranian uranium enrichment, although the IAEA has yet to resolve allegations of atom bomb research by Tehran.        
	Four months before the Nobel honour, the US tried to foil ElBaradeis election to a third term in June 2005 over allegations  strongly denied  of IAEA laxity towards Iran, but backed off when no other candidate stepped forward.

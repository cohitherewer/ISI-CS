                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Asians end Kuwait strike
                            
	Kuwait, July 28 (Reuters): The Kuwaiti government reached an agreement with Asian workers today to end a three-day strike over pay and conditions, state news agency KUNA said.        
	Earlier, some workers had overturned cars and ransacked offices before being dispersed by the police. The strike in the oil exporting Gulf Arab state came against a backdrop of soaring inflation.        
	KUNA quoted cabinet minister Faisal al-Hajji as saying that the workers had agreed to return to work after the government said it would ensure their rights and that anyone participating in riots would be deported.        
	More than 500 Asian cleaners and workers earlier staged street demonstrations until police dispersed them, residents and a security source said. A witness said police used tear gas and batons.        
	A Bangladeshi worker in his 30s told Reuters TV they wanted a net salary of 50 dinars ($188) a month without deductions for visa fees.

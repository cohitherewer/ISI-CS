The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US river spills into farms, small towns
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             US river spills into farms, small towns

	Quincy (Illinois), June 19 (Reuters): The Mississippi river surged past levees and spilled into farms, small towns and parkland today, adding to billion-dollar losses that have ignited global food inflation fears.        
	More than two dozen levees on the key US commercial waterway have either overflowed or been breached, causing grain and meat prices to soar on concerns about short supplies. Corn prices retreated early today, having set record highs for two weeks on flooding that has submerged or stunted crops on millions of hectares.        
	Political pressure was growing to provide relief. President George W. Bush will travel to Iowa to survey flood damage in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City and meet emergency workers and state and local officials.        
	Republican presidential candidate John McCain, an Arizona senator, will also be in the state to inspect the damage and the response. His Democratic rival in the November presidential election, Illinois Senator Barack Obama, visited earlier this week.        
	In Quincy, Illinois, along the Mississippi, the largely volunteer effort to fill and stack sandbags continued.        
	Jeff Steinkamp, chief engineer of Quincy, where the flooded river was expected to crest at 9.8 metres on Friday, said days of sandbagging levees had paid off so far. Everything is holding for now. So far, so good, he said.        
	The Army Corps said 23 levees along the Mississippi had failed this week. It said 48 levees protecting more than 115,335 hectares of crop land were at high flood risk.        
	The latest levee to be overtopped was close to the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, north of St Louis, that protected about 1,619 hectares of parkland. Another two-dozen levees are at risk of being swamped by floodwaters, the Army Corps said.        
	Levee breaches upstream temporarily lower the rivers level downstream.

	Dhaka, Nov. 24 (Reuters): Three senior US senators, including defeated presidential candidate John McCain, will visit Bangladesh early next month to meet its leaders ahead of a long-delayed vote, a US official said today.        
	McCain, who has an adopted child from Bangladesh, Joseph Lieberman and Lindsey Graham will meet officials from the interim government that has promised to hold a free, fair and credible election on December 29.        
	US embassy spokesman Harvey Sernovitz said the visit was part of a broader regional trip. He did not give details on the timing of the visit.        
	They will discuss bilateral issues with the government and civil society leaders (and) ... may also meet top politicians and monitor pre-election conditions in Bangladesh, Sernovitz said.

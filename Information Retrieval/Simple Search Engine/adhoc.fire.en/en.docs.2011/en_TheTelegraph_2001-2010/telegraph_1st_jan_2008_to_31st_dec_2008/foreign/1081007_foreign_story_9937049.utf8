	Twin tattoos    
	 London, Oct. 6: Angelina Jolie has unveiled two new tattoos which give the geographical coordinates of the French city where her three-month-old twins were born, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The actress showed off the latest addition to her extensive collection of body art at the New York Film Festival screening of her new film, Changeling.      
	The two lines of blue script on her upper left arm detail the longitudinal and latitudinal location of Nice, where Knox and Vivienne were born in July.      
	They are inscribed directly below four similar lines of coordinates which represent the birthplaces of her other four children. From the top down the script represents adopted son Maddox, born in Cambodia, then Zahara, from Ethiopia, followed by her first biological child Shiloh, who was born in Namibia.      
	Just above her two new tattoos are the coordinates for adopted son Pax Thien, who is Vietnamese by origin.    
	Loud Lohan    
	 New York (AP): Michael Lohan is not the type to back down from a fight. The estranged father of actress Lindsay Lohan has publicly feuded with the actress, her girlfriend Samantha Ronson and her mother Dina Lohan. For his next battle, Lohan will use his fists rather than his mouth: Hes auctioning off the chance to knock him out in a charity boxing match November 24 at the Hilton Long Island in Melville, New York.

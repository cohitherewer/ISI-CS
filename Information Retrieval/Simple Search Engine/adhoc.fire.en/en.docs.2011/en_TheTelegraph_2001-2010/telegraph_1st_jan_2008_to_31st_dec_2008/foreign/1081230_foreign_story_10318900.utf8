	Harry holiday lager    
	 London, Dec. 29: Prince Harry has been seen drinking lager through a hosepipe while on holiday, his last drinks before he becomes teetotal in 2009, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The Prince was on holiday in Mauritius with the friends and family of his girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, 23, when he was pictured taking part in drinking games. He joined in the party within hours of arriving on the holiday island at the weekend.       
	Standing on a balcony, he was seen throwing back his head and putting the length of hose to his mouth before swallowing the drink in moments. A witness told The Sun: Harry and his friends were having a great time. They were daring each other to down drinks through the pipe. Harry didnt go first but it looked like he was one of the more experienced drinkers.

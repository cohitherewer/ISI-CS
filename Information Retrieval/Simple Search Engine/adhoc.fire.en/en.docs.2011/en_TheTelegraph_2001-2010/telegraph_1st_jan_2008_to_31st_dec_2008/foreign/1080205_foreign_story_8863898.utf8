	Colombo, Feb. 4 (Reuters): Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels killed 13 people with two roadside bombs today, just hours after the government celebrated the islands 60th anniversary of independence with a parade of military might in the capital.
    
	At least a dozen people were killed and 17 hospitalised in a suspected rebel bombing of a civilian bus in the north-eastern town of Weli-Oya. A soldier also died and three others wounded when their army tractor was blown up by a bomb near the southeastern town of Buttala, officials said.
    
	They were the latest in a series of deadly attacks as a 25-year civil war between the state and the LTTE escalates.
    
	It was a Tamil Tiger Claymore mine targeting a civilian bus in Weli-Oya, a military spokesman said of the attack in the north-eastern district of Polonnaruwa, about 200 km from Colombo.
    
	Thousands of police and troops were on high alert in Colombo earlier today as a defiant Sri Lankan military paraded tanks and troops as fighter jets flew overhead amid fears Tiger rebels would attack the celebrations.
    
	The parade came a day after a suspected female Tiger suicide bomber killed 11 people and wounded 92 in an attack on the islands main train station, which sits a few hundred metres from the site of todays parade.

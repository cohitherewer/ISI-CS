	Houston, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Rescuers made their way through piles of debris and water-filled streets in Texass seaside towns today after Hurricane Ike flooded hundreds of miles of the US coastline, cut power to millions and pummelled the oil hub of Houston.        
	A weakened Ike pushed northward after slamming into the Texas coast as a giant Category 2 hurricane yesterday.        
	Officials have barely begun to assess the damage, which early estimates put in the billions of dollars.        
	The giant storm swamped the island city of Galveston and hammered Houston, the fourth most populous US city.        
	The sea wall protecting the coastal barrier island of Galveston, where Ike crashed ashore, was piled high with the detritus of wrecked buildings, boats and other debris.        
	Wreckage and floodwaters have hampered rescuers attempt to search all 32m of Galveston, where about 10,000 people ignored a mandatory evacuation order.         
	Heavy rains falling across Houston today threatened more flooding.        
	In Houston Ike shattered the windows of skyscrapers, showering streets with glass and debris, tore apart bus shelters and ripped metal sheets off buildings.        
	According to an early estimate of damage by the insurance industry, Ike could lead to $8 billion to $18 billion in claims. Federal and state officials, including homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff, are set to tour storm-damaged areas today. President George W. Bush will visit his native Texas to view the devastation on Tuesday.

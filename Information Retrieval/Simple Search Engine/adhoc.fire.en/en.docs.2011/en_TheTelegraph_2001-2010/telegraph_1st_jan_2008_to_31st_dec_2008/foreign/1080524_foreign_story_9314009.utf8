	Kathmandu, May 23 (Reuters): Hundreds of people queued up at petrol pumps with their cars and motorcycles in the Nepali capital today, as a state-run oil company warned they were running out of fuel stocks.        
	The Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC), which has a monopoly on oil imports, said it would soon face a shortage unless the government gave the firm a subsidy or allowed a price rise. The government subsidises some fuel prices. But with the rising international price of oil, the firm says it is struggling to pay for imports.        
	We are able to recover only 70 per cent of the cost of oil and lose the rest because we are forced to sell at a price less than the cost price, NOC chief Digambar Jha said.        
	The price of petrol in the international market hit $135 a barrel today. But we are selling it at a price fixed when it was just $83 a barrel.

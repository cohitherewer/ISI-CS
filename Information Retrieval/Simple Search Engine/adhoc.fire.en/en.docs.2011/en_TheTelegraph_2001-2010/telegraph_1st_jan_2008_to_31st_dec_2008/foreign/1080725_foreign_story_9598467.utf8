	Barcelona, July 24 (AP): Holy no comment, Batman!        
	Dark Night star Christian Bale ducked questions about allegations he assaulted his mother and sister at a London hotel, pleading for privacy today in what he said was a deeply personal matter.        
	The Welsh-born heart throb, who plays the caped crusader in the blockbuster Batman movie, told a news conference in this northeastern port city that he preferred to focus on the films box office and critical success.        
	In his first comments since the alleged incident at Londons luxury Dorchester Hotel, Bale asked the media for time. Its a deeply personal matter, Bale told The Associated Press at a news conference. I would ask you to respect my privacy in the matter.        
	The star looked relaxed, dressed casually in a black long sleeve shirt and khaki pants. Bale, 34, spent four hours talking to British police on Tuesday.

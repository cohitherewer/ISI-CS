	Heath art    
	 Sydney, May 9 (AP): A portrait of Hollywood star Heath Ledger painted weeks before his death has won an Australian art award.

	Sydney artist Del Kathryn Barton won first prize with her self portrait. Heath was the popular choice among the 32,000 who saw the exhibition. Ledger died of an accidental prescription drug overdose in January. He was 28.

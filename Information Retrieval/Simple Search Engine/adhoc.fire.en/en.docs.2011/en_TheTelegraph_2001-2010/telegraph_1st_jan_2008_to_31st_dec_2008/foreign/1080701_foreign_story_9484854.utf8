	Thimpu, June 30 (Reuters): The National Assembly in newly democratic Bhutan has stopped lawmakers from bringing laptop computers into the House for fear they might spend their time playing computer games.        
	The members can be distracted playing games and viewing pictures, said Nima Tshering, Apeaker of the Assembly. Some lawmakers had argued that laptops were more convenient.

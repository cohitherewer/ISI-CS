	Dickens desk    
	 London, June 4 (Reuters): The desk where Charles Dickens wrote Great Expectations and his final correspondence hours before his death fetched 433,250 at an auction today, around seven times its pre-sale estimate.      
	The Irish entrepreneur who bought the furniture called the price a bargain. Its a part of Charles Dickens, so Im delighted to be its owner, Tom Higgins said after the sale. Ive been a huge Dickens fan for a long time. I actually think its worth a lot more than what I paid for it and it could have gone for 5 million.

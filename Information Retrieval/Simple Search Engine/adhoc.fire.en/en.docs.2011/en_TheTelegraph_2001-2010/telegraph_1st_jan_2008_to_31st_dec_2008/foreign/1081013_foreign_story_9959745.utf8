                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Concern over Brown eyesight 
          MELISSA KITE                          Brown: Eye trouble                                   
	London, Oct. 12: Gordon Brown is struggling with increasing problems because of his partial sight, it has emerged.         
	The Prime Ministers close friends have revealed that he can only see extremely large print and has needed guidance at public events. There were suggestions that if Brown falls or bumps into something his damaged retina could fail and he would go blind completely.         
	Brown, who was left blind in one eye after a rugby accident at the age of 16, addressed the problems in an interview when he admitted that he was suffering increasing problems with the other eye and recently had to have a cataract removed.         
	Appearing stoical, he said he had enough sight but admitted: It does mean when youre speaking to an audience you automatically tend to correct (which direction to look in) so youve got to be careful. If youre reading something you have to look slightly to the side.         
	Damian McBride, Browns chief spin doctor until the reshuffle, is quoted as telling the interviewer: His sight isnt very good.         
	Insiders also revealed that Browns memos are in huge print and triple spaced while his own handwriting is getting larger. One senior official said: If I want him to reply to an email, I always make sure its in at least 36 point. That is five times as large as standard print size.         
	There is mounting anecdotal evidence that Brown is battling a serious disability. As this newspaper revealed last month, the Prime Minister has been daubing black ink all over the Commons dispatch box during Prime Ministers Questions.         
	Aides have now also revealed that at the Labour spring conference the Prime Minister took a wrong turn off the stage and failed to find the exit.         
	When he was about to meet a line-up of war veterans recently, former minister John Reid had to be moved out of the way because Brown would have confused him with a veteran, according to one aide.         
	You cant understand Gordon if you dont understand his fear that he could go blind at any moment, one friend said.         
	In public Gordon puts on a heroic performance, but there is always a cost.         
	The revelations may be an attempt by Number Ten to explain to the public why the Prime Minister appears to stare blankly and awkwardly sometimes.         
	The apparently frozen expression on his face and forced looking smile has been one of his biggest disadvantages in connecting with the public.         
	There were also suggestions last night that Browns legendary temper was down to his frustration at his own limitations.         
	The anger is actually very much about him, one friend was quoted as saying.                    THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

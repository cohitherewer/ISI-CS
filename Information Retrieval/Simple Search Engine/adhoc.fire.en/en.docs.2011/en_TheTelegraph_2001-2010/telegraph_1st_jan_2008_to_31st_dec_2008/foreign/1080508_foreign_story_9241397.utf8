	Yangon, May 7 (Reuters): Aid trickled into Myanmar today for an estimated one million victims of Cyclone Nargis in military-ruled Myanmar, with the death toll rising to nearly 23,000 and expected to go higher.        
	At Yangon airport, a Reuters photographer on a Thai military plane said two Indian and one Chinese transport planes with tents and construction materials had landed.        
	With the inundated Irrawaddy delta virtually cut off and frustration growing among aid agencies and governments to deliver supplies, France suggested invoking a UN responsibility to protect clause without waiting for military approval. French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner told reporters today the idea was being discussed at the UN.        
	State Myanmar radio and TV, the main official sources for casualties and damage, reported an updated death toll of 22,980 with 42,119 missing and 1,383 injured in Asias most devastating cyclone since a 1991 storm in Bangladesh that killed 143,000.        
	US officials in Myanmar are receiving information that there may be over 100,000 deaths in the delta area.        
	 The information that were receiving indicates that there may well be over 100,000 deaths in the delta area, said Shari Villarosa, the charge daffaires of the US embassy in Myanmar.         
	Thailand, China, India and Indonesia were flying in relief supplies and the US President and Australian Prime Minister appealed to the Myanmar government to accept their assistance.        
	Even relief workers of the UN, which has a presence in the diplomatically isolated southeast Asian country, were awaiting visas five days after Cyclone Nargis struck with 190 km winds. Water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, basic medical kits, bed nets and food were priorities.        
	 Debris and fallen trees at the airport had been cleared, but paddy fields around the city were still flooded.

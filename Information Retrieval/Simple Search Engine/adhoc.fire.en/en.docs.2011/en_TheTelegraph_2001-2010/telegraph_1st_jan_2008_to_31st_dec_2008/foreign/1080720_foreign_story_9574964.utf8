                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jolie gives paparazzi the slip
                            
	Paris, July 19 (AP): Angelina Jolie has left the building. Oh, and so have the twins.        
	Before dawn today, the Hollywood superstar and her newborn twins left the French Riviera hospital where she gave birth a week ago, the hospital said in a statement.        
	The mother and her babies are doing very well, reported the Fondation Lenval hospital, located in the southern Mediterranean city of Nice.        
	Jolie slipped out at 0200 GMT today with the twins, Knox Leon and Vivienne Marcheline Jolie-Pitt, deftly evading most of the paparazzi who have followed the family for months in southern France, ever since Jolie arrived for the Cannes film festival in May.         
	AP Television cameras outside the hospital filmed a large white van with tinted windows leaving one of the hospitals back entrances.

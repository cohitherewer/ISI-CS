          LAURA CLOUT                          Normal mother                                  
	London, July 31: Catherine Zeta-Jones says her children think their father Michael Douglas makes pancakes for a living.         
	The Welsh actress, 38, has tried to make life as normal as possible for Dylan, 7, and Cerys, 5, but did not realise quite how successful she had been until recently.        
	She said her husband is an excellent pancake and waffle maker while at home in Bermuda. She said: Dylan was doing occupations at school recently and the teacher said: You have to go home and ask Mummy and Daddy what they do.        
	So we were trying to explain to Dylan that we make movies and he went to Michael: Hang on. Mama makes movies, you make pancakes.         
	So my two-time Oscar-winning husband with a career of 40 years looks at me and says: Oh, its come to that.        
	But the actress added that although her husband is a successful cook, she has been banned from the kitchen after she nearly burned down their New York apartment.        
	Zeta-Jones says the family chose to live in Bermuda because of the privacy. Its been great bringing up my children there  taking them to school without hassle. For me it was the ideal choice. The actress has recently finished filming Death Defying Acts, in which she portrays a con artist.

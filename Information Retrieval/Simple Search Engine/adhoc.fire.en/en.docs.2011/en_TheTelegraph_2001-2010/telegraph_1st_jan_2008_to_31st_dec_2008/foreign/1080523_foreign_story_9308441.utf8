The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | McCain to vet Jindal as running mate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       McCain to vet Jindal as running mate

	Washington, May 22: Senator John McCain, the certain Republican candidate for the 2008 US presidential election, has invited Indian American Bobby Jindal to his scenic ranch for what amounts to be a vetting as his vice-presidential running mate.        
	Jindal, the recently elected governor of Louisiana, is one of three potential vice-presidential candidates who will spend this weekend at McCains ranch in Sedona in his home state of Arizona. The other two are Charlie Crist, governor of Florida, and Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, who lost to McCain in this years primary contests for the Republican presidential nomination.        
	The Telegraph had reported on May 6 that the high priests of American conservatism were mounting a concerted campaign to get Jindal on the McCain ticket as a counterweight to their presidential nominees perceived liberalism.        
	Jindal, who was born a Hindu and converted to Roman Catholicism, does not believe in the theory of evolution and wants it to be replaced in school curriculum with intelligent design of the universe by God, favoured by Christian conservatives here. Jindal also champions a pet cause of conservatives here: no abortion under any circumstances, not even in cases of rape or incest.        
	On the positive side, however, Jindal is only a year older than the constitutional minimum age of 35 for the presidency and for the second slot on the ticket. This could be a welcome contrast with the 72-year-old McCain, whom many Americans consider too old for the White House.        
	In the few months that he has been governor, Jindal has established a reputation as a reformer in corruptionridden Louisiana and he would enhance McCains platform of good governance during the general election campaign.         
	In addition to the three potential vice-presidential choices and their wives, there will be 17 other political couples at the ranch, most of them McCains close advisers and colleagues in the Senate who have been with him on the campaign trail. They are expected to privately weigh in with McCain about the three likely choices after the extended weekend interaction in Sedona with the these men and their wives.        
	McCains spokespersons repeatedly disabused speculation that the weekend gathering was meant to choose his running mate and insisted that it was a social gathering where McCain would personally grill and roast prime rib for his guests.         
	But the denials are not being taken seriously here because the process of choosing a number two on the presidential ticket is traditionally a process where the nominee keeps his choice a secret until a final decision is taken.        
	Jindals office confirmed last night that he would be going to Arizona for the meeting with McCain, but the statement was silent on his vice-presidential prospects.         
	It is to Jindals disadvantage as the vetting process gets under way that McCain is likely to win Louisiana in November with or without the states governor as his running mate.        
	On the other hand, Florida is a swing state and its governor Crist could sway the state in McCains favour and secure the White House for him as Florida did for the current President in 2000.        
	Two years ago, when the Republicans lost both chambers of the US Congress, Crist won easily in Florida.         
	American conservatives do not view Crist as one of them. Romneys business background and management skills  he was in charge of the 2002 Salt Lake City winter Olympics  could dampen worries about McCains complete lack of executive experience at a time when the ailing US economy is a key campaign issue. At the same time, it would revive questions about Romneys Mormon religious background.

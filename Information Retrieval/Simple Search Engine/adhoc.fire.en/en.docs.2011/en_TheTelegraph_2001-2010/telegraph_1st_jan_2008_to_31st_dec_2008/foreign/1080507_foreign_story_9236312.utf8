The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | In rare appeal, Bush offers aid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In rare appeal, Bush offers aid
                            
	Washington, May 6 (Reuters): President George W. Bush made a rare personal appeal to Myanmars junta today to accept US disaster teams that have been blocked and said Washington was ready to help more after a devastating cyclone.        
	Addressing a government he has long tried to isolate, Bush said: Our message is to the military rulers. Let the US come and help you, help the people.        
	Bush spoke in the Oval Office as the death toll from Cyclone Nargis, the worst storm to hit Asia since 1991, rose to nearly 22,500 with an additional 41,000 missing.        
	He offered emergency assistance from the US navy, which the White House said had two ships within two days sailing time of the southeast Asian country.        
	The US has made an initial aid contribution but we want to do a lot more, Bush told reporters. But he risked further antagonising the junta by coupling his humanitarian aid offer with a signing ceremony for legislation awarding its chief political opponent, detained democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi, the Congressional Gold Medal, Americas top civilian honour.        
	The Bush administration and Myanmar have long been estranged. Bush last week imposed a new round of sanctions on the countrys military rulers to pressure them on human rights and political reform.        
	With Washington trying to reach out with a humanitarian response, the state department said yesterday the junta was refusing to let US disaster experts into the country.         
	Were prepared to move US naval assets to help find those who lost their lives, to help find the missing, to help stabilise the situation, Bush said. But in order to do so, the military junta must allow our disaster assessment teams into the country.        
	India can help        
	First Lady Laura Bush yesterday said that India can help cyclone-ravaged Myanmar in a better way than the US. Speaking at a news conference at the White House, Laura Bush said Myanmars military junta may accept Indias help more readily.         
	I think India can help. India is close on the border there. I think there are a lot of ways they could help and get help there quickly. Maybe the Burmese government would accept it more readily from the Indian government than they do from the US government,she said.

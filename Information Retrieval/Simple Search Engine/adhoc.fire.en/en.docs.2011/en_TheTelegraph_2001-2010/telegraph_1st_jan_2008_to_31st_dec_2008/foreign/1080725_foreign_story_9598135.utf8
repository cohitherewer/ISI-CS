	United Nations, July 24 (Reuters): UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon today named South African judge Navanethem Pillay as the world bodys new human rights chief, succeeding outspoken Canadian Louise Arbour, a UN spokeswoman said.        
	Pillay is currently a judge at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. UN diplomats and officials had said the US had opposed to her appointment due to her positions on abortion and other issues but had ultimately decided not to block her.        
	UN spokeswoman Michele Montas said secretary-general Ban Ki-moon expects that the new high commissioner will preserve the independence of her office and will maintain effective working relations with the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council.        
	Montas said the UN General Assembly would meet to discuss confirmation of Pillays appointment on Monday.

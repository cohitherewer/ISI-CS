	Washington, Feb. 13: A year after Barack Obama launched his insurgent campaign for the US presidency, the junior Senator from Illinois last night became the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.        
	For the first time in the gruelling primary voting season across the US, Obama overtook New York Senator Hillary Clinton in the number of delegates for the Democratic National Convention to be held in Denver in August.        
	A rolling delegate count this morning by the political tracking site, Real Clear Politics, showed Obama with1260 delegates against Clintons 1,221. These include super delegates, the Democratic party appratchiks, members of the party establishment, many of whom are still loyal to the former President, Bill Clinton.        
	Although the majority of super delegates have so far been backing the Clintons, many of them have changed their minds and switched to Obama or decided to stay neutral after Obamas eighth consecutive win in just one week.        
	Counting out the super delgates, Obamas latest tally of elected convention delegates now stands at 1104 against Hillary Clintons 979. A presidential nominee must secure the support of 2025 delegates at the party convention.        
	Yesterdays Potomac primary in the national capital region in the vicinity of the Potomac river saw Obama sweep Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia with unexpectedly huge margins.        
	The Potomac primary also created uncertainty among the ranks of Republicans because another insurgent, Christian conservative Baptist minister Mike Huckabee nearly upset front-runner John McCains apple cart in Virginia and demonstrated considerable support in Maryland and in the District of Columbia.         
	Huckabee with 240 Republican delagates is well behind McCains count of 797. But the former Arkansas governor, who wants to amend the US Constitution to reflect Christian conservative values, has sworn not to leave the primary contests until one candidate crosses the requisite number of 1,191 delegates needed for the partys nomination.        
	Conservatives are mobilising with enthusiasm against Arizona Senator McCain, whom they describe as not conservative enough. Some conservatives have gone to the extent of saying that they prefer Hillary Clinton to McCain.                
	Clintons rout last night threw her well-oiled campaign machine into turmoil with the resignation of deputy campaign manager Mike Henry only two days after the weekend losses in several states triggered the replacement of campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle. Clinton was also forced to make a $5million personal loan to her own campaign in the face of money pouring into Obamas war chest from ordinary Americans at an average of $1 million a day.        
	However, it is not as if Clintons candidacy can be written off. In what many people view as a smart strategy, the Clintons are planning to campaign in every possible nook and corner of Texas and Ohio before voting in these two states, which will send large delegations to Denver.

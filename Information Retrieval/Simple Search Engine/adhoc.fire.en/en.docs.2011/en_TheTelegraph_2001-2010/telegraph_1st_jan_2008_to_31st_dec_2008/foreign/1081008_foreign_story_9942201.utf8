	Beauty block    
	 London, Oct. 7: Clint Eastwood has said Angelina Jolies career has been hampered because she is too beautiful, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The movie veteran said Jolies talents are easily overlooked because of her gorgeous face which is the most beautiful... on the planet. He said: People sometimes cant see past that, to her talent.       
	The Dirty Harry star compared the mother of six to Meryl Streep. He added: Actors know, with me they arent going to be allowed to rehearse a scene for a couple of hours and then get away with doing 25 takes before we get it right. So they come with their full bag of tricks.      
	Angelina is a lot like Meryl Streep in that respect.      
	Eastwoods new film is set in Los Angeles in 1928. Jolies characters son is kidnapped and a fruitless search ensues. Months later a boy claiming to be the nine-year-old is returned. Dazed by the swirl of police and reporters, she allows him to stay despite knowing he is not her son.    
	Nude swim    
	 Tokyo (Reuters): A bald, naked man who said he was Spanish went swimming in the moat of Japans Imperial Palace on Tuesday, climbing the palace wall, throwing rocks and splashing water at police before being taken into custody. Television footage showed the tall man getting out of the water at one point, chasing police with a rock and a plastic construction site pole. He then dove back into the murky water and swam across to the other side.

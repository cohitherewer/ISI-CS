	New York, May 6 (Agencies): A Grammy-nominated violinist, who left his $4 million, 285-year-old Stradivarius violin in a taxi, is giving a free concert at an airport taxi stand for the driver who returned it.        
	Philippe Quint, 34, left his 1723 Ex-Keisewetter violin in Mohammed Khalils taxi when returning from Newark Liberty Airport last week. Khalil later returned it to Quint, the musicians publicist said.        
	Quint plans to repay Khalil and his fellow taxi drivers with a 30-minute recital at the taxi holding area at Newark Liberty, one of the three airports serving the New York city metropolitan area.        
	After his concert, Quint will perform on the Stradivarius in New York at Carnegie Halls Weill Recital Hall on September 23. He is providing tickets for that concert to Khalil and his family, the publicist added.         
	The violin was on loan from philanthropists Clement and Karen Arrison of Buffalo, New York.        
	Khalil, 57, emigrated from Egypt in 1980 and became a US citizen. He has been driving cabs for 24 years and is married with three sons. Quint, 34, is also an immigrant, having left Russia in 1991 to become a US citizen.

	Islamabad, Nov. 7: Pakistan has taken the unprecedented step of making cyber terrorism a crime punishable by death, according to a decree issued yesterday by President Asif Ali Zardari.         
	Cyber terrorism is described as the accessing of a computer network or electronic system by someone who then knowingly engages in or attempts to engage in a terroristic act.         
	Whoever commits the offence of cyber terrorism and causes death of any person shall be punishable with death or imprisonment for life, according to the ordinance, which was published by the state-run APP news agency.         
	The prevention of electronic crimes law will be applicable to anyone who commits a crime detrimental to national security through the use of a computer or any other electronic device, the government said in the ordinance.         
	It listed several definitions of a terroristic act including stealing or copying, or attempting to steal or copy, classified information necessary to manufacture any form of chemical, biological or nuclear weapon.         
	Amir Rana, an expert on terrorism in Pakistan, said that although a similar decree had been issued during emergency rule under Pervez Musharraf, the new law was unique worldwide.         
	Rana said it was introduced to fill judicial loopholes in Pakistans legislation  most probably at the behest of the US  but that it raised fears it would be abused by Pakistani law enforcement agencies.         
	It raises two concerns. Firstly, will it give the investigating agencies the right to enter any home to seize personal computers? he said. And how will a cyber terrorist be defined?         
	The ordinance also set out punishments for other offences, including electronic fraud, electronic forgery, system damage, unauthorised access to codes and misuse of encryption. Punishments for those crimes ranged from three to 10 years in prison.        
	US missile kills 13        
	A suspected US missile targeting a Taliban commander killed 13 people on the Pakistan side of the Afghan border today, officials said, indicating Americas new general for the region is ignoring pleas by Islamabad for a halt to the strikes, adds AP.        
	Todays attack took place in Kam Sam village in North Waziristan region, a stronghold of militants blamed for killing US troops in neighbouring Afghanistan.

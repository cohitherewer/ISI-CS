                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       UK minister calls for united Qaida fight

	Islamabad, April 7 (Reuters): British and Pakistani security agencies must enhance cooperation to fight al Qaida and other militant groups, a British minister said in Islamabad today.        
	We both face a threat from al Qaida and other terrorist and violent organisations, interior minister Jacqui Smith said, while inaugurating an art exhibition in the Pakistani capital.        
	Threats to UK have had connections here. And threats to Pakistan have been tracked back to the UK, she added. She said dialogue and cooperation between the two countries security agencies was vital.        
	That we face threats from the same groups and sometimes the same individuals underlines how important this is, she said.        
	Smith is the first senior member of the British government to visit Pakistan since the formation of a new government following the defeat of parties aligned to President Pervez Musharraf in an election on February 18.        
	Arriving a week after the new cabinet was sworn, Smith said Britain was ready to increase its assistance for Pakistan to combat militancy.        
	She said the Department for International Development was doubling its spending in Pakistan to 480 million for the period 2008-11.        
	Some of the funding was earmarked for development programmes in tribal areas on the Afghan border where al Qaida and the Taliban militants have taken refuge.        
	Pakistan is a key Western ally, and has helped Britain and the US thwart some major attacks. A sting operation in 2004 helped British police capture a dozen members of an al Qaida-linked group in London in 2004. They were convicted last year.        
	Three of four bombers who killed themselves and 52 others in London in series of attacks on July 7, 2005, were of Pakistani origin. On the negative side, a British Pakistani man named Rashid Rauf escaped from police custody in December.        
	Rauf was suspected of involvement in an al Qaida plot to blow up trans-Atlantic airliners in 2005. Pakistan has seen a wave of attacks from the Islamist militants since it joined the US-led war on terrorism following the September 11 attacks in 2001.

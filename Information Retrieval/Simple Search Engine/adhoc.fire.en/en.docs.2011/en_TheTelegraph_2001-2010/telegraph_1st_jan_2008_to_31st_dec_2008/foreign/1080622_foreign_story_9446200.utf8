	Lhasa, June 21 (Reuters): Chinese communist party officials in charge of restive Tibet used the passing of the Olympic torch relay through the capital Lhasa today to defend their control and denounce the exiled Dalai Lama.        
	The torch procession ended under tight security below the towering Potala Palace after having been run for just over two hours before a carefully-selected crowd, some three months after the region was convulsed by anti-Chinese protests.        
	Tibets sky will never change and the red flag with five stars will forever flutter high above it, Tibets hardline Communist Party boss Zhang Qingli said at a ceremony marking the end of the two-hour relay through strictly guarded streets.        
	We will certainly be able to totally smash the splittist schemes of the Dalai Lama clique, he added, in front of the Potala, traditional seat of the Dalai Lama, the most powerful figure in Tibetan Buddhism.        
	Lhasa was under lockdown with police and troops every few metres along the relay streets, closely watching the groups of residents chosen to cheer on the torch. Shops were shut.        
	At the start of the relay, groups of students  Tibetan and Han Chinese  waved Olympic banners, the Chinese national flag and the hammer and sickle banner of the ruling communist party.

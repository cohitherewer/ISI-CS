	London, Dec. 5: Boy George has been found guilty of false imprisonment for handcuffing a male escort after a naked photo shoot.         
	The singer, whose real name is George Dowd, shackled Audun Carlsen, 29, to his bed at his flat in Shoreditch, east London, on April 28 last year after accusing him of tampering with his computer. Carlsen, from Norway, told a jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London that Dowd beat him with a metal chain as he tried to escape from the premises.        
	The former Culture Club star, 46, admitted restraining Carlsen but claimed it was because he had stolen photographs of himself from the computer and messed it up. Dowd, who did not give evidence at the trial, denied to police that he punched or assaulted Carlsen or swung a chain at him as the escort fled the flat. He suggested that bruises Carlsen sustained could have been due to the fact that he was HIV positive. But the jury found that the case against the singer had been made and convicted him of one count of false imprisonment. He will be sentenced next month. Carlsen told the court that Dowd concocted the story about computer tampering so that he could punish him for not agreeing to sex during the first meeting.

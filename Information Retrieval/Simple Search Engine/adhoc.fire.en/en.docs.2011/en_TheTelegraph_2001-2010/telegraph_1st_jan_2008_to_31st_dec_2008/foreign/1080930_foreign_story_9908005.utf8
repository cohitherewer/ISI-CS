	Dhaka, Sept. 29 (Reuters): Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas hopes of returning home to take charge of her party before the elections suffered a blow today after the high court rejected her bail petition.        
	Hasina was expected to return to Bangladesh over the next few weeks. However, her party, the Awami League, demanded that she should have full freedom.        
	The countrys army-backed interim government has vowed to make the December 18 elections fair and credible with the participation of all major parties, including those of Hasina and another former Premier, Begum Khaleda Zia.        
	Hasinas lawyers said the court refused to grant bail to the former Premier, now in the US on medical parole, over a charge of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was in power between 1996-2001.        
	It is one of several corruption charges pending against the former Prime Minister.

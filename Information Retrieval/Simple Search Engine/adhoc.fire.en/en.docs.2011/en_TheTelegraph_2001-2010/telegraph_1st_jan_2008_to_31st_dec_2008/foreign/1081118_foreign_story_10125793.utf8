	London, Nov. 17 (PTI): Supermodel Kate Moss had a fight with boyfriend Jamie Hince after she found that he had stashed a vial of his ex-girlfriends blood as a keepsake.        
	Moss was angry after she discovered a parcel containing the little bottle and love letters from Hinces former girlfriend Sharin Foo.         
	He was obsessed with Sharin and kept the vial and letters. It wasnt like he used to get them out and read them all the time. He could just never bring himself to throw them away, a friend of Hince told the Sun tabloid.        
	But now Kates found them shes gone through the roof. She has demanded to know why Jamie had all these reminders of a past relationship, he added.         
	Friends close to Hince claim that Moss has always been uncomfortable about his relationship with Sharin, whom he dated in 2004.

	Kathmandu, Oct. 23: The Maoists plan to assimilate their soldiers into the Nepal Army suffered a serious setback today after the Opposition Nepali Congress party strongly opposed the move to appoint a former rebel as the head of the integration committee.         
	According to the Congress vice-president, Ram Chandra Poudel, the decision to pull out of the panel was taken after the Maoists nominated Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) chief Nand Kishore Pun as its chairman.         
	Pun, who is more well known by the nom de guerre Pasang, took over the top PLA post after former Maoist chief Prachanda became Prime Minister.         
	Poudel informed Prachanda about the Congress decision and said his party would strongly oppose the Maoist move. We feel that a non-Maoist representative should be made the committee chairman. Alternatively, a rotating system can be adopted, he said. Poudel said the Congress would not be part of the panel if its demand was not met.        
	Following the Nepali Congress objection, Prachanda postponed a crucial cabinet meeting which was supposed to formally approve the integration committees proposal. The cabinet will meet tomorrow to discuss the issue,he told reporters.

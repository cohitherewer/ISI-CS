	Paul pitch for roos    
	 Canberra, March 12 (Reuters): A British animal protection group is using the face of former Beatle Paul McCartney in an international campaign against a planned cull of hundreds of kangaroos on an Australian military base.      
	As demonstrators today promised human shields to protect the animals, McCartney appeared on a website set up by the British animal welfare group Viva! (www.viva.org.uk) to condemn the cull of up to 500 animals using tranquilliser darts and lethal injection.      
	There is an urgent need for action to protect kangaroos from a barbaric industry which slaughters them for meat and leather, McCartney said in an undated message. Please do all you can to help Viva! end this shameful massacre. Authorities say the eastern grey kangaroos, which feature on Australias coat of arms, threaten other local species through overgrazing.    
	Skull and bones in luggage    
	 Munich (Reuters): Two Italian women carrying the remains of a man who died in Brazil 11 years ago in their luggage were stopped by Munich airport police during a stopover on their journey from Sao Paulo to Naples. Airport security spotted the skull and bones when the suitcase was put through the X-Ray machine, police said. One of the women was the dead mans sister and she explained to surprised officials that it had been her brothers wish to be buried in Italy. After showing his death certificate, the Italians, aged 63 and 62, were allowed on their next flight to Naples. We questioned the women and they produced a valid death certificate showing he had died 11 years ago of natural causes. As they were not violating any German laws they were allowed to continue their journey to Italy.

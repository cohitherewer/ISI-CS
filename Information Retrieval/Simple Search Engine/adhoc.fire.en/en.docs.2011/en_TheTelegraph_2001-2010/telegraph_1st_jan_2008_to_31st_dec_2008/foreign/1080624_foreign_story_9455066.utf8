                              Major setback                            
	Islamabad, June 23 (AP): Pakistans most popular politician, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, suffered a major political setback today when a court ruled him ineligible to run in the coming parliamentary byelections.        
	The decision was likely to deepen a rift between Sharif and his partner Asif Ali Zardari of the Pakistan peoples Party (PPP) in the governing coalition over reinstating fired judges and could further destabilise the government in a nation seen as an important ally in the US-led war on terror.        
	This ruling will undermine, in a major way, the effort for national reconciliation, said Nasim Zehra, an analyst and fellow at Harvard Universitys Asia Center. It is not a politically sustainable judgment.        
	Sharif had been barred from running in February elections because of convictions related to his ouster in a 1999 coup, which was led by the current President, Pervez Musharraf. Earlier this month, the nations election commission effectively cleared him to run in byelections scheduled for Thursday after a tribunal set up to decide the matter failed to reach consensus.        
	However, the Lahore high court, acting on a petition from a candidate and a voter, ruled today that Sharif was ineligible to run for parliament, a decision that also barred the bitter Musharraf opponent from serving as Prime Minister.        
	Sharifs allies were furious, with dozens chanting: Go Musharraf go outside the court and angry lawmakers walking out of the provincial Assembly in protest, according to television reports.        
	About 100 Sharif supporters in Multan burned tyres in the street.        
	Ahsan Iqbal, a spokesman for Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party, said the ruling made Pakistan look like a banana republic, and he lashed out at Asif Ali Zardari. The two party leaders have had sharp disagreements over how to reinstate dozens of senior judges that Musharraf fired during a state of emergency last year. Sharif, who pulled his members from the cabinet over the rift, has demanded the government immediately restore the judges to the bench and remove their replacements, who he says are pawns of Musharraf.        
	Zardari, the husband of slain leader Benazir Bhutto, has sought to link the return of the judges to constitutional reforms that could take months to pass and has called for keeping the replacement judges on the bench along with their predecessors.        
	Speaking on Dawn TV, Iqbal asked how, in the wake of todays court ruling, Zardaris party could let the courts continue to play mockery with democracy in this country, continue to play mockery with the fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan.        
	Farhatullah Babar, a spokesman for Zardaris party, said he was disappointed with the ruling, but thought it might spur the parties to sort out their dispute over the judges.        
	Ashtar Ausaf, Sharifs lawyer, told Dawn News TV that the court handled the case in a slipshod manner and disposed of it in just three hours.

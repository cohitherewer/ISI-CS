The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jittery Pakistan smells an India-US axis
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Jittery Pakistan smells an India-US axis

	Islamabad, Nov. 23: A redrawn map of South Asia has been making the rounds among Pakistani elites. It shows their country truncated, reduced to an elongated sliver of land with the big bulk of India to the east, and an enlarged Afghanistan to the west.        
	That the map was first circulated as a theoretical exercise in some American neoconservative circles matters little here. It has fuelled a belief among Pakistanis, including members of the armed forces, that what the US really wants is the breakup of Pakistan, the only Muslim country with nuclear arms.        
	One of the biggest fears of the Pakistani military planners is the collaboration between India and Afghanistan to destroy Pakistan, said a senior Pakistani government official involved in strategic planning. Some people feel the United States is colluding in this.        
	That notion may strike Americans as strange coming from an ally of 50 years. But as the incoming Obama administration tries to coax greater cooperation from Pakistan in the fight against militancy, it can hardly be ignored.        
	This is a country where years of weak governance have left ample room for conspiracy theories of every kind.        
	Pakistan is a collection of just four provinces, which often seem to have little in common. Virtually every one of its borders is disputed with its neighbours.        
	These facts and the insecurities that flow from them inform many of Pakistans disagreements with the US, including differences over the need to rein in militancy in the form of al Qaida and the Taliban.        
	The new democratically elected President, Asif Ali Zardari, has visited the US twice since assuming power three months ago. He has been generous in his praise of the Bush administration. But that stance is criticised at home as fawning and wins him little popularity among a steadfastly anti-American public.        
	So how will the promise by President-elect Barack Obama for a new start between the US and Pakistan be received here? How can it be begun?        
	One possibility could be some effort to ease Pakistani anxieties, even as the US demands more from Pakistan. That will probably mean a regional approach to what, it is increasingly apparent, are regional problems. There, Pakistani and American interests may coincide.         
	American military commanders have started to argue forcefully that the solution to the conflict in Afghanistan must involve a wide array of neighbours.        
	Obama has said much the same. Several times in his campaign, he laid out the crux of his thinking. Reducing tensions between Pakistan and India would allow Pakistan to focus on the real threat  the Qaida and Taliban militants who are tearing at the very fabric of the country.        
	If Pakistan can look towards the east with confidence, it will be less likely to believe its interests are best advanced through cooperation with the Taliban, Obama has written in Foreign Affairs magazine.

	Kathmandu, Dec. 22 (Reuters): The UN and the US today criticised a weekend attack by activists on a Nepali publishing house in which witnesses said journalists were beaten and the office ransacked.        
	About 50 activists, self-described supporters of Nepals ruling Maoist party, went to the office of Himalmedia, publishers of the weekly English-language Nepali Times and other magazines, and broke windowpanes before beating staff yesterday. The activists said they were angry at critical coverage.        
	This is a direct attack on free press and democracy, said Kunda Dixit, editor of the weekly. Some staff received minor injuries, he said. About 300 journalists and human rights activists marched through Kathmandu today to protest against the attack.        
	The US and the Nepal office of the UN human rights agency condemned the attack and urged authorities to investigate the incident. There is no justification for the use of violence and intimidation by any party or organisation.

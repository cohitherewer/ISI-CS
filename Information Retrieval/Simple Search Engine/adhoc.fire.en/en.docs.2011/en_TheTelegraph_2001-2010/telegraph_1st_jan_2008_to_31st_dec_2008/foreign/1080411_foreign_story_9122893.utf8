          ANITA SINGH                          Elton John and Hillary Clinton in New York. (AP)                                  
	London, April 10: Sir Elton John has staged a fundraising concert for US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton and claimed that the misogynistic attitudes of Americans may be hindering her bid for the White House.         
	The star, an ardent Clinton supporter, raised $2.5 million (1.25 million) for her campaign with the gig at New Yorks Radio City Music Hall.        
	Ive always been a Hillary supporter. There is no-one more qualified to lead America, he told the audience.        
	But he added: Im amazed by the misogynistic attitudes of some of the people in this country. And I say to hell with them... I love you Hillary.         
	Clinton struck a defiant note when she took to the stage to address the crowd. The New York senator echoed the title of one of Sir Eltons hits as she said: What I want you to know is: Im still standing. The British singer explained: The reason Im here tonight is to play music but, more importantly, as someone who comes from abroad and is in America quite a lot of the time and is extremely interested in the political process because it affects the world.

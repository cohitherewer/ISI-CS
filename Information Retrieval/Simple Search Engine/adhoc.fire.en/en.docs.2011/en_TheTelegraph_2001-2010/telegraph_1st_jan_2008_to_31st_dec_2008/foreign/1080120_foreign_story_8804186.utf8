 - Islamic terror cell busted
                   
	Madrid, Jan. 19 (Agencies): Two Indians and 12 Pakistanis were arrested by Spanish police today after it claimed to have smashed a suspected Islamic terrorist cell that was plotting an attack in the northeastern city of Barcelona.
    
	Spains interior minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told a news conference that civil guard police found explosives and other equipment during raids on five addresses in Spains second city and arrested the suspects after receiving information from its own and other European intelligence agencies.
    
	Spains leading daily El Pais reported on its website (www.elpais.com) that Spanish authorities have warned France, Portugal and Britain of the possibility of attacks on Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf during his visit to Europe next week.
    
	The Spanish interior minister, however, did not give the names of those arrested in the overnight raids in Barcelona. 
    
	The arrests come less than two months before Spanish national elections, whose last vote in March 2004 was held after Europes worst terror attack when four Madrid trains were bombed, killing 191 commuters and wounding a further 1,800 .
    
	There are fears that Islamic militants could try a similar plot to disrupt this years vote, scheduled for March 9.
    
	The interior minister gave no details on what sort of an attack was allegedly being plotted, but said authorities found four timers in some of the suspects homes.
    
	When someone has timers at home you have no option but to think violent acts are being planned, he said, adding that more arrests were expected and the country was on high security alert. Rubalcaba made no mention of Musharraf in his news conference. He was not scheduled to visit Spain.
    
	Rubalcaba said todays raids were distinct from a number of operations against Islamic militants in recent years which largely targeted groups that sought to finance radical groups or recruit members to fight.
    
	Rubalcaba said the group, which had stockpiled bomb-making materials including timers, ball-bearings and batteries, had been ready to act. Computers were also seized during the raid in the old district of Raval just after midnight. 
    
	The operation is continuing and Spain remains on a high level of alert against possible attacks.

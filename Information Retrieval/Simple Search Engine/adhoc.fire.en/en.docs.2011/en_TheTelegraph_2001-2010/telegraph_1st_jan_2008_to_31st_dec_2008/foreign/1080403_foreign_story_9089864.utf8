The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mariah goes past Elvis in most number one hits
                                                                                                               Mariah goes past Elvis in most number one hits
                              Second only to the beatles                            
	Los Angeles, April 2 (AP): With her 18th chart-topper Touch My Body, Mariah Carey has passed Elvis Presley for the most number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, and is now second only to the Beatles.        
	But while the diva was in full celebration mode after learning of her latest milestone, she was also quick to put her accomplishment in perspective. I really can never put myself in the category of people who have not only revolutionised music but also changed the world, Carey told The Associated Press yesterday via phone from London. Thats a completely different era and time... Im just feeling really happy and grateful.        
	Careys single is the new number one single on Billboards Hot 100 singles chart: The song also is number one on the trade magazines digital download chart thanks to a precedent-setting 286,000 downloads in its debut week. She had been tied with Presley with 17 number one singles; the Beatles are the all-time leaders with 20 (Madonna also beat a Presley record this week, surpassing the King for the most top 40 hits with her 37th for her hit 4 Minutes.)        
	Carey said being in such company was gratifying not only because of her personal success, but what it meant for women and minorities.         
	For me, in my mind the accomplishment is just that much sweeter, she said. In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me its about saying: Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.        
	Touch My Body is the first single off Careys upcoming album EMC2, due out April 16. It is the follow-up to her Grammy-winning disc The Emancipation of Mimi, released in 2005, that years best-selling album with five million copies sold; it marked a huge comeback for the multiplatinum superstar after personal and professional setbacks.        
	Like that album, Carey said EMC2 continues her sense of freedom and rebirth: Its like emancipation of Mariah Carey to the second power and beyond.        
	 Carey, 38, said this is the most enjoyable point of her nearly two-decade old career, and thats her priority these days, not trying to set sales records or even making pop history. Ive gone through enough of my life worrying about that kind if thing, said Carey.        
	I want to encourage anyone else out there who feels like maybe they cant overcome an obstacle, I feel like Im living proof ... never lose your faith, she added. Im seriously a grateful individual right now.

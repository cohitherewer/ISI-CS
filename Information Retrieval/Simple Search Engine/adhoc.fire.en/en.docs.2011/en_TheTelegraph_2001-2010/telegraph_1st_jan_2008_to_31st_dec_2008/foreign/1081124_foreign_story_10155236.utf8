	Islamabad, Nov. 23 (Reuters): The Pakistan government has disbanded the political wing of the ISI to focus on counter-terrorism, the foreign minister said today.        
	Often referred to by critics as a state within a state, the ISI is blamed by India for several terror attacks. Pakistans civilian leaders have suspected the ISI of involvement in the overthrow of their governments in the past.        
	Foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan, said the political wing of the agency had been disbanded, describing it as a positive development.

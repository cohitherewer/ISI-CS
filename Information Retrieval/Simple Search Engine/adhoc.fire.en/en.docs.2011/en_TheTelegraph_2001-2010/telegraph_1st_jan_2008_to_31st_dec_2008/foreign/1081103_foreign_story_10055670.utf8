The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | In crisis, a few Brownie points
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In crisis, a few Brownie points
          AMIT ROY                          Brown at the King Saud University in Riyadh on Sunday. (AP)                                  
	London, Nov. 2: The current economic crisis has allowed one politician to come back from the dead  British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.         
	Only last April, Labour peer Lord Meghnad Desai had reflected the growing disenchantment within his own party and the pressure for Brown to stand down with the cruel jibe: Gordon Brown was put on earth to remind people how good Tony Blair was.         
	But yesterday Desai acknowledged: What Gordon Brown is good at is being able to deal with an international crisis.         
	And to prove how spot on this observation is Brown gave a series of confident interviews today after talks in Riyadh with King Abdullah in which the British Prime Minister claimed he had persuaded the Saudis to pump new money into the International Monetary Fund to prop up countries that were apprehensive about defaulting.         
	Iceland, Hungary and Ukraine have already been allocated some $30bn, with Pakistan expected to follow suit by requesting aid.         
	Asked whether he thought the Gulf states would now hand over some of the one trillion dollar windfall they have reaped from soaring oil prices, Brown responded: Yes, I think people want to invest both in helping the world get through this very difficult period of time. The Saudis will, I think, contribute, so we can have a bigger fund worldwide.         
	The Indian economy, too, would benefit from stable oil prices.         
	For Brown, being able to command the international stage, is helping him to rescue his domestic rating from what appeared a hopeless situation before the start of the global crisis.         
	Commenting on the Tory lead over Labour being reduced from between 25 per cent and 20 per cent to around nine per cent in opinion polls, Desai said he still did not think Brown was poised to win the next election.         
	But the economist added significantly: At least, this is not a meltdown  this is winnable territory.         
	Among other senior members of the Indian population in the UK, Brown has no supporter more loyal than Lord Swraj Paul, whose Caparo group is being buffeted by the sharp fall in steel prices.         
	I am sure Labour will win the next election, said Paul. He (Brown) is saying, Let the people judge me on my performance.         
	Paul stressed: Neither David Cameron nor George Osborne (the Tory leader and Shadow Chancellor respectively) has come up with another policy when the country is in turmoil.         
	As he drove off yesterday for a weekend in the Buckinghamshire countryside, now looking picture perfect in rich autumn colours, Paul explained to The Telegraph why he was being so optimistic.         
	Brown is a careful man who takes his time, said Paul. During the summer he reassessed the situation and decided there had to be a change of direction. Then the financial crisis came up and there is no Prime Minister in the world who has his experience. What he has done has become a model both for the United States and for governments in Europe.         
	What he did not want was people standing outside banks to see if their money was safe  he did not want panic, said Paul.         
	In his opinion, Brown had no option other than to use heavy government borrowing to stabilise the banks and reassure customers, Your money is safe  a policy that the Americans have since had to follow after having first allowed Lehman Brothers to go bankrupt. Brown also made cabinet changes and ensured his government looked more knitted.         
	As a result, Browns personal standing had improved. You could say the economic situation has helped him. People have realised he is a solid man.         
	Meanwhile, in another part of London, Desai and his wife, Kishwar, were preparing to fly to the island of Guernsey in the English Channel where, as de facto ambassadors for Bollywood, they were due to give lectures on the deeper meaning of the Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor starrer, Jab We Met, following a screening of the movie.         
	As a man who had been Chancellor of the Exchequer for 10 years before succeeding Blair, he has the experience, Desai now conceded.         
	Browns future depended on whether he was able to move Britain out of a short recession into a more stable economic climate. My instinct says he may go for an election before it is due in May 2010.         
	The next big test for Brown is a by-election next Thursday in Glenrothes, which borders his own seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath in Scotland. If the Scottish National Party fails to capture the seat, it will strengthen Browns still fragile recovery.         
	Labour has a 10,600 majority and should be able to hold it, perhaps by a slim majority, predicted Desai.

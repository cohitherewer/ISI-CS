The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pakistanis empty bank accounts
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Pakistanis empty bank accounts
          NASIR JAFFRY                          People gather at the site of a missile attack near Miran Shah, the main town in North Waziristan, Pakistan, on Thursday. Suspected US drones fired missiles into a madarsa set up by top Taliban commander Jalaluddin Haqqani in the tribal area bordering Afghanistan. Eleven people were killed. (AFP)                                  
	Islamabad, Oct. 23: As India faces the prospect of an economic slowdown, people across the border in Pakistan have begun taking out money from banks with the import-dependent country turning to world agencies for a bailout.        
	I had a deposit of around (Pakistan) Rupees 10 lakh in one bank, which I withdrew after hearing reports of an imminent closure of some banks, said Rawalpindi resident Naeem Haider.        
	Economists and industrialists have been repeatedly trying to assure the people they should not worry about a collapse, but figures suggest that depositors withdrew around (Pakistan) Rs 165 billion from banks from July to September.        
	The fear had been sparked by the severe liquidity crunch confronting banks, which ran short of funds in making large payments and continuing to extend credit to the private sector. Bank-to-bank lending also dried up. The central bank had to pump in (Pakistan) Rs 180 billion to commercial banks last week to tide over the crisis.         
	Pakistans crumbling economy needs billions of dollars urgently to stave off an economic meltdown and the country has turned to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and a grouping called Friends of Pakistan for immediate assistance. The country of 165 million people, racked by civilian strife on its northwestern fringes, needs a bailout package of $10-15 billion to stabilise its dwindling economy and avoid a balance of payment crisis.        
	A little over half the total would come in the form of an IMF loan while the remaining amount will be extended by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and bilateral donors, if it does not get help from the friends group.        
	We have no other option left but to approach the IMF for a bail-out package to stabilise the deteriorating macroeconomic situation, Qaisar Bengali, a Karachi-based economist, told The Telegraph.        
	Pakistans foreign exchange reserves last week touched a record low of $2.48 billion in real terms, barely enough to cater to the needs of one-and-a-half months imports.        
	This is a gift that we have been conferred by former Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, who kept painting a rosy picture for four years and focused merely on cosmetic measures, Bengali said.

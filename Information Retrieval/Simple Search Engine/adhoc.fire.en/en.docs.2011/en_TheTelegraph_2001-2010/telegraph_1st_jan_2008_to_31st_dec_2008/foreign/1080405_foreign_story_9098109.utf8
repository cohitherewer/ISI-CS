	London, April 4 (Reuters): Supermodel Naomi Campbell was released on bail pending investigation into a disturbance on a plane at Heathrows new Terminal 5, police sources said today.        
	The 37-year-old was escorted off a US-bound flight yesterday after police were called. She was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer, and later released to return on bail in late May.

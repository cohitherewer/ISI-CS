The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak admits US unhappy with ISI
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Pak admits US unhappy with ISI
                            
	Islamabad, July 31 (Reuters): The US has accused members of Pakistans main spy agency of tipping off al Qaida-linked militants before US missile attacks on targets in federally-administered tribal lands, Pakistan defence minister Ahmed Mukhtar said.        
	He openly acknowledged American mistrust of Pakistans main military spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, in remarks aired today on Pakistani television.        
	They think that there are some elements in the ISI at some level that when the government of Pakistan is informed of targets, then leak it to them (militants) at some level, Mukhtar told Geo channel in Washington. He had accompanied Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani on a maiden visit to the US.        
	This is an issue on which they were a bit annoyed.        
	The disclosure of American displeasure by a minister in the four-month-old civilian government could embarrass President Pervez Musharraf and the Pakistani military. It could also renew concerns about the stability of the nuclear armed state.        
	The US no longer gives Pakistan advance notice when it targets militants in tribal areas. The News, a Pakistani daily from the same media group as Geo, reported that Bush had asked who was controlling the ISI.        
	The spy agency is the main intelligence arm of the military, which directs its operations. However, according to the law, it reports to the Prime Minister.        
	Pakistans security apparatus consists of the ISI, the Military Intelligence, which deals solely with armed forces matters, and their civilian cousins, the Intelligence Bureau, Federal Investigation Agency and the police Special Branch.        
	Pakistan is going through a transition to civilian rule after 8 years of military-led government and the new leaders want to streamline reporting lines.

          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, July 15: A Pakistani court today asked the government to find out how detained nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan can move around freely and meet his relatives and friends.         
	I would suggest that we should look into ways to bring an end to this issue once and for all, chief justice of Islamabad high court Sardar Muhammad Aslam said during the hearing of a peition filed by Khans lawyer Iqbal Jafree. The plea challenged his illegal and unconstitutional detention over four- and-a-half years.         
	The chief justices remarks came after the government filed a written reply opposing Khans meeting relatives and friends on the ground that they could make him reveal confidential information that could damage Pakistans security.         
	I think both the government lawyers and Khans counsel should look into ways to enable the scientist to travel and move freely, meet his relatives and friends or discuss anything that he likes except proliferation, the chief justice said.         
	He adjourned the hearing till Wednesday after the two sides agreed to consult each other on the issue. We will consult each other to see that Khan gets as many concessions as possible, state lawyer Ahmar Bilal Soofi told reporters outside the court.         
	Khan has said in recent interviews that the army supervised shipment of centrifuges to North Korea in 2000.

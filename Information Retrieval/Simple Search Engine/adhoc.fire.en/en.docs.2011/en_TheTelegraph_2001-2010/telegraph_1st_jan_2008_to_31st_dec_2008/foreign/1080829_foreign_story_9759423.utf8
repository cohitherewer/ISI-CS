	Islamabad, Aug. 28 (Reuters): Pervez Musharraf is gone from the presidential palace but he is by no means forgotten on the vast Facebook online networking site, where friends and foes are fighting over his legacy.        
	The former army chief gave up the presidency last week, nine years after coming to power in a coup, rather than face an impeachment battle most analysts said he would have lost over charges of misconduct and abusing the Constitution.        
	Welcomed by many Pakistanis in the early years of his rule as a force for stability and economic progress, most turned against Musharraf after a series of political missteps.         
	But not everyone is happy hes gone. Some Facebook users say they appreciated his liberal economic policies and efforts against extremism in a country rife with violent militants. His fans include a number of young Pakistanis, many of them expatriates.        
	Thank you for all that you have done for this nation and its undeserving people, wrote Seema Ahmed from Los Angeles. Facebook fan Sherbano Ahmed said: If we as the silent majority dont speak up this time, then we would have surrendered our decency and freedom to thieves.        
	The idea that Western-style democracy is what nuclear-armed Pakistan needs also comes under fire.        
	Fixing the system with American or UK systems will be just mimickery (sic) at best that will produce great thieves or worse, third-rate actors, said Shahedah Ahmed from London.        
	Their entries are found under headings like The only hope  Musharraf and Pakistan would be lost without Musharraf.        
	The anti-Musharraf groups are equally unsubtle  Burn in hell Musharraf and I hate Musharraf. Musharrafs critics curse the staunch ally of President George W. Bush, accusing him of killing innocent people in the name of the war on terror. Busharraf is the correct name ... to be honest he should be killed in the same brutal manner the way mushy (Musharraf) killed thousands of innocent true Muslims, Sana Khan wrote.

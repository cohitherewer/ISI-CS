	Stallone vodka ad    
	 Moscow, Aug. 17 (Reuters): Sylvester Stallone, the mighty destroyer of Soviet opponents in the Rambo and Rocky movies, now plans to advertise Russian vodka.      
	Russian vodka producer Synergy said recently it had signed a one-year contract with the actor, who will appear in television and newspaper advertisements for the vodka brand Russian Ice from September 1. Sources valued the deal at $1 million. Stallone  whose film character John Rambo killed Soviet troops by the dozen in Afghanistan and whose Rocky Balboa humiliated Soviet boxer Ivan Drago  will advertise the product under the slogan: There is a bit of Russian in all of us.    
	Theme park     
	 Rome (Reuters): With the ruins of ancient Rome, the splendour of Vatican City and countless Renaissance art treasures, what does Italys capital lack to attract tourists? The answer, according to the mayors office, is a Disneyland-style theme park. The model is Euro-Disney in Paris, said deputy mayor Mauro Cutrufo, announcing plans to build a vast ancient Rome theme park just outside the city.    
	Fashion fire    
	 London: Designer bulletproof fashion is set to become the latest craze among the paranoid super-rich, reports The Sunday Telegraph. Harrods is now stocking a luxury range of ballistic daywear for patrons who fear they are in the firing line. A Columbian entrepreneur, Miguel Caballero, came up with the idea for the range as student while pondering how to protect his wealthy classmates from guerrilla revolutionaries. King Abdullah of Jordan, Venezuelas President, Hugo Chavez, and Columbias President, Alvaro Uribe, are all said to be fans of the range alongside actor Steven Segal, star of the bullet-riddled action film Under Siege. Tough enough to withstand fire from automatic weapons, the clothing is also reportedly unobtrusive enough to be worn at parties.     
	Da Vinci    
	 London: A portrait has jumped in value from 10,000 to 100m after art experts decided it was drawn by Leonardo da Vinci, reports The Sunday Telegraph. The artwork was previously attributed to an anonymous German artist, however after a year long study, experts now believe the Nuptial Portrait of a Young Woman was instead drawn by the Renaissance master. It is thought that the 500-year-old drawing was commissioned by the woman to send to a prospective husband.

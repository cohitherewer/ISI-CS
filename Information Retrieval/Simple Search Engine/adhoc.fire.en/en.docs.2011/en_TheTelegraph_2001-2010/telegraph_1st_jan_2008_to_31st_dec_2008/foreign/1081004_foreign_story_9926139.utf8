	New York, Oct. 3 (PTI): Plans to introduce a yoga programme in a New York district has been stalled after parents alleged that their children were being indoctrinated in Hindu rites.         
	The yoga programme, aimed at relieving stress at Massena Central High School, was temporarily suspended by the board of education pending further investigation into the complaints by some parents.         
	Board president Julie L. Reagan, however, defended the classes for students, insisting that it is not a hidden religious programme.

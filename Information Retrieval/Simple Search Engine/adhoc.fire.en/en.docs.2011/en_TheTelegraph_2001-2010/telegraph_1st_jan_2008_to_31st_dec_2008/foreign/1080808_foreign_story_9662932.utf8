          CHRIS IRVINE                          Ledger as the Joker in The Dark Knight                                  
	London, Aug. 7: The investigation into Heath Ledgers death has been closed after prosecutors decided not to pursue a criminal case.         
	Prosecutors in the US attorneys office in New York had been overseeing a Drug Enforcement Administration investigation into whether the painkillers found in Ledgers body  oxycodone and hydrocodone  were obtained illegally. But the prosecutors have dropped the case as they dont believe theres a viable target.        
	The decision comes after recent it was reported that actress Mary-Kate Olsen was demanding immunity before answering questions about the death of her close friend and his drug use.        
	Reports claim she was the first person called by a masseuse who found the 28-year-old Dark Knight actor dead in his Manhattan apartment.        
	The DEA had obtained a subpoena that would have forced Olsen to talk, but it is no longer valid because it depended on prosecutors pursuing the case  although it could still be revived if evidence of a crime emerges.        
	Other drugs in his system included anti-anxiety medication and sleeping pills which were prescribed legally by doctors in California and Texas. It would appear that a combination of the drugs, and not an excess of any one drug in particular, killed the star.        
	Ledgers body was discovered on January 22 by the masseuse who police say spent nine minutes making three calls to Olsen before dialling 911 for help, then called her again after paramedics arrived.        
	At some point, Olsen, who was in California, summoned her personal security guards to the apartment to help.        
	Ledger was nominated for an Oscar for his role as a gay cowboy in 2005s Brokeback Mountain. His portrayal of The Joker in Batman sequel The Dark Knight has been earning rave reviews.        
	Having been nominated for an Oscar for his performance in Brokeback Mountain, Ledger is tipped to win a post-humus gong at next years awards for his critically-acclaimed role in Dark Knight.

	Beichuan, China, May 18 (AP): China declared three days of national mourning for earthquake victims and ordered a suspension of the Olympic torch relay as the search for survivors of the disaster grew bleak today.        
	The State Council, Chinas cabinet, said the mourning period would start tomorrow and include three minutes of silence observed by citizens nationwide  exactly a week after the magnitude 7.9 quake struck China  while horns of vehicles, trains, ships and air raid sirens wail in grief.        
	All national flags will fly at half-staff at home and at Chinese diplomatic missions abroad, and public recreational activities will be halted, the council said.        
	Beijing Olympic organisers said in a statement that the torch relay would also be suspended for three days to express our deep mourning to the victims of the earthquake.        
	The relay had already resumed last week after the quake on a more somber note, with runners starting with a minute of silence and asking for donations along the route. Organisers have said the relay will go on as planned in quake-hit Sichuan province next month.        
	In the disaster zone, efforts appeared to shift today from searching for buried survivors to clearing corpses from shattered buildings as the government said the confirmed death toll rose to 32,476.        
	Another 220,109 people suffered injuries, according to a statement from the State Council. The government has said it expects the final death toll will surpass 50,000.        
	Near the quakes epicentre, few hopeful relatives were seen in Beichuan, where several dozen corpses in blue body bags lay in a street. Soldiers regularly pulled more dead from the wreckage.        
	Pandas missing        
	Three giant pandas are missing from the worlds most famous panda reserve after the earthquake, Chinese state media reported today.        
	All the pandas at the Wolong Nature Reserve were at first reported safe.         
	The reserves 60 other giant pandas are safe, but five staff members of the reserve were killed in the quake.

	Kathmandu, Jan. 15 (AP): Nepal plans to name the only airport in the Mount Everest region at Lukla as Tenzing-Hillary airport after Sir Edmund Hillary and his climbing partner, Tenzing Norgay, who scaled the 8,850-metre summit of Mount Everest on May 29, 1953.
    
	Lukla airport, situated at 2,800 metres, serves as the gateway for thousands of trekkers and mountaineers going to the Everest region.
    
	Gurung was speaking at a memorial ceremony held by the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in Kathmandu today. He said there were also other proposals to establish an annual award in Hillarys name and establish a trekking route in their honour in the Everest region.
    
	Hillary died on Friday of a heart attack at the age of 88.His death has been mourned in Nepal, where he spent much time helping the people in the foothills of the worlds highest mountain.Following his famous climb, Hillary returned to Nepal several times and founded the Himalayan Trust, which has built 27 schools,two hospitals and 12 clinics around Mount Everest.
    
	 Thousands of people have benefited from the trusts projects, andthe Sherpa community reveres Hillary as a result.

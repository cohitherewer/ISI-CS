	London, Jan. 21 (Reuters): Millions of British men buy their underpants from Marks and Spencer  and one of them is not happy.
    
	Jeremy Paxman, feared presenter of the BBCs Newsnight programme, has got his knickers in a twist over what he sees as falling standards and lack of gusset support.
    
	Such was his frustration, the 57 year-old presenter, outlined his complaint in an email to M amp;S chief executive Stuart Rose.
    
	Although the company refutes his claims, Rose responded and the pair will meet in the next few weeks to discuss the topic over lunch, a M amp;S spokeswoman confirmed.
    
	Like very large numbers of men in this country I have always bought my socks and pants at Marks amp; Sparks, Paxman said in the email  leaked in the Mail on Sunday. 
    
	Ive noticed that something very troubling has happened. Theres no other way to put this. Their pants no longer provide adequate support.
    
	Paxman said he is not alone.
    
	When Ive discussed this with friends and acquaintances it has revealed widespread gusset anxiety, he wrote.
    
	Socks too are a cause for concern. Paxman said they are wearing out around the big toe quicker these days and fall down more easily because of the lack of ribbing at the top. These are matters of great concern.

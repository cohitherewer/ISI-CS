	Baghdad, Dec. 19 (AP): The Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at President George W. Bush during a news conference was beaten afterward and had bruises on his face and around his eyes, a judge said today.        
	Judge Dhia al-Kinani, the magistrate investigating the incident, said the court has opened an investigation into the alleged beating of journalist Muntadhar al-Zeidi. He was wrestled to the ground after throwing his shoes during the news conference on Sunday. There have been conflicting claims on hiscondition since then. One of his brothers said he was harshly beaten.

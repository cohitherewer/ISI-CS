	Kathmandu, May 29: Hours after the Constituent Assembly declared Nepal a republic the government removed the flag of the Shah dynasty from atop the Naryanhitti Palace and replaced it with the national flag thereby giving a symbolic burial to the 239-year old institution of monarchy.        
	The royal flag bearing the crest and coat of arms of the Shahs was removed as hundreds of people who had assembled on the busy Durbar Marg area cheered and shouted slogans hailing a republican Nepal asking the deposed monarch Gyanendra to vacate the palace immediately.        
	The palace staff thereafter hoisted the national flag even as excited crowds tried to break into the palace where Gyanendra continues to live with his wife and mother.        
	The celebrations outside the palace turned unruly forcing the riot police to cane charge the people causing injuries to several of them. The police also lobbed tear gas shells to disperse the crowds and bring the situation under control.         
	The Constituent Assembly had late last night declared Nepal a federal democratic republic and instructed the government to order Gyanendra to vacate the palace within 15 days. The assembly also passed a motion introduced by the government to convert the sprawling palace into a national museum.

	London, Aug. 24: Margaret Thatchers daughter Carol has revealed details of her mothers struggle with dementia for the first time.         
	In her new book, Carol Thatcher tells of her pain at having to repeatedly break the truly awful news of her father Denis death to her mother until the information sank in.         
	In her book, A Swim-On Part in the Goldfish Bowl: A Memoir, she wrote how her mothers blotting-paper brain which had always absorbed information got confused between Bosnia and the Falklands during a conversation about the war in the former Yugoslavia.         
	She wrote: I almost fell off my chair. Watching her struggle with her words and her memory, I couldnt believe it. She was in her 75th year but I had always thought of her as ageless, timeless and 100 per cent cast-iron damage-proof.         
	The contrast was all the more striking because, until that point, shed always had a memory like a website.         
	In the book, serialised in a Sunday newspaper, Carol added: From the fateful day of our lunch, telltale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge.         
	Whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice, because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank, Mum started asking the same questions over and over again, unaware she was doing so.         
	It might be something innocuous  such as What time is my car coming? or When am I going to the hairdresser?  but the fact she needed to repeat them opened a new and frightening chapter in our lives. I had to learn to be patient... I also had to learn she had an illness and that it wasnt personal.         
	Thats the worst thing about dementia: it gets you every time. Sufferers look and act the same but beneath the familiar exterior something quite different is going on.         
	Recalling Denis death from pancreatic cancer in 2003, she said: Losing Dad... was truly awful for Mum, not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead. I had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again.         
	Every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years, shed look at me sadly and say Oh, as I struggled to compose myself. Were we all there? shed ask softly.         
	The former Conservative Prime Minister, 82, has kept a low profile in recent years and her doctor advised her to stop making public speeches on health grounds.         
	But she made a rare return to the limelight when she visited her old Downing Street domain as a guest of Gordon Brown in September last year and attended this years Wimbledon tennis tournament.         
	Carol said her mother still had a good memory of her time in office at No 10 as if her dementia had sharpened her powers of long-term recall.

          JONATHAN WYNNE-JONES                          Rowan Williams                                  
	London, June 22: The Church of England will be thrown into turmoil this summer following the decision of leading bishops to boycott a landmark Anglican summit in protest of the presence of pro-gay bishops.         
	In a move that marks a significant split in the established Church, at least three bishops, including Michael Nazir-Ali, the Bishop of Rochester, will decline an invitation from Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to attend the Lambeth Conference.         
	Up to six more bishops are understood to be considering similar action because of Williamss decision to allow controversial figures to be at the gathering of worldwide Anglican bishops, which meets only once in 10 years.         
	The boycott will intensify the row over gay clergy, which was reignited when The Sunday Telegraph disclosed last week that two gay priests had exchanged vows in a version of the marriage service.         
	It threatens to undermine the authority of the Archbishop, who is battling to maintain unity in the Church in the face of bitter rows over homosexuality and women bishops.         
	He has already been snubbed by 250 Anglican bishops, mainly from Africa, who are meeting this week at a rival conference in Jerusalem, but the absence of English bishops would be a highly significant development for the future of the Church of England.         
	Six bishops and about 60 clergy from the Church of England will be at this weeks meeting of conservatives, the Global Anglican Future Conference, at which Bishop Nazir-Ali will deliver a key-note address on the way ahead for the Anglican communion.         
	He will not go to the Lambeth Conference, however, as he believes that it has been compromised by the inclusion of American leaders who consecrated the Anglican communions first gay bishop.         
	Friends of Bishop Nazir-Ali, who is one of the most prominent and influential figures in the Church, said he has made the decision on a matter of principle. He considers the Americans action to have been unscriptural and disobedient, and feels unable to meet those he holds responsible for causing the schism in the worldwide church.         
	The Lambeth Conference is a Eucharistic gathering where the bishops gather around the Lords table to teach the common faith, and he doesnt see how he can do this, said a friend of the bishop.         
	Bishop Nazir-Ali was said to be surprised that the American bishops were invited to the meeting despite a recommendation in an official report, the Windsor report, that they should be excluded. The bishop does not intend his absence to be seen as an act of disloyalty to the archbishop, but rather as an attempt to stand for the traditional teaching of the Church.         
	Pete Broadbent, the Bishop of Willesden, and Wallace Benn, the Bishop of Lewes, will also be absent.

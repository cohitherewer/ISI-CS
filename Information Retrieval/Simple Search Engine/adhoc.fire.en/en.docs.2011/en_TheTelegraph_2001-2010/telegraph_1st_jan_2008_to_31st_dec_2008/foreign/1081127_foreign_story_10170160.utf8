	Bangkok, Nov. 26 (Agencies): Anti-government protesters shut down Bangkoks Suvarnabhumi airport today as Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat rejected his army chiefs call to resign.        
	Runways at the Suvarnabhumi airport remained inactive with all flights in and out of Bangkok cancelled, leaving thousands of passengers, including some Indians, stranded. The Bangkok civil court ordered the protesters to end the siege. It granted an injunction sought by the airport operator, saying that the protests had infringed on peoples rights.         
	The Peoples Alliance for Democracy, which is running a four-month campaign to topple the Somchai regime, said it would maintain its siege of the airport and urged the military to intervene and remove the government. We sympathise with the passengers but this is a necessary move to save the nation, protest leader Sondhi Limthongkul said on a makeshift stage amid applause. If he doesnt resign, I will not leave.        
	Tempers frayed at the airport, a major hub in Asia that averages 700 flights a day. I understand nothing, nothing, nothing, said French tourist Denis Hapard. We dont understand whats happening. Were really upset.        
	Protesters distributed flyers trying to explain their action. After reading the flyer, Clay Judd, 30, of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, said he didnt know what to make of the situation. For us to be upset because we cant have a huge turkey dinner  so what? Judd said.

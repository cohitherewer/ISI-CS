	Islamabad, April 16 (AP): Pakistan hosted its leg of the Beijing Olympic torch relay today in an invitation-only event guarded by tight security imposed by the pro-China government.        
	Clearly worried about the possibility of protests or even a terror attack on the high-profile ceremony, thousands of police aided by sniffer dogs stood guard.        
	Televised live  the only way the general public could watch  the relay looked almost like a practice run as runners carried the flame around the perimetre of Jinnah Stadium, Islamabads main sports complex.        
	Most of the sparse crowd, including President Pervez Musharraf, fresh from a six-day trip to China, and a raft of school children sat on review stands.        
	Protests against Chinas human rights record have marred the torchs passage through western cities, and Pakistan has gone to great lengths to avoid any repeat during the Olympic symbols 22-hour stay en route to Beijing.        
	The original plans for carrying the torch along a 3-km route from the white-marble parliament in Pakistans capital were scotched.        
	Colonel Baseer Haider, an army official helping organise the event, said the route change was made because of the overall security environment and the risk of bad weather. A violent hailstorm hit Islamabad yesterday, but weather was fine today.        
	Police, many carrying guns, surrounded the stadium, where soldiers manned the main gate and checked vehicles with sniffer dogs. Only guests with invitation cards issued by the Pakistan Olympic Association were being allowed in.        
	There is absolutely no chance of any trouble, any protest against it, Mohammed Yahya, an event coordinator from the Pakistan Olympic Association, said.        
	A plane carrying the torch from Oman landed at the military section of Islamabad airport amid tight security early today.         
	The Pakistan Olympic Association urged broadcasters using state TV coverage of the torch to avoid negative comments and make no mention of the conflict in Tibet.

	Dhaka, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Supporters of Bangladeshs detained former Prime Minister, Begum Khaleda Zia, went on a rampage in Dhaka today, burning and damaging vehicles.        
	One man was killed and nine were injured, police said.         
	The protesters were demanding that the countrys army-backed interim administration allow Khaledas ailing son to go abroad for medical treatment.        
	Both Khaleda and Tarique Rahman, her son and likely political heir, have been under detention for more than a year and face charges of graft and abuse of power.        
	The victim, a trader, died after he was hit by metal pieces from a natural gas-powered vehicle that exploded after the crowd set it on fire, police said.        
	The protests began after television channels reported that Tarique had stumbled and hurt himself in a Dhaka hospital where he was being treated for a broken spinal chord.        
	Riot police took up positions in all the entrances of the sprawling Dhaka University, where the protests erupted today. Witnesses said calm was restored later but the area remained tense as police tightened security around the campus.        
	Doctors had earlier urged Bangladeshs army-backed interim government to allow Tarique to travel abroad for medical treatment. Tarique, who is too weak to walk without help, fell on the floor of a toilet and hurt his head. He is receiving treatment, a doctor at the hospital told reporters.

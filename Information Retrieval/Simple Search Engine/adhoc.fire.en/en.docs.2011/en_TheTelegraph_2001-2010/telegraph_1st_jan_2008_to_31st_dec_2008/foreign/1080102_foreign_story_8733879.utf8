                                                                                                            Airline services threat
                            
	New York, Jan. 1 (PTI): A new law, which came into force today, will penalise airlines heavily if they fail to provide adequate services to passengers stuck on the airport tarmac.        
	The law  first of its kind in the US  would make it compulsory for airlines operating in the New York state to provide water, snacks, fresh air and working toilet facilities to passengers struck on tarmac in a plane for more than three hours.         
	However, it does not force the carrier to take passengers off the plane as deplanements are not within the jurisdiction of the state.        
	 It would also require the carrier to explain to the stranded passengers their rights and way to file a complaint.         
	The carriers found violating the law could be fined $1,000 per passenger.        
	 The law also provides setting up an office of airline consumer advocate within the Consumer Protection Board. The advocate would refer any violations to the state attorney generals office, which can seek civil penalties.        
	 The law has stood the test of judicial review. A federal judge in Albany, capital of New York state, has already rejected the challenge mounted by the Air Transport Association, an airline industry group, and that could encourage other states to write similar laws.        
	The law was formulated after a series of lengthy delays during which passengers were confined in planes for several hours in some cases without food, water and with overflowing toilets.

	London, Sept. 1: A macho Vladimir Putin was lauded by Russian media for supposedly saving a TV crew from a grisly death at the jaws of a Siberian tiger.         
	The Russian Prime Minister was visiting the Ussuri reserve in Siberia, observing how researchers monitor the tigers in the wild, when a trapped beast escaped and charged towards a nearby camera crew. Putin apparently quickly shot the beast and sedated it with a tranquiliser gun.         
	Vladimir Putin not only managed to see the giant predator up close but also saved our television crew too, a presenter on Rossiya television said at the start of the main evening news.         
	Footage of the former KGB spy, who cultivated a macho image during his eight years as the Kremlin chief, showed him striding through the taiga in camouflage and desert boots before grappling with the tiger.         
	Putin helped measure the Amur tigers incisors before placing a satellite transmitter around the neck of the beast, which can weigh up to 450 kg.        
	The scenes were reminiscent of the photographs released last year that showed the leader stripped to the waist in a series of macho hunting poses.        
	The Amur tiger, the worlds biggest wild cat, has recently pounced back from the brink of extinction to hit its highest population level for at least 100 years, the WWF said last year.         
	Putin thanked Western researchers for being involved in programmes to save the Amur tigers.

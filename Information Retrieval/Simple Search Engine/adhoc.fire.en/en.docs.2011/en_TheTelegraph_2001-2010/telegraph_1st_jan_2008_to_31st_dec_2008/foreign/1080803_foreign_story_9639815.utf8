	Washington, Aug. 2: Turns out, it is a small world.        
	The small world theory, embodied in the old saying that there are just six degrees of separation between any two strangers on Earth, has been largely corroborated by a massive study of electronic communication.        
	With records of 30 billion electronic conversations among 180 million people from around the world, researchers have concluded that any two people on average are distanced by just 6.6 degrees of separation.        
	The database covered all of the Microsoft Messenger instant-messaging network in June 2006, or roughly half the worlds instant-messaging traffic at that time, researchers said. To me, it was pretty shocking. What were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity, said Eric Horvitz, a Microsoft researcher who conducted the study with Jure Leskovec.         
	In recent years, the massive databases yielded by mobile phone records have been exploited by researchers to better understand human movements and social networks. Stripped of text messages and personally identifiable information, the records indicate users location and patterns of contact.        
	The Microsoft research focused on the popular concept that has inspired games such as Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon and a well-known play by John Guare. A degree of separation is a measure of social distance between people. You are one degree away from everyone you know, two degrees away from everyone they know, and so on.        
	But proof of the theory has been thin.        
	Its origins lie in the work done in the Sixties by Stanley Milgram and Jeffrey Travers. In an oft-cited 1969 work, they put the figure at 6.2, though they never referred to it as degrees of separation. Their finding was based on asking 296 people in Nebraska and Boston to send a letters to a Boston stockbroker.        
	The subjects were told to send the letter to an acquaintance who could best advance the letter to the target, but most failed: Only 64 of the original 296 letters reached the stockbroker. Of those letter chains that were complete, the average number of degrees of separation was 6.2. The Microsoft Messenger project went further. For the purposes of their experiment, two people were considered to be acquaintances if they had sent one another a text message.         
	The researchers looked at the minimum chain lengths it would take to connect 180 billion different pairs of users in the database. They found that the average length was 6.6 steps and that 78 per cent of the pairs could be connected in seven hops or less.

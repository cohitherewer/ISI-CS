The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kenya church torched
                                                                                                            Kenya church torched
                            
	Nairobi, Jan. 1 (Reuters): A mob torched a Kenyan church today, killing villagers cowering inside, as the death toll from ethnic riots triggered by President Mwai Kibakis disputed re-election soared to at least 180.        
	The Opposition put the toll at about 250 deaths.        
	In the most grisly incident, as many as 30 people died when fire engulfed a church near Eldoret town where 200 members of Kibakis Kikuyu tribe had taken refuge in fear of their lives. A reporter and a senior security official said the fire at the Kenya Assemblies of God Pentecostal church had been deliberately started by a gang of youths.        
	The local reporter who visited the smouldering wreckage of the church in the fertile Rift Valley province said he saw up to 15 bodies crammed in a corner. They were charred. I could not look at the scene twice, said the reporter from the scene, 8 km from Eldoret.        
	He said about 200 Kikuyus were sheltering at the church after fleeing their homes.        
	Some youths came to the church. They fought with the boys who were guarding it, but they were overpowered and the youths set fire to the church, he said.        
	Another source who spoke to witnesses said about 30 people had been killed.        
	The explosion of violence in one of Africas most stable democracies and strongest economies has shocked the world and left Kenyans aghast as long-simmering tribal rivalries pitch communities against each other.        
	For Africans, the church deaths revive memories of Rwanda, where thousands were massacred seeking shelter during the 1994 genocide that killed 800,000 people.        
	Leading local newspaper, the Daily Nation, feared Kenya was on the verge of a complete melt-down.        
	Police were out in force in the capital on New Years day, and the streets were quieter. But details emerged of a rising death toll and widespread destruction in one of the countrys darkest moments since 1963 independence from Britain.        
	Washington first congratulated Kibaki  then switched that line to express concerns about irregularities.

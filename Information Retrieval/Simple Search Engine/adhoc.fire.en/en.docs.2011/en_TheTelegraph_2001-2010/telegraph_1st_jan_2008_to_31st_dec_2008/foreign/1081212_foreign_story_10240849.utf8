                                              Hasina: Poll prayers      
	Dhaka, Dec. 11 (Reuters): Bangladeshs former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today formally launched her campaign for a December 29 parliamentary election that aims at bringing the South Asian country of 140 million people back to democracy.        
	Hasina, chief of the Awamai League, one of the two leading parties contesting, said prayers at the shrines of Muslim saints in the holy northeastern city of Sylhet.        
	Separately, the Jatiya Party of former ruler, President Hossain Mohammad Ershad, announced formation of a grand alliance with Hasinas Awami League and some smaller parties.        
	The announcement came a day after Ershad had said there would be no alliance with the Awami League, but today he said the League had agreed to leave 49 seats of the 300-seat parliament for the Jatiya Partys nominees to contest.        
	Hasina left Dhaka early today in a motorcade with other party leaders amid tight security. On the way, Hasina, who ruled Bangladesh for five years until 2001, was greeted by thousands of chanting followers.        
	She waved from her bullet-proof vehicle as it entered Sylhet, 250 km from Dhaka and surrounded by hills and tea gardens.

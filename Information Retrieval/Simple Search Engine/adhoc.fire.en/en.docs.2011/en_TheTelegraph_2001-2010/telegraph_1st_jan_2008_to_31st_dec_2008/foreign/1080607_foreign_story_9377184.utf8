	Bad art for cause    
	 Vienna, June 6 (AP): Two blondes with bulging bosoms. A child crying next to a decapitated doll. A man with pipes protruding from his face.      
	Thats just a sampling of intriguing images on view in the Austrian capital that all share the same label: bad painting that makes good art.      
	Curators of the new exhibit at Viennas Museum of Modern Art, or Mumok, say the phenomenon began in the 1920s and is represented in works by celebrated 20th century artists such as Rene Magritte, Francis Picabia, and Georg Baselitz.      
	They challenge their medium by using a range of incorrect, bad or ugly approaches in order to attack and criticise it by its own means, a panel tells visitors entering the exhibit.

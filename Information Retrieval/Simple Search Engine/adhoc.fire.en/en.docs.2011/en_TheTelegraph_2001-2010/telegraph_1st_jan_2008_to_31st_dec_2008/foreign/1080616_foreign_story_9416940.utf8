	Kabul, June 15 (Reuters): Afghan President Hamid Karzai today threatened to send troops into neighbouring Pakistan to kill Taliban militants if they continued cross-border attacks into Afghanistan.        
	The self-proclaimed Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud and other Taliban officials in recent weeks have vowed to send fighters into Afghanistan for the war against Afghan and foreign forces.        
	This means that Afghanistan has the right of self defence, Karzai said in his first reaction to the threats by the militants when asked by a reporter for comment.

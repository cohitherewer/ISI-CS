	Zurich, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Masked robbers brandishing handguns stole four paintings by 19th century masters worth $164 million from a Zurich museum in Switzerlands biggest art theft, police said today.        
	Oil paintings by Cezanne, Degas, van Gogh and Monet were stolen in broad daylight yesterday from the private Buehrle Collection in the second dramatic art theft in the area within days.        
	This is the biggest robbery in Switzerland in an art museum and one of the biggest art robberies in Europe, said Peter Rueegger, head of investigations for the Zurich police.        
	Three men in dark clothing and masks, one of whom spoke German with a Slavic accent, forced their way into the museum and made off with the paintings in a white car, police said. A reward of 100,000 Swiss francs was on offer for information leading to their arrest, police added.        
	Rueegger said the Zurich robbery could be compared to the theft of Norwegian artist Edvard Munchs The Scream from the Munch Museum in Oslo nearly four years ago. That work was recovered in 2006.        
	The robbery in Switzerlands financial capital follows the theft of two Picasso paintings  Tete de Cheval, from 1962, and Verre et Pichet, from 1944  from a nearby cultural centre last week.        
	They said it was possible a white vehicle had also played a role in this incident and that they would investigate whether the two thefts were connected.        
	The four paintings stolen were:        
	- Cezannes The Boy in the Red Vest from 1890,        
	- Degass Viscount Lepic and His Daughters from 1871,        
	- Monets Poppies Near Vetheuil from 1880 and        
	- Van Goghs Blossoming Chestnut Branches from 1890, police said.        
	The Boy in the Red Vest was the museums most valuable painting, said Lukas Gloor, curator of the collection at the museum.        
	I am devastated. We had done everything we could to protect the paintings to the best of our knowledge and capability, Gloor said.         
	Police raised the value of the paintings to 180 million Swiss francs ($164.2 million) after initially saying the paintings were valued at 100 million francs. The theft occurred at the impressionist collection amassed by the late Swiss industrialist Emil Buehrle  one of the most controversial business figures of his time for selling anti-aircraft guns to Nazi Germany during World War II.        
	The Buehrle Collection, positioned near Zurichs wealthy Gold Coast chain of lakeside suburbs, boasts one of the most important assemblies of French impressionism and post-impressionism, according to its website www.buehrle.ch.        
	Buehrle collected the paintings, housed in a gated villa on the outskirts of Zurich, between 1951 and his death in 1956, according to the website.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UN envoy in Suu Kyi meet
                                                                                                               UN envoy in Suu Kyi meet
                            
	Yangon, March 8 (Reuters): Detained Myanmar Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi met the visiting UN envoy today as the military junta signalled it was in no mood to be swayed on its drive for a new Constitution.        
	A spokesman for Suu Kyis National League for Democracy party, which won a 1990 election only to be denied power by the army, declined to elaborate on the content of Suu Kyis talks in Yangon with Ibrahim Gambari.        
	However, it looks highly unlikely there will be any breakthrough in the UNs push since September to get the generals to release Suu Kyi from house arrest.

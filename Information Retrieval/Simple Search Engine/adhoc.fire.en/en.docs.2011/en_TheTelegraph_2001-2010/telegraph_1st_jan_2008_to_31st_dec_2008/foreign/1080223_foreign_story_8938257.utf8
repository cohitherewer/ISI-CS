	Islamabad, Feb. 22 (Reuters): A roadside bomb ripped through a vehicle carrying a wedding party in Pakistans northwestern valley of Swat today, killing 13 persons, officials said.        
	The vehicle was passing through Matta town when it was hit by the blast north of Mingora, the main town in Swat valley, where security forces have been battling Islamist militants for months, the officials said. Thirteen persons have been killed and several have been wounded, including women and children, in the blast, said security official Major Aurangzeb.        
	More than 450 people have been killed in militant-related violence in Pakistan since the start of the year, which intensified after the army stormed Islamabads Lal Masjid.

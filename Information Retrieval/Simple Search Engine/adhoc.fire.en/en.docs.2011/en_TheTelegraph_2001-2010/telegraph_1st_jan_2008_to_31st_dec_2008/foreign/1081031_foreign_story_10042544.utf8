	London, Oct. 30: A drink which aims to deliver the same fix as cigarettes is being launched in Britain to help smokers beat the cigarette ban in pubs.         
	The drink, called Liquid Smoking, has already proved a hit in the Netherlands.        
	Dutch suppliers United Drinks and Beauty Corporation, hopes the drink will be on sale in London before Christmas as they aim to target the opposite end of the energy drinks market. The manufacturers say it does not contain nicotine, but rather a mix of roots from South African plants which is said to give a slight energising effect.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Streep slams Hollywoods skinny star obsession
  - IM FATTER THAN ANY MOVIE STAR                              Actors choice: Actress Meryl Streep in Sydney to promote her new film Mamma Mia!. (Reuters)                                  
	Actress Meryl Streep has attacked Hollywoods preoccupation with skinny stars and declared: I am fatter than any movie star youve ever met, but I dont care.         
	The veteran star said the pressure to be thin can be overwhelming. Who doesnt feel the pressure in this business? You cant be in it as a woman and not be mowed down by these things. You can either submit  or just get made and defy it, she said.         
	Streep, 59, said she had thought about plastic surgery but rejected the idea. I have considered it. Ive thought: Oh, would that help? And every time I think about it I actually think it doesnt help. It simply means you can play women who have had facelifts, she said in an interview.         
	I always think I can spot it too. Its not like it doesnt make people look refreshed... it does do that. But I always see it. I talk to people and I see it and go: Oh, youve had something done.         
	She added: My oldest daughter is an actress and the pressure on her to remain really, really, really thin, to be glamorous, is intense. To be at openings and wearing couture and having people throw borrowed clothing and borrowed jewellery at her like she is a mannequin, just to sell other peoples crap. It is too bad. It doesnt really enhance your ability to do the job.         
	The star of Kramer vs Kramer, Out Of Africa and The Devil Wears Prada is currently starring in a big screen version of Mamma Mia!, the musical featuring songs by Abba. It opens in the UK tomorrow.         
	Streep said making the movie had improved her figure: I was in great shape for Mamma Mia! because I was dancing so much. It is a very simple truth that if you are moving all day long and are very, very active you can have a good meal at night.         
	Meryl Streep has received 14 Oscar nominations, more than any actor or actress in the history of the Academy Awards. She won her first best actress Oscar for her role in Sophies Choice and the second for Kramer vs Kramer. Streep is tied with actor Jack Nicholson for the most Golden Globe wins, six each.        
	Streep is widely considered to be one of the most respected and talented film actors of her time.

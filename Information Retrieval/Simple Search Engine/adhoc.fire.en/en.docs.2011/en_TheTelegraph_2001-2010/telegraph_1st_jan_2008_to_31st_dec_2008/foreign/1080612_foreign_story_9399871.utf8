	Los Angeles, June 11 (Reuters): Oscar-winning actor Paul Newman, responding to a flurry of unconfirmed reports saying that he is gravely ill with cancer, issued a terse, cryptic statement on Tuesday that shed little light on his actual condition.        
	Newman says hes doing nicely, his spokesman, Jeff Sanderson, said.

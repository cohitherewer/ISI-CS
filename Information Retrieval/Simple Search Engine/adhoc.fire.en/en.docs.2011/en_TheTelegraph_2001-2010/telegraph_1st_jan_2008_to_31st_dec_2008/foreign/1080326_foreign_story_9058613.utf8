The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hillarys sniper claim backfires
                                                                                                               Hillarys sniper claim backfires
                            
	Washington, March 25 (Reuters): A CBS News video from Hillary Clintons 1996 visit to Bosnia as First Lady contradicts a more dramatic description the Democratic presidential candidate gave in a recent campaign speech.        
	In a news video shown on CBS yesterday, Clinton is seen casually walking from her plane and greeting a young girl. CBS said the pictures were recorded at a greeting ceremony when the plane landed.        
	At a recent campaign event, Clinton, who was accompanied by her daughter Chelsea, said she remembered landing under sniper fire.        
	There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base, Clinton said.        
	At the time of the trip, the Bosnia war was over but hostilities continued.

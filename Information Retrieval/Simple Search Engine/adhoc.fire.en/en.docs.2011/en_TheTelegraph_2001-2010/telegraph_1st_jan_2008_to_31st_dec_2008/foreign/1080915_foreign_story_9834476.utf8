          AISLINN SIMPSON                          Prince Harry                                  
	London, Sept. 14: Prince Harry has celebrated his 24th birthday with the accolade of being named Britains coolest young royal.         
	The third in line to the throne beat his cousin Zara Phillips, brother William and other relatives Beatrice and Eugenie to the coveted title.         
	Voters cited his recent service, as a lieutenant in the Household Cavalrys Blues and Royals, in Afghanistan, his African charity work and his involvement with the glamorous South African Chelsy Davies as reasons for his appeal.         
	Harry spent 10 weeks in Helmand Province last Christmas, working as a tactical air controller  calling up allied air cover in support of ground forces  and mounting foot patrols. But the deployment was cut short when a media blackout on reporting the news was broken by a website.         
	He has talked about his desire to serve again in a conflict zone and the poll found 62 per cent of more than 3,000 people questioned believed he should return to the front.         
	Asked which royal couple they most wanted a night out with, those polled picked Harry and Chelsy as first choice (35 per cent), followed by Zara and Mike Tindall (33 per cent), William and Kate Middleton (28 per cent), and Peter Phillips and Autumn (4 per cent).         
	Questioned about Harrys finest moment, 49 per cent said it was carrying on his mothers charity work, 44 per cent said it was his service in the army, 4 per cent said it was organising last summers Concert for Diana in memory of the princess, and 3 per cent said it was getting back with Chelsy earlier this year after the couple broke up.         
	When questioned about who was the coolest young royal Harry got 42 per cent of the votes, Zara got 35 per cent, William got 15 per cent and Eugenie and Beatrice both got 4 per cent, according to the poll conducted by MSN Entertainment.         
	His misjudgment in wearing a Nazi outfit to a fancy dress party was voted his most infamous moment.

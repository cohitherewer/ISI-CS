	Intimate Keira    
	 London, Aug. 28: The actress Keira Knightley has agreed to appear in intimate love scenes for her new role in the forthcoming film The Duchess, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Despite turning down parts in the past for being too explicit, Knightley, 23, has indicated that in this case she believes the scenes are an essential part of the film. Love scenes are never particularly pleasant, the actress said. But I thought that they were necessary enough to warrant doing them. I use my body as a tool. Its what I use.      
	Although Knightley is known for posing nude with only a bowler hat to spare her blushes to advertise Chanel perfume, she revealed that she has rejected roles in the past if she believes that the sexual content or nudity is gratuitous. I have turned roles down because I thought that the sex and the nudity was explicit, the Pirates of the Caribbean star said.      
	Her latest film The Duchess is based on Amanda Foremans bestselling biography of Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire and a distant relative of the late Diana, Princess of Wales.    
	SMS snoop    
	Sydney (Reuters): Cant help checking your partners text messages on the sly? Youre not alone, with an Australian survey showing one in three mobile phone users are SMS snoops, and the consequences can often be heart-breaking. The online survey, conducted for telecoms service provider Virgin Mobile Australia, shows that women are more likely than men to check their partners phone in secret. It also revealed that 73 per cent of these sneaky text checkers have found out things they later wished they had not.

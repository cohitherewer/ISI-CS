	Lovely Lopez    
	 New York, June 19 (AP): Students at a Staten Island, New York, elementary school for autistic children sure like the way Jennifer Lopez moves.      
	Teacher Kathy Amati and a professional showed the video for Lopezs Lets Get Loud to the students at P.S. 37. The children liked it so much, they wanted to watch it every day. They learned the lyrics and the dance moves from the video.       
	With their teachers encouragement, they wrote to Lopez, hoping for pictures or an autograph. Instead, the Bronx-born singer-actress visited P.S. 37 on Tuesday for the graduation ceremony of a group of 10- and 11-year-olds.

	Washington, Dec. 22: Maybe one day they will include it on the safety instruction card: in the event of a crash, please do not start Twittering until you have left the aircraft.         
	An American software engineer appears to have raised the bar in real time citizen journalism after the Boeing 737-500 he was travelling on careened off the runway on take-off at Denver International Airport. As flames engulfed the plane, Mike Wilson sent his first Tweet even before managing to get off the aircraft, alerting his friends and family to the drama: Holy f***ing s*** I was just in a plane crash!        
	It was the first of 30 messages Mr Wilson sent to the popular microblogging service, initially via text message and then, when he got home later that night, via the Web. Each message is a maximum of 140 characters long. The aircraft veered off the runway at about 6.22pm on Saturday, shedding one of two engines and catching fire as it skidded off into the snow.         
	First news of the crash reached the outside world via Wilsons Twitter account at 6.25pm. His second Tweet  in which Wilson complained about losing his glasses  came half an hour later after the passengers had taken shelter from the sub-zero temperatures in one of the airports four fire stations.

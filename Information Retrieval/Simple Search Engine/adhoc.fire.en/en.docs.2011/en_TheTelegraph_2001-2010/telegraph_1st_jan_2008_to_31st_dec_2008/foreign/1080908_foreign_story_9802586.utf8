	Havana, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Hurricane Ike barrelled toward Cuba as an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm today and was forecast to sweep into the central Gulf of Mexico as a large and powerful storm echoing Hurricane Gustav.        
	Ikes top sustained winds reached 215 kmph, making it a savage Category 4, the US National Hurricane Center said.        
	Forecasters said Ike could strengthen further before sweeping into Cuba late today, severely threatening sugar cane fields, the tourist hotels of Varadero and the crumbling colonial buildings of Havana.        
	The densely populated Miami-Fort Lauderdale area in south Florida seemed an increasingly less likely target, but visitors were ordered to flee the vulnerable Florida Keys island chain yesterday.        
	Ike was forecast to curve into the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of this weeks Hurricane Gustav, ploughing toward an area that produces a quarter of domestic US oil. Gustav slammed ashore near New Orleans, which was swamped by Hurricane Katrina three years ago but largely spared by Gustav.        
	Oil companies had begun returning workers to the offshore platforms that were evacuated before Gustav hit Louisiana on Monday.         
	The deeper Ike goes into Cuba, the weaker it will be once it re-emerges over the Gulf of Mexico. But over water it was expected to rapidly regain its former intensity.        
	In five days there will be a large hurricane in the central Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane centre said.         
	Alerts went up across eastern Cuba as residents shivered at the prospect of another major storm a week after Hurricane Gustav devastated parts of western Cuba. Tourists were evacuated from the Guardalavaca resort on Holguin provinces northern coast.

	Washington, Sept. 24 (Reuters): A US military drone went down in eastern Afghanistan with engine problems yesterday but was recovered immediately and was never near the Pakistan border, a military spokesman said today.        
	US army Captain Christian Patterson said in a telephone call from Afghanistan that the unmanned aerial vehicle was being operated by US armed forces when it crashed in Paktika province. It was recovered immediately after it went down, Patterson said.It wasnt close to the border. He gave no details about the vehicles operation or mission.        
	News of the problem drone coincided with Pakistani reports that a suspected pilotless US drone crashed in northwestern Pakistan near the village of Angor Adda, where US commandos launched a raid on September 3. A US defence official responded to the reports of a downed drone in Pakistan yesterday by saying there were no reports of a missing Pentagon drone.         
	It was not immediately possible to reconcile the Pakistani and US statements, which suggested that more than one drone may have crashed.

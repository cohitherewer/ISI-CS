The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bush orders sanctions on Harare
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bush orders sanctions on Harare

	Washington, June 28 (Reuters): President George W. Bush today ordered US sanctions against the illegitimate government of Zimbabwe, and called yesterdays election a sham in which President Robert Mugabe appeared heading for a landslide victory.        
	He also said the US would press for UN action, including an arms embargo.        
	Given the Mugabe regimes blatant disregard for the Zimbabwean peoples democratic will and human rights, I am instructing the secretaries of state and treasury to develop sanctions against this illegitimate government of Zimbabwe and those who support it, Bush said in a statement.        
	The US first imposed sanctions in March 2003 and later widened them to apply to more people accused of undermining democracy in Zimbabwe. US sanctions bar Americans from engaging in any transactions or dealings with them.        
	If the US imposes sanctions on Zimbabwes government and its agencies, that would be the first time those entities were targeted, the White House said.        
	Bush has instructed that the treasury and state departments build on the current list of more than 170 persons and entities, as well as potentially add sanctions against the government of Zimbabwe, White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said.        
	To date, we have not had sanctions on the government and its parastatals.        
	Mugabe is heading for a landslide victory in a one-candidate election boycotted by the opposition and is expected to be sworn for a new term on Sunday, government sources in Africa said.        
	Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai remained on ballot papers after electoral authorities refused to accept his decision to withdraw on the grounds of violence against his supporters. He has taken refuge in the Dutch embassy.        
	On Friday, the Mugabe regime held a sham election that ignored the will of the people of Zimbabwe, Bush said.        
	The international community has condemned the Mugabe regimes ruthless campaign of politically-motivated violence and intimidation with a strong and unified voice that makes clear that yesterdays election was in no way free and fair, Bush said.        
	The UN Security Council has expressed deep regret and said a free and fair vote had been impossible.        
	We will press for strong action by the United Nations, including an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and travel ban on regime officials, Bush said. He said the United States stands ready to support a legitimate government through development assistance, debt relief, and normalization with international financial institutions.        
	The US will continue to provide food assistance and AIDS treatment, said Bush, who was spending the weekend at Camp David.

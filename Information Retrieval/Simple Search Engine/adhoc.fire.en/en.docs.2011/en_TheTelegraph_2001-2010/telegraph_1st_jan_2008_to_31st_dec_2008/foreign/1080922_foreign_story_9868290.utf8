The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nationalisation spree in US
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nationalisation spree in US
  - Marxist whispers in capitalist land as govt raises economic control        K.P. NAYAR                          Socialist Tilt                                        
	Washington, Sept. 21: Karl Marx may yet have the proverbial last laugh. Some 160 years after Marx predicted the triumph of socialism in the most industrialised societies, this process may be under way in America.        
	To say this aloud in the talking shops of Washington and New York would invite derision in this country where socialism is still a dirty word. For that matter, to be a liberal here in 2008  except in small pockets on Americas east and west coast  is to inevitably invite name-calling.        
	But howsoever one may disguise what is now happening in America, the fact of the matter is that on Tuesday, the US government effectively nationalised the American International Group (AIG) by acquiring 79 per cent of its stock.        
	AIG was given $85 billion in a loan  a loan, not compensation or any price for the stock  with taxpayers money, which the now-government-owned insurance giant has to repay in two years.         
	The company was simply taken over like what Fidel Castro did with private assets 90 miles off the Florida coast some half a century ago.        
	It will require a miracle to turn around AIGs fortunes so dramatically in two years that it can repay this large loan. The only way the repayment can be made, if at all, is by selling AIGs subsidiaries.        
	If there are no takers for these subsidiaries, AIG may end up becoming a US counterpart of sorts of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India.        
	A week earlier, the US treasury department nationalised Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by seizing control of their stock worth at least one billion dollars at the time of their nationalisation.        
	In its inevitable, but slow descent into a controlled economy, the US government has already moved along the lines of central European states which had diluted goulash socialism  Hungary, Yugoslavia and Poland, in varying degrees  a decade or two before the collapse of communism.        
	This was inconceivable in Washington that the state would cap the returns to shareholders on their investment until the other day when successive men in charge here were dictating free market for the rest of the world as a tonic for speedy economic growth.        
	Yet that is precisely what happened last week to stockholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which together finance about two-thirds of the entire home loans in the US, going by recent statistics.        
	Today, the Bush administration sent to the US Congress a plan seeking approval of $700 billion to buy the bad debt of any US financial institution for the next two years. Experts estimate that the takeovers could ultimately cost the taxpayer half a trillion dollars.        
	If approved, this plan will bar courts from reviewing actions taken by the US treasury department under the powers conferred by this new law. When he was Russian President, Vladimir Putin did not go that far.        
	If Jawaharlal Nehru had been alive to see the current financial crisis in America, he too, like Marx, would have had the last laugh at his critics galore who have gone about the last decade deriding Nehruvian economic policies aimed at giving the public sector control over the commanding heights of the economy .        
	It is acutely embarrassing for leaders here to acknowledge it, but crucial segments of the American economy, in deep crisis papered over by cosmetic measures for several years, have been quietly depending on state control over their commanding heights for survival.        
	A typical case was the Bush administrations decision in its first term to bail out Boeing by giving it a US Air Force lease for 100 aerial refuelling tankers, which experts say the air force did not need.         
	It was a handout that some estimate would have ultimately given Boeing a windfall of up to $100 billion because the tankers would be taken back and re-sold by the aircraft manufacturer at the end of the lease.        
	The deal was cancelled only after Senator John McCain, this years Republican presidential candidate, launched an all-out bid against what amounted to a state subsidy for an industry that was then ailing.        
	Similarly, in 2001, the US Congress approved a $15 billion aid package for Americas airline industry: $5 billion in direct cash handouts and $10 billion more in government-backed loan guarantees.         
	Americas slow and unstated descent into state control of its economy, especially last weeks developments, is troubling for many, especially the base of the Republican party.        
	Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the US House of Representatives, the high priest of a short-lived conservative revival during Bill Clintons presidency, was yesterday quoted in the local media as saying: If we saw France do this, Italy do this we would have thought it was crazy. We would have had pious speeches about the folly of bureaucrats running businesses.

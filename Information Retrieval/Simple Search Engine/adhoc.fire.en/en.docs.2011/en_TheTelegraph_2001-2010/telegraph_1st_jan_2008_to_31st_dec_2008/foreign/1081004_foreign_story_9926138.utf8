The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jobs heart attack not true, says Apple
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Jobs heart attack not true, says Apple
                              Jobs: Internet rumours                            
	New York, Oct. 3 (Reuters): An Internet report claiming that Apple Inc chief executive Steve Jobs has had a heart attack is not true, the company said today.        
	Responding to a report in iReport, a citizen journalist website owned and operated by Time Warner Incs CNN, Apple spokesman Steve Dowling told Reuters by email: It is not true. The report claimed Jobs was rushed to the emergency room after suffering a major heart attack.        
	Asked for for further details about the status of Jobss health, Dowling repeated: The story is not true.        
	The report has since been removed from iReport. A CNN spokesman was not immediately available for comment.        
	Apple shares, which have in the past been shaken by the question of Jobss health, climbed more than 5 per cent in early trade but retreated as the rumour gained momentum on Internet blogs. The stock at one point was down more than 2 per cent, and hit a 17-month low of $94.65.        
	After Apple denied the report, the shares recovered, climbing to $104.04, up 3.9 per cent on Nasdaq.        
	The report comes about a month after Jobs, who is often perceived as irreplaceable as Apples leader, introduced new iPod digital music players, appearing thin but jaunty. He walked on a stage in front of a screen that flashed: The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated  a quotation borrowed from Mark Twain.

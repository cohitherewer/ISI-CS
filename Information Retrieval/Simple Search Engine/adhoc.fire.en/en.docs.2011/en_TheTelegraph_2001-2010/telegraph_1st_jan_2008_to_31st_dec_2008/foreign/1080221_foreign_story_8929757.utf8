The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US prepares to shoot down failing satellite
                                                                                                               US prepares to shoot down failing satellite

	London, Feb. 20: A specially-armed US navy warship is moving in to position in the Pacific to destroy an out-of-control satellite, using missiles originally designed to intercept ballistic missiles.         
	China and Russia have expressed concerns over the plan, saying that it represents a veiled weapons test and that it is the first step in a new, space-based phase of the arms race.         
	In preparation for the strike, the US government has issued a warning to air and sea traffic to remain clear of an area of the Pacific while the USS Lake Erie carries out its task. A notice to mariners broadcast by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency warned of hazardous operations in the area between 0230 and 0500 GMT tomorrow. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a similar notice to airmen.        
	US defence secretary Robert Gates has been granted the authority by President Bush to give the go-ahead to launch. Washington has denied accusations that the interception is a show of strength after Chinas successful shooting down of a weather satellite in January 2007. It also denies that it is hiding technological secrets by destroying the satellite.         
	While the SM-3 interceptor missiles have successfully brought down ballistic missiles in tests, the bus-sized satellite represents a much greater problem. It is colder, making it harder to track with the infrared heat-seeking technology, and is travelling far faster.        
	The plan is for the non-explosive warhead to smash into a fuel tank on the satellite. The tank is filled with hydrazine, a toxic propellant which may pose a danger to humans if it survives the re-entry intact. The system itself is very accurate, so hopefully that will translate into being able to hit the tank, said a defence official.         
	Some analysts, citing defence sources, have said the Pentagon may even wait until as late as March to try to down the 2,270-kg satellite. The Pentagon expects to announce the missile firing publicly within an hour of the event.

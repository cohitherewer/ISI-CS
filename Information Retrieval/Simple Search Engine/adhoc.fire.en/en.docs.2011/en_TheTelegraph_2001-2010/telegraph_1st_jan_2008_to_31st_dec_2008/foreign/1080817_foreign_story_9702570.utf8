	London, Aug. 16: Beware of silver foxes with a glint in their eye  they may be playing away from home.         
	A new study suggests men thinking of having an affair would have done so by the age of 55. The research, by scientists in the US at the University of New Hampshire, which found that women who cheat are most likely to have had an affair by the age of 45, investigated the reasons people have affairs.         
	According to the study, which analysed data from a nationwide survey where respondents admitted whether they or their partner had ever cheated, the different peaks of infidelity focus on the ability to bear children. The report, said: The reproductive benefits of an affair expend farther into a mans lifetime than a womans.        
	While the survey found that a man is seven per cent more likely to be unfaithful than a woman, it also said that a woman calculates the cost benefits before cheating on her partner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Watchdog pulls out of Russia polls
                                                                                                            Watchdog pulls out of Russia polls
                            
	Moscow, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Europes main election watchdog cancelled plans today to monitor Russias presidential election next month, citing unacceptable restrictions imposed by Moscow.        
	We made every effort in good faith to deploy our mission, said Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) director Christian Strohal.The Russian federation has created limitations that are not conducive to election observation.        
	Any ODIHR verdict is regarded by western states as the best yardstick of whether a vote is fair and the groups withdrawal is likely to further damage Russias democratic credentials. Russia hit back saying the decision by the watchdog, described in the past by Russian officials as a tool of western states, was unacceptable.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | School not linked to Scientology, says Smith
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       School not linked to Scientology, says Smith
                            
	Los Angeles, June 30 (AP): Will Smiths soon-to-open private school is not a Scientology facility, as some reports have suggested, the academys director said.        
	Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, have founded the New Village Academy, scheduled to open in September.        
	The school will use instructional methods developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard called study technology. And a few teachers belong to the church.        
	But the couple say they are not Scientologists, and the academys director insists the facility has no religious affiliation.        
	We are a secular school, and just like all non-religious independent schools, faculty and staff do not promote their own religions at school or pass on the beliefs of their particular faith to children, New Village Academy director Jacqueline Olivier told the Los Angeles Times.        
	Oliver said some of the schools staffers are Scientologists, Muslim, Christian or Jewish.        
	In addition to reading and math, the school offers classes on yoga, robotics and etiquette.

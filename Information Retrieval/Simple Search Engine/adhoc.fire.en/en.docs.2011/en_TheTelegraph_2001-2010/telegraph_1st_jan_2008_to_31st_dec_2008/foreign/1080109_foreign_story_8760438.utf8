	Table trap    
	 Prague, Jan. 8 (Reuters): Two Czechs stuck in a billiard table while searching for a ball had to call the fire squad and were freed only when rescuers took the table apart, a newspaper reported today.      
	At first, the two players in the western Czech city of Karlovy Vary thought it was funny when both of their hands became trapped inside the table. But panic struck when they could not free themselves, daily Lidove Noviny reported.      
	Their trapped hands hurt them quite a bit, a fire brigade spokesman said.We have no clue at all how they could become stuck in there. In the end we had no other option but to dismantle the entire table.    
	Flush fright

The children, who reported their father missing before Christmas, told police the marriage wassteeped in hatred. The Macedonian-born wife threw the biggest chunks of her husband into a bin, police said.     
	Shave show    
	 New York (AP): Fans of late night talk show host David Lettermans latest look are in for disappointment: His beard is history. The late-night funnyman had the bushy beard he grew while off the air during the strike by the Writers Guild of America shaved on Monday on his Late Show. One barber buzzed the beard with an electric razor; the next one lathered him up and finished the job with a straight razor. We have to say goodbye to an old friend tonight, and Im just sick about it, Letterman said. He said he was being pressured to shave, although he would not say by whom.     
	Star plan

Spears was hospitalised on Thursday night after a child custody dispute with ex-husband Kevin Federline resulted in a standoff with police.

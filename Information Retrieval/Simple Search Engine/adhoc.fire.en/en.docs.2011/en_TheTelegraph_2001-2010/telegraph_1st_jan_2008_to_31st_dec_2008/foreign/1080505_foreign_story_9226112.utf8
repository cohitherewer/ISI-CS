                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Abrupt end to talks, China sets condition
  - Beijing links next round to Dalai peace moves                                 
	Beijing, May 4 (Agencies): The first talks between the Dalai Lamas envoys since unrest flared up in Tibet ended abruptly today.        
	Beijing has demanded credible moves from the Tibetan leader to stop violence as a condition for the next round of parleys.        
	 Chinese officials and the Dalai Lamas private representatives agreed to hold another round of contact and consultations at an appropriate time, the state-run Xinhua news agency said after the meeting in the Southern city of Shenzen.        
	 During the meeting, Chinese officials Zhu Weiqun and Sitar told the emissaries from Dharamsala that the riots in Lhasa had given rise to new obstacles for resuming contacts and consultations with the Dalai side.        
	 However, the government, they said, still arranged the meeting with great patience and sincerity.        
	 Zhu and Sitar expressed the hope that to create conditions for the next round of contact and consultations, the Dalai side would take credible moves to stop activities aimed at splitting China, stop plotting and inciting violence and stop disrupting and sabotaging the Beijing Olympic Games, Xinhua said.        
	The Tibetan government-in-exile, based in Dharamsala, had said earlier that the talks would continue for the next two to three days. But the meeting failed to stretch beyond a few hours.        
	 Tenzin Takhla, the Dalai Lamas secretary, had told PTI from Dharamsala that the emissaries were expected to return to India by Thursday.        
	As the two parties gathered, President Hu Jintao said in Beijing he hoped for a positive outcome and that the door of dialogue remains open. (I) hope contacts this time will yield positive results, Xinhua quoted Hu as saying.        
	When determining a persons position, we must not only listen to what he says but also watch his deeds, Hu told a group of Japanese reporters.        
	The Dalai Lama has repeatedly said he was not behind the recent unrest in Tibet.

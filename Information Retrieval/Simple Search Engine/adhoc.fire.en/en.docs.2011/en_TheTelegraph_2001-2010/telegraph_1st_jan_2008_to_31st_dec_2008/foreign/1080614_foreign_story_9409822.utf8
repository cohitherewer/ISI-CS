	London, June 13: Actor Tom Hanks has shown he is a real life hero by stopping work on his new film to help a stranded bride reach her wedding.         
	Hanks is currently reprising the role of Robert Langdon for the filming of Angels and Demons, the sequel to the Da Vinci Code, in Rome.         
	He was filming a scene with a crew outside a church in the city, when the actor spotted the stuck bride-to-be         
	Dressed in her wedding dress and veil, and ready to get married, the woman had arrived at the Pantheon only to find her access blocked by the film crew. But as soon as he spotted the damsel in distress, Hanks immediately called a stop to filming and rushed over to help.         
	Not content with easing the nervous brides path to the church, Hanks took her arm, and escorted her and her father across the film set to the altar. The actor even gathered up the brides long veil to stop it dragging on the floor, according to Hello magazine.         
	But after his gallant move, it was back to business as usual, with Hanks and the crew resuming work to complete the scene.         
	The new movie, based again on a book by Dan Brown, is due to be released next year.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

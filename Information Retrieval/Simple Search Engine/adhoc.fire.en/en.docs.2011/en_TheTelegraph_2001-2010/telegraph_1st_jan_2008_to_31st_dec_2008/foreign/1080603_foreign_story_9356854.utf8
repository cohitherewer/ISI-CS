	Copenhagen, June 2 (AP): Denmark today deplored a deadly car bombing targeting its embassy in Pakistan in the worst anti-Danish attack since a 2006 prophet cartoon crisis.        
	At least six people were killed and dozens wounded in the attack in Islamabad, officials and witnesses said.        
	Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen called the bombing an attack against Denmark. But he said Denmark would not be cowed by terrorists. Denmark will not alter its policy because of a terror attack, he told reporters. We will not give in to terrorists. We will maintain the foreign and security policy line we have been leading.        
	Earlier this year, Danish intelligence officials warned of an aggravated terror threat against Denmark after local newspapers reprinted a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammad wearing a bomb-shaped turban. Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet for fear it could lead to idolatry.        
	The cartoon was one of 12 featuring the prophet  first published in Denmark  that sparked riots in the Muslim world in 2006. Mobs attacked Danish embassies in Lebanon, Syria and Iran to protest publication of the cartoons in European newspapers.        
	This year, Muslims staged peaceful protests in Pakistan over the Mohammad cartoons. In April, Denmark briefly evacuated staff from its embassies in Algeria and Afghanistan because of terror threats. The Danish foreign ministry said the bomb today killed an embassy cleaner and general worker, and injured two other workers, none of them Danes.

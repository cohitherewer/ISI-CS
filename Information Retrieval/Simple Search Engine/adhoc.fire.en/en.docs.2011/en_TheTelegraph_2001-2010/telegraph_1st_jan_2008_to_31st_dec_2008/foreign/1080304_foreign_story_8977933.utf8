	Moscow, March 3: The only western observers to monitor the Russian election in which President Vladimir Putins chosen successor swept to power have denounced the vote as neither free nor fair.
    
	Dmitry Medvedev won support from more than 70 per cent of voters in the most one-sided presidential election in Russias post-Soviet history.
    
	But the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, or PACE, said restrictions on Opposition candidates and bias in the state media made the contest unequal, despite the fact that the result did overall reflect the will of the electorate.
    
	It is still not free and still not fair, said Andreas Gross, who headed the 22-member observation mission. Only 300 international observers were monitoring the 96,000 polling stations yesterday after the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the continents main election watchdog, decided to boycott the vote. 
    
	The Russian election commission dismissed PACEs criticisms on the grounds that they were not supported by evidence. 
    
	Announcing his victory, Medvedev promised to continue the policies of his mentor, appearing alongside Putin at a rally in Red Square.
    
	The two men bounded on to a makeshift stage like a pair of ageing rock stars.
    
	Medvedev, dressed in a pair of tight jeans and an even tighter black leather jacket, its collar turned up, addressed his fans first and promised to follow his mentors philosophy. Together we can continue the course set by President Putin, he said. Together well go further.
    
	But it was Putin the crowd wanted to hear. As he began to talk a huge chant of Putin! Putin! filled Red Square, echoing off the domes of St Basils Cathedral. 
    
	Although Putin will hand over the presidency in May, he will return as Prime Minister and many expect that it is the former KGB agent who will be the real power in the relationship. 
    
	Such a victory carries a lot of obligations. This victory will serve as a guarantee that the course we have chosen, the successful course we have been following over the past eight years, will be continued, Putin said. 
    
	At a news conference, Medvedev said he would form his new government in collaboration with Putin, and pledged that Russias foreign policy would be to defend Russian interests through all legal means. 
    
	But he also insisted that he would be his own man, asserting that foreign policy, according to the Constitution, is determined by the President, not the Prime Minister.
    
	Earlier, Russians had dutifully queued to vote in driving rain that melted the snow and covered Moscow in a layer of ankle-deep brown sludge. 
    
	Its raining, Putin said after casting his ballot. Thats a good omen. Spring has come, added Medvedev, 42. 
    
	With western observers boycotting the poll in protest at Kremlin restrictions, human rights activists spoke of fears that state authorities would rig the vote. 
    
	Factory workers, teachers and other professionals claim they were threatened with the sack if they failed to vote. 
    
	As in Soviet times, there were reports that officials from companies and institutions were at polling stations to ensure that their colleagues had cast their votes. 
    
	Many voters came of their own volition, however, either lured by childrens concerts and the sale of cheap food or because they genuinely supported Medvedev because of his close ties to the outgoing President. We are tired of being weak, said Yuri Dubinin, a 39-year-old businessman, after voting in the Moscow suburb of Zhulebino. I think Medvedev will be even stronger than Putin.

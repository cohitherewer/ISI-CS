                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hate rears ugly head in polls

	Washington, Oct. 21: The campus of Western Carolina University woke up yesterday to a chilling spectacle: a 34-kg bear cub had been shot in the head, brought to the campus and dumped on a roundabout at the entrance to the university.         
	There is nothing unusual about a dead bear in the western areas of North Carolina at this time of the year. It is bear hunting season in the state. What was chilling about this incident, though, was that the 34-kg cub was no hunters trophy. It had been draped in campaign material for the Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama.         
	The message in the outrage was so obvious as the US presidential campaign descends into extreme negativism in its final fortnight that authorities at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee did not even want to address it.         
	Leila Tvedt, associate vice- chancellor of the university, said: We cannot speculate on the motives of the people involved, nor who those people might be. Campus police are cooperating with authorities to investigate this matter.         
	The incident has sent such a chill right through the heart of political discourse in Americas South with its history of racism that although the campus police have a photograph of the dead bear, they have declined to release it to the media.         
	The incident comes four days after police in Virginia arrested Bill White, leader of a neo-Nazi group, the American National Socialist Workers Party, who told The New York Times about Obama that we are facing the potential of a half-black candidate financed by Jewish money... . White brings out a magazine called The Nationalist Socialist. Its latest issue, according to the Times, has on its cover a photograph of Obama with a rifles crosshairs focused on his head and a headline using a racial slur and seemingly calling for his assassination.         
	White was arrested not for implying or making any threats against the black presidential candidate, but for allegedly threatening a member of a jury which convicted a white supremacist of plotting to kill a federal judge in Chicago. The Democratic National Committee has a unit which monitors hate crime on the campaign trail. It had reported earlier that hate groups had been largely marginalised in this election.         
	But in the presidential and Congressional campaigns final weeks, as opinion polls swing not only in favour of Obama, but also in favour of a Senate and House of Representatives with a huge majority for Democrats, the Republican party is orchestrating a campaign that increasingly relies on fanning racial, sectarian and wildly ideological tensions.         
	As a result, the US media is reporting incidents from many parts of America that describe a campaign that has descended into depths that had not been anticipated after the Democrats embraced Obama in the partys primaries.         
	In Louisiana, a white man walked into an election office a few days ago. He was angry that he had not received his voter registration card and warned officials that they could not stop him from voting to keep the nigger out of office.         
	A few days ago, the Arabic news channel, Al Jazeera, sent a white cameraman  who could not clearly be mistaken for any Arab  to record feelings on the street in Ohio.         
	A white woman said on camera on the prospect of an Obama victory: I am afraid if he wins, the black will take over. He is not a Christian. This is a Christian nation! What is our country gonna end up like?         
	A white man said: He must support terrorists! You know, uh, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck. And that to me is Obama.         
	A few weeks ago, a Congressman from Georgia, John Lewis, cautioned Republicans that they were stirring up the same emotions that former Alabama governor and 1972 presidential candidate George Wallace had exploited to promote his political agenda.         
	Because of this atmosphere of hate, four little girls were killed on Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham, Alabama. Senator McCain and Governor Palin are playing with fire, and if they are not careful that fire will consume us all.         
	The irony is that Republican presidential candidate John McCain names civil rights veretarn Lewis as one of three people he most admires.

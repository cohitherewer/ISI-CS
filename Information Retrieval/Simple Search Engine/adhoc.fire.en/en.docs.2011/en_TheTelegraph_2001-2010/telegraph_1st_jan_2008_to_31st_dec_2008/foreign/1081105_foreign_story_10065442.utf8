                              Palin: Relieved                            
	Anchorage (Alaska), Nov. 4: A report released yesterday by a state board found that Governor Sarah Palin did not apply improper pressure to try to dismiss a state trooper who was her former brother-in-law and did not violate state ethics laws in the firing of her public safety commissioner.        
	The report by the Alaska Personnel Board contradicts the conclusions last month of a separate inquiry into the matter overseen by a bipartisan panel. The earlier probe found that Palin had breached a state ethics act. The panel said that the governor was within her rights to fire the public safety commissioner.

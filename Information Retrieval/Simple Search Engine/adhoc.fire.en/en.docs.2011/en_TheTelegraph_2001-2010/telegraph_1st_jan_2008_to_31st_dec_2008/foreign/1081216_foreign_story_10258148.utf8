	Contrite Cruise    
	 New York, Dec. 15 (Reuters): Actor Tom Cruise called his behaviour on NBCs Today show three years ago arrogant and said he learned a lesson from the interview in which he dismissed psychiatry as pseudoscience.      
	The actor has been ridiculed for over-the-top behaviour in TV interviews and generated tabloid headlines over his love life and vocal support for the Church of Scientology.      
	He was contrite in an interview with host Matt Lauer today, his first appearance on the show since the 2005 incident. After looking at it I really thought its not what I intended. I thought in looking at myself that I came across as arrogant, Cruise said.

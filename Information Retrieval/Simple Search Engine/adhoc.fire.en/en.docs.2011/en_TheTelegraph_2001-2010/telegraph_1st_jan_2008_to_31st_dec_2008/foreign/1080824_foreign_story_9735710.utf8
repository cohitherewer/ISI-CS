	Islamabad, Aug. 23 (AP): Pakistans ruling coalition was on the brink of collapse today after former Prime Minster Nawaz Sharif demanded that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) slash the powers of the President before he supports their nominee.        
	Sharif also cut the deadline for the reinstatement of judges sacked by former President Musharraf by two days to Monday. It is one of the key issues dividing the PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) since they forced former Musharraf from power less than a week ago.        
	With presidential elections set for September 6 and militant violence flaring in the volatile northwest  37 militants were killed today in retaliation for a string of suicide bombings  pressure was building for the two sides to end differences that appeared increasingly irreconcilable.        
	Asif Ali Zardari, co-chairman of the PPP which has the biggest bloc in the National Assembly, agreed today to run for the presidency.        
	Though a long-time Musharraf critic, he is likely to continue the former generals support for the US war against terrorism.        
	But Zardaris climb to power would dismay many in this nation of 160 million, who view the husband of assassinated leader Benazir Bhutto as a symbol of corruption that tainted its last experiment with civilian rule in the 1990s.        
	Despite the backing of his party, Zardaris election is far from certain. Sharif, who heads the PML-N, was one of Bhuttos bitter rivals and has been threatening to pull out of the coalition over the reinstatement of the judges.        
	He demanded after meeting Zardaris aides today that the PPP agree to sharply reduce the powers of the new President before he supports their candidate.        
	Sharif wants the head of state to be deprived of the constitutional right to dissolve parliament or to appoint chiefs of the armed forces. However, Zardaris name was thrown into the race without any such guarantee.        
	Ehsan Iqbal, a senior leader in Sharifs party, accused Zardari of taking unilateral steps to break up the coalition ... We regret deeply that the PPP has not honoured its agreements, which we have in writing.        
	Sharif, ousted by Musharraf during his 1999 coup, also pushed up a middle-of-the week deadline for the reinstatement of judges fired by Musharraf late last year to avoid challenges to the former Presidents rule.        
	He wants an agreement by Monday that all  including former Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry  will be back on the bench, saying a surprise September 6 election date forced him to push up his deadline.        
	Zardari, though he wants the judges reinstated, is not quite as enthusiastic. Like Musharraf, he has accused Chaudhry of being too political, and says it should be up to parliament to decide. Analysts say he also might fear that the Chaudhry will revive corruption cases killed off by Musharraf as part of a failed effort to form a power-sharing deal with Bhutto.

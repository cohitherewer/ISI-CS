          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, Sept. 19: The Pakistan government plans to reappoint three more sacked judges  one from the Sindh high court and two from the supreme court.        
	However, lawyers and judges disagreed with the governments decision, saying that it was an attempt to harm their movement to reinstate all judges sacked by former President Prevez Musharraf last year.         
	Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilanis government has already reappointed eight deposed judges of the Sindh high court and reinstated three supreme court justices.        
	Athar Minullah, a spokesman for deposed chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, told reporters in Islamabad that the government was trying to divide the lawyers. He added that their movement would continue until the last deposed judge refuses to take a fresh oath.         
	Former chief justice of Sindh high court Justice Sabihuddin Ahmed is likely to be appointed to the supreme court and two apex court judges are expected to take a fresh oath soon.         
	Another judge of the Sindh high court, Sarmad Jalal Osmany is also likely to be elevated to the supreme court.         
	After this, the strength of the supreme court will increase to 22 against the sanctioned strength of 29.         
	It is expected that notification (official order) about re-appointment of Sabihuddin and Sarmad will be issued in the next couple of days.         
	After the fresh wave of appointments, four judges of the supreme court  Khalilur Rehman Ramday, Falk Sher, Raja Fayaz Ahmed and Chaudhry Ejaz Ahmed  will remain deposed.         
	Musharraf had sacked at least 60 judges after they refused to take fresh oath under provisional constitutional order (PCO) that he issued after imposition of emergency in the country on November 3, 2007.         
	The former President, who himself stepped down amid threats of his impeachement by the government, had issued an official order to re-instate several judges of Sindh high court in early August but the move was aborted after Pakistan Peoples Partys then coalition partner Pakistan Muslim League (N) resisted the decision.         
	The PPP and PML(N) formed their government in March after agreeing to restore judges within 30 days of assuming the power.         
	The alliance finally collapsed in August after PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari refused to give any timeframe for re-instatement of judges and decided to contest presidential elections.         
	The PML(N) and other political parties including All Parties Democratic Alliance (APDM), a grouping of leading religious and political parties have been demanding re-instatement of judges through parliamentary resolution, saying that giving them fresh oath would mean recognizing Musharrafs November 3 decision as legal and constitutional.

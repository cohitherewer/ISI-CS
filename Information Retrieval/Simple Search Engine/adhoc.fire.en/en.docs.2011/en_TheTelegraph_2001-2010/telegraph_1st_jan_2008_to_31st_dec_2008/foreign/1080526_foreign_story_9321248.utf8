	Hong Kong, May 25: (AP): A modern Chinese painting featuring masked characters wearing the red scarves of Chinas communist youth organisation has fetched a record $9.7 million, an auction house said today.        
	Zeng Fanzhis Mask Series 1996 No. 6 sold at a Hong Kong auction yesterday evening, Christies said. Christies spokesperson Kate Malin said the buyer was anonymous.        
	Zengs painting shows eight men and women wearing smiling white masks and red scarves  part of the uniform of the Young Pioneers, Chinas communist youth organisation. The group is apparently posing for a picture, with its members putting their arms around each others shoulders.        
	Zeng presents the notion that the role and the character one presents to the world is constantly changing to fit the social decorum of the ephemeral environment  never constant and never true to the personality that lies beneath, Christies said on its website.        
	The sale broke Christies previous world record for modern Chinese art for Cai Guoqiangs Set of Fourteen Drawings for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which fetched $9.5 million in November, the auction house said. Cais 14 screens were done in gunpowder and ink.        
	In October, Yue Minjuns Execution  inspired by the military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters centered around Beijings Tiananmen Square in 1989  went for $5.9 million at an auction held by Sothebys.        
	Yues Gweong-Gweong  which features his signature smiling characters cascading onto Tiananmen Square  sold for $6.9 million at yesterdays auction in Hong Kong. Its buyer was also anonymous.        
	While the record prices have drawn attention to modern Chinese art, critics say they have also spawned the proliferation of imitation pieces that abuse Chinese motifs like Tiananmen Square and Mao Zedong without genuine artistic purpose to attract Western buyers.

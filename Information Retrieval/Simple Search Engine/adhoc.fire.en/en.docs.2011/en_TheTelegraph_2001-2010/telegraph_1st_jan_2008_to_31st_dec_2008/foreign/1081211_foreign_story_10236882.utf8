The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama puts pressure on governor to resign 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Obama puts pressure on governor to resign

	Chicago, Dec. 10: President-elect Barack Obama today called for the resignation of Rod R. Blagojevich, the besieged governor of Illinois whose political fortunes slammed to earth a day after he was arrested and accused of putting Obamas former Senate seat up for auction.        
	Robert Gibbs, a spokesman for Obama, said the charges against Blagojevich had made his leadership virtually untenable.         
	It is difficult for the governor to effectively do his job and serve the people of Illinois, Gibbs said. The President-elect believes that the Illinois General Assembly should consider the issue and put in place a process to select a new senator that will have the trust and confidence of the people of Illinois.        
	It is the first time Obama has weighed in on the fate of Blagojevich. Yesterday, Obama said he had been saddened and sobered by news of the governors arrest, and asserted that he had not talked to the governor or his staff about filling Obamas vacant Senate seat. But he declined to comment further.         
	Obama becomes the most prominent voice in a near-unanimous chorus of political leaders who have called on Blagojevich to step aside. Politicians, including leading Democrats in the Senate and many Illinois lawmakers and executive officials, greeted the charges against Blagojevich with a chorus of shock and dismay. Many urged the governor to step down immediately.        
	The Illinois legislature, which is currently adjourned, plans to reconvene on Monday to try to neutralise Blagojevichs authority by even trying to impeach him. The state House is expected to draft a bill that would call for a special election to fill Obamas Senate seat, which he resigned last month.        
	State law authorises the governor to appoint the President-elects successor.         
	More than 50 lawmakers have already signed a draft resolution to create a committee to investigate whether the governor should be impeached.        
	Cindy Davidsmeyer, a spokeswoman for Emil Jones, the president of the state Senate, said lawmakers could pass a bill on the special election as soon as next Tuesday. It is unclear whether Blagojevich would sign such legislation; he could veto it or delay it by returning it to the legislature with requests for changes or by taking no action at all for as long as 60 days.         
	Steve Brown, a spokesman for the state House speaker, Michael Madigan, said the legislature would act quickly to try and send yet another signal that there is not confidence in the governors ability to make this appointment.        
	Blagojevich (pronounced bluh-GOY-uh-vich), a Democrat, has not made any public comments on his arrest. Sheldon Sorosky, his lawyer, told reporters that the governor was very surprised and certainly feels that he did not do anything wrong. A hearing in federal court will be held in January to determine whether there is probable cause to go forward with the charges.        
	This morning, Blagojevichs 52nd birthday, he went back to work. Briefcase in hand, he emerged from his home on Chicagos North Side, and ducked into a waiting black sport-utility vehicle.         
	Just a day earlier, FBI agents with a warrant for Blagojevichs arrest had led him from his home while his children slept. The early-morning arrest would become the first in a series of developments yesterday that stunned a state that thought it had seen every brand of political corruption and created grave doubt over how or when Obamas successor in the Senate might now be selected.

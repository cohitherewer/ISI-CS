                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tiger truce offer rejected
                            
	Colombo, Nov. 10 (Reuters): Sri Lankas government rejected the latest Tamil Tiger truce offer today, again demanding the separatist rebels surrender or be destroyed by a military offensive rapidly gaining ground.        
	The LTTE at the weekend reiterated what they say is a long-standing desire for a truce in the 25-year-old war. The government has previously called such offers disingenuous. In parliament, agriculture minister Maithripala Sirisena repeated President Mahinda Rajapaksas stance, which has been in place since the government scrapped a 2002 ceasefire in January.        
	Indian ban upheld        
	In New Delhi, a special tribunal headed by an high court judge today upheld the Centres notification for extending the ban on the LTTE for another two years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sleeping revolution gets a poll call to stir out of bed 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sleeping revolution gets a poll call to stir out of bed

	Kathmandu, April 6: This must be the laziest revolution on earth. It happened three Aprils ago  an explosion of hundreds of thousands on the streets of this capital that pushed a devious usurper king into restoring parliament and recognising the people rather than his palace as supreme. The Peoples Revolution, they called it. It has still to come to bear.        
	The king is still in his palace, a little clipped and caged, but still able to flap about enough for anyone to factor him out. The parliament has lumbered from deadlock to deadlock. The people have been wondering whatever happened to their celebrated revolution.         
	That day back then, it seemed the king would be banished in minutes and a new Nepal would be born, says writer Manjushree Thapa. Then everybody happily went home and seemed to forget about it, it was like a lovely and frenzied dream that had passed and nothing more was to happen.         
	Twice they have tried to induce it to deliver  in June and November 2007  twice theyve resorted to last-minute abortion. Four days from now, Nepal will lumber up to blow life yet again into its stillborn revolution  at last, a long-awaited election, the first in nine years, thats meant to bury the Hindu kingdom in a ballot-heap and conjure a secular republic from the count.                     
	This is by any yardstick a historic moment in this nations history  a 238-year-old monarchy and an even older feudalism being re-packaged as a democracy. And not a humdrum one at that  this is probably the first democracy being feted by a guerrilla army. Prachandas Maoist rebels have, at least for now, given up the bullet to fight for the ballot.         
	But be not baffled if Nepalis appear not terribly consumed by what they are meant to be undergoing. History has been so long a moment, theyve stopped taking too much notice. And it hasnt quite run its course yet.         
	Optimistic estimates are that it should take only two, at worst three, years hereon to complete the revolution. Thats how long, they say, it will take the new constituent assembly to convert the Nepali resolve for change into reality.         
	Its tough the blame cynics for being cynical, and there are a lot of them in Kathmandu. We have been through so many changes since the last election in 1999 and yet, little really has changed, says Akhilesh Narayan (name changed), who works for a UN agency thats been pushing polls.        
	The royal massacre, the Maoist upsurge, the hope of the peace process, the exhilaration of the revolution, and yet everything is the same, the same political actors, the same jockeying, the same sense of uncertainty.        
	Foreign diplomats and agencies seem excited about what is going to happen in Nepal but Nepalis arent, probably because they know better.        
	Close to a thousand foreign election observers have poured into the country and more are coming. The diplomatic and civil society circuit is a tizzy of daylong meetings and late-evening parties.         
	The greater buzz of this election comes not from festooned campaign vehicles blaring away, it comes from shiny diplomatic plated SUVs zipping up and down: finally Nepal is going to the polls, lets get going too.         
	Nepalis themselves are a little more stoic. Kathmandu isnt a capital surcharged with the intimations of radical transformation. It isnt hurrying anywhere. It is merely its quotidian chaos.         
	It is queued up at the temples or at 24-hour bars, it is milling in the bazaars of Thamel, it is packing the bus shelters for the last ride home, or, in most cases, merely looking forward to the eight-day holiday bonanza that begins tomorrow  five for the elections, and then, by the sheer grace of God, three for the conveniently dovetailed Ramnavami.         
	Somewhere during that long break, theyll probably take time off to prod the revolution with a vote.         
	It seems in need of more than a prod, though; a shove would work better. Before any of the deliberations on the big agenda can begin, the constituent assembly must be constituted, of course, which is what the ensuing elections are for. And that itself appears a far way off. We have an election date  April 10  but nobodys telling when the constituent assembly itself will come into being, not even the election commission.         
	Four weeks? Maybe six? Maybe more, who knows? This is a slow revolution, be patient, is the sardonic advice of one member of Kathmandus small but vocal civil society.         
	A lot of that patience is being demanded on account of the confounding prize the revolution has given itself  a complex proportional representation system that will give the constituent assembly more than half its 601 members.         
	The directly elected seats will be fast to count, goes the conventional wisdom, only a week or so; the proportional seats will take a while. Someone who should know suggests June should be a safe bet for the inauguration of the new house. I hope youve budgeted for a long stay in Nepal, he adds with a mischievous wink. History will take time to be made.

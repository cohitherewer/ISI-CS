The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | For moment, Hillary steel mask cracks 
                                                                                                            For moment, Hillary steel mask cracks 
          ROBIN GIVHAN                          Hillary Clinton in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. (Reuters)                                  
	Washington, Jan. 8: For a brief moment at a campaign stop in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton let slip a glimpse of uncontrolled emotion.         
	Today, streams of voters filed into polling stations in New Hampshire in the countrys first presidential primary election. Polls indicated that Barack Obama, who is of Kenyan descent, had pulled ahead of Hillary.        
	Yesterday, in response to a question from an empathetic voter who wondered how Hillary remains upbeat and so wonderful, Hillarys voice cracked as she conceded that the non-stop campaigning  and all it entails  is not easy.        
	Hillary got choked up. Her voice grew softer. Her eyes grew moist. And she cupped her chin in her hand in a gesture that seemed to indicate both exhaustion and frustration. The candidate, who has presented a consistent face of steely determination and invincibility, had a jarring moment of vulnerability.        
	Hillary didnt cry. God, no. A woman seeking the Presidency isnt allowed to do that no matter how tired she gets and how often she hears: People just dont like you. As if choosing the next commander -in-chief is akin to electing a student body president.        
	So there were no tears rolling down Hillarys cheeks, and there was no messy sniffling. As displays of emotion go, this one was tasteful and reserved  and ever so brief. It was like one of those perfect flickers of sadness that won Helen Mirren an Oscar for The Queen. It was dignified, yet human.        
	But nothing is ever that simple with Hillary. As she herself has noted, she is a Rorschach test for the way in which we believe women get ahead, handle power, negotiate marriage and make us all feel warm, fuzzy and protected. With Hillary, whom people so often view through their own personal lens, the same fleeting gestures can be interpreted as both coldly calculating and wimpy.        
	Psychologists use the Rorschach test to try to examine the personality characteristics and emotional functioning of their patients.        
	Over the past 17 years, Hillary has constructed a public face that is controlled and largely inscrutable. Spontaneity and emotional frankness are not character traits one associates with her.         
	During her greatest public trials, even when discussing her husbands betrayal while promoting her memoir, Hillary presented herself as a fighter.        
	She never has come across as wounded. Angry maybe. Defiant perhaps. The public is accustomed to seeing those on her face and hearing them in her voice. They ring true. Everything else seems suspect. (Even her laughter has been analysed and judged inappropriate, insincere and annoying.)        
	Its no great leap to wonder whether that cracking in her voice yesterday had been self-consciously conjured up. Clinton got teary-eyed? Really? The disbelief might be cynical, but not unreasonable.        
	How does she convince observers  those pesky pundits, the annoying media, the relentless bloggers  that her husky-voiced emotion was real? Would she have been more persuasive if she had shed one perfect tear like Demi Moore in Ghost?        
	Of course, if she comes across as too authentically vulnerable and tender she runs the risk of being called a wuss. Cant stand the heat, Hillary? The mere indication that her tear ducts are in working order is enough to raise that question.        
	In this rare public moment when raw humanity flashed across Hillarys face and got caught in her voice, she was explaining why shes running. She was explaining herself: Some people think elections are a game, lots of whos up or whos down. Its about our country. Its about our kids futures. And its really about all of us together.        
	A lifetime of work, sacrifice, frustration, patience and defiance seemed to be compressed in a few sentences. There was a little bit of disappointment in her words. A hint of exasperation. Her voice sounded heavy with tearful emotion. Not crocodile tears, but real ones. Not because she is a wimp. But simply because she is human.

             exact worth
                 
	Rome, March 3: Luciano Pavarotti died with debts of around 7 million, but left behind a string of properties in Italy, the US and Monte Carlo, it has been revealed. 
    
	A 100-page document compiled by Giorgio Cariani, a notary, has tried to pinpoint the exact worth of the opera singers estate so a legal battle over its division can be avoided. 
    
	Under Italian law, half of Pavarottis estate will go to his four daughters, while a quarter will go to Nicoletta Mantovani, his second wife and widow. However, Pavarotti said, in the last of his three wills, that the final quarter, which comprises an apartment and various works of art in New York, should also go to Mantovani.
    
	The family played down the chances of an unseemly squabble for the maestros money, but it is understood Pavarottis three adult daughters want the value of his US assets carefully identified so Mantovani does not get more than her fair share. 
    
	There is no disagreement between me and Lucianos grown-up daughters, said Mantovani last year, in her only television interview. She also revealed she had multiple sclerosis, and was being treated in New York. 
    
	Meanwhile, a court in Pesaro is trying to discover why Pavarotti, who died last September at the age of 72, decided to transfer his US assets to Mantovani at the last moment. 
    
	Anna Maria Bernini, Mantovanis lawyer, said: We are working without argument. I know that perhaps it is journalistically more interesting to talk of spats, but this is simply not true.
    
	She added that if the value of the US assets turned out to be worth more than a quarter of his total estate, the excess would be returned to the daughters without any quarrel. 
    
	Pavarotti died 7.5 million overdrawn on one current account, and with 3.5 million of mortgages. However, other accounts in local banks around his hometown of Modena contained around 4 million. He also owned two large mansions, one in Modena and one in Pesaro, both with swimming pools and extensive grounds. 
    
	At Modena, he owned a neighbouring restaurant, race course and stables, and a further nine apartments. He also had a jewel of a two-bedroom apartment in Prince Charlotte Boulevard, Monte Carlo. The statement of his wealth also included his royalties, works of art and jewellery, as well as several stage costumes, which were noted down as impossible to value.

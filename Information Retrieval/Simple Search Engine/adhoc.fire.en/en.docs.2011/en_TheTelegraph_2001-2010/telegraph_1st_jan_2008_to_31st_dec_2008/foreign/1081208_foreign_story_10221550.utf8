The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | America after me, says former ISI chief 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       America after me, says former ISI chief 
                            
	Islamabad, Dec. 7 (Reuters): A former head of the Pakistani militarys Inter-Services Intelligence agency said today the US wanted him on a UN list of people and organisations linked to al Qaida and the Taliban.        
	Long retired, Lieutenant-General Hamid Gul said the US moves against him began several weeks ago, pre-dating the latest controversy surrounding the ISI.        
	The agency is currently under scrutiny because of its past links with the Lashkar-e-Toiba, which is suspected by India and US officials to have supplied the gunmen who killed 171 people in the attack on Mumbai last month.        
	Gul, a vocal critic of the US military presence in Afghanistan, said Pakistani foreign ministry officials had confirmed to him the US was trying to put him on the UN list. He said he had asked his government for support.        
	I dont know why America is so much after me, said the bluff, moustachioed Gul from his home in the military cantonment area of Rawalpindi.        
	Lou Fintor, spokesperson for the US embassy in Islamabad said he had no information, and added it was government policy not to comment until action had been taken either by the UN or the US treasurys office of foreign assets control.        
	Pakistani officials could not be contacted.        
	The News daily reported today that Gul was one of five former ISI officers the US wanted the Security Council to put on the list to freeze their assets.        
	Gul was director-general of the ISI from 1987 to 1989, at the end of a mujahideen war, covertly funded by the US and Saudi Arabia, to drive the Soviet army out of Afghanistan.        
	It was at the tail-end of this period that Pakistani support began for a separatist movement in Kashmir. Lashkar-e-Toiba, a group whose leader hails from Sargodha, the same city as Gul, was founded in 1990.        
	Gul says he supports the Afghan resistance to western forces at a moral and academic level, but no more than that.        
	Gul maintains the September 11 attacks in the US were more likely the work of a neo-con/zionist conspiracy than al Qaida.        
	Speculation among analysts and western media has bubbled for years that the ISI either secretly supports the Taliban, or there are rogue or retired officers helping the insurgents.        
	An old ISI colleague of Guls, Khalid Khawaja said he suspected his was another name the US aimed to add to the list.        
	Khawaja said he kept up with old Taliban and militant contacts, but denied those ties extended to anything illegal.        
	In contrast, Gul said he had severed all contact with the Taliban after 2001, and added that he had never been close to them as his Afghan connections were principally with the old mujahideen commanders from the 1980s.

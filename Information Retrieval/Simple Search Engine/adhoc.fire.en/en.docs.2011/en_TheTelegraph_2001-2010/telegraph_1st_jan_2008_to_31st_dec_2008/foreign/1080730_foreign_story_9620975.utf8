	Japan eel drink    
	 London, July 29: Unagi Nobori, a fizzy drink made from eels, has been launched in Japan, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The beverage, which translates as Surging Eel, is a vivid yellow liquid and contains eel extract and vitamins found in the fish.       
	It has been launched this month to coincide with the start of Japans annual eel-eating season.       
	Many believe the fish boost energy during the summers hot and humid conditions.       
	Kazunori Hayashi, spokesman for the company Japan Tobacco Inc, which produced the drink, said: It is mainly for men who are exhausted by the summers heat.      
	The product is believed to be the first mass-produced drink of its kind made in Japan.       
	Its main ingredients include extracts from the head and bones of eels, and five vitamins  A, B1, B2, D and E  contained in the fish.

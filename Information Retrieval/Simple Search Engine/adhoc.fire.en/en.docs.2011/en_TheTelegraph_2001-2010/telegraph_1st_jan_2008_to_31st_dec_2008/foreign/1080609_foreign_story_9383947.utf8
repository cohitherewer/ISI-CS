                                Shahbaz , Musharraf                           
	Lahore, June 8 (PTI): Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) president Shahbaz Sharif today made a triumphant return to the post of chief minister of the crucial Punjab province and launched a blistering attack on President Pervez Musharraf.        
	Shahbaz asked the embattled President to step down immediately for the good of the country.        
	General Musharrafs dictatorship is taking its last breath, said Shahbaz, the 57-year-old younger brother of former Premier Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted as chief minister during a military coup led by Musharraf in 1999.        
	Claiming that Musharrafs days are numbered, Shahbaz said: For the good of the nation, I would like to ask Musharraf... to show mercy to the country and immediately resign and go home so that this government gets a chance to work.        
	As the PML-N and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) legislators chanted go, Musharraf, go, Shahbaz said his return to the post was because of the peoples struggle against dictatorship.        
	Shahbaz was elected chief minister by bagging 265 votes in the house with 297 elected members. The Opposition PML-Q, an ally of Musharraf, boycotted the session.        
	Although he had filed nominations for the by-polls scheduled for June 26, Shahbaz was elected unopposed after all other candidates in Bhakkar constituency withdrew from the race last week.        
	Addressing the assembly after his election, Shahbaz said the people were unwilling to accept Musharrafs continuance as President because of his repressive actions.        
	Dictators and perpetrators of injustice against political workers and women will be brought to justice, he said.         
	Although dictatorship was obliterated by the result of the February 18 general election, Musharraf had gone back on his promise to leave if the people voted against him, Shahbaz said.        
	The prevailing situation shows that his presence in the countrys political arena is about to end. This is the dictator who created countless problems for the country, he said.        
	The PML-N, a key partner in the PPP-led government at the Centre, is the largest party in the Punjab province with 164 seats in the house of 371.        
	The fresh attack came a day after Musharraf dismissed speculation that he was planning to resign or go into exile.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sharif kept in dark on Kargil: Ex-general
                                Sharif (top) and Musharraf                           
	Islamabad, June 3 (PTI): Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was kept in the dark on the Pakistan armys Kargil operation, a former aide of President Pervez Musharraf said during an interview last night.        
	 Lieutenant General (Retired) Jamshed Gulzar Kayani, who served in the ISI and commanded the crucial Rawalpindi-based 10 Corps, said he believed Sharif was not carried on board during the initial stages of the Kargil intrusion by Pakistani troops in early 1999.        
	 Kayani, who was then in the ISI, subsequently briefed the former Prime Minister on the Kargil issue at a meeting on May 17, 1999. Sharif told Musharraf, who was then the army chief, that he would support the operation as long as you succeed.        
	 However, Sharif also told Musharraf that it would be very difficult for him to back the operation if there were reverses, Kayani said in an interview aired on the Geo TV channel last night.        
	In my individual opinion, he (Sharif) was not carried on board. If you go in for such an operation, you have to bring the chief executive on board. You have to give him comprehensive briefings on each and every step (as the Kargil operation) could have opened out into an all out war, said Kayani who is now part of a group of retired military officers pressing for Musharrafs ouster from office.        
	Reacting to Kayanis comments, Sharif today demanded that Musharraf be tried for treason. I have been asking for a commission to probe the Kargil issue for a very long time.... Kargil was a very big blunder committed by Musharraf. It was a misadventure that was a major failure, Sharif told reporters at Lahore airport before departing for London.        
	Kayani also said that those who planned the Kargil operation did not anticipate a strong response from the Indian army, including the use of air power.        
	 Despite the gallantry of troops and young officers, Pakistan suffered reverses due to Indias intense response , he said.        
	During the May 17, 1999, briefing, Sharif was uncertain and asked the high-profile personalities present if it would be correct to give the green signal for the Kargil operation, Kayani said.        
	 He quoted former foreign minister Sartaj Aziz as saying: Sir, I will not be able to support it on the diplomatic milieu.         
	Certain generals present at the meeting also raised questions as to whether the Pakistan army could logistically support the operation.        
	After consulting all those present, Sharif gave Musharraf the green signal and said the Kargil operation could go on as long as you succeed.        
	 Kayani added: But in cases of reverses, Nawaz Sharif said it will be very difficult for me to support the operation.        
	 The bodies of some dead Pakistani soldiers were never found and Sharif finally went to the US to work out an understanding to end the conflict, the former Musharraf aide added.

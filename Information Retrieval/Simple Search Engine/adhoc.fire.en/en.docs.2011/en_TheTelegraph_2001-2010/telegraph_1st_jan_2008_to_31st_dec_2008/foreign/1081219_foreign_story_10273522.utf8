                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Shoe hero apologises to Maliki
                            
	Baghdad, Dec. 18 (Reuters): An Iraqi journalist who hurled his shoes at President George W. Bush apologised to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki for embarrassing him before the watching world, the Premiers office said.        
	TV reporter Muntazer al-Zaidi shot to instant fame when he called Bush a dog in Arabic at a joint news conference with Maliki in Baghdad last Sunday and threw both his shoes at Bush.        
	Zaidi said in his letter that his big ugly act cannot be excused, said Yasin Majeed, Malikis media adviser. Zaidi added: But I remember in the summer of 2005, I interviewed your Excellency and you told me: Come in, this is your house. And so I appeal to your fatherly feelings to forgive me.

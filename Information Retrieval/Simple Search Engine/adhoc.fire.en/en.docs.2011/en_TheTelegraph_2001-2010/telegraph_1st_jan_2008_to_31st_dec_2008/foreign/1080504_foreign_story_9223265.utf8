	London, May 3: Fathers are feeling increasingly under pressure to match the supposedly perfect parenting skills of celebrity dads such as David Beckham and David Cameron.         
	A survey has found that unrealistic portrayals of fatherhood by celebrities such as Beckham, who appear to combine successful careers with a happy home life and doting children, has left many men frustrated at their own relationships.         
	A poll of 4,000 fathers by the website Netmums.com found that, because of this, a third of them were unsure if they would stay with their partner for good.         
	More than 40 per cent believing they may have suffered from a male version of post-natal depression, with over half feeling deprived of the me-time they used to spend with friends as mothers increasingly demand breaks from the children in the evenings and weekends.         
	Sally Russell, director of Netmums.com, said: In the past the male and female parenting roles have been very clearly defined, but we are now seeing increasing numbers of parents both opting to work. There are also fewer stay-at-home mums.

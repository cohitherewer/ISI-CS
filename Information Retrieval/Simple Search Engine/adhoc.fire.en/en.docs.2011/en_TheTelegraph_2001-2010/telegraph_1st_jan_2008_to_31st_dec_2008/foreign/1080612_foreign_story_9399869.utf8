                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       11 Pak soldiers killed in US raid

	Islamabad, June 11 (Reuters): Pakistan said today an unprovoked and cowardly air strike by US forces had killed 11 Pakistani soldiers on its border with Afghanistan and undermined the basis of security cooperation.        
	The soldiers were killed at a border post in the Mohmand region, opposite Afghanistans Kunar province, late yesterday as US coalition forces in Afghanistan battled militants attacking from Pakistan, a security official said.        
	The incident came as frustration is rising in Kabul and among western forces in Afghanistan over Pakistani efforts to negotiate pacts to end militant violence on its side of the border. Nato says such deals lead to more violence in Afghanistan.        
	In its strongest criticism of the American military since joining the US-led campaign against terrorism, the Pakistani army condemned the killing of the soldiers, including an officer. If confirmed, it would be the most Pakistani soldiers ever killed in an attack by US forces.        
	The attack hit at the very basis of cooperation and sacrifice with which Pakistani soldiers are supporting the coalition in the war against terror, the military said. Such acts of aggression do not serve the common cause of fighting terrorism, it said.        
	Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani also condemned the attack. We will take a stand for sovereignty, integrity and self-respect and we will not allow our soil (to be attacked), he told parliament.        
	Earlier, a Pakistani security official said the soldiers were killed after militants had launched an attack into Afghanistan.

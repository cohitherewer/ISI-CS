	Lovesick? Try sex    
	London, Oct. 18: Elizabethan doctors recognised lovesickness as a medical illness and prescribed sex as a treatment, research has shown, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Dozens of previously unseen doctors reports, diaries and prescriptions show that people visited hospitals with symptoms including depression, inflamed bodies, excessive erotic desire, irrational thoughts and a loss of self control. The term love sickness would now be considered to be unrequited or forbidden love or the distress of being broken-hearted. Doctors prescribed remedies including potions, diets, mental exercises and listening to music.      
	However, doctors believed that the most successful remedy was simply to have sex.

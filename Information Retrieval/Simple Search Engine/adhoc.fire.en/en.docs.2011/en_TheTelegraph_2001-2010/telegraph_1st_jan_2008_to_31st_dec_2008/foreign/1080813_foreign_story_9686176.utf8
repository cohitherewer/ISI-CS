          JIM YARDLEY                          Lin Miaoke: Cute but cannot sing				                                       
	Beijing, Aug. 12: Pigtailed and smiling, Lin Miaoke, age 9, stood in a red dress and white shoes during last Fridays Olympic opening ceremonies and performed Ode to the Motherland in what would become one of the evenings most indelible images: a lone child, fireworks blazing overhead, singing a patriotic ballad before an estimated one billion viewers.        
	Except that she was not really singing.        
	Her proud father, Lin Hui, who only learned of her singing role 15 minutes before the ceremonies began, watched on television and noticed that the voice was a little different from hers. Today, Lin said in a telephone interview that he had assumed the difference might be caused by the acoustics.        
	Acoustics had nothing to do with it. Under pressure from the highest levels of the ruling communist party to find the perfect face and voice, the ceremonys production team concluded the only solution was to use two girls instead of one. Miaoke, a third grader, was judged cute and appealing but not suitable as a singer. Another girl, Yang Peiyi, 7, was judged the best singer but not as cute. So when Miaoke opened her mouth to sing, the voice that was actually heard was a recording of Peiyi. And it is unclear if Miaoke even knew. The reason was for the national interest, explained Chen Qigang, general music designer of the opening ceremonies, who revealed the deception during a Sunday radio interview. The child on camera should be flawless in image, internal feeling and expression.                  Yang Peiyi: Can sing but not cute      
	The filmmaker Zhang Yimou, who oversaw the production, has drawn international raves for a performance considered one of the most spectacular in Olympic history. But to achieve the spectacular, Zhang faked not only the song; organisers also have admitted that one early sequence of the stunning fireworks shown to television viewers was actually created using digitally enhanced computer graphics for theatrical effect.        
	Miaokes song was considered critical because it coincided with the arrival of the national flag inside the massive National Stadium. In his radio interview, Chen said that a member of the ruling communist partys powerful politburo, whom he did not identify, attended one of the last rehearsals and demanded that Miaokes voice must change.

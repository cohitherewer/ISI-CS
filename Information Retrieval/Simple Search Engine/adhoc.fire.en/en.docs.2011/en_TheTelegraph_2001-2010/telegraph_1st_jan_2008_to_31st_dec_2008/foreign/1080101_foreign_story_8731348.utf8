	Kibera (Kenya), Dec. 31 (Reuters): Nineteen-year-old Abdallah Juma could scarcely contain his joy when he voted in Kenyas presidential election for the first time.
    
	I was so excited. It was my first time to be choosing my new President, the school dropout said, emerging from one of myriad rusty iron shacks crowding east Africas biggest slum. Now his hopes lie in ashes, he says  alongside the smouldering ruins of shops and burnt out shells of minibuses littering Kibera after days of rioting and bloodshed. 
    
	President Mwai Kibaki was hastily sworn in to a second term in office yesterday, after an election on Thursday marred by accusations of rigging and ethnic violence. Opposition challenger Raila Odinga and his supporters denounced the poll as fraudulent and demanded a recount. Kibakis ruling party has rejected this as laughable.
    
	Im disappointed, said Juma, who voted for Odinga, sweeping ash from his front entrance with worn out trainers. We were denied our democratic rights. We voted for nothing. 
    
	Rioters in the eastern coastal town of Likoni burned tyres in the street. Cars queued outside petrol stations, cashpoints ran out of money, and holiday-makers were stranded. Back in Kibera, police chased protesters through the morning.

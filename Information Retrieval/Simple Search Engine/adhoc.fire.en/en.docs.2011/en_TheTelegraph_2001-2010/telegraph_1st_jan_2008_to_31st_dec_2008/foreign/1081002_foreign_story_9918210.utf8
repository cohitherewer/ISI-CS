	Islamabad, Oct. 1 (PTI): Pakistani Taliban commander Baitullah Mehsud, blamed for masterminding the assassination of former Premier Benazir Bhutto, has died after a long illness, according to media reports.        
	Mehsud, believed to be 36- years-old, had been suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure for almost a year and had reportedly lapsed into a coma a few days ago. News about his death broke early this morning.        
	TV channels quoted official sources and local residents in the Waziristan tribal region as saying that Mehsud had died at about 1am. CNN quoted Pakistani military officials as confirming that Mehsud had died.

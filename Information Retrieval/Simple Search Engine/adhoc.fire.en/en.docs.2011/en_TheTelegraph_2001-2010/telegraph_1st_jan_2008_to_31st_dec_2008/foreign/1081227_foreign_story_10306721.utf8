	Washington, Dec. 26 (Reuters): Eartha Kitt, a sensual singer, dancer and actress who rose from modest rural roots to captivate audiences with her sultry voice and style, died yesterday at the age of 81.        
	Andrew Freedman, a long-time friend and publicist, said Kitt died of colon cancer for which she was recently treated at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York.

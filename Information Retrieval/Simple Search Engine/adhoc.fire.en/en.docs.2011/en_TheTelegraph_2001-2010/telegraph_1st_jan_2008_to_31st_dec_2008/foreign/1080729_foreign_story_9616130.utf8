	Baghdad, July 28 (Reuters): Three female suicide bombers killed 28 people and wounded 92 when they blew themselves up among Shias walking through the streets of Baghdad on a religious pilgrimage today, Iraqi police said.        
	In the northern oil city of Kirkuk a suicide bomber killed 22 and wounded 150 at a protest against a disputed local elections law, Iraqi security officials said.        
	The attacks mark one of the bloodiest days in Iraq in months and underscored the fragility of recent security gains in the country, where violence is at its lowest level since early 2004. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the Baghdad blasts.

          NICHOLAS CONFESSORE                          Kennedy: Frontrunner                                  
	Albany (New York), Dec. 16: Caroline Kennedy, the deeply private daughter of former President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy, will seek the US Senate seat in New York being vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton.        
	Kennedy ended weeks of silence with a series of rapid-fire phone calls to the states leading political figures, including Governor David A. Paterson, in which she emphatically and enthusiastically declared herself interested in the seat, according to several people who received the calls.        
	She told me she was interested in the position, Paterson said at a news conference outside Albany yesterday. He added Shed like at some point to sit down and tell me what she thinks her qualifications are.        
	The governor, who has sole authority to fill the Senate vacancy, insisted that he had not yet chosen a successor to Clinton and said that yesterdays conversation with Kennedy was the first he had had with her since an initial discussion almost two weeks ago.        
	But several people who have counselled the governor on the pending vacancy said that Kennedy has emerged as a clear frontrunner, if she proves able to withstand the intense scrutiny and criticism that her decision to seek the seat is likely to provoke. Still, some have questioned whether Kennedy is qualified for the job.         
	Kennedy is now launching a public effort to demonstrate that she has both the ability and the stomach to perform the job, with plans to visit parts of the upstate region. The governor has done nothing to discourage her, said a person who has spoken with Kennedy.        
	In addition, a person with direct knowledge of the conversations said that Kennedy and Paterson had spoken several times in recent days and that the governor had grown increasingly fond of her.         
	Under state law, Kennedy would have to run and win in 2010, to finish out the last two years of Clintons term, and again in 2012, to win a term of her own.

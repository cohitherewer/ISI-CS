	Space beer    
	 London, Dec. 3: The worlds first space beer cultivated from barley grown in a laboratory orbiting the earth has been unveiled, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The extra-terrestrial beverage was the result of a five-month mission during which barley was grown for the first time in a Russian laboratory on board the International Space Station.      
	 Sapporo Breweries, one of Japans major breweries, went on to use the crop of barley grown in space to create 100 litres of a 5.5 per cent proof beer  aptly named Space Barley.

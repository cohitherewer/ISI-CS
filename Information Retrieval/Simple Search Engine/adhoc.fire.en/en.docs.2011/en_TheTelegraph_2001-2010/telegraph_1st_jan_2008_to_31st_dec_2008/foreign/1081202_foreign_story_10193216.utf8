                              Kylie: Dazzling                            
	Beijing, Dec. 1 (Reuters): Pop star Kylie Minogue, who went from soap actress to become one of the worlds most famous female recording artists, wowed fans today at her first performance in Chinese capital Beijing with an electric show.        
	A beaming Minogue, who recently overcame breast cancer, belted out a series of her biggest hits, including Cant get you out of my head, Better the devil you know and I should be so lucky.        
	Its my first time ever here in Beijing and youve made me feel so welcome, she told the crowd of some 6,000 who had gathered to see her at the Beijing Workers Gymnasium.        
	Im very happy today, Minogue said in broken Chinese, to roars of approval from the crowd. Well, its true!        
	Her Beijing date was part of the KylieX2008 tour, a $16 million production that has already been to more than 21 countries, and included a Shanghai date last weekend.        
	Nicknamed by local media the pea princess in reference to her diminutive size, Kaili Minuo as she is known in Chinese barely rested during the two-hour show, dressed to the nines in a dazzling and constantly changing Jean Paul Gaultier wardrobe.        
	While not as well known in China as Madonna or Celine Dion, Minogue packed in the crowds with the most expensive ticket going for 2,580 yuan ($376.5), well out of the price range of the average Chinese.

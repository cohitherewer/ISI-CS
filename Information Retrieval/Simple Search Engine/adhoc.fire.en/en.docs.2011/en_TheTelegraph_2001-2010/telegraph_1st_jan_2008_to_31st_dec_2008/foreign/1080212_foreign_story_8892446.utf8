The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | From abyss, a singer rises
                                                                                                               From abyss, a singer rises
                            
	Los Angeles, Feb 11 (Reuters): British pop singer Amy Winehouse, whose rapid decline into an abyss of drug abuse shocked fans last year, won five Grammy Awards yesterday after taking a break from rehab to perform at the show from London.        
	But jazz veteran Herbie Hancock was the surprise winner of the coveted album of the year award for the all-star Joni Mitchell tribute River: The Joni Letters, preventing Winehouse from enjoying a historic clean sweep of the top four Grammy prizes.        
	Still, Winehouse, 24, won the most awards at the ceremony. Her tally for the night included record and song of the year for her signature hit tune Rehab, and best new artist. Hip-hop star Kanye West, who had led the field with eight nominations going into the awards, ended up with four victories.        
	Winehouses Back to Black and Wests Graduation, both commercial and critical successes, were considered the front-runners for album of the year.         
	The loss was likely a huge blow for West. The outspoken artist made his displeasure loud and clear after he lost the race with his two previous albums.         
	The pianist and composer also won the contemporary jazz album Grammy, bringing his career haul to 12. Virtually no one among the Grammy pundits had expected him to take the big prize. Even his nomination was a surprise.        
	Its immeasurable how surprised I am, Hancock, 67, told reporters backstage. I didnt even hear my name at first, and I was waiting to hear my name, and they said it, and I didnt hear it. And then I heard the word River... Is this happening?        
	Even without the album of the year, Winehouse savored a tentative comeback. Three weeks ago she was filmed appearing to be smoking crack cocaine at a party. A little later, she entered a London rehab clinic.        
	Because of her drug treatment  and problems getting a US work visa  Winehouse performed Rehab and the equally personal You Know Im No Good live via satellite from a London recording studio decorated as a cabaret.

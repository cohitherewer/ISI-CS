	Paris, Jan. 12 (Reuters): Its not often that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair is not recognised. But his first foray into the world of mobile phone messaging left one friend puzzled.
    
	Blair told a conference organised by Frances ruling UMP party in Paris he got his first mobile phone six months ago. When I lived at Downing Street I never had one. I got my first mobile the day I left, said Blair. I sent an SMS to a friend, but given my lack of technological knowledge I didnt realise the telephone hadnt identified me as the sender. I got an SMS back saying: But sorry, who are you? Blair said.

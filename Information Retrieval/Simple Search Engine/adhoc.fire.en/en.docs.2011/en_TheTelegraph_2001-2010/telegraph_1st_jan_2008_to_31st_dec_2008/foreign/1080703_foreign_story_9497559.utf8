	London, July 2 (Reuters): A British Royal Navy warship on which Prince William is serving has seized cocaine worth at least 40 million in a major drugs bust, the ministry of defence said today.        
	The frigate HMS Iron Duke intercepted an ocean-going speedboat on Saturday several hundred miles northeast of Barbados in a joint operation with the US Coast Guard, the ministry said.        
	US Coast Guards boarded the speedboat, seized 45 bales of cocaine, weighing a total of 900kg, and arrested the five-man crew. The drugs were then transferred to HMS Iron Duke.        
	William, who is second in line to the English throne, is on a two-month attachment with the Royal Navy until August 1.

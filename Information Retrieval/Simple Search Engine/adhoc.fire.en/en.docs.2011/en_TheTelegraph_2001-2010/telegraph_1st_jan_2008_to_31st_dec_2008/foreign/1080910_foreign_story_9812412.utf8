The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Indians hurt in Tiger air raid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Indians hurt in Tiger air raid
          
	Colombo, Sept. 9 (Reuters): The Sri Lankan military said it had shot down a Tamil Tiger plane for the first time today after the rebels launched a pre-dawn air raid and ground assault on a military base which killed at least 25 people.        
	Two Indian technicians were injured in the attack.        
	But the rebels denied their plane had been shot down, and said its raid had succeeded in destroying an air force radar station in an assault that killed 20 soldiers.        
	The Indian technicians were wounded in the Tiger strike. Identified as Roop and Thakur, they were carrying out maintenance of an Indian-supplied radar at the air base. They were sent for treatment to Colombo and were out of danger.         
	The Tiger raid was one of the most audacious counter-attacks by the LTTE since the army stepped up its advance over the past three weeks, seizing rebel strongholds in what has been the bloodiest fighting since 1999.        
	If confirmed, the downing of the rebel aircraft would provide a boost to the military, frustrated and embarrassed by its inability to impose its air superiority and stop six earlier attacks by the Tigers ramshackle air force since March 2007.        
	The rebels hit a base in Vavuniya, a rear echelon headquarters located just south of the frontline and 250km northeast of the capital, Colombo, with an artillery barrage and ground troops before two aircraft dropped bombs.        
	SLAF (Sri Lankan Air Force) interceptors destroyed one aircraft over Mullaittivu, air force spokesman Wing Commander Janaka Nanayakkara said, referring to a LTTE-held port. Eleven rebels, 12 soldiers, one policeman and one civilian were killed during the fighting, military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said.

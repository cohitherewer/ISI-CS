                              William, Kate: Closer                            
	London, Jan. 5 (PTI):Prince William and his girlfriend Kate Middleton are planning to settle down, finally, the Daily Mail tabloid quoted a friend of the prince as saying.        
	William and Kate are house-hunting. I know everyone expects that William will eventually go and live in the 5million house being built on the Duchy of Cornwalls Harewood Park estate but that is not necessarily a fact, the friend told the Mail.         
	Middleton, who will be 26 on Wednesday, recently told one of her school friends that her dream is to get married, have a nice house, a couple of dogs and go skiing every year with William.         
	Friends say that the couple are now closer than ever.

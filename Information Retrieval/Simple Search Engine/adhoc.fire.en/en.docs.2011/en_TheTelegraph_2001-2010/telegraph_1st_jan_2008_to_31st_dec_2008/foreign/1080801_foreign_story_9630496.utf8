	London, July 31: Dame Elizabeth Taylor was put on a life support machine after suffering congestive heart failure, it has been reported.         
	The condition of the 76-year-old double Oscar-winning actress was said to have deteriorated after being diagnosed with pneumonia.         
	Her children were called to her bedside and told she might not survive, according to the US magazine the National Enquirer.         
	Congestive heart failure is when the heart is too weak to pump blood around the body.        
	However, her condition is now believed to have improved since she was put on life support last week to the extent that she can now breathe unaided. A source told the magazine: The doctors thought they were going to lose her. Shes still very sick, but shes past the crisis.        
	Taylor was said to have been admitted to hospital on July 15 after bout of flu developed into pneumonia.        
	The British-born actress, who has three children and adopted a fourth with ex-husband Richard Burton, has suffered from a catalogue of health problems and is now confined to a wheelchair.        
	She has had both hips replaced, had a benign brain tumour removed in 1997 and suffers from the brittle bone disease osteoporosis.        
	Two years ago she appeared on CNNs Larry King Live talk show to dismiss rumours she had Alzheimers.

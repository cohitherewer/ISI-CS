	Silent violin    
	 London, Feb. 14 (Reuters): A Russian businessman paid a record price yesterday for an 18th- century violin that had not been played in public for more than 70 years.      
	Maxim Viktorov, who bought the instrument by master violin maker Guiseppe Guarneri, paid well in excess of the previous world auction record for a musical instrument of $3.54 million, auction house Sothebys said.      
	It said Viktorov bought the violin privately, and did not disclose the price. Viktorov promised that the instrument, dating from 1741, would now be played regularly in public.       
	Instruments by Guarneri, also known as del Gesu, are considered to be on a par with those of the more famous Antonio Stradivari, a contemporary.    
	Proud zoo    
	 Sydney (Reuters): Sydneys premier zoo is celebrating the news that its nine-year-old Asian elephant is pregnant, but animal rights groups are shocked that the zoo has let a juvenile elephant fall pregnant. Allowing such a young elephant to fall pregnant was the equivalent of allowing your 12-year-old daughter to become pregnant, said Erica Martin, Asia Pacific director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. She said elephants should be at least 11 years old before conceiving.    
	Mel court    
	 Los Angeles (Reuters): Oscar-winning actor Mel Gibson, who made worldwide news by unleashing an anti-Semitic tirade during his 2006 arrest for drink-driving, received a judges approval on Tuesday to serve the rest of his probation without appearing in court again. The judge said the director had completed the requirements of his no-contest plea.

	Victoria strip    
	London, Aug. 13: Queen Victoria is set to have another layer of her legendary modesty stripped away after a pair of her seldom-seen stockings was found in a loft, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Her 50-inch bloomers, chemise and nightdress fetched a small fortune after attracting bids from around the world at auction last month.      
	And now the last of her unmentionables is to poised to go under the hammer after spending decades stuffed in a box in a suburban home.      
	The black-and-white, hand-stitched, silk stockings with crests are believed to have been Victorias favourite design during the 1870s.      
	Their current owner had no idea of their potential value until she learned of the huge prices fetched by the rest of the monarchs underwear.    
	Flat father    
	London: A Swedish lawyer is trying to sell her flat  complete with a balcony view over one of Stockholms trendiest neighbourhoods and a live-in stepfather, reports The Daily Telegraph. The woman, who inherited the top floor studio flat when her mother died a few years ago, now wants to sell it. But she has failed to convince her stepfather to budge from the flat in the Sdermalm district, despite a court order obliging him to do so. So, in a bizarre case of buy one, get one free, the vendor said that the flat will, therefore, go to the highest bidder  with the stepfather.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Amsterdam to shut many brothels
                            
	Amsterdam, Dec. 6 (AP): Amsterdam unveiled plans today to close brothels, sex shops and marijuana cafes in its ancient city centre as part of a major effort to drive organised crime out of the tourist haven.        
	The city is targeting businesses that generate criminality, including gambling parlours, and the so-called coffee shops where marijuana is sold openly. Also targeted are peep shows, massage parlours and souvenir shops used by drug dealers for money-laundering.        
	I think that the new reality will be more in line with our image as a tolerant and crazy place, rather than a free zone for criminals, said Lodewijk Asscher, one of the main proponents of the plan.        
	The news comes just one day after Amsterdams mayor said he would search for loopholes in new rules laid down by the national government that would close marijuana cafes near schools citywide. The measures announced today would affect about 36 coffee shops in the centre itself  a little less than 20 per cent of the city total.

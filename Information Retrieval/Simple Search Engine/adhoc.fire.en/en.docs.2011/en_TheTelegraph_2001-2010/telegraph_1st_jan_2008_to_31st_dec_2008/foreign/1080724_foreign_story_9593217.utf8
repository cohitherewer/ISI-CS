	Horrible dare    
	 Sydney, July 23 (Reuters): An Australian mans dare went horribly wrong when he tried to play chicken with cars on a freeway wearing only his underwear.       
	The 18-year-old was critically injured after being hit by a four-wheel drive car on a freeway in the southern city of Melbourne in the early hours of Wednesday, police said. Police are dismayed at the utter stupidity of a man who decided to play chicken on the Tullamarine Freeway, the statement said.      
	It was lucky nobody was killed as a result and police couldnt believe anybody would be foolish enough to take such grave risks with their personal safety and that of other road users.

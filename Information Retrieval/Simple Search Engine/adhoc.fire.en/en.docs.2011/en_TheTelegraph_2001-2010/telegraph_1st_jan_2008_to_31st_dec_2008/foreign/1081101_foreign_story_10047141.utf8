                              The headquarters of the Cambridge University Press in Cambridge                            
	London, Oct. 31: Half of students at Cambridge University have admitted cheating, according to new figures.         
	A survey shows 49 per cent of undergraduates have plagiarised work whilst studying at the university.         
	Law students were the worst offenders with 62 per cent of them breaking the university plagiarism rules, according to student newspaper Varsity. The university is now planning to introduce special plagiarism detection software to tackle the problem.         
	Its a depressing set of statistics, said Robert Foley, a professor in biological anthropology at Kings College. At St Edmunds College, 67 per cent said they had broken the rules.         
	Only 5 per cent of students who took part in the survey said they had been caught plagiarising while 80 per cent said they thought the university already did enough to punish it.         
	Many students blamed their intense work load for cutting corners, while others said they did not understand the universitys definition of plagiarism and were surprised to know they had broken the rules.         
	Sometimes when Im really fed up, I Google the essay title, copy and throw everything on to a blank word document and jiggle to order a bit. They usually end up being the best essays, said a student at Pembroke College.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bangla polls deferred
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bangla polls deferred
                            
	Dhaka, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Bangladesh said today it had delayed by 11 days until December 29 a parliamentary election which is expected to return the country to democracy after a long spell of emergency rule by an interim government.        
	Chief election commissioner A.T.M. Shamsul Huda said the new date was set after talks with the two main parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by former Prime Ministers Sheikh Hasina and Begum Khaleda Zia.        
	The BNP asked for the delay, saying it needed more time to prepare for the vote as Khaleda was released from prison on bail in September whereas Hasina left prison on parole in June. The Awami League had agreed to take part in the December 18 polls.        
	Deadlines for submitting and withdrawing nominations for the parliamentary vote were delayed to November 30 and December 11 respectively, and rural sub-district elections were now on January 22, 2009 rather than December 28, 2008, as both parties demanded.        
	Senior BNP leader Nazrul Islam Khan said the new election schedules were positive.        
	The election chief said he had conveyed to the government the parties demand for lifting of emergency rule after the date of withdrawing nominations in the parliamentary polls. But this is a matter for the government to decide, he said.        
	Asif Nazrul, a law professor at the Dhaka University and political analyst, said: The politicians should grab the latest move by the election commission, as it is probably the last chance for a participatory poll within a foreseeable future.        
	If they fail, the future of democracy (in Bangladesh) will be at greater risk, he said.        
	The December 29 election will cap nearly two years of emergency rule which followed widespread political violence.        
	The country had also suffered a series of crippling strikes that often shut down transport and ports, something business leaders say they do not want to see again.

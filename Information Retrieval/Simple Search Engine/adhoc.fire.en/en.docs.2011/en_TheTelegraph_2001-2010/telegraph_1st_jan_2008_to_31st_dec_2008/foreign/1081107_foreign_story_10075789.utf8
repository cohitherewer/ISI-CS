	Washington, Nov. 6: President-elect Barack Obama has begun an effort to dampen what his aides fear are unusually high expectations among his supporters.        
	They plan to remind Americans regularly throughout the transition that the nations challenges are substantial and will take time to address.        
	Obamas advisers said they were startled, if gratified, by the jubilation that greeted the news of Obamas victory in much of the US and abroad. But while the energy of his supporters could be a tremendous political asset as Obama works to enact his agenda after taking office in January, his aides said they were looking to temper hopes that he would be able to solve the nations problems or fully reverse Bush administration policies quickly and easily. We have talked about this, said Robert Gibbs, a senior adviser to Obama. Its important that everybody understands that this is not going to happen overnight. There has to be a realistic expectation of what can happen and how quickly.        
	Joel Benenson, Obamas campaign pollster, said he thought that the public appreciated the problems that the President-elect was facing and would judge him against that backdrop. I dont think they view him as a miracle worker who in two months is going to solve an economic crisis, Benenson said. It is a matter of being straightforward with people about what we are going to achieve and how fast its going to take.        
	Obama will hit that theme at a news conference he is expected to hold over the coming days, and in most of his public appearances from here on, aides said. They said they would discourage the traditional yardstick for measuring the accomplishments of a new President  the first 100 days.

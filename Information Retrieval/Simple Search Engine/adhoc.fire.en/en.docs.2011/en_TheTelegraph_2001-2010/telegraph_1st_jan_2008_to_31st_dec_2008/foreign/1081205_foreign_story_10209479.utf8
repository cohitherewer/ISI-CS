                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Putin rules out early Kremlin bid
                            
	Moscow, Dec. 4 (Reuters): Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin hinted today that he may return to his old job in the Kremlin, but not before his ally President Dmitry Medvedevs term expires in 2012.        
	Asked by a reporter whether he would rule out returning to the presidency next year, Putin said: The next elections in the Russian Federation are in 2012 ... we will have to get through to that time, then we will see.        
	Medvedev prompted speculation about an early Putin return to the Kremlin last month when he unexpectedly proposed lengthening the presidential term to six years.         
	But Putin told reporters he was satisfied with the tandem style of government. This has seen the two men collaborating closely.

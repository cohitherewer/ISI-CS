The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Labour slumps to worst loss in local polls
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Labour slumps to worst loss in local polls
                          It rsquo;s clear to me that this has been a disappointing night, indeed a bad night for Labour 				 - Brown                    
	London, May 2 (Reuters): Britains ruling Labour Party slumped to its worst local election defeat on record today, dealing a blow to Prime Minister Gordon Brown in his first test at the polls since taking over from Tony Blair.        
	Buffeted by global economic turmoil and bedevilled by party infighting, Brown now faces an uphill climb against the resurgent Conservatives in the next parliamentary elections due in 2010 at the latest. If the economic crisis continues through 2010, Browns dead in the water, MORI pollster Robert Worcester told Reuters.        
	With more than two-thirds of the results counted from local councils in England and Wales, BBC predictions gave the Conservatives a 44 per cent share of the national vote and Labour 24 per cent, one point behind the centrist Liberal Democrats.        
	Labour had lost 291 councillors, while the Conservatives had gained 233.        
	After being dealt a damning verdict on his first year in power, Brown said: Its clear to me that this has been a disappointing night, indeed a bad night for Labour. My job is to listen and to lead and that is what I will do, he told reporters after his electoral drubbing.        
	Gloomy economic news today added salt to Browns wounds. The Prime Minister served as finance minister for a decade before becoming Prime Minister last June.        
	British house prices suffered their biggest annual fall in 15 years in April, data from Britains biggest mortgage lender HBOS Plc showed.        
	Comparable records on the share of the national vote began in the 1970s and analysts said this could be Labours worst result since 1968 when Harold Wilsons government suffered huge losses, prefiguring a national defeat two years later.         
	Labour suffered some high-profile defeats, including losing Reading council, its last remaining council stronghold in the wealthy southeast of England.

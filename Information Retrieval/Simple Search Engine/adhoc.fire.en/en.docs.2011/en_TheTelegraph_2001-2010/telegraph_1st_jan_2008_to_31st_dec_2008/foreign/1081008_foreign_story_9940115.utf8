                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bond girls reunited with Roger Moore

	London, Oct. 7: Roger Moore has been reunited with six former Bond girls for a tribute to author Ian Fleming, and proved that despite turning 81 next month, he still has the 007 charm.         
	The actor posed for a photo surrounded by the glamorous former leading ladies during a party at the London Palladium.        
	The event, which was also attended by current Bond Daniel Craig, was to mark the end of Flemings centenary year.        
	Standing on the far left of Moore is Zena Marshall, 82, who starred as Miss Taro alongside Sean Connery in the first Bond film, 1962s Dr No.        
	Next to her are Tania Mallet, 67, who played Tilly Masterson in Goldfinger opposite Connery in 1964; Caroline Munro, 58, who was helicopter pilot Naomi in The Spy Who Loved Me with Moore in 1977; Shirley Eaton, 72, who as Jill Masterson was covered in gold paint in Goldfinger; and Eunice Gayson, 77, who played Sylvia Trench in Dr No and From Russia With Love.         
	On the right of the picture is Madeline Smith, 59, who appeared as Miss Caruso in Live And Let Die with Moore in 1973.        
	Roger Moore was the most prolific Bond actor, starring in seven 007 films compared to Sean Connerys six.         
	The Bond girls who joined him, however, have not been as fortunate in their film careers.        
	Eaton made a few unsuccessful films after Goldfinger, but then retired to raise a family.        
	Gayson similarly only found success in a few episodes of The Saint and The Avengers after starring opposite Connery in two Bond films.        
	She returned to the stage in 1990 to play the part of Little Red Hoods grandmother in a production of the musical Into The Woods at the Phoenix Theatre, London. Mallets only film was Goldfinger, she then returned to more lucrative work in modelling.        
	After starring in The Spy Who Loved Me, Munro starred mainly in low-budget sci-fi and horror films.         
	Marshall appeared in films and TV series including Danger Man after her role as Taro in Dr No. Smith featured in several films, and television series All Creatures Great and Small, after Live and Let Die.

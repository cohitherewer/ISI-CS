                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             US ship fires shots at suspected Iran boats

	Washington, April 25 (Reuters): A cargo ship hired by the US military fired warning shots at boats suspected to be Iranian, the US navy said today, underscoring tension in the Gulf as the Pentagon sharpened its warnings to Tehran.        
	According to American defence officials, the Westward Venture cargo ship chartered by the US defence department was travelling in international waters when two unidentified small boats approached yesterday.        
	After the boats failed to respond to radio queries and a warning flare, the cargo ships onboard security team fired a few bursts of machine gun and rifle warning shots, according to Commander Lydia Robertson, a spokeswoman for the US navys Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet.        
	The small boats left the area a short time later, she said by telephone.They were able to avoid a serious incident by following the procedures that we use.        
	The news helped push oil prices up more than $3 to $119.50 a barrel  within striking distance of the record $119.90 hit earlier this week  as traders worried escalating tensions in the region could eventually disrupt crude shipments.        
	In Tehran, an Iranian navy source denied that any confrontation had occurred with a US ship in the Gulf. But the source, quoted by a journalist for Irans state-owned Arabic Al-Alam TV channel, said any shooting that may have occurred could have targeted a non-Iranian vessel.        
	US defence officials said they suspected the boats were Iranian.We dont have complete confirmation of that but we suspect it, one official said.        
	The incident was reported as Americas top military officer charged Iran with increasing its support for Iraqi militias with weapons and training used to kill US troops.

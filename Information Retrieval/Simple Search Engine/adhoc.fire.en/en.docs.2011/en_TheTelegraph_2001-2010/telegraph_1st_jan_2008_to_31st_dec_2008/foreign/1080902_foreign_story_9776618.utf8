	London, Sept. 1: Two foetuses found in the tomb of Tutankhamun are the twin children of the teenage pharaoh, according to the anatomist who first studied his mummified remains in the 1960s.         
	Robert Connolly, who is working with the Egyptian authorities to analyse the young kings remains and those of the two stillborn children, presented his findings at the Pharmacy and Medicine in Ancient Egypt Conference at the University of Manchester. He said that despite their different sizes, the two foetuses would have made more sense as a single pregnancy for Tutankhamuns wife Ankhesenamun.        
	The smaller foetus is five months in gestational age and less than 30cm in height while the other is estimated to be between seven and nine months in gestational age and measures 38.5cm.         
	They have never been publicly displayed but will undergo CT scans and DNA testing whose results, due in December, could establish why they died and their relation to the pharaoh.         
	Connolly, a physical anthropology specialist from the University of Liverpools department of human anatomy and cell biology, said: I studied one of the mummies, the larger one, back in 1979, determined the blood group data from this baby mummy and compared it with my 1969 blood grouping of Tutankhamun. The results confirmed that this larger foetus could indeed be the daughter of Tutankhamun. We now believe that they are twins and they were both his children. The forthcoming DNA study on them will contribute another key piece to this question.

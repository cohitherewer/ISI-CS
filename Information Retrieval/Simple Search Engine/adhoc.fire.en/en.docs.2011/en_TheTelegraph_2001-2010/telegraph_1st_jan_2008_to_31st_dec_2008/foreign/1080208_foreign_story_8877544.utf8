The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sharia in UK unavoidable
                                                                                                            Sharia in UK unavoidable
                            
	London, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, spiritual leader of the worlds Anglicans, said today that the introduction of some aspects of Islamic Sharia law in Britain was unavoidable.        
	Other religions enjoyed tolerance of their laws in Britain, he said, and he called for a constructive accommodation with Muslim practice in areas such as marital disputes. Asked in a BBC interview if the adoption of Sharia law was necessary for community cohesion, Williams said: It seems unavoidable.        
	Certain conditions of Sharia are already recognised in our society and under our law, so it is not as if we are bringing in an alien and rival system.        
	The issue of integrating Britains 1.8 million Muslims has been widely debated since July 2005 when four British Islamists carried out suicide bombings on Londons transport network, killing 52 people. Sharia is the body of Islamic religious law based on the Quran, the words and actions of the Prophet Mohammad and his companions, and rulings of Islamic scholars. It covers issues including worship, commercial dealings, marriage and penal laws.        
	It is implemented in varying degrees in Muslim countries. Williams said he was not endorsing the harsh punishments issued in Saudi Arabia, where murderers and drug traffickers are beheaded. Nobody in their right mind would want to see in this country the kind of inhumanity that has sometimes been associated with the practice of the law in some Islamic states, the extreme punishments, the attitudes to women.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Desperate Hillary targets outsourcing

	Chicago, Feb. 20: With Barack Obamas tenth consecutive victory in Democratic primaries and caucuses, Hillary Clinton, the one-time certainty for the partys presidential nomination, last night desperately jumped on the bandwagon of criticising job outsourcing.        
	We have to take back every single tax break that companies get for exporting jobs out of America, she said in a fiesty speech in Youngstown, Ohio, that made no mention of her convincing loss to Obama in Wisconsin and a defeat in Hawaii that was looming at that time.        
	Obama, the winner in both states, continued to hammer away at the dubious benefits of globalisation for America. Year after year, politicians in Washington sign trade agreements that are riddled with perks for big corporations but have absolutely no protections for American workers... It is bad for our economy, it is bad for our country, and it will not happen when I am President, Obama declared.        
	Clinton embraced the populist theme of American job losses to developing countries even as commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath declared here that he and the outgoing Bush administrations trade representative, Susan Schwab, had agreed to fast track negotiations on signing an investment protection agreement. They aim to conclude the agreement before the next President takes office in January 2009.        
	There was irony in Clinton borrowing the populist themes of Obama and another candidate, John Edwards, who is no longer in the race.        
	A day earlier, her campaign had alleged that Obama had plagiarised a speech by Deval Patrick, the Massachusetts governor and a friend of the new Democratic front-runner.         
	The charge did not have any impact on yesterdays voting in Wisconsin and Hawaii, but it was emblematic of the panic that is descending on the Clinton camp as the presidential nomination appeared to be slipping away from the former First Lady. It is likely that the Democratic nomination process may now descend into bitterness and dirty tricks if neither Clinton nor Obama head for the partys national convention in August without a clear majority of delegates.         
	Both camps now have their eyes on the delegate-rich, large states of Texas, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Voting takes place in Texas and Ohio on March 4 and in Pennsylvania on April 22.        
	 On the Republican side, Arizona Senator John McCain last night won the primary in Wisconsin with a convincing 55 per cent majority over his distant rival, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee.

	New York, Aug. 7 (AP): Cosmetics giant LOreal is denying it lightened Beyonces skin tone in an ad.        
	We highly value our relationship with Knowles. It is categorically untrue that LOreal Paris altered Knowless features or skin tone in the campaign for Feria hair colour, the Paris-based company said in a statement sent to the Associated Press through the singers representative.        
	The ad is in the current edition of Elle magazine.        
	LOreal, the maker of Garnier hair care and Lancome cosmetics, is the worlds largest cosmetics maker.

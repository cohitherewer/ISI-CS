The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bank blow to Myanmar
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bank blow to Myanmar

	London, May 20: The World Bank has refused to lend money to Myanmar to help it recover from the cyclone because the countrys ruling generals have been in arrears with the bank for a decade.        
	The Myanmarese junta, which is still only allowing limited access for relief supplies and is barring foreign disaster specialists, says that 5-billion worth of damage was done by Cyclone Nargis, which killed an estimated 200,000 people 17 days ago.        
	The junta has invited the World Bank to a donor conference jointly organised by the UN and Asean, to be held in Yangon on Sunday.        
	But the bank cannot legally provide any resources to Myanmar because it is in arrears with the bank since 1998, said Juan Jose Daboub, the World Banks managing director.        
	However, he said the bank was working with Asean by providing technical support to assess the damage and plan economic reconstruction.        
	On Monday, a plan was announced to channel international aid to Burma through Asean, raising hopes that more assistance may shortly reach the 2.5 million cyclone survivors in desperate need of food, shelter and drinking water.        
	So far, according to the UN, only around 20 per cent of them have received anything at all.        
	The xenophobic junta has obstructed foreign aid, apparently for fear that it would undermine the generals grip on power, but they are less suspicious of Asian neighbours who have consistently refused to criticise their brutal rule.        
	However, the plan is short on details and it remains to be seen what, in practice, it will amount to.        
	Witnesses describe desperate survivors lining up in torrential rain along the roads leading into the worst hit Irrawaddy delta, begging passing vehicles for food.        
	In the absence of adequate government response, some private citizens have tried to help  but now the regime has started distributing leaflets asking them not to.        
	The leaflets say that giving food may make victims lazy and more dependent on others.        
	But there are signs that the insular junta, which recently relocated to a remote new capital, has begun to appreciate the scale of the disaster.        
	A three-day period of national mourning began today. Senior general Than Shwe finally toured a pristine camp for survivors at the weekend, in his first public appearance since the storm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pervez rubbishes quit rumours
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pervez rubbishes quit rumours
                            
	Islamabad, May 29 (Reuters): The Pakistani army and President Pervez Musharrafs spokesperson moved to dampen speculation today that the beleaguered President was about to quit.        
	Rumours that Musharraf was close to resigning were one of the reasons for falls of more than 4 per cent on the Karachi stock market on both yesterday and today.        
	Ever since the February general election robbed him of parliamentary support, speculation has abounded that the President, who came to power as a general in a 1999 coup, would be driven from office.        
	A front page story in the News daily today focused on a late-night meeting between the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, and Musharraf.        
	The military issued a statement saying Kayani regretted that a section of the press is trying to unnecessarily sensationalise routine functional matters.        
	A spokesperson for Musharraf rebutted the newspaper articles assertion that Musharraf had agreed to leave his official residence in Rawalpindi. Neither has there been any discussion of the President moving out of the Presidents Lodge, nor is there any plan for him to do so, said Rashid Qureshi.        
	Another close aide to Musharraf said any suggestion that the army had asked him to step down was totally wrong.        
	Despite pressure from several sides to quit, Musharraf has sat tight and watched cracks develop in the new coalition over how to tackle him.        
	The Pakistan Peoples Party, leading the two-month-old government, has drafted a 62-point constitutional amendment that will reduce the President to a figurehead.        
	The constitutional package will take many months to debate, but it could persuade Musharraf to leave gracefully in the meantime, according to a senior PPP official.        
	Coalition partner Nawaz Sharif, the Prime Minister Musharraf overthrew, is impatient to see his usurper hounded out of office.        
	Sharif aims to contest a byelection next month for a seat in the national assembly, having been barred from contesting the February election.        
	At a meeting of his party in Lahore to mark the 10th anniversary of Pakistans nuclear tests yesterday, Sharif said Musharraf should be tried as a traitor.

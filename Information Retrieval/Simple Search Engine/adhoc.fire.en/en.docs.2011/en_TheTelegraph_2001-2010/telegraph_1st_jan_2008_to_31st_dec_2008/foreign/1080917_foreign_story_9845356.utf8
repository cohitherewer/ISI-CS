	Vandals no more    
	 London, Sept. 16: Residents of a French town have voted to change their name from Vandals, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The inhabitants of Vantoux, near Metz, decided to change their name to Vantousiens, meaning from Vantoux, because they did not want to be associated with the fifth-century tribesmen of the same name who rampaged across Europe.       
	 June, the mayor decided to launch the exercise, sending a form with six proposals to the 330 homes in the community  with 931 people voting to change the name.       
	 mayor Claude Vellei explained: Its a matter of principle. Too many visitors come here expecting to meet the wrong kind of people. Were not vandals, and there is no reason why people should refer to us in this way.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Visa CEO loses all his cards
                            
	New York, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Imagine running the worlds largest credit card network, and not having your own plastic.        
	Thats what happened to Visa Inc chief executive Joseph Saunders. He spoke yesterday morning at a Goldman Sachs financial services conference in New York. He had come from the Visa headquarters in San Francisco.        
	Unfortunately, his credit cards didnt make the trip.        
	Im supposed to start off, and say that Im very happy to be here, and I guess I am. But its 4:15 in the morning as far as Im concerned, and I lost my wallet on the way here, Saunders said. Its rather embarrassing when somebody steals my credit cards. The comment prompted laughter. Saunders did not elaborate. Visa did not immediately return a call seeking further comment.

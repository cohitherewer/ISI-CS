	Wam (Pakistan), Oct. 30 (AP): Children begged for food from trucks passing through a region of Pakistan hit by a strong earthquake as survivors prepared today for another frigid night camped out in destroyed mountain villages.        
	Dozens of children lined main roads in the region to run after trucks in the hope of being thrown food. I am hungry, my mother is hungry, said 9-year-old Zarin Gull. We must get food.

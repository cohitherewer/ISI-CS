	Dallas, April 9 (AP): American Airlines cancelled more than 1,000 flights today, more than one-third of its schedule, as it spent a second straight day inspecting the wiring on some of its jets  the same issue that caused it to scrap hundreds of flights two weeks ago.        
	The USs biggest airline had already cancelled 460 flights yesterday, stranding thousands of travellers. Federal inspectors found problems with wiring work done two weeks ago, although the airline says passenger safety was never jeopardised.        
	Airline officials said the flights would have averaged more than 100 passengers, meaning that more than 100,000 travellers could have been left scrambling to book new flights.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 50 radiation sources in quake zone   All traced but 15 still to be contained 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       50 radiation sources in quake zone   All traced but 15 still to be contained

	Chengdu, May 23 (Reuters): China has found what it termed 50 hazardous sources of radiation because of last weeks earthquake, a senior official said today, though he insisted the situation was under control.        
	But Wu Xiaoqing, the vice-environment minister, said there had been no accidental releases of radiation.        
	Thirty-five of the radiation sources have been recovered, and the location of another 15 has been confirmed, but they have not yet been recovered, Wu told a news conference in Beijing.        
	Three are buried in rubble and another 12 are in dangerous buildings, which the staff cannot go into, he added.        
	The disaster area  the mountainous province of Sichuan  is home to Chinas chief nuclear weapons research lab in Mianyang, as well as several secretive atomic sites, but no nuclear power stations.        
	Wu declined to comment on whether there were be more, as yet unlocated, radiation sources.        
	The ministry, which lost over $100.8 million worth of equipment and offices in the quake is also struggling to contain more commonplace dangers from the regions array of heavy industry.        
	Environmental supervision capacity in the area is badly below what is needed.... A number of hidden troubles will loom large in the recovery process, Wu said.        
	The quake-hit area has a big concentration of high-risk industries. There are over 100 chemical plants in Chengdu, Deyang, Mianyang, Guangyuan, Yaan, Meishan and Aba, he added, listing areas near the epicentre.        
	There were also 59 producers of hazardous waste in four of these areas alone, he added, although all facilities were currently considered secure.        
	Most drinking water in the area is of the same quality it was before the quake, although samples in one area had higher than usual concentrations of petroleum, Wu said, which could be the result of fuel leaking from crushed cars and generators.        
	Air quality was also normal across the quake zone, despite fears that the collapsed buildings could throw up asbestos or fine dust particles that can damage the lungs.        
	But Wu cast a shadow over the impoverished areas economic future, saying that chemical and petrochemical projects would be reviewed before reconstruction work was allowed to go ahead.

          PATRICK SAWER                               
	London, June 28: They may all look the same to the human eye, but it seems penguins are different to each other after all.         
	New computer software has just been developed which allows researchers studying the lives of jackass penguins to tell each one apart  even when there are 20,000 to choose from.         
	Its not their face that gives the game away, but the distinctive markings on their chests.         
	A recognition system developed by a British professor studying the birds of South Africas Robben Island  more famous as the prison home of Nelson Mandela  records and helps distinguish between the pattern of spots on their chests and stomachs.         
	A camera set up on a penguin track in Robben Island records and analyses the pattern of spots of each bird that walks past. It has the advantage over tags as it can operate without the birds having to be caught, which greatly reduces stress on penguin and scientist. These penguins are vicious, nasty things that bite and scratch. They have very sharp beaks. I do love them but, by God, they can hurt, said Prof. Peter Barham, of Bristol University, said.         
	The numbers of the African penguin, more porperly called Spheniscus demersus but popularly known as jackass because its call sounds like the braying of a donkey, are undergoing a steep decline.         
	Penguins walk past the camera as they go to and from the sea to feed. The system is able to record 20 per cent of the birds in a day and after a month 98 per cent of the 20,000 penguins on the island will have been identified individually.

	Dhaka, Aug. 4 (Reuters): Bangladeshis voted today in local elections, the first polls organised by the countrys army-backed interim government since it took power in early 2007.        
	Todays elections are being monitored by thousands of observers from Bangladesh and abroad, and their opinion is likely to be a barometer for the success of national elections later in the year.        
	All the candidates in todays polls had registered as independents because Bangladeshs election laws prevented parties from directly contesting local councils. But after a high court ruling, parties will be able to field candidates during additional rounds of local polls.

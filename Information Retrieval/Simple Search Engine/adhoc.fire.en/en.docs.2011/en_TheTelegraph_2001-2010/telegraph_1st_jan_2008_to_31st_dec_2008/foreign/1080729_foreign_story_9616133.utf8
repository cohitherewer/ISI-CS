	Los Angeles, July 28: The Dark Knight continued its record-breaking domination of the box office at the weekend, pulling in another $75 million to take its 10-day US takings to $314 million.         
	 This breaks the previous record of 16 days, the time it took Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest to reach the $300 million mark in 2006. The Dark Knight now ranks as the second-biggest movie of the year but is only just behind Ironman which took $315 million. Studio Warner Bros is confident the Dark Knight will hit the $400 million in another eight days.         
	Four hundred million is yesterdays news, said Dan Fellman, of Warner Bros. Observers are now questioning whether the film could achieve what has previously been considered an almost impossible feat, unseating Titanic as the most successful film of all time. James Camerons 1997 romantic epic made $600 million in the US and $1.8 billion worldwide.

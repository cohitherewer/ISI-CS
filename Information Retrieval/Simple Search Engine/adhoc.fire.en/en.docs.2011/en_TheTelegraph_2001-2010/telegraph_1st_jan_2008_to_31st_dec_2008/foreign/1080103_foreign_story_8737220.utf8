	All smoke with fire    
	 Lisbon, Jan. 2 (Reuters): The head of the Portuguese agency responsible for enforcing a new ban on smoking in public was seen lighting up at a New Year party, breaking the law on the first day it came into effect.      
	Antonio Nunes, president of Portugals food standards agency, was photographed by the daily Diario de Noticias smoking a cigar at a casino on the outskirts of Lisbon. Nunes told the daily he was not aware the anti-smoking law, which applies to cafes, restaurants and bars, also included casinos. But a spokesman for the ministry of health said it did. We will have to look into what is in the law, Nunes said.     
	Eddie ties knot on island    
	 Los Angeles (AP): Actor Eddie Murphy celebrated New Years Day by tying the knot with film producer Tracey Edmonds, their representatives told People magazine. The pair exchanged vows on Tuesday on a private island off Bora Bora in French Polynesia in front of a small group of family and friends, the magazine reported. A call to Murphys publicist, Arnold Robinson, was not immediately returned early on Wednesday. Murphy and Edmonds began dating last autumn and were engaged in July. Murphy, 46, has five children from his marriage to Nicole Mitchell Murphy, who filed for divorce in 2005. He also has a daughter with Spice Girls singer Melanie Brown. Edmonds, 40, has two sons from her 13-year marriage to singer Kenneth Babyface Edmonds.     
	Dianes motherhood urge    
	 New York (AP): Actress Diane Keaton says she planned to wait until she was in a strong and substantive relationship before becoming a mother  but that never happened for her. Motherhood was not an urge I couldnt resist, it was more like a thought Id been thinking for a very long time, says Keaton, who celebrates her 62nd birthday on Saturday. So I plunged in. The Oscar winner, whose past romantic partners include Woody Allen and Warren Beatty, adopted daughter Dexter, now 12, and son Duke, 7. Ive had such an unusual life. Obviously career-oriented. I was happy to be a daughter well into my 40s. That was something that meant a lot to me, Keaton tells Ladies Home Journal in its February issue. I didnt think that I was ever going to be prepared to be a mother. I wanted to be in a good relationship.

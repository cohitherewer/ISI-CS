	London, May 28: Men who take regular exercise are less likely to die from cancer than those who do none, a research has shown.         
	Men who do 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day have a 34 per cent lower chance of being killed by cancer than those who do not, according to scientists.         
	Researchers in Sweden monitored the health and physical activity levels of 40,708 men aged 45 and 79 for seven years.         
	During that time, 3,714 of the participants developed cancer and 1,153 died from their disease. The findings showed exercise had a significant influence on cancer survival and a smaller impact on incidence.         
	Men who walked or cycled at least 30 minutes a day were 34 per cent less likely to die from cancer than men who exercised less or not at all.         
	The same activities led to only a 5 per cent reduction in cancer rates, a result which could be due to chance.         
	However, a more intensive programme of walking and cycling for between an hour and an hour-and-a-half a day was associated with a 16 per cent lower cancer incidence.         
	Study leader Professor Alicja Wolk, from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said: These results clearly show, for the first time, the effect that very simple and basic daily exercise such as walking or cycling has in reducing cancer death risk in middle-aged and elderly men.         
	The research was published yesterday in the British Journal of Cancer.         
	Lesley Walker, the director of cancer information at the charity Cancer Research UK, which publishes the journal, said: This study gives us a clear indication that men who exercise are less likely to die from cancer.

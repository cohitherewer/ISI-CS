The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bidding war begins for first snaps of Jolie twins
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bidding war begins for first snaps of Jolie twins
          PHILIP SHERWELL                              
	New York, June 28: As Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt hide out from the prying cameras of the paparazzi in the south of France ahead of the birth of their twins, the bidding war for the first sanctioned pictures of their unborn children has already broken all records.         
	In New York media circles, there have been reports recently that agents for the Hollywood stars have been offered up to $15 million for the photographs and that the eventual price could top $20 million for a worldwide deal.         
	The new benchmark could soon make it as lucrative for stars to give birth as to make movies. The couple are expected to donate the funds to one of the charitable causes they support  as they did with the money they received for the first images of daughter Shiloh in 2006. Representatives of People, Americas biggest-selling magazine which bought those pictures, said the $4.1 figure widely reported then was exaggerated.         
	People and its rival OK! have declined to comment on negotiations for photographs of the twins. Insiders have said that talk of $15 million is too high at this stage.         
	There is no doubt that the final tally will shatter the current record set earlier this year when Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony sold the US rights for their twins pictures to People and the European rights to OK! for $7 million.

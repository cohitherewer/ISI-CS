	Kathmandu, April 17: Maoist chief Prachanda, whose party is set to lead a coalition government in Nepal, said that India must ensure a steady supply of essential goods to his land-locked country keeping in mind the sensitive political situation.        
	Speaking with businessmen at the Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries here last evening, Prachanda said if a proper atmosphere for cooperation can be created between the two countries, it will certainly help in taking bilateral relations to a new high.        
	The Maoist chief rejected reports that after the Maoist victory in the Constituent Assembly polls, India had halted the supply of cement, iron rods and other building materials to Nepal.        
	He said if any problem arises in the smooth supply of essential goods to Nepal from India, it would have a long-term negative impact on bilateral relations between the two countries. This matter also came up during the discussion I had with officials in Delhi, he said referring to his conversation with external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee on Tuesday.        
	The officials in Delhi have assured me that they would like to develop relations with the Maoists in all fields, Prachanda said, adding: I have held talks on several occasions with the Indian ambassador and other officials regarding this matter.        
	No pullout        
	The Nepali Congress, which received a drubbing in last weeks elections, today decided not to pull out from the interim government till the first meeting of the new parliament.         
	At an informal meeting in Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koiralas residence here today, the party said withdrawal from the government at this stage would be improper.

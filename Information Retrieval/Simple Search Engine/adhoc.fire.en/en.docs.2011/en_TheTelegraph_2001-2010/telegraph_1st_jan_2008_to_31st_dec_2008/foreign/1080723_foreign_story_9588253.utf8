                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Israel raid near Obama hotel

	Jerusalem, July 22 (Reuters): A Palestinian rammed a bulldozer into vehicles on a busy Jerusalem street today, ahead of a visit by US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, and wounded 16 people before being shot dead.        
	The attack, just down the road from the hotel where Obama was to stay, was the second such incident in Jewish west Jerusalem in three weeks.        
	Todays bulldozer attack is a reminder of what Israelis have courageously lived with on a daily basis for far too long, Obama told a news conference in Amman. I strongly condemn this attack and will always support Israel in confronting terrorism and pursuing lasting peace and security.        
	Obama, who was to fly to Israel later in the day, said his thoughts and prayers go out to all who were injured, and to their families.        
	The attack occurred while Israeli President Shimon Peres hosted Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at his official residence less than a kilometre away. Israeli officials said the driver was a Palestinian from a village in an area of the occupied West Bank that Israel considers part of Jerusalem. Its residents have freedom of movement throughout the city and Israel. The bulldozer driver left a construction site, and hit two cars, a police spokesman said.

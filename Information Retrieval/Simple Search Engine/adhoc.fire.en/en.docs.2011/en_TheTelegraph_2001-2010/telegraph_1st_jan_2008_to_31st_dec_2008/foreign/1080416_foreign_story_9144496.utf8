  - PAT ON THE BACK FOR SISTER CONDI                              Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright with the present incumbent, Condoleezza Rice, at the state department in Washington. (AFP)                                  
	Washington, April 15 (Reuters): Madeleine Albright, the first female US secretary of state, saw her official portrait unveiled yesterday and joked that the walls may shake when it is hung beside her whiskered and pinstriped predecessors.        
	Albright, a Democrat who was the top US diplomat from 1997 to 2001, and Republican secretary of state Condoleezza Rice had nothing but praise for one another at a ceremony to unveil the portrait despite their policy differences.        
	The former secretary called Rice my sister and recalled the intellectual debt they both owed her father, Josef Korbel, an emigre Czech diplomat and professor whose university class inspired Rice to study international relations. They are the first two women to have served as US secretary of state.        
	When I was in office, I was called everything from a snake to a witch to elderly but dangerous, Albright said, adding that her portraitist did a marvelous job of concealing each of those qualities.        
	On my first day as secretary, after being sworn in, I walked down the corridor to my new office, and in so doing, I had to pass by the paintings of all those men with whiskers and suits and I was worried that someone would call... security, she said.        
	In the future, my portrait and that of secretary Rice  and who knows which of our sisters  will compete for space with the men and  I dont know, Condi  when this portrait goes up, maybe the walls will shake, she added.        
	Rice, a pianist who did not feel she was good enough to play professionally, said that Albrights father had saved her from a life of musical obscurity and set on a path that eventually took her to the state department.        
	I was in college at the University of Denver trying to figure out my way in life and coming to the realisation that if I stayed a music major I would end up playing at Nordstrom or perhaps at a piano bar, Rice said.        
	Then one day I walked into a course on international politics ... with that one class, I was hooked. Suddenly I knew what I wanted to do. and so I owe a great deal to Dr Josef Korbel, Madelines father, she said.        
	My father would be so incredibly proud that we were here together, Albright replied.         
	We did have the same intellectual father.

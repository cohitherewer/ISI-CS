	Dhaka, July 15 (PTI): A Bangladesh court today acquitted former military dictator Hussain Mohammed Ershad in a graft case, citing a lack of evidence against him.        
	Dhaka divisional judge Mohammad Golam Mortuza ordered the acquittal after a long trial. The case involved the controversial purchase of Electronic News Gathering (ENG) equipment during Ershads nine-year rule until 1990. The judge said none of the 21 witnesses could clearly say how much money from the national exchequer was misappropriated for buying the devices.        
	The judge, while pronouncing the verdict, also noted that Ershad resigned from his presidential post a day after the ENG equipment was installed and he did not get an opportunity to use it. I had to suffer massive tortures since I quit power, thanks to Allah, now I have got justice, Ershad said.

	Kabul, Jan. 14 (AP): Militants with suicide vests, grenades and AK-47 rifles attacked Kabuls most popular luxury hotel this evening, killing at least six persons in a coordinated assault rarely seen in the Afghan capital, witnesses and a Taliban spokesman said.
    
	It appeared to be the first direct attack on a hotel in Kabul since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. The assailants also appeared to concentrate on the hotels gym and spa, where foreigners relax and work out.
    
	The 6.12 pm assault came on a night the Norwegian embassy was holding a meeting at the Serena Hotel. An American inside said she saw a body she believed to be dead and pools of blood in the lobby.
    
	The militants killed six persons and wounded six, said interior ministry spokesman Zemeri Bashary. One of the attackers was shot to death and the Taliban spokesman said a second died in the suicide explosion.
    
	Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said four militants with suicide vests attacked the hotel  one bomber who detonated his explosives and three militants who threw grenades, fired guns and then fled. 
    
	Suzanne Griffin, an American who works with the aid agency Save the Children, said she was in the gyms locker room when the attack started.
    
	Thank God I didnt get into the shower because then we heard gunfire, a lot of it. It was very close, close enough that plaster came off the ceiling, said Griffin, her voice shaking. We all just sat on the floor and got as far as we could from any glass and huddled on the floor. We turned our phones on silent.
    
	Griffin, 62, of Seattle, said hotel staff evacuated the women to another part of the hotel. We had to step over a womans dead body. She was one of the gym people, she said.
    
	Stian L. Solum, a photographer from the Norwegian photo agency Scanpix, said a Norwegian journalist from the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet and a Norwegian diplomatic staff member were wounded in the attack. He said Norways foreign minster Jonas Gahr Stoere, currently visiting Kabul, was not injured and was safe in the hotel.

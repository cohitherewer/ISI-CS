	Jerusalem, Jan. 10 (Reuters): President George W. Bush, hardening his tone towards Israel today, urged an end to the occupation of the West Bank and pushed for a peace treaty to be signed within a year to create a Palestinian state.
    
	The US rarely uses the politically charged word occupation to describe Israels hold on lands captured in a 1967 war. It is a term Palestinians seeking a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip employ frequently to describe their plight.
    
	The establishment of the state of Palestine is long overdue. The Palestinian people deserve it, Bush said in a statement he read to reporters in a Jerusalem hotel.
    
	Bushs language, after he travelled to the West Bank city of Ramallah past Israeli checkpoints and settlements, could cause political pain to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, whose Right-wing coalition partners usually bridle at such remarks.

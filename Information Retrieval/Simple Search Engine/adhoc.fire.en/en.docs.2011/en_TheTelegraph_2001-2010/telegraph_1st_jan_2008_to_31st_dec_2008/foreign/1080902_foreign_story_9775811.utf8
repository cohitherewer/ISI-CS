	Miracle baby    
	 London, Sept. 1: A mother whose son grew outside her womb and was delivered in a pioneering British operation has spoken of her joy at giving birth to a miracle baby, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Jayne Jones, 38, saw at a routine ultra-sound scan when she was 27 weeks pregnant that her baby was growing in her abdomen, on the omentum  the layers of fat that cover the bowel. Almost all such foetuses die within weeks, even days, of conception.      
	 days after the scan Jones was rushed to Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, by her husband Graham because she had collapsed in pain. She had to have ground-breaking surgery that had never been done before in Britain.       
	Billy was born weighing two pounds on April 19 and immediately put in an incubator - where he was kept warm inside a plastic bag. Billy, who has two sisters, Rosie, 11, and Jessie, nine, has developed well.    
	Tropic hit

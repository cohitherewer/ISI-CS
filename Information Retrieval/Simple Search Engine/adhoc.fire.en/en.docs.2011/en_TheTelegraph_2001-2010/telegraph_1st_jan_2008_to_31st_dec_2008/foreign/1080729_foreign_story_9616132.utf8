The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Ex-Google team takes on giant
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ex-Google team takes on giant

	Menlo Park (California), July 28 (Reuters): A start-up led by former star Google engineers yesterday unveiled a new Web search service that aims to outdo the Internet search leader in size, but faces an uphill battle changing surfing habits.        
	Cuil Inc (pronounced cool) is offering a new search service at www.cuil.com that the company claims can index, faster and more cheaply, a far larger portion of the Web than Google, which boasts the largest online index.        
	The would-be Google rival says its service goes beyond prevailing search techniques that focus on Web links and audience traffic patterns and instead analyses the context of each page and the concepts behind each user search request.        
	Our significant breakthroughs in search technology have enabled us to index much more of the Internet, placing nearly the entire Web at the fingertips of every user, Tom Costello, Cuil co-founder and chief executive, said in a statement.        
	Danny Sullivan, a Web search analyst and editor-in-chief of Search Engine Land, said Cuil can try to exploit complaints consumers may have with Google  namely, that it tries to do too much, that its results favour already popular sites, and that it leans heavily on certain authoritative sites such as Wikipedia.        
	The time may be right for a challenger, Sullivan says, but adds quickly: Competing with Google is still a very daunting task, as Microsoft will tell you.        
	Microsoft Corp, the number three US player in Web search has been seeking in vain, so far, to join forces with number two Yahoo Inc to battle Google.        
	Cuil was founded by a group of search pioneers, including Costello, who built a prototype of Web Fountain, IBMs Web search analytics tool, and his wife, Anna Patterson, the architect of Google Incs massive TeraGoogle index of Web pages. Patterson also designed the search system for global corporate document storage company Recall, a unit of Australias Brambles Ltd.        
	The two are joined by two former Google colleagues, Russell Power and Louis Monier. Previously, Monier led the re-design of e-commerce leader eBay Incs search engine and was the founding chief technology officer of two 1990s Web milestones, AltaVista and BabelFish, the first language translation site.        
	They do have the talent that is used to building large, industrial-strength search engines, Sullivan says of Cuil.        
	Cuil clusters the results of each Web search performed on the service into groups of related Web pages. It sorts these by categories and offers various organising features to help identify topics and allow the user to quickly refine searches.        
	User privacy is another appeal of its approach, Cuil says. Because the service focuses on the content of the pages rather than click history, the company has no need to store users personal information or their search histories, it says.        
	We are all about pattern analysis, Patterson says. We go over the corpus (Web pages) 12 times before we even index it.        
	Cuil has indexed a whopping 120 billion Web pages, three times more than what they say Google now indexes, Patterson said, adding the company has spent just $5 million.        
	Google itself pre-emptively responded to Cuils arrival with a blog post on Friday boasting of the growing scale of its own Web search operations.        
	Sullivan said he puts no stock in either companys boasts about the size of their indexes, since it has only an indirect effect on the ultimate success Web surfers have in searching.

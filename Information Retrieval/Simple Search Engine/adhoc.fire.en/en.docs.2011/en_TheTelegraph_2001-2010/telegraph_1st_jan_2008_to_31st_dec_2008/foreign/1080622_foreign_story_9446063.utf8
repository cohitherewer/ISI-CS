	London, June 21 (Reuters): Smokers in deprived parts of one of Scotlands biggest cities are being offered food vouchers worth 50 a month if they give up smoking, the National Health Service said today.        
	They will have to pass weekly carbon monoxide breath tests at their local chemist to prove that they have kicked the habit. During the trial, they will receive money credited to a card that can be used to buy groceries.

	London, May 18: Peter Phillips, the queens eldest grandchild, has married his incredibly composed but slightly nervous Canadian bride at St Georges Chapel in Windsor Castle.         
	Autumn Kelly looked elegant in a cream Sassi Holford wedding gown as she and the groom emerged hand-in-hand after the ceremony to pose for photographs with senior members of the royal family, including the queen and Prince Philip.         
	Absent from the royal family picture, however, were two potential brides-to-be: Prince Harrys girlfriend Chelsy Davy and Prince Williams girlfriend Kate Middleton, who stayed out of the limelight to ensure that their presence would not overshadow the bride and groom on their special day.         
	Their presence at such a high-profile royal event has renewed speculation about the impending marriages.         
	Davy, 22, who has been going out with Harry for four years, was to be formally introduced to the queen for the first time.         
	Middleton, 26, had the more daunting task of being at the event without William, who had a prior engagement  the wedding of a close friend in Kenya.         
	Phillips, who is 11th in line to the throne, and his bride, who are both 30, exchanged vows at the chapel and then hosted a reception and dance at Frogmore House, Windsor, which has been lent to them by the queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Phillips is the first of the queens eight grandchildren to get married.         
	Among the 300 guests at the 55-minute ceremony were 70 friends and family of Kelly who travelled from Canada.

	Heroes in a name    
	 London, Nov. 3: A teenager has changed his name to Captain Fantastic Faster Than Superman Spiderman Batman Wolverine Hulk And The Flash Combined, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The record-breaking name, now thought to be the worlds longest, was the idea of music graduate George Garratt, 19. He changed his name by deed poll online for 10 last week.      
	Captain Fantastic said: I wanted to be unique. I decided upon a theme of superheroes.      
	Captain Fantastic joins a number of people with unusually long names, including Rhoshandiatellyneshiaunneveshenk Koyaanisquatsiuth Williams, a girl born in Texas in 1984.       
	The teenager from Somerset added that while he thought the new name was crazy, his grandmother was no longer speaking to him. Last month in Italy, a couple was banned from naming their son Friday  Venerdi  because the name could expose him to ridicule.

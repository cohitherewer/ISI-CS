	Twins wed
  
	 London (Reuters): A couple discovered after they had married that they were twins who had been split up at birth and adopted by separate families, according to a member of Britains House of Lords.
   
	British peer David Alton recounted the story to Parliament to argue that artificially conceived children should be told who their biological parents are.
   
	 said he heard the story from a high court judge. They met later in life and felt an inevitable attraction, and the judge had to deal with the consequences of the marriage.

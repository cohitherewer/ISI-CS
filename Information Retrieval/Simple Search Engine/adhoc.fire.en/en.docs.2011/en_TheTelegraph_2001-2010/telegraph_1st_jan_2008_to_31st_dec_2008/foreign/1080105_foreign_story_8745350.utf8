The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Caucus? Crack the American riddle
                                                                                                            Caucus? Crack the American riddle
                            
	 Why are caucuses and primaries important?        
	Each of the 51 American states gets to send a certain number of delegates to the Democratic Party and Republican Party conventions in late summer, where each partys presidential candidate is chosen.        
	The primaries and caucuses determine which candidate the delegates vote for. The more voters from a state give their backing to Candidate X, the more delegates supporting Candidate X will be sent from the state to the national convention.               
	 What is a caucus?        
	An arcane and weird system of grassroots democracy. The word comes from the Algonquin tribe of Native Americans, meaning a gathering of tribal chiefs.        
	Most states now hold primary elections with registered Republicans and Democrats voting in a secret ballot to pick presidential nominees  but not Iowa.              
	 What happens at a caucus?        
	Participants, led by a chairperson, indicate their preferences for their partys presidential nomination and pick delegates to their county conventions.              
	 Who takes part in the Iowa caucus?        
	Any US citizen who resides in Iowa and who is old enough to vote in the November general election and is a member of the party is eligible.        
	Iowas caucuses are a series of simultaneous evening meetings held in nearly 1,800 precincts across the state.        
	 Traditionally, only a small number of Iowans show up. But yesterday, Democrats estimated a turnout of 239,000, shattering the previous record of 124,000. Turnout was also up on the Republican side, where projections showed about 115,000 people taking part.               
	 Have the Iowa caucuses always mattered?        
	No. It was only in 1972 after rules were changed to open up the caucuses to all party supporters and Iowa moved the date forward to January so that it was first in the nation that the rest of America took notice. In 1976, the little-known Jimmy Carter came storming out of the cornfields to win the White House, assuring Iowas place at the centre of the political universe every four years.               
	 Is Iowa usually right?        
	It probably thinks so, but the winner in the caucus does not always go on to take his or her partys nomination. In 1980, George Bush Sr narrowly beat Ronald Reagan but lost out in the end.         
	In 1988, Richard Gephardt won the Democratic caucus, only for Michael Dukakis to become the nominee. In 1992, the caucuses were bypassed because an Iowa senator, Tom Harkin, was standing. But Iowa usually influences what happens afterwards, providing momentum for trailing candidates and halting the progress of many a front-runner.               
	 What happens next?        
	Delegates chosen at the caucuses go to the county convention. There, the field is winnowed and delegates are chosen for the district convention. This happens again at district meetings and again at the state convention, where delegates are named to attend the partys national convention.              
	 Why are the numbers different?        
	The Republicans essentially hold a straw poll  a head count  at their precinct caucuses, reporting real numbers. One head, one vote.        
	 The Democrats do not report straight numbers, but use a mathematical formula to determine support in percentages. A candidate must have the support of 15 per cent of those present at any meeting  precinct caucuses through the state convention  to remain viable. This is meant to ensure greater consistency throughout the process.

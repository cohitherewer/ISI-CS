The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Paks Afghan envoy missing
                                                                                                               Paks Afghan envoy missing
                              Mansoor Dadullah: Critical controversy                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Pakistans ambassador to Afghanistan went missing today while travelling by road through a Pakistani tribal region where Taliban militants have become increasingly active in recent months, officials said.        
	Ambassador Tariq Azizuddin was being driven through the Khyber region on his way back to Kabul when he disappeared, according to officials who requested anonymity.        
	Hes been missing since 0600 GMT, said a security official in the Khyber region. The envoy was due to have changed cars at the border, but is not believed to have reached the frontier. Four Pakistani ICRC workers went missing in the same area a few days ago.        
	The foreign ministry cannot comment as it is still obtaining information, a ministry spokesman said.        
	The security situation in Pakistan has deteriorated markedly since mid-2007.        
	Taliban leader hurt        
	Pakistani security forces critically wounded a top figure in the Taliban militia fighting US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, one of six militants captured after a clash near the border today, the army said.        
	Mansoor Dadullah, brother of slain Taliban military commander Mullah Dadullah, and the five others were challenged by security forces as they crossed from Afghanistan into Pakistans southwestern province of Baluchistan. They refused to stop and opened fire, said army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas.        
	Security personnel returned fire. As a result, all of them sustained injuries and all of them were captured, Abbas said. Dadullah was arrested alive but he is critically wounded.        
	Earlier, a senior military official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to journalists, said Dadullah died of his wounds while being flown to a hospital with the other injured men.        
	Two Pakistani intelligence officials, who declined to be named for the same reason, gave a different account of Dadullahs capture, saying he was nabbed during a raid on a madarsa in a neighbouring district.         
	In Afghanistan, officials reacted cautiously. Spokesmen at Afghanistans interior and defence ministries said they had no immediate comment.         
	Lieutenant Colonel David Accetta, the top US military spokesman in Afghanistan, said he could not confirm the report.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China keeps lid on news from Tibet
                                                                                                               China keeps lid on news from Tibet

	Chengdu (China), March 22 (AP): With restive Tibetan areas swarming with troops and closed to outside scrutiny, Chinas government stepped up efforts today to put its own version of the unrest before the international public.        
	Information barely trickled out of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital where protests started on March 10, and from other far-flung Tibetan communities after the government smothered western China with thousands of troops to quell the most widespread demonstrations against Chinese rule in nearly five decades.        
	The government banned foreign media from Tibetan areas and has been attempting to fill the vacuum with its own message. Footage of Tibetan protesters attacking Chinese and an examination of western media Web pages accusing them of biased reporting by ignoring Tibetan violence were disseminated via TV, the Internet, email and YouTube, which has been blocked in China.        
	CNNs bureau in Beijing has been deluged in recent days by a barrage of harassing phone calls and faxes, accusing the organisation of unfair coverage. An email to UN-based reporters in New York from Chinas UN mission sent an Internet link to a 15-minute state television programme showing Tibetans attacking Chinese people in Lhasa.        
	What I have seen in the past few days, as far as western media coverage on China is concerned, is nothing short of a lamentable crisis of conscience, resulting largely from an unquenchable thirst for negativity, controversy and excitement, said the unsigned email.        
	China raised its death toll by 5, to 22, with the Xinhua News Agency reporting that the charred remains of an 8-month-old boy and four adults were pulled from a garage burned down in Lhasa last Sunday  two days after the city erupted in anti-Chinese rioting.        
	The Dalai Lamas exiled government says 80 Tibetans have been killed in Lhasa and 99 in Gansu province.        
	The media barrage underscored that the government campaign is moving into a new phase. While security forces clamp down on protests under a choke-hold of information, the leadership was attempting to shape the crackdown for its own people and foreigners to try to contain any fallout.

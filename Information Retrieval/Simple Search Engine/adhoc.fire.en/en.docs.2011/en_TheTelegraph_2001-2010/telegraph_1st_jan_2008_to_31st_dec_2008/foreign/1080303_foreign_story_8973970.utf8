The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | A Taslimas music makes it   to Korea 
                                                                                                               A Taslimas music makes it   to Korea

	New York, March 2 (AP): When Farah Taslima started composing in the third grade, she never dreamed her music would be performed by the New York Philharmonic by the time she was 12. Even if she had, she never could have imagined it would happen in North Korea.        
	Four members of the orchestra and four North Korean musicians performed Taslimas piece on Wednesday, a day after the 106 members of the Philharmonic performed a historic concert broadcast to the world.        
	Yesterday morning, Farah, her sister and their parents sat in their Manhattan home talking about a congratulatory email from Jon Deak, a Philharmonic double bass player who runs the orchestras teaching programme for child composers.        
	Her little piece, Serenity Unleashed, was a big hit in Pyongyang, he wrote.        
	I was just, like ... I was amazed! Farah said. I never thought something like this would happen. It was awesome.        
	It was no small achievement for the daughter of Khondaker Hossain, who moved to the US from Bangladesh 11 years ago when Farah was a baby.        
	She has not been back to Bangladesh since her family left Dhaka, but said Serenity was inspired by her parents stories about her native land in their Bengali language. It begins quietly, then it gets crazy and out of control, like the busy feeling of Bangladesh, always on the move, she said. And then it goes back to quiet.        
	I didnt know what composing was, but I loved it right off the bat, said Farah.        
	Her family lived in the citys Queens borough, and Hossain worked odd jobs. Last year, he became a New York City Police Department traffic agent.        
	His wife, Shaheen, stays home and takes care of the family, whose members now live in a luxury high-rise behind Lincoln Center that offers some apartments at affordable rents; they won theirs by lottery.        
	 Another daughter, 18-year-old Sarah, attends Columbia University on scholarship.

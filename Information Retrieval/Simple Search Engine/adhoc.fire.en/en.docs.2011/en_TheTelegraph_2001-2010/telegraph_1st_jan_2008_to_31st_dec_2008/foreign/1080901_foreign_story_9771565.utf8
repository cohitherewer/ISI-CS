          PHILIP SHERWELL IN DAYTON, OHIO AND TIM SHIPMAN IN BEAVER, PENNSYLVANIA                          Palin                                  
	Aug. 31: Senator John McCain had met Alaska governor Sarah Palin just once, six months ago, before summoning her to be his running mate on the Republican presidential ticket last week.         
	Her meteoric rise from small-town Alaskan politics to vice-presidential candidate was dramatically illustrated as the McCain campaign revealed the subterfuges that kept her name a secret until shortly before their first joint rally on Friday lunchtime.        
	It was the culmination of a cloak-and-dagger operation more akin to the workings of a clandestine society than a major political party.         
	The Arizona senator first met Palin at the National Governors Association get-together in Washington in February. McCain was impressed by a fellow Republican maverick who shared his zeal for fighting government waste and asked his staff to track her progress.        
	But they did not speak again until last Sunday when the Arizona senator called her to discuss the job.         
	A private jet carrying Palin and a close aide landed in the Arizonan desert town of Flagstaff on Wednesday.        
	Later that night she held talks with top McCain aides Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter in a safe house.        
	The next morning, Palin was driven to the McCain ranch in nearby Sedona.         
	Palin and her aide flew later on Thursday with the two McCain lieutenants to Ohio, where they checked in to a hotel as the Upton family, while McCain made his way publicly to the key battleground state.        
	She was quietly joined by her husband Todd and four of their five children  her three daughters and baby son. The girls were told they were travelling to Ohio to celebrate their parents 20th anniversary, which by chance fell on Friday.        
	Just an hour before the rally on Friday, she texted her eldest son Track and told him to switch on the television.        
	Even her parents were in the dark until the last minute.                                                    THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

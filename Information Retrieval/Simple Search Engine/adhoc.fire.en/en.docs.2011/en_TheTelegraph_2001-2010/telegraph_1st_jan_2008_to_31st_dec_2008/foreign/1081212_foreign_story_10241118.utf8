	Chicago, Dec. 11: President-elect Barack Obama said today he was quot;as appalled and disappointed as anybody quot; by corruption charges against Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and called on him to resign.        
	At a news conference in Chicago to introduce his choice as secretary of health and human services in the new administration, Obama reiterated that he has never spoken to Blagojevich about the appointment of a replacement to serve out the remainder of Obamas Senate term.        
	Obama also said he has not been contacted by any federal investigators regarding the case. He said he has asked his team to gather all the facts about any staff contacts that might have taken place between his office and Blagojevich or his advisers. But he said he was certain that his office had no involvement in any deal-making with Blagojevich on the Senate seat.        
	Questions about the case overshadowed the formal nomination of Thomas A. Daschle to become next secretary of health and human services, a post that Blagojevich had coveted in one of several scenarios involving what federal prosecutors said was the governors plan to sell Obamas Senate seat to the highest bidder.        
	This Senate seat does not belong to any politician to trade, Obama said in opening remarks before introducing Daschle. It belongs to the people of Illinois, and they deserve the best possible representation. In response to questions, Obama said: I do not think the governor at this point can effectively serve the people of Illinois.         
	Todays announcement placed Obama in front of reporters for the first time since he issued a statement yesterday calling for Blagojevich to step down after being charged with a number of corrupt practices.        
	The complaint filed in federal court to support Blagojevichs arrest quotes lengthy conversations between the governor and his chief of staff about which potential Senate candidates might bring them the biggest personal windfall, and whether Obamas election might open the door for Blagojevich to be named to a cabinet position.

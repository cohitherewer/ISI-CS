          JEFFREY GETTLEMAN                              
	Nairobi, Oct. 1: The Somali pirates who hijacked a Ukrainian freighter loaded with tanks, artillery, grenade launchers and ammunition said in an interview today that they had no idea the ship was carrying arms when they seized it on the high seas.        
	We just saw a big ship, the pirates spokesman, Sugule Ali, said in a telephone interview. So we stopped it.        
	The pirates quickly learned, though, that their booty was an estimated $30 million worth of heavy weaponry, heading for Kenya or Sudan, depending on whom you ask.        
	In a 45-minute interview, Sugule spoke on everything from what the pirates wanted (just money) to why they were doing this (to stop illegal fishing and dumping in our waters) to what they had to eat on board (rice, meat, bread, spaghetti, you know, normal human being food).        
	He said that so far, in the eyes of the world, the pirates had been misunderstood. We dont consider ourselves sea bandits, he said. We consider sea bandits those who illegally fish in our seas and dump waste in our seas and carry weapons in our seas. We are simply patrolling our seas.        
	The pirates who answered the phone call yesterday morning said they were speaking by satellite phone from the bridge of the MV Faina, the Ukrainian cargo ship that was hijacked about 200 miles off the coast of Somalia on Thursday. Several pirates talked but said that only Sugule was authorised to be quoted. Sugule acknowledged that they were now surrounded by American warships, but he did not sound afraid. You only die once, Sugule said.        
	He said that all was peaceful on the ship, despite unconfirmed reports from maritime organisations in Kenya that three pirates were killed in a shootout among themselves on Sunday or Monday night.        
	He insisted that the pirates were not interested in the weapons and had no plans to sell them to Islamist insurgents battling Somalias weak transitional government. Somalia has suffered from many years of destruction because of all these weapons, he said. We dont want that suffering and chaos to continue. We are not going to offload the weapons. We just want the money. He said the pirates were asking for $20 million in cash; we dont use any other system than cash. But he added that they were willing to bargain.         
	Piracy in Somalia is a highly organised, lucrative, ransom-driven business. Just this year, pirates hijacked more than 25 ships, and in many cases, they were paid million-dollar ransoms to release them. The juicy payoffs have attracted gunmen from across Somalia, and the pirates are thought to number in the thousands.        
	The piracy industry started about 10 to 15 years ago, Somali officials said, as a response to illegal fishing. Somalias central government imploded in 1991, casting the country into chaos. With no patrols along the shoreline, Somalias tuna-rich waters were soon plundered by commercial fishing fleets from around the world. Somali fishermen armed themselves and turned into vigilantes by confronting illegal fishing boats and demanding that they pay a tax.        
	From there, they got greedy, said Mohamed Osman Aden, a Somali diplomat in Kenya. They starting attacking everyone. By the early 2000s, many of the fishermen had traded in their nets for machine guns and were hijacking any vessel they could catch: sailboat, oil tanker, UN-chartered food ship.        
	Its true that the pirates started to defend the fishing business, Mohamed said. And illegal fishing is a real problem for us. But this does not justify these boys to now act like guardians. They are criminals.        
	The US and several European countries have been talking about ways to patrol the waters together. The UN is even considering something like a maritime peacekeeping force. Because of all the hijackings, the waters off Somalias coast are considered the most dangerous shipping lanes in the world.

          HENRY SAMUEL                              
	Paris, June 30: The auction website eBay has been ordered to pay 40 million euros (31.65 million) to fashion houses Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior for allowing fake copies of their luxury goods be sold on its pages.         
	A Paris commercial court ordered eBay to pay Vuitton and Dior  both owned by the LVMH group  19.3 million euros and 17.3 million euros respectively in damages for selling counterfeit products.         
	It also ordered eBay to pay more than 3.25 million euros to four perfume brands  Christian Dior, Kenzo, Givenchy and Guerlain  for illicit sales of their products, as these should only be sold through specialist dealers.         
	The court banned eBay from broadcasting adverts of perfume or cosmetic goods of these brands or those presented as such.

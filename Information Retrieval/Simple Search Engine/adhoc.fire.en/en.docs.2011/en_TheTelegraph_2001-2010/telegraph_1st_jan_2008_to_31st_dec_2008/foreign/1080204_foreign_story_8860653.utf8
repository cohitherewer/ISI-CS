	London, Feb. 3: UK ministers will announce a crackdown on overseas doctors, including from India, this week in an attempt to prevent thousands of British medics from facing unemployment.
    
	Foreign doctors from outside the European Union, who account for half of all applicants for jobs this year, face a ban on having their specialist medical training funded by taxpayers.
    
	The increased competition from abroad means that three junior doctors will be chasing every post this year.
    
	Ministers are desperate to redress the balance and are preparing a move that Prime Minister Gordon Brown hopes will be seen as backing his declaration of British jobs for British workers last autumn.
    
	A government source said: We need to do something quickly about this and restricting access to specialist medical training is an area where we think we can make a difference.
    
	Thousands of overseas doctors will be hit by the crackdown. Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, said: It is government incompetence which has led to a situation where there are three applicants for every place.
    
	We have a lot of overseas doctors who have been here for years and who have the legitimate expectation they can complete their training here.
    
	Last year, the health department issued guidance that foreign doctors could only be considered for a training post if there was no suitable candidate from Britain or the EU.
    
	However, the guidance was successfully challenged in court by the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, who claimed it was unfairly discriminatory.
    
	Ministers are appealing against the court decision, but the appeal is not due to be heard until later this year.
    
	In the mean time, 16,000 foreign doctors training in Britain have to be treated the same as British candidates applying for a post as a GP or a specialist.
    
	The problems facing junior doctors have been made worse by a cut in the number of training posts from 15,600 to 9,000 after changes camein last year.
    
	Three medical schools have opened in the last decade and a chaotic online application system for junior doctors, introduced last year, has been scrapped.
    
	In the long term, ministers are considering introducing charging for post-graduate training for overseas medics, according to the government sources.
    
	Doctors leaders warn that without changes, thousands of British junior doctors will have to work abroad.
    
	A DoH spokesman said: Any changes to the rules will only affect people applying in the future, not those already here. 
    
	We are considering this issue, there is a Lords appeal soon, and well make further announcements in due course.

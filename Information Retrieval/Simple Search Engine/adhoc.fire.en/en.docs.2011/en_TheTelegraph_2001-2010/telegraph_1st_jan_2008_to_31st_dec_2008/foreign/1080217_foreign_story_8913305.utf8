	Beijing squeeze    
	 Beijing, Feb. 16 (Reuters): An advertisement on Beijings subway proclaiming: Squeezed in?! Go and buy a car then! has angered passengers who said it only encourages traffic jams, a state newspaper said Friday.      
	The advertisement, written in large white letters on a red background, is also contrary to the Beijing city governments aim of getting more people to take public transport, the official Beijing Daily said.      
	Isnt this out of tune with environmental protection? it quoted a subway passenger surnamed Yang as saying. Some Internet users have come up with their own versions of the advertisements slogan, the newspaper said, proposing: Stuck in a traffic jam? Then take the subway!.    
	Golden girl    
	 Mexico City (AP): Mexicos Golden Girl apparently will have a little less gold to spend after draping herself in the countrys flag in an otherwise nude photo shoot. The federal interior department has fined pop diva Paulina Rubio for desecrating a patriotic symbol in a magazine published in October, the daily newspaper Excelsior reported. The fine totalled 52,600 pesos ($4,900), the newspaper said. The photograph, which appeared in the Spanish edition of Cosmopolitan magazine, shows Rubio clutching the flag in front of her apparently naked body.    
	Super shirt    
	 Managua (Reuters): Shirts and caps proclaiming the victory of the New England Patriots  when the American football team actually lost the latest Super Bowl  have ended up in the hands of poor Nicaraguan children. Hundreds of shirts and caps, which had been manufactured in advance to celebrate the Patriots expected victory over the New York Giants, were handed over to children in the southern city of Diriamba. The children are the winners, said Miriam Diaz, of World Vision, a Christian humanitarian organisation.    
	Hasty cast    
	Cambridge, Massachusetts (AP): Christopher Walken sang a song from Hairspray and spoofed a comedy skit to earn Harvards Hasty Pudding Man of the Year award. Before the presentation Friday, Walken, who serenaded John Travolta last year in the latest film version of Hairspray, sang to a Harvard student dressed in drag. Another cast member of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals at Harvard University came on stage banging a cow bell, evoking a skit on the show Saturday Night Live.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obama appoints scientists in team 
                                  (Top) Holdren, Lubchenco				                           
	Washington, Dec. 20 (AP): President-elect Barack Obama today named Harvard physicist John Holdren and marine biologist Jane Lubchenco to top science posts, signalling a change from Bush administration policies on global warming that were criticised for putting politics over science.        
	Both Holdren and Lubchenco are leading experts on climate change who have advocated forceful government response.         
	Holdren will become Obamas science adviser as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy; Lubchenco will lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees ocean and atmospheric studies and does much of the governments research on global warming.        
	Holdren also will direct the Presidents Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. Joining him as co-chairs will be Nobel Prize-winning scientist Harold Varmus, a former director of the National Institutes of Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Eric Lander, a specialist in human genome research.        
	From landing on the moon, to sequencing the human genome, to inventing the Internet, America has been the first to cross that new frontier because we had leaders who paved the way, quot; Obama said in announcing his selections in his weekly radio address.         
	Leaders who not only invested in our scientists, but who respected the integrity of the scientific process.        
	Because the truth is that promoting science isnt just about providing resources  its about protecting free and open inquiry.         
	Its about ensuring that facts and evidence are never twisted or obscured by politics or ideology, he said. I could not have a better team to guide me in this work.        
	In their posts, the four scientists will confront challenges in global warming after years of inaction by the Bush administration, which opposed mandatory cuts of greenhouse gas pollution.

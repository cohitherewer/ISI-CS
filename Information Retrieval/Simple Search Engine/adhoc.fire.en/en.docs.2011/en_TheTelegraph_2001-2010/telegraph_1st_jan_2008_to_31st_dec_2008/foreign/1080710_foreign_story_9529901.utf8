          AISLINN SIMPSON                           Terror legacy                                  
	London, July 9: The son of terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden has appeared on a terrorist film on the Internet calling for Britain and its allies to be wiped out.         
	Hamza Bin Laden, 16, the youngest of the Saudi-born warlords 18 sons, is claimed to be the author of a poem featured on an extremist website to mark the third anniversary of the July 7 London bombings in which 52 people died.         
	In it, the boy dubbed the Crown Prince of Terror, called for an acceleration in the destruction of America, Britain, France and Denmark, the latter singled out for the publishing by its largest selling broadsheet of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed.         
	Oh God, reward the fighters hitting the infidels and defectors. Oh God, guide the youth of the Islamic nation and let them assist with the fighters plans, he continued.         
	God, be pleased with those who want to go for jihad  and blind those who are watching and want to capture them. Grant victory to the Taliban over the gangs of infidels.         
	The poem is thought to have been read out by Hamza himself, and is accompanied by a video clip featuring his father. A short introduction announced: We now offer you a new poem by Sheikh Hamza Bin Laden, may God protect him.        
	Patrick Mercer, the Conservative MP and a former shadow minister for security, said of the reading: We now have the Crown Prince of Terror taking up his fathers mantle. Hamza is the only son from Bin Ladens marriage to his Saudi wife.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tibet a matter of national unity: Hu
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Tibet a matter of national unity: Hu

Vincent met Hu briefly and both leaders said they wanted closer economic ties. Vincent and Hu talked mostly in private for 20 minutes at the forum which takes place every year in Chinas Hainan province. They sat side by side after shaking hands.

	Beijing, April 12 (Reuters): Chinas conflict with the Dalai Lama was purely a question of national unity and had nothing to do with ethnicity, religion or human rights, Chinese President Hu Jintao said .        
	He spoke after China again bared its teeth against foreign critics, denouncing the European Parliaments call to boycott the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics if Beijing does not start talks with the Dalai Lama about Tibet.        
	Hus comments, reported by the Xinhua news agency, were among the clearest yet from the top echelon of Chinas leadership framing the Tibet troubles as an existential threat to the country.        
	Our conflict with the Dalai clique is not an ethnic problem, not a religious problem, nor a human rights problem, Hu said. It is a problem of either preserving national unity or splitting the motherland.        
	Chinese officials have warned that groups campaigning for independence in Tibet have joined Muslim Uighurs fighting for an independent East Turkestan in the northwest region of Xinjiang. Hu, who made his comments in a meeting with visiting Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, also reiterated Chinas position that it was open to talks with the Dalai Lama.         
	The denunciation of the European Parliaments boycott call was Chinas latest unyielding response to foreign criticism after the Tibetan unrest. It used language very similar to Beijings condemnation a day earlier of a resolution by US lawmakers.        
	The parliament called on the EU leaders to consider the option of non-attendance of the opening ceremonies of the Games.         
	Monks arrested        
	Chinese police arrested nine Buddhist monks suspected of bombing a government building in Tibet, Xinhua said today. It said the bombing occurred on March 23.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US spies killed in Pak
                            
	Islamabad, June 27 (AP): A gang of Pakistani militants executed two alleged US spies in front of thousands of cheering supporters today as a top UN official expressed fears that peace deals with the gunmen were sparking a wave of human rights abuses.        
	At least 5,000 people gathered by the banks of a stream in the Bajur region to watch the grisly execution, which highlighted the power of local Taliban forces in the lawless tribal areas near the Afghan border. Masked militants pulled the two blindfolded Afghans from a car and forced them to kneel on the ground.        
	Waliur Rehman, a local Taliban commander, told the crowd that the two men confessed to aiding in a suspected US missile strike last month in the border town of Damadola that killed 14 people. The men revealed the names of others involved, and they would be killed as well, he said. Whoever, for the sake of money, for the sake of America, harms the interest of the Islamic world will meet the same fate, he said.        
	Gunmen with daggers then pounced on one of the men  identified as Jan Wali, 36  decapitated him and waved his bloody head to the cheering crowd. The militants then argued over how to kill the other man because he may have been a teenager, before one of them lost patience and shot him with an assault rifle.        
	UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour said today that she was concerned that the peace deals undermined state authority and left residents vulnerable to a range of human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings. The government has the responsibility to ensure the protection of civilians, she told reporters in Islamabad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pope sorry for clergy abuse
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pope sorry for clergy abuse
          BARBIE DUTTER                              
	Sydney, July 19: The Pope issued a powerful apology to victims of sexual abuse by Roman Catholic clergy, damning paedophile priests for their evil acts and insisting that they be brought to justice.         
	In his most strongly-worded statement yet on the crisis that has engulfed the church globally, Pope Benedict XVI strayed from a prepared homily to castigate abusive clergy and other Catholic personnel for their crimes.         
	I am deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured, and I assure them that, as their pastor, I too share in their suffering, he said during a mass in Sydney, where he has spent the past week for World Youth Day celebrations.         
	These misdeeds, which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust, deserve unequivocal condemnation. They have caused great pain and damaged the churchs witness.        
	It is not the first time the Pope has acknowledged publicly the abuse of children by Catholic priests, but goes further than previous statements by making a specific apology and stating clearly that the perpetrators must be punished.         
	But victims families and support groups in Australia were dissatisfied, saying a sweeping papal apology fell far short of the action needed to secure justice for those who had suffered. Anthony Foster, whose two daughters were raped by a Catholic priest while they were at primary school in Melbourne, said: They are only words. It doesnt commit the resources of the church to the problem.

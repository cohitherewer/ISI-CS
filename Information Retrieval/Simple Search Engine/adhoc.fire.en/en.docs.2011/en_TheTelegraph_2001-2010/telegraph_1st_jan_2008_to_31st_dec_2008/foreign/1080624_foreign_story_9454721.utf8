	New York, June 23 (AP): Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton fulfilled a pledge to a young supporter by speaking at the teenagers high school graduation yesterday.        
	The girl, Aleatha Williams, a campaign volunteer and the daughter of a supporter, introduced the senator to fellow graduates from Pelham Preparatory Academy in the Bronx as my aunt.        
	Clinton said she had known Aleatha and her wonderful mother, Patricia, since the girl was 2 and had promised her when she graduated from eighth grade that she would attend her high school graduation.        
	Four years later, here I am with all of you, Clinton said.        
	The New York senator ended her campaign for the Democratic nomination for President on June 7 and endorsed Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, who has clinched the nomination.        
	 She invoked the campaign to urge the 86 graduates to achieve success.        
	No one five years ago, no one four years ago, when I attended Aleathas graduation lunch, could have predicted that an African-American and a woman would have been competing for the presidency of the United States in 2008, Clinton said.        
	Pelham Preparatory Academy was founded in 2002 as part of an initiative to improve graduation rates by carving up some of the citys large high schools into smaller, more manageable units.         
	Schools Chancellor Joel Klein, who attended the schools commencement ceremony at nearby Fordham University, said students should always remember that an American hero spoke at their graduation.

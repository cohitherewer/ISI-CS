	Washington, May 26: Indian American Bobby Jindal appears to have passed a preliminary test in his choice as the Republican vice-presidential candidate in the November poll.        
	Jindal told WWLTV of Louisiana, where he is governor, in the only interview after this weekends vice-presidential vetting exercise that he would again meet the presumptive Republican presidential candidate JohnMcCain next week.        
	McCain will travel to Louisiana for that meeting, according to Jindal who was one among three potential running mates invited by McCain to his ranch in Arizona during the weekend.         
	There is no indication so far that McCain has scheduled any such meeting with the two other likely running mates who were also invited to his ranch.         
	Jindal told his local TV station that there were absolutely no discussions on choosing a vice-presidential candidate during the Memorial Day weekend gathering of a score or so Republican Senators, governors and other McCain supporters and their wives at the scenic ranch.        
	He is said to be accurate on this count because the weekend exercise was meant merely to give the Republican presidential aspirant a chance to get to know some of his likely vice-presidential choices in an informal setting and assess his level of comfort with each of them.        
	The two other potential running mates who were invited by McCain were Charlie Crist, the governor of Florida, and Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, who lost to McCain in this years primary contests for the Republican presidential nomination.        
	WWLTV spoke to Jindal at the airport as he was leaving Arizona for Louisiana yesterday .The governor said McCains visit to Louisiana next week was to familiarise himself with the states problems in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which became a symbol of US inefficiency and incompetence.        
	Jindal said most of his discussions in Arizona during the weekend were about his states recovery after the natural disaster.

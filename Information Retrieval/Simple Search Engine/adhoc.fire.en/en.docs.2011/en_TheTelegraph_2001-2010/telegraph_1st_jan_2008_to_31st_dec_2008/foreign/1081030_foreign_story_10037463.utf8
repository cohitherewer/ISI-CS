                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BBC in lapse of taste
                              Brand: Crude row                            
	London, Oct. 29 (Reuters): The BBC said today it had suspended Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross for their gross lapse of taste as the row escalates over crude messages they left on the answerphone of actor Andrew Sachs during a radio show.        
	The Radio 2 presenters had joked on air that Brand had slept with the granddaughter of 78-year-old Sachs, who played Spanish waiter Manuel in the classic comedy series Fawlty Towers, and said he might kill himself after hearing their messages. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has joined the voices condemning the presenters actions while Georgina Baillie, Sachss 23-year-old granddaughter, said they should be sacked.        
	In the light of the furore, with more than 18,000 complaints received from the public, BBC director-general Mark Thompson said he had decided to take action.        
	This gross lapse of taste by the performers and the production team has angered licence payers. I am determined that we satisfy them that any lessons will be learnt and appropriate action taken, he said. Thompson said he wanted to add his own personal apology to Sachs.

	New York, Aug. 24 (PTI): When he is not playing tennis and golf with friends, Pervez Musharraf could use his time giving speeches for a handsome fee, like Bill Clinton does.         
	A report in the upcoming issue of Newsweek has said that when the 65-year-old former Pakistan President goes on a pilgrimage to Mecca in the next few days, he may continue travelling on a lucrative speech tour through West Asia, Europe and the US.        
	Chicago-based Embark LLC, the report said, was one of the international public relations firms trying to enrol Musharraf as a keynote speaker.         
	Newsweek quoted public relations executives as saying that the army veterans earnings could approach that of Clinton, who snubbed him during a lightning visit to Islamabad eight years ago.        
	The (speaking) fee for Musharraf would be in the range of $150,000-200,000 a day, plus jet and other VIP arrangements on the ground, Embark president David B. Wheeler said.        
	He said Clinton, for whom Embark has arranged speaking engagements in West Asia, commands up to $250,000 for each appearance.         
	If we did multiple events in multiple cities, Musharraf could get closer to the $500,000-1,000,000 range (for a series of talks), Wheeler was quoted as saying.        
	Embark, which promises unique experiences that educate, entertain and enlighten, has also booked speeches for former US President George H.W. Bush and former American secretary of state Colin Powell, Newsweek said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | CPM plays down riots
                                                                                                               CPM plays down riots
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 17: The CPM today played down the violence in Lhasa, saying it was Chinas internal matter.        
	Party politburo member Sitaram Yechury, asked whether the crackdown in Tibet wasnt a gross violation of human rights, quickly went on the offensive.        
	He asked that if a foreign country spoke of rights abuse in Kashmir, how do we react to that? We say it is our internal matter and we do not agree with such interference in our internal affairs.        
	Yechury added: All I would say is that it (Tibet) is an internal problem of China. The Government of India recognises Tibet as an integral part of China.

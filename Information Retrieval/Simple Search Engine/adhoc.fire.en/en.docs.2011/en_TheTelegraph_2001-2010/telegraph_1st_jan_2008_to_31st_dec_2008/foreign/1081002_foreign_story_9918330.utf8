                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             No hot pursuit of raiders: Antony
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 1 (PTI): The Centre today said it had put together a plan to tackle the threat of piracy on the high seas after 18 Indians were taken hostage by Somali pirates aboard the Panamanian ship MV Stolt Valor 16 days ago.        
	However, the defence minister, A.K. Antony, ruled out hot pursuit as a policy to meet the threat. He said a serious attempt was being made to secure the release of the Indians.         
	 Piracy on the high seas is becoming a serious problem and all nations, mainly those in the Indian Ocean region (IOR), are concerned, he told reporters when asked about the Indian hostages .        
	Antony said hot pursuit against pirates had wider implications. His comments came amid repeated demands from the families of the hostages that the government should try to secure their release as soon as possible.

          DAVID E. SANGER                          Obama during the taping of the Meet the Press programme in Chicago. (AP)                                  
	Washington, Dec. 9: When President-elect Barack Obama talked on Sunday about realigning the American automobile industry he was quick to offer a caution, lest he sound more like the incoming leader of France, or perhaps Japan.        
	We dont want government to run companies, Obama told Tom Brokaw on Meet the Press. Generally, government historically hasnt done that very well.        
	But what Obama went on to describe was a long-term bailout that would be conditioned on federal oversight. It could mean that the government would mandate, or at least heavily influence, what kind of cars companies make, what mileage and environmental standards they must meet and what large investments they are permitted to make  to recreate an industry that Obama said actually works, that actually functions.         
	It all sounds perilously close to a word that no one in Obamas camp wants to be caught uttering: nationalisation.         
	Not since Harry Truman seized Americas steel mills in 1952 rather than allow a strike to imperil the conduct of the Korean War has Washington toyed with nationalisation, or its functional equivalent, on this kind of scale. Obama may be thinking what Truman told his staff: The President has the power to keep the country from going to hell.         
	The fact that there is so little protest in the air now reflects the desperation of the moment. But it is a strategy fraught with risks.        
	The first, of course, is the one the President-elect himself highlighted. Governments record as a corporate manager is miserable, which is why the world has been on a three-decade-long privatisation kick, turning national railroads, national airlines and national defence industries into private companies.         
	The second risk is that if the effort fails, and the American car companies collapse or are auctioned off in pieces to foreign competitors, taxpayers may lose the billions about to be spent.        
	And the third risk  one barely discussed so far  is that in trying to save the nations carmakers, the US is violating at least the spirit of what it has preached around the world for two decades. The US has demanded that nations treat American companies on their soil the same way they treat their home-grown industries, a concept called national treatment.         
	Yet so far, there is no talk of offering aid to Toyota, Honda, BMW or the other foreign automakers that have built factories on American soil, employed American workers and managed to make a profit doing so.        
	If Japan was doing this, wed be threatening billions of dollars in retaliation, said Jeffrey Garten, a professor at the Yale School of Management, who as under secretary of commerce in the 1990s was one of many government officials who tried in vain to get Detroit prepared for a world of international competition. In fact, when they did something a lot more subtle, we threatened exactly that, referring to calls for import restrictions.        
	Garten said he was stunned by the scope of the intervention that Washington was now considering. I dont know that weve seen anything like this since the government told the automakers what kind of tanks to make during World War II, he said. And that was just for the duration of the war  this could be for much, much longer.         
	It is hard to measure just what kind of chances Obama may be taking with this plan, in part because so many parts of it are still in motion.        
	In the short term, Democrats are floating the idea of linking $15 billion in immediate loans to the designation of a car czar who, in doling out the money, could require or veto big transactions or investments  essentially a one-man board of directors.

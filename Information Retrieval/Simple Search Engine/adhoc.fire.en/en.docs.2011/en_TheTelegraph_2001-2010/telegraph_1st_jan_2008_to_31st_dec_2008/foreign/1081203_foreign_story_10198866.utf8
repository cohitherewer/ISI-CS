	Chest trap    
	 London, Dec. 2: Ugandan men have been warned by police of a booby trap after several were knocked out by chloroform smeared on womens chests by criminal gangs, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Victims of the attacks have been discovered by police officers naked with all their possessions having been stolen by the gang, who use the women to lure their prey and rob them when they fall unconscious after intimate activity.       
	Fred Enanga, a spokesman for the countrys Criminal Investigations Directorate, called on all men, and particularly travelling businessmen, to take caution. He said: Its a serious situation and people have to be aware.      
	Enanga said: They apply this chemical to their chest. We have found victims in an unconscious state.       
	You find the person stripped totally naked and everything is taken from him. And the victim doesnt remember anything.

	Rome, Nov. 13 (Reuters): Italys top court has authorised a father to disconnect the feeding tube which has kept his daughter alive for 16 years, removing the last legal hurdle in a landmark right-to-die case that has split the country.        
	Eluana Englaro, who is now 37, has been in a vegetative state at a hospital in northern Italy since a 1992 car crash. Her father Beppino Englaro has been battling his way through Italys courts to seek an end to the life support for more than 10 years.         
	The Cassation Court, in a verdict released today, rejected as inadmissible an appeal against a July ruling by a lower tribunal, which had also authorised  for the first time in Catholic Italy  the removal of the tube.        
	The Vatican, which has condemned the earlier ruling as justifying euthanasia, said it had no comment today. Euthanasia is illegal in Italy. Pro-euthanasia activists hailed the verdict as historic, but political leaders were split over the case.

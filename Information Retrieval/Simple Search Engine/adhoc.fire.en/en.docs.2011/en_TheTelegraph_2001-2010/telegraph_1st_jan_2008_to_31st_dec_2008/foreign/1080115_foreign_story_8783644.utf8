	Berlin, Jan. 14 (Reuters): German academics believe they have solved the centuries-old mystery behind the identity of the Mona Lisa in Leonardo da Vincis famous portrait.
    
	Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant, Francesco del Giocondo, has long been seen as the most likely model for the sixteenth-century painting.
    
	But art historians have often wondered whether the smiling woman may actually have been da Vincis lover, his mother or the artist himself.
    
	Now experts at the Heidelberg University library say dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book by its owner in October 1503 confirm once and for all that Lisa del Giocondo was indeed the model for one of the most famous portraits in the world.
    
	All doubts about the identity of the Mona Lisa have been eliminated by a discovery by Armin Schlechter, a manuscript expert, the library said in a statement today.
    
	Until then, only scant evidence from sixteenth-century documents had been available.This left lots of room for interpretation and there were many different identities put forward, the library said.
    
	The notes were made by a Florentine city official Agostino Vespucci, an acquaintance of the artist, in a collection of letters by the Roman orator Cicero. The comments compare Leonardo to the ancient Greek artist Apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time, one of them a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo.

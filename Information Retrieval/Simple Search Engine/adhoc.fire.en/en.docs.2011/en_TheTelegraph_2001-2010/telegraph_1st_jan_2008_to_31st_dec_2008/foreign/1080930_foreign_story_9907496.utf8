          JESSICA SALTER                          johansson: No rush                                  
	London, Sept. 29: US starlet Scarlett Johansson has married her actor fiance Ryan Reynolds.         
	The couple, who have been dating since spring 2007 and got engaged in May, married in a quiet ceremony at the weekend, according to publicist Meredith Sullivan.        
	The small wedding took place at a resort outside Vancouver, British Columbia, and guests included Johanssons mother, Melanie Sloan, and her brother, Adrian Johansson.         
	Johansson once said that monogamy was not a natural instinct. In a magazine interview she said: Monogamy can be hard work for some people. I dont think it applies to everybody. Last month the 23-year-old actress also insisted she would not rush into marriage.        
	She said: Were just recently, very recently, engaged. So, you know, were just taking it easy. And no big plan yet. But its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged. I mean, Im 23. Theres no reason to rush into it. Everything feels very natural and relaxed.         
	Johansson, who rose to fame as a child actress in The Horse Whisperer, most recently starred in the Woody Allen film Vicky Cristina Barcelona.              
	Mr Reynolds, 31, who began acting as a teenager, starred in the TV show Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place and the romantic comedy Definitely, Maybe.              
	Miss Johansson dated actor Josh Harnett for about two years. Mr Reynolds broke up with singer Alanis Morissette shortly before meeting Miss Johansson.

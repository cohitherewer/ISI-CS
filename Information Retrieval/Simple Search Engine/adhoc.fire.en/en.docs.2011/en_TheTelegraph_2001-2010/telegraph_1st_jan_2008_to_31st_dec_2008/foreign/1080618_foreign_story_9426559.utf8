The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | BP rethink urged in older patients
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BP rethink urged in older patients
                            
	London, June 17 (Reuters): Doctors need to rethink the way they measure blood pressure and focus only on the higher of the two conventional readings in patients older than 50, European experts said today.        
	Systolic pressure  the peak pressure in the arteries at the start of the hearts pumping cycle  is the key risk factor for older patients who are most susceptible to heart problems, they reported in the Lancet medical journal.        
	Since more than 75 per cent of people with hypertension are aged over 50 years, the burden of disease is mainly due to systolic pressure, Bryan Williams of the University of Leicester, Peter Sever of Imperial College London, and Lars Lindholm of Swedens Umea University Hospital wrote.        
	The use of diastolic pressure for diagnosis and risk analysis in our ageing populations has thus become illogical. Diastolic pressure is the lowest pressure in the rest phase of the heart cycle.        
	Measuring only systolic pressure would simplify treatment strategies and make it easier for patients to understand their condition, they argued. It would also focus the minds of researchers at drug companies to develop new anti-hypertension medicines addressing the correct target.        
	Drugs to treat high blood pressure remain an important business for pharmaceutical companies.

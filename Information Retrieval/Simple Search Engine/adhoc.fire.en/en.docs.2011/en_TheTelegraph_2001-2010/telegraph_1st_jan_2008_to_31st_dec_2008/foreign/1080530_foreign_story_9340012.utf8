	New York, May 29 (PTI): George Clooney and his girlfriend Sarah Larson have split after an year of romance, a report has said.        
	The 47-year old actor, director and producer was single again after an year of dating with Larson, People magazine said on its website, quoting a source.        
	The pair initially met in Las Vegas nearly four years ago, when Larson, a onetime Fear Factor winner, was a cocktail server at a whiskey bar.         
	But it wasnt until they met for the second time in June 2007 in Las Vegas that sparks flew.

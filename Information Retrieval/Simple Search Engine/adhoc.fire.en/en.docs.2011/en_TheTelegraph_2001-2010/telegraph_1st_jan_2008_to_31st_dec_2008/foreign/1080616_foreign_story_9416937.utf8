	Kathmandu, June 15: Narayanhitti Palace , the seat of the recently abolished Shah dynasty, was today formally dedicated to the nation as a national museum by Nepals Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.         
	In a solemn function held at the palace, which was vacated by the former King Gyanendra last week, Koirala hoisted Nepals national flag and unveiled the signage and logo of the newly christened Narayanhitti Durbar Museum.         
	The palace guards belonging to Nepal Army were also replaced with personnel from the armed police.         
	The development is significant as Narayanhitti has been the seat of power and object of utmost reverence and as well as fear for most of the 239-year reign of the Shahs. It was also the scene of the 2001 patricide during which the then Crown Prince Dipendra is suspected to have murdered his entire family, including his father King Birendra, in a fit of drunken rage during a family dinner.         
	In his address, Koirala thanked Gyanendra for vacating the palace and giving up his throne in deference to the peoples desire. The recent events are historic as Nepal has transformed itself into a republic without any bloodshed. The former King has to be commended for respecting the peoples wishes and leaving the palace without creating any fuss, he said and urged the people to concentrate on building federal structures in the country.         
	All members of the Constituent Assembly, senior government officials, politicians, diplomats, journalists and others were present on the occasion.         
	Officials said a car gifted by Adolf Hitler to a Nepali king is likely to be displayed in the museum         
	The 1939 Mercedes-Benz presented by the Nazi leader to King Tribhuvan, Gyanendras grandfather, is now rusting at Nepals main Narayanhitti palace grounds        
	With the palace now being declared a museum the government has constituted a high-level committee to prepare an inventory of the palace items including the royal crown, sceptre and throne. The last three items were formally handed over to the government by Gyanendra for safekeeping.

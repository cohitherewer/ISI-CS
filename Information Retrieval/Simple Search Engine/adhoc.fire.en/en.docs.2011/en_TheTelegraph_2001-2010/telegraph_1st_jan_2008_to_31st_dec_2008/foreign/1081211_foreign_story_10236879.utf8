                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Greece paralysed as clashes again rock Athens

	Athens, Dec. 10 (Reuters): Protesters threw fire bombs at police outside parliament today during a general strike which paralysed Greece and piled pressure on a conservative government reeling from the worst riots in decades.        
	Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis announced financial support for businesses damaged in five days of rioting. He also pledged to safeguard people from violence, but did not say how. Government sources have denied rumours emergency measures were being considered.        
	Riots have raged in at least 10 cities and the cost of damage to shops and businesses in Athens alone is estimated at about $259 million, the Greek Commerce Confederation said. In a televised message, Karamanlis announced subsidies, loans and tax relief measures to help those affected.        
	Thousands marched on parliament today in a union rally at economic and social policy, which quickly turned violent. Police fired teargas and protesters responded with stones, bottles and sticks.         
	Participation in the strike is total, the country has come to a standstill, said Stathis Anestis, spokesman for the GSEE union federation.

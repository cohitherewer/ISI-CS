	Islamabad, Dec. 30: Backed by helicopter gunships, tanks and artillery, Pakistani security forces today shut down a crucial supply line for Nato forces fighting in Afghanistan as they launched an offensive against Taliban militants who dominate the Khyber Pass region.        
	Nato uses the Khyber Pass, an ancient trade gateway that cuts through the mountains on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, to transport the majority of provisions for troops fighting the resilient Afghan insurgency. Supplies are ferried 1,126km north from Karachi to Peshawar, and then trucked 64km westward through the pass and into Afghanistan.        
	But Taliban militants, including forces led by an upstart lieutenant to the warlord Baitullah Mehsud, have taken over the area between the pass and Peshawar, and now routinely attack convoys with rocket-propelled grenades.         
	Many drivers in the convoys have already quit making the trip because the route is so deadly. Militants also ransacked a half-dozen supply depots in Peshawar this month, burning 300 cargo trucks and Humvees destined for Nato troops.        
	The attacks  and the Pakistani governments inability to quell them  have sent American military officials scrambling to secure other supply routes into Afghanistan through Russia and Central Asia. Nato officials said that they believed that shutting down the route through the Khyber Pass during the military offensive that began today would not deprive them of necessary supplies.         
	Over all, its a temporary irritation, said a Nato spokesman in Kabul, Captain Mark Windsor of the British Royal Navy. There will obviously be a minor effect in the short term, but its for the long-term good of our operation. However, Tariq Hayat, the top civilian official in the Khyber Agency, the formal name for the Pakistani district between the Khyber Pass and Peshawar, said there was no timetable for the operation, which he said would continue until I am satisfied that the area is clear of all lawless and miscreant elements.         
	 Hayat declined to say how many troops were involved in the offensive, but he said they were drawn almost entirely from the countrys paramilitary Frontier Corps.

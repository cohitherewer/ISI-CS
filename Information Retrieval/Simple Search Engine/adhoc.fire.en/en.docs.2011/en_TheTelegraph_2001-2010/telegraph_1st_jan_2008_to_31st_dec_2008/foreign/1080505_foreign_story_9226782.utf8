	Beijing, May 4 (Reuters): A province in eastern China yesterday recorded 622 new cases of the EV71 intestinal virus, which can sometimes be fatal, even as the country imposed tougher health standards ahead of the Beijing Olympics.        
	The figure brought to 5,151 the number of people infected by Enterovirus 71 in Anhui province, Xinhua news agency today quoted regional health authorities as saying.        
	Anhuis worst hit city was Fuyang, about 750km south of Beijing. A total of 362 cases had been recorded there, Xinhua said, adding that 22 children had died.        
	Kindergartens in Fuyang, which had been due to reopen on Monday after a holiday weekend, will stay closed until May 12 to help prevent the spread of the virus.

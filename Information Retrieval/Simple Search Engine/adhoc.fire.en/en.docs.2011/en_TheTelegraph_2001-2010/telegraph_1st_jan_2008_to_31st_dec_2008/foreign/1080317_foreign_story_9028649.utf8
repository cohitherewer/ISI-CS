	New Delhi, March 16: Indias statement following the violent protests in Lhasa mark a break with its tradition of being extra cautious on the Tibet dispute.        
	Delhis stress on dialogue and non-violence to solve the causes of the unrest almost amounts to a call for talks between Beijing and the Dalai Lama, sources said.        
	Although the foreign office balanced its remarks yesterday by repeating the old stand that Indian territory cannot be used for anti-China protests, Beijing is unlikely to appreciate the overall statement.        
	The sources said that India, a democracy that upholds the ideals of non-violence, could not avoid taking a position on the bloody events that have led to the deaths of innocent people in the Tibetan capital.        
	We are distressed by reports of the unsettled situation and violence in Lhasa, and by the deaths of innocent people, the foreign ministry spokesperson said.        
	We would hope that all those involved will work to improve the situation and remove the causes of such trouble in Tibet, which is an autonomous region of China, through dialogue and non-violent means.        
	The emphasis on dialogue will discomfit China whose previous talks with the exiled monk  in Beijings eyes the main agent stirring instability in Tibet  yielded nothing substantial.        
	The Chinese have alleged that the current unrest has been organised, premeditated and masterminded by the Dalai Lama, whom India hosts.        
	Which is why Indias reiteration that it will not permit anyone to use its territory for anti-China political activities was a crucial balancing act, the sources said.        
	India continues to witness daily anti-China protests by Tibetans in exile, with small groups trying to march into Tibet.        
	Hours after the Centres near-call for China to talk with him, the Dalai Lama was quoted by PTI as saying that Delhi was too cautious on the Tibet dispute. He, however, acknowledged that India had its own limitations in dealing with China.        
	Speaking in McLeodganj, Himachal Pradesh, the 73-year-old Buddhist spiritual leader said that Delhi held hostile views on certain actions by Tibetans, but added that we should not pick up one particular incident. He did not elaborate.        
	Delhi has for years been fearful of rubbing a friendly China the wrong way on the touchy subject of Tibet.        
	The Centre had asked its ministers last November to stay away from a function where the Dalai Lama was honoured for receiving the Congressional gold medal, Americas highest civilian award.        
	A letter sent by the cabinet secretary had made it clear to the ministers that the felicitation was not in conformity with the countrys foreign policy and so did not warrant the presence of any cabinet member.

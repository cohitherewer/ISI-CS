The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | New in Cuba: free sex change

	London, June 7: Cubas new President Raul Castro has decided to offer citizens free sex changes.         
	The development is the latest in a series of eye-catching reforms in state policies since Castro succeeded his brother Fidel in February.         
	Health officials in Havana said the countrys health minister, Jose Ramon Balaguer, has already signed the resolution allowing the operations.         
	Under the new regulations, the procedure will be offered by the countrys universal health service, widely regarded as one of the communist states few successful ventures.         
	So far, 28 Cubans have requested the operation and Cuban surgeons have received training from Belgian doctors in how to carry it out.         
	Cuban doctors first carried out a sex change operation in 1988, but a public outcry from scandalised citizens persuaded the government not to offer them as a routine service.         
	The new policy was spearheaded by Mariela Castro Espin, 46, the Presidents daughter, who heads the National Centre for Sex Education.         
	She has already worked to improve gay rights in the country and has pushed for Cuba to recognise same-sex unions and inheritance rights.         
	If those changes are approved, Cuba will have the most liberal sexuality laws in South America.         
	Since President Castro came to power in February he has ordered a series of reforms in a liberal direction. They include allowing private citizens to own mobile phones in their own names and to rent hotel rooms and cars. Cubans can also buy computers and DVD players. However, there are not many people who can afford them.        
	He has also moved to decentralise the countrys moribund, centrally planned farms, raised pensions and improved salaries for some public workers.

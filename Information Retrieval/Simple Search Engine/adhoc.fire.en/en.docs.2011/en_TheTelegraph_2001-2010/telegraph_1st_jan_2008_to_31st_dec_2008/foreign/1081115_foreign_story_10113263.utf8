	Islamabad, Nov. 14 (Reuters): Pakistan has asked the International Monetary Fund for a $9 billion bailout along with help from other lenders to avert a balance of payments crisis, a finance ministry official said today.        
	Credit ratings agency Standard amp; Poors cited Pakistans tardiness in securing foreign assistance for a decision today to lower its rating on the nations sovereign debt deeper into junk bond territory.        
	We are asking $9 billion from the IMF, they are talking about $7.4 billion. IMF can give us up to $7.6 billion, a finance ministry official said.        
	The international community is concerned that an economic meltdown in the nuclear-armed state could play into the hands of al Qaida and allied Islamist militant groups seeking to destabilise the Muslim nation of 170 million.

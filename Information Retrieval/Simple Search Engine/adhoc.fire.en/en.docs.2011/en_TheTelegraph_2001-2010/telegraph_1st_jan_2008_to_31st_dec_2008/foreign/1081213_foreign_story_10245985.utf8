          ELISABETTA POVOLEDO AND LAURIE GOODSTEIN                          Monsignor Elio Sgreccia at the Vatican. (AP)                                  
	Vatican City, Dec. 12: The Vatican issued the most authoritative and sweeping document on bioethical issues in 20 years today, taking into account recent developments in biomedical technology.        
	It reinforced the churchs opposition to in-vitro fertilisation, human cloning, genetic testing on embryos before implantation and embryonic stem cell research.         
	The Vatican says these techniques violate the principle that every human life  even an embryo  is sacred, and that children should be conceived only through intercourse by a married couple.         
	The 32-page instruction, titled Dignitas Personae, or The Dignity of the Person, was issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vaticans doctrinal watchdog, and has the approval of Pope Benedict XVI.         
	It was developed to provide moral responses to bioethical questions that have been raised in the 21 years since the congregation last issued instructions.         
	The document bans the morning-after pill, the Intrauterine Device and RU 486, saying these can result in what amount to abortions. The church also objects to freezing embryos, because it exposes them to potential damage and manipulation, and raises the irresolvable problem of what to do with frozen embryos that are not implanted. There are hundreds of thousands of these in the US alone, a fact that prompted church ethicists to use this document to reiterate the churchs opposition to in vitro fertilisation.         
	There is no morally licit way to get out the blind alley created by the thousands of frozen embryos already in existence, said Monsignor Elio Sgreccia, president emeritus of the Pontifical Academy for Life, at a news conference here today.        
	The Vaticans intended audience is both individual Roman Catholics, but also doctors, scientists and medical researchers, and legislators who might consider regulating new developments in biomedical technology.         
	In the US, President-elect Barack Obama has said he would end the restrictions on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research that were instituted by President Bush.

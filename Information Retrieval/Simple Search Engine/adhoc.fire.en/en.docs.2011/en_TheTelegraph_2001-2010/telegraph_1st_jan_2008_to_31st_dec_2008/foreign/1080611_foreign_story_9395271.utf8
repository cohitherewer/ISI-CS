	Khartoum, June 10 (Reuters): A Sudanese airliner burst into flames after careering off the runway on landing at Khartoum airport today, killing 100 passengers, Al Jazeera television reported.        
	The broadcaster showed film of the aircraft ablaze in the darkness while emergency workers played water hoses on the burning fuselage. It said the plane had been carrying about 200 passengers.        
	A source at Khartoum airport said the plane was a Sudan Airways flight coming from Syria and Jordan. It was landing at the airport and came off the runway, the source told Reuters.        
	The emergency escape chutes could be seen deployed at the side of the aircraft. Ambulances arrived on the scene.         
	The blaze appeared to be consuming the fuselage and cockpit area.        
	At the time of the landing visibility in the Sudanese capital was restricting visibility.         
	Sudanese soldiers and rebels said today they had clashed in a remote territory of Darfur over the weekend. The rebels said they had killed 157 Sudan soldiers.

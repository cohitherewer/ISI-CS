	London, April 8 (Reuters): Supermodel Naomi Campbell has been banned from flying with British Airways after she was escorted off a flight last week and arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer, media reports said today.        
	The 37-year-old, released on bail pending an investigation into the incident, said she hoped the row with the airline could be resolved amicably.        
	BA said it had not made any announcement regarding Campbell. When asked about a report in the Mirror tabloid saying she had been banned, a spokesman said: We dont comment in detail about matters relating to individual passengers. All incidents of abuse against passengers or staff are taken extremely seriously by BA.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mugabe fails to win in partial recount
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Mugabe fails to win in partial recount
                            
	Harare, April 26 (Reuters): President Robert Mugabes party has failed to win control of Zimbabwes parliament in a partial recount of the March 29 election, results showed today, confirming the ruling partys first defeat in 28 years.        
	Results of a parallel presidential poll have not been released, but the parliamentary defeat increases pressure on Mugabe ahead of an expected run-off against Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).        
	The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission said it did not know when the presidential results would be published. It hoped to compile the recount statistics by Monday and then invite candidates to verify results before making them public.         
	Tsvangirai says he won outright and his party has rejected both the recount and any run-off as an attempt by Mugabe to steal the election.        
	For the first time since Zimbabwes independence from Britain in 1980, the MDC wrested a parliamentary majority from Mugabes ZANU-PF in the election four weeks ago, triggering a recount in 23 out of 210 constituencies.

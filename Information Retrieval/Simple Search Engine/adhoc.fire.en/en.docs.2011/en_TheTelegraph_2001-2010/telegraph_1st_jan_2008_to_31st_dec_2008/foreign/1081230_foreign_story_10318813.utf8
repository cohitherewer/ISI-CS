	Berlin, Dec. 29 (Reuters): Tom Cruise has defied expectations and won favourable reviews from German critics for his portrayal of a Prussian army officer who tried to assassinate Hitler in 1944 in the Hollywood film Valkyrie.        
	German reviewers who were initially highly suspicious have warmed to the film, describing it as a serious work, and Cruise has overcome unease about his suitability for the role.        
	Valkyrie is neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century. Neither is it the action thriller we feared, but it is a well-made and serious film, said public broadcaster ZDF.        
	Cruise plays his part decisively, coolly  a solid performance, though he wont have a sniff at an Oscar.        
	The Hollywood actor plays Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg, who planted a briefcase bomb under a table at Hitlers military headquarters in eastern Prussia on July 20, 1944. The heavy wooden table saved Hitler, who suffered only minor injuries.        
	Stauffenberg was executed the same night with his co-conspirators and his legacy helps ease the burden of guilt about World War II and the Holocaust Germans still endure.

	Harare, July 21 (Reuters): Zimbabwes President Robert Mugabe and Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai today signed a deal laying down the framework for formal talks on forming a power sharing government to end a deep political crisis.         
	It was the first meeting in 10 years between the two rival leaders, who are widely believed to detest each other. They sat at a conference table separated by South African President Thabo Mbeki who mediated the deal.         
	The preliminary agreement was signed in Harares Rainbow Towers Hotel after weeks of deadlock since Mugabe was re-elected on June 27 in a widely condemned poll boycotted by Tsvangirai because of violence against his supporters.        
	Mbeki said the agreement committed both sides to an intense process to try to complete substantive negotiations as quickly as possible. All parties recognise the urgency, he said.         
	A subdued Mugabe said after the signing that the agreement was to chart a new way of political interaction.Tsvangirai called the ceremony a very historic occasion.

	Tokyo, May 7 (Reuters): A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.7 jolted a wide area of eastern Japan early today, including Tokyo, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.        
	There were no immediate reports of damage, although television pictures showed computer screens rocking and hanging objects swinging in a newsroom at public broadcaster NHK.        
	The quake, at 1645 GMT today, was centred around 160 km east of Tokyo, around 40 km below sea level in the Pacific Ocean, the agency and its US equivalent, the US Geological Survey, said.        
	There have been no reports of damage so far. There was radical shaking from side to side, Yoshihisa Wakui, an official in Motegi, around 80 km north of Tokyo, told NHK.        
	I was taking a nap, but then there was such a big shaking. Motegi, in Tochigi prefecture north of Tokyo, was among areas to feel the quake most strongly.

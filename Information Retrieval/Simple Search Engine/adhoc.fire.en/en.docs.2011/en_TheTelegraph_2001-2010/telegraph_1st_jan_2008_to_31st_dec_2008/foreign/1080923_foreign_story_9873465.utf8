	Peshawar, Sept. 22 (Reuters): Gunmen kidnapped Afghanistans top diplomat in Pakistan today after shooting dead his driver in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, police said.        
	Abdul Khaliq Farahi is Afghanistans ambassador designate to Pakistan, but is still serving as consul-general in Peshawar, a post he has held since the fall of the Taliban in 2001.        
	The consul-general was going home from his office when his car was fired upon. His driver has been killed and unidentified men have kidnapped the diplomat, said an Afghan official in Peshawar, who requested anonymity. The security situation in the capital of the North West Frontier Province has deteriorated alarmingly in the past year.        
	The military launched an operation in the outlying areas of Peshawar in June in response to fears that some Taliban or criminal gangs were becoming bolder inside the city. Gunmen fired on a US diplomats car in Peshawar in late August, but she escaped unhurt after her driver took evasive action.        
	After the latest incident involving the Afghan diplomat, an eyewitness told a Reuters journalist at the scene that he saw the gunmens car intercept the consulate car and gunmen shoot the driver before taking away two persons. The witness was led away by police before he could finish his account or give his name. Peshawars police chief, Malik Naveed Khan, could only confirm the kidnapping of the consul-general. We dont know many details, he said.

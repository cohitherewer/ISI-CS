The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Helen says she snorted cocaine
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Helen says she snorted cocaine
                              horrible sniff                            
	London, Sept. 1: Dame Helen Mirren has revealed that she used to love snorting cocaine, but stopped taking it after discovering that a fugitive Nazi war criminal had lived off the proceeds of the drug.         
	The 63-year-old, who won an Oscar last year for her portrayal of the Queen, revealed that she took the Class A drug until the early 1980s. She only quit after reading that Klaus Barbie, who was known for his role in the deaths of 4,000 people during World War II, made a living from cocaine dealing.         
	I loved coke. I never did a lot, just a little bit at parties, she said in a magazine interview. Klaus Barbie was hiding in South America and living off the proceeds of being a cocaine baron. And I I saw how my little sniff of cocaine at a party had an absolute direct route to this horrible man in South America.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Magnetic toys in US recall
                                                                                                               Magnetic toys in US recall
                            
	Washington, March 17 (AP): Toy distributor Mega Brands Inc. recalled about 2.4 million Chinese-made toys today because small magnets could fall out and cause internal damage to children who might swallow or inhale them.        
	If more than one magnet were to be ingested, they could adhere to each other and cause intestinal perforation, infection or blockage, which could be fatal.        
	Mega Brands is recalling 1.1 million Magtastik and Magnetix Jr. toys for pre-schoolers, children below 6 years old.         
	The company and the Consumer Product Safety Commission have received 19 reports of magnets having fallen out of the toys. In one incident, an 18-month-old boy put a magnet in his mouth but did not swallow it.        
	In another, a 3-year-old boy needed medical treatment to remove a magnet from his nasal cavity.

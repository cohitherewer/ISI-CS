	Twin touch    
	 Yorktown (New York), June 23 (AP): Here comes the bride. And here comes the other bride, who looks just like her.      
	Identical twin sisters Francine and Maria Munafo have added their weddings to the list of special events they have shared by marrying in a double ceremony in suburban New York.      
	The 28-year-olds became engaged to their longtime boyfriends on Christmas Day 2006 and married them on Saturday at a waterfront catering hall in Westchester county.      
	They both wore white strapless dresses. But Marias had a touch of magenta and Francines had some green. After sharing their proms, Sweet 16 parties, graduations and now their weddings, the twins have decided to go their separate ways for their honeymoons: Francine and Jeffrey Parkinson are going to Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Maria and Albino Goncalves are visiting the Poconos.    
	Mad mob

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Clooney may give up acting in 10 years
                                                                                                               Clooney may give up acting in 10 years
                            
	Los Angeles, April 2 (Reuters): Ten years from now, George Clooney reckons people are going to be so sick of seeing him on movie screens that he may give up much of his acting career.        
	But dont think Clooney, 46, the suave leading man in many blockbusters in a career spanning more than 20 years, is leaving Hollywood anytime soon. He is turning increasingly to directing.         
	Clooney says he is more successful than he ever dreamed he would be, most recently starring in last years Oscar-nominated drama Michael Clayton and the comedy Leatherheads, which he also directed and which opens on Friday. Ten years from now, I imagine people will be fairly sick of seeing a lot of us who are on camera now, Clooney said. My hope is Ill be directing more.         
	Leatherheads, co-starring Renee Zellweger, marks his third film as a director after Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Good Night, and Good Luck.         
	Clooney said he may begin work on a fourth directing job, tentatively titled Suburbicon written by No Country for Old Men brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, at the end of this year.        
	I like doing it. Its really creative and fun and a place where I want to put most of my focus, Clooney said.        
	It was roughly 10 years ago when he first read a screenplay for Leatherheads. He was a popular television actor on hospital drama ER, but he had suffered through two poorly received movies in Batman and Robin and The Peacemaker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Popular Cuba blog blocked
                                                                                                               Popular Cuba blog blocked
                            
	Havana, March 24 (Reuters): The Cuban authorities have blocked access from Cuba to the countrys most-read blogger, Yoani Sanchez, she said today.        
	Sanchez, whose critical Generacion Y blog received 1.2 million hits in February, said Cubans can no longer visit her Web page (http://www.desdecuba.com/generaciony/) and two other home-grown bloggers on the website on a server in Germany.         
	So the anonymous censors of our famished cyberspace have tried to shut me in a room, turn off the light and not let my friends in, she wrote in her blog today.

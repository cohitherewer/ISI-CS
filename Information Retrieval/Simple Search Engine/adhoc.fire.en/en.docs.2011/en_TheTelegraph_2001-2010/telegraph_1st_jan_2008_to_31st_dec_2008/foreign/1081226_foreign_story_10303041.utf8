	London, Dec. 25: Harold Pinter, the British playwright whose gifts for finding the ominous in the everyday and the noise within silence made him the most influential and imitated dramatist of his generation, died yesterday. He was 78 and lived in London.        
	The cause was cancer, his wife, Lady Antonia Fraser, said today.         
	Pinter learned he had cancer of the oesophagus in 2002. In 2005, when he received the Nobel Prize in Literature, he was unable to attend the awards ceremony at the Swedish Academy in Stockholm but delivered an acceptance speech from a wheelchair in a recorded video.         
	In more than 30 plays  written between 1957 and 2000 and including masterworks like The Birthday Party, The Caretaker, The Homecoming and Betrayal  Pinter captured the anxiety and ambiguity of life in the second half of the 20th century with terse, hypnotic dialogue filled with gaping pauses and the prospect of imminent violence.         
	Along with another Nobel winner, Samuel Beckett, his friend and mentor, Pinter became one of the few modern playwrights whose names instantly evoke a sensibility. The adjective Pinteresque has become part of the cultural vocabulary as a byword for strong and unspecified menace.        
	An actor, essayist, screenwriter, poet and director as well as a dramatist, Pinter was also publicly outspoken in his views on repression and censorship, at home and abroad. He used his Nobel acceptance speech to denounce American foreign policy, saying that the US had not only lied to justify waging war against Iraq but that it had also supported and in many cases engendered every Right-wing military dictatorship in the last 50 years.        
	He admitted, and said he deeply regretted, voting for Margaret Thatcher in 1979 and Tony Blair in 1997. Pinter fulminated against what he saw as the overweening arrogance of American power, and belittled Blair as seeming like a deluded idiot in support of Bushs war in Iraq.        
	His political views were implicit in much of his work. Though his plays deal with the slipperiness of memory and human character, they are also almost always about the struggle for power.        
	The dynamic in his work is rooted in battles for control, turf wars waged in locations that range from working-class boarding houses (in his first produced play, The Room, from 1957) to upscale restaurants (the setting for Celebration, staged in 2000). His plays often take place in a single, increasingly claustrophobic room, where conversation is a minefield and even innocuous-seeming words can wound.        
	In Pinters work, words are weapons that the characters use to discomfort or destroy each other, said Peter Hall, who has staged more of Pinters plays than any other director. But while Pinters linguistic agility turned simple, sometimes obscene, words into dark, glittering and often mordantly funny poetry, it is what comes between the words that he is most famous for. The stage direction pause would haunt him throughout his career.        
	Intended as an instructive note to actors, the Pinter pause was a space for emphasis and breathing room. But it could also be as threatening as a raised fist. Pinter said that writing the word pause into his first play was a fatal error. It is certainly the aspect of his writing that has been most parodied. But no other playwright has consistently used pauses with such rhythmic assurance and to such fine-tuned manipulative effect.        
	Early in his career, Pinter said his work was about the weasel under the cocktail cabinet. Though he later regretted the image, it holds up as a metaphor for the undercurrent of danger that pervades his work. As Martin Esslin wrote in his book, Pinter: The Playwright: Mans existential fear, not as an abstraction, but as something real, ordinary and acceptable as an everyday occurrence  here we have the core of Pinters work as a dramatist.        
	Though often grouped with Beckett and others as a practitioner of the Theatre of the Absurd, Pinter considered himself a realist. In 1962 he said the context of his plays was always concrete and particular. He never found a need to alter that assessment.        
	Pinters ranking among his countrymen was first after Beckett. Beginning in the late 1950s, John Osborne and Pinter helped to turn English theatre away from the gentility of the drawing room.                   
	With Look Back in Anger, Osborne opened the door for several succeeding generations of angry young men, who railed against the class system. Pinter was to have the more lasting effect as an innovator and a stylist. And his influence on other playwrights, including David Mamet in the US and Patrick Marber in England, is undeniable.        
	The playwright Tom Stoppard said that before Pinter, One thing plays had in common: you were supposed to believe what people said up there. If somebody comes in and says: Tea or coffee? and the answer is Tea, you are entitled to assume that somebody is offered a choice of two drinks, and the second person has stated a preference.         
	With Pinter there are alternatives, such as the man preferred coffee but the other person wished him to have tea, Stoppard said, or that he preferred the stuff you make from coffee beans under the impression that it was called tea. Another British playwright David Hare said: The essence of his singular appeal is that you sit down to every play or film he writes in certain expectation of the unexpected.

	Islamabad, Jan. 21: The US will deliver 10 upgraded F-16 aircraft to Pakistan as part of a deal to supply 24 multi-role jets to the countrys air force. 
    
	 The aircraft will be equipped with the latest weapons system including air-to-air missiles, sources told The Telegraph. 
    
	The Pakistan air force, which had signed a deal with the US to purchase 18 brand new F-16 aircraft and 26 orlder versions of the jet in 2006, has already been flying the Fighting Falcons for the last 25 years. They had been purchased in 1982, almost three years after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. 
    
	The US had delivered two F-16s to Pakistan last July, months after PAF inducted two JF-17(Thunder) jets in its fleet. Co-produced by Pakistan and China, the Thunder is doing active service in the air force. Six more jets will be included in the fleet before they are manufactured in the country. Earlier this month, the US defence department awarded a $498.2 million contract to Lockheed Martin Corporation to supply 18 brand new F-16s to Pakistan. 
    
	The Pentagon has already released a list of defence contract awards, which include an authorisation to Lockheed to sell 12 F-16C and six F-16D planes to Pakistan.

	Karachi, April 9 (Reuters): At least seven people were killed in clashes between supporters and opponents of President Pervez Musharraf in the southern city of Karachi today, hospital officials said.        
	The violence is the first since a new government made up of Musharrafs opponents was sworn in just over a week ago.         
	Television footage showed a policeman firing shots in the air to disperse angry mobs who were setting fire to cars and petrol pumps.        
	A Reuters reporter saw the bodies of two men who, according to hospital officials, had been killed in shooting. Five charred bodies were later recovered from an office building which was set on fire, police told Reuters.        
	The violence erupted in various parts of the city and protesters set on fire several vehicles, a senior police officer, Azhar Farooqui, told Reuters. The situation is tense but under control, he said.        
	The violence broke out after anti-Musharraf lawyers clashed in court with his supporters. The city has been tense since angry protesters assaulted Arbab Ghulam Rahim, a Musharraf supporter and former chief minister of Sindh, on Monday as he was coming out of the provincial Assembly in Karachi.        
	Another vocal supporter of Musharraf, former federal minister Sher Afghan Niazi, was thrashed by angry lawyers in the eastern city of Lahore today.        
	Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), a pro-Musharraf party which holds sway in Karachi and other Sindh cities, blamed anti-Musharraf lawyers for violence.        
	The (anti-Musharraf) lawyers beat Sher Afgan in Lahore and today they beat our lawyers who were holding a peaceful protest in Karachi. This is a shameful act, Haider Abbas Rizvi, a senior MQM leader said. But lawyers leaders rejected accusation.        
	Everyone saw, even mediamen were there, that the MQM-backed lawyers stormed the bar building and ransacked our offices, Naeem Qureshi, secretary-general of Karachi Bar Association said.        
	This is an attack on the campaign for the restoration of judiciary and democracy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bangla allows Hasina to go abroad
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bangla allows Hasina to go abroad
                            
	Dhaka, June 9 (Agencies): Bangladesh courts trying detained former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on graft charges ruled today that the hearings could continue in her absence, paving the way for her to go abroad for medical treatment.        
	Hasina asked yesterday for permission to allow lawyers to appear on her behalf after a government-appointed medical board suggested she should be sent abroad immediately for treatment. Now it is just a matter of time when she will take the journey abroad, said an official of Hasinas Awami League.        
	The government has decided to give her an opportunity to go abroad for treatment. She will be released through an administrative order, chief prosecution lawyer Sharfuddin Ahmed Mukul said here. Mukul said Hasina, who was the Prime Minister from 1996 to 2001, could be released as the court had returned her passport. However, the cases against her would continue.        
	As word spread that Hasina might leave the country, hundreds of party leaders and workers gathered outside the special jail in Dhakas sprawling parliament compound, many with flowers. Security has been tightened around the jail.        
	Hasina is suffering from high blood pressure, eye problems and hearing impairment caused by grenade blasts at a rally in Dhaka in 2004, which killed 23 leaders and workers of her party.        
	Her arch-rival and fellow former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, who is also facing corruption charges, said yesterday that she would not seek medical treatment abroad, accusing the government of setting a trap ahead of an election planned in December.        
	I will not go abroad for treatment in any way, I will undergo treatment at home, the BNP leader, who was arrested in September under graft charges, told reporters and questioned the motive behind the proposal to send the two leaders abroad.

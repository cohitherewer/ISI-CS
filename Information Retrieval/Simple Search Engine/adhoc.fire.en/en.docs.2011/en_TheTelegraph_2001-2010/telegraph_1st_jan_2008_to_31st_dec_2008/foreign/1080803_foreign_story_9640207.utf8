	Yeoh kick    
	 Los Angeles, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Not many actresses have given strong, emotional performances and kicked major butt in the same film, but fortunately for fans of the Mummy movies, Michelle Yeoh is one.      
	Yeoh, 45, stars in The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, the third in a series of box office hits about adventurer Rick Connell (Brendan Fraser).      
	 this newest version, Yeoh portrays a Chinese sorceress, Zi Yuan, who puts a curse on an ancient emperor only to see him rise from the dead after 2,000 years to seek vengeance.      
	Zi is one of a group of people, including Connell, who must put the emperor back in his grave, and she uses not only her fists, but her wits and poise, as well. Its a small, but important role, Yeoh said. She was so much about being one with the world and Mother Nature, and there was a certain amount of understanding in her that you could see behind her eyes.

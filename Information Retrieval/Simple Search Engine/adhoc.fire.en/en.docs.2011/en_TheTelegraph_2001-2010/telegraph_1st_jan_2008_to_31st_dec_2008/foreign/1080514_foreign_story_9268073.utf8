Dont cry, take heartache leave
          KAREN KRIZANOVICH                          Harder at work                                  
	London, May 13: Going through a nasty divorce? Splitting up with your loved one?        
	Crying your eyes out at work wont boost your career or make you popular with peers, so maybe now is the time to tell your boss about heartache leave, a benefit newly available to employees of the Japanese firm Hime amp; Company.         
	While birth, bereavement and marriage are all rites of passage for which employees are allowed time off to recover, this Tokyo-based PR firm has identified another situation that demands a break: the break-up.         
	No matter whos done the dumping, the companys boss, Miki Hiradate, says that Hime amp; Co employees whose personal lives have become fractured can request heartache leave.        
	The policy is laid out on the company website, www.himeclub.com: Many companies have maternity leave and claim they are kind to women because of this People may take sick leave, yet not for heartache. But people would find it harder to be at work in such a situation, making simple mistakes, doing strange things.        
	Taking heartache leave means no one will have to watch you sadly checking your mobile for the I still love you texts that never come, or writing a memo while blowing your nose. And youll be at less risk of accidents when that special song comes on the radio while driving.         
	The time permitted for recovery is brief, however. One day off work is granted to those in their early 20s, two days for the mid-20s and a luxurious three days for those who are 30 or over.

	Panama City, Dec. 6 (AP): Panama said its canal is open to all, including a Russian warship sailing through the waterway yesterday.        
	The destroyer Admiral Chabanenko is the first Soviet or Russian military ship to traverse the 80-km waterway since World War II.        
	The US government has shown little concern about the destroyers trip through a canal that was off limits to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.        
	The destroyers journey to the Western Hemisphere, however, reflects Russias growing influence and anger with the US for using warships to deliver aid to Georgia after its August war with Russia.        
	Panamanian foreign minister Samuel Lewis portrayed the Russian canal crossing as business as usual. Here there is no other message than that the canal is open to all of the worlds ships, he said.        
	The warship is part of a fleet that is the first Russian navy deployment to the Western Hemisphere since the Cold War. Before arriving at the canal, it took part in joint exercises with Venezuelas navy.        
	Also yesterday, Russia said it was sending its sole aircraft carrier and several accompanying ships for combat training in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.        
	The destroyer entered the canal last night and was expected to take eight hours to reach the Pacific. Following its passage, the Admiral Chabanenko will dock at what was once the base for all US naval activities in South America.        
	The US government handed over the Rodman Naval Station and the canal to Panama nearly a decade ago, and the waterway has since become a symbol of Panamas true independence.

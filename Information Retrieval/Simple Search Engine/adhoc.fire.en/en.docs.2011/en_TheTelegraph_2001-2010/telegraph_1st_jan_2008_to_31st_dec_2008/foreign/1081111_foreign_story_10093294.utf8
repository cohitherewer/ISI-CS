	Dhaka, Nov. 10 (Reuters): A Bangladesh Special Court today sent four former ministers, and key allies of ex-Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, to jail until a court hearing later this week for alleged graft, court officials said.        
	They are from Zias Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its main ally, the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party. The four  Saifur Rahman and A.K.M. Mosharraf Hossain of the BNP and Moulana Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid of the Jamaat  are among high-profile contestants in the December 18 parliamentary election.        
	Analysts said the court decision could cast fresh doubts on whether the election would be held on schedule, or possibly make the BNP and Jamaats participation more unlikely.

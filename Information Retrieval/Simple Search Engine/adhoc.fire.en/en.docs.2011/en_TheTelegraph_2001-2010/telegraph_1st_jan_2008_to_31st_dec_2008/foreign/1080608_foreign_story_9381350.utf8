	Arvada (Colorado), June 7 (AP): Police in a Colorado town say theyve caught two thong bandits who used womens underwear to disguise themselves during a convenience store robbery.        
	Ninteen-year-old Joaquin Rico turned himself in yesterday, two days after 24-year-old alleged accomplice Joseph R. Espinoza turned himself in.        
	A surveillance video released last week by police in Arvada, Colorado, shows two unarmed men inside the store. One man wore a green thong and the other wore blue. Each thong barely covered the mans nose, mouth and chin.

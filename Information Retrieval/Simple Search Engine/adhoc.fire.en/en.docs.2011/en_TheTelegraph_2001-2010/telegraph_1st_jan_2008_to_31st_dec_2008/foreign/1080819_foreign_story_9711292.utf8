	End of Knight    
	 Los Angeles, Aug. 18 (Reuters): Big-screen Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. scored his second number one movie of the summer yesterday as Hollywood spoof Tropic Thunder ended the month-long reign of The Dark Knight atop the North American box office.      
	Tropic Thunder, a farcical combat movie within a comedy that also stars Ben Stiller and Jack Black, grossed $26 million during its first weekend in US theatres, bringing its five-day estimated total to $37 million.      
	Downey who appears in the film in blackface, portraying a white actor playing a black action hero, also starred in the summers first chart-topping movie, Marvel Studioss Iron Man.      
	The Dark Knight slipped to number two with $16.8 million in ticket sales in its fifth weekend of release but became the second-highest-grossing film ever.

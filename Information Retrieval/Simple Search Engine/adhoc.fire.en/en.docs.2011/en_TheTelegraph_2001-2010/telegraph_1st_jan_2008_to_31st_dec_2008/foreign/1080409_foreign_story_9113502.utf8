	Melbourne, April 8 (PTI): Climate change can force beer lovers around the world, especially in Australia, to shell out extra money for buying the drink, a scientist warned today.        
	The beverage is expected to get dearer as the production of malted barley  an ingredient in the making of beer  faces a decline in Australia due to drought conditions, according to Jim Salinger of New Zealands National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research.        
	Most areas in Australia where malted barley is cropped are likely to experience production declines, salinger said. Barley production in the main growing region of New Zealand  from where brewing giant Lion Nathan gets about 70 per cent of its malted barley  would also be affected.

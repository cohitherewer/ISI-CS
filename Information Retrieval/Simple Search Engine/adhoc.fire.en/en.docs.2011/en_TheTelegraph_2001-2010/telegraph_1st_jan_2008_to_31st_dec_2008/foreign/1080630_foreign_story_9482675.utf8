          ROGER DOBSON                          George Clooney                                  
	London, June 29: Stubble is the way to win a womans heart, a study has shown. Researchers found that women are more attracted to men with stubbly chins than those with clean-shaven faces or full beards.         
	Women participating in the research rated men with stubble as tough, mature, aggressive, dominant and masculine  and as the best romantic partners, either for a fling or a long-term relationship.         
	The findings of the experiment, carried out on British women aged 18 to 44, could explain the appeal of actors such as George Clooney and Brad Pitt who cultivate their unshaven look.         
	The explanation for the preference is not clear, but experts in human evolution say that facial hair may be a signal of aggression because it boosts the apparent size of the lower jaw, emphasising the teeth as weapons.        
	Psychologists at Northumbria University who carried out the new study believe that stubbly men may offer women the best worlds  not too strongly masculine, but mature and with the potential to grow a full beard.         
	The researchers carried out the study using computer technology to alter pictures of 15 mens faces so that they displayed different degrees of hairiness. Five levels were used  clean-shaven, light stubble, heavy stubble, light beard and full beard.         
	The pictures were shown to 76 women who were asked to rate them for masculinity, aggression, dominance, attractiveness, age, and social maturity.        
	Faces with full beards were judged to be the most masculine, aggressive and socially mature. They were rated the least attractive and the worst choice for a short-term relationship.        
	Men with light beards were considered the most dominant. Those with light stubble were rated the most attractive and as the ideal romantic partner for the short or long term. Clean-shaven men finished bottom for masculinity, dominance, aggression, and social maturity.

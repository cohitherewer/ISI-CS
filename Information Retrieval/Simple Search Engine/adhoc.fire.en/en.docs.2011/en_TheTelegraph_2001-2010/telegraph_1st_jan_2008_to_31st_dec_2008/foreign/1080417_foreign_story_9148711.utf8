                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Vitamins can shorten life
                            
	London, April 16 (Reuters): Vitamin supplements taken by millions of people in the hope of extending their lives may actually increase the risk of premature death in some cases, researchers said today.        
	Scientists reviewed 67 studies on 230,000 people to see whether so-called antioxidant vitamins prolonged life expectancy.         
	They found that vitamin C, often taken in an attempt to ward off colds, seemed to have no positive or negative effects.        
	Vitamins A and E, traditionally used to help strengthen bones and improve circulation, showed if anything, increased rates of mortality.

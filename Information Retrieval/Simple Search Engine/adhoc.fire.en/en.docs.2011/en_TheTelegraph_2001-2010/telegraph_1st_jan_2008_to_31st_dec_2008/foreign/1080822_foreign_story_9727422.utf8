	London, Aug. 21: Iran has banned a popular actress from leaving the country after she starred in a Hollywood movie without permission from Iranian authorities.         
	The ban was imposed after Golshifteh Farahani, 25, took part in Ridley Scotts Body of Lies with Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. Farahani is the first Iranian-based female actor to star in a Hollywood movie.         
	She found out about the ban on Tuesday when she wanted to travel to Hollywood to examine a new offer, an unnamed source told the official news agency Irna. It said Iranian movie stars must obtain permission from the culture ministry before appearing in foreign movies.         
	Body of Lies, expected to be released in October, is the story of an agent who travels to Jordan to track down an al Qaida leader.

	Beijing, Aug. 10 (Reuters): President George W. Bush today worshipped at a Beijing church in a bid to press for wider religious freedom in China and met the countrys communist leaders for what he promised would be candid discussions.        
	Bush, who has insisted sports and politics do not mix, spent the day blending high-level diplomacy with some Olympic fun  watching a gold medal win by American swimmer Michael Phelps and seeing Chinese President Hu Jintao for private talks.        
	I enjoy our conversations ... our relationship is constructive and its important and also very candid, Bush said as he sat down with Hu after earlier attending a prayer service at a communist government-sanctioned church.        
	I had a very uplifting experience going to a church, he said and thanked Hu for helping to arrange the visit.        
	I feel very strongly about religion, Bush added. He has repeatedly said he uses private talks with Hu to discuss frankly human rights as well as freedom of speech and religion in China.        
	Bushs trip to Beijing has been a delicate balancing act, enjoying the Olympic games and praising China on a variety of issues while publicly nudging China to improve its internationally criticised record on human rights.        
	Despite Chinas rejection of his prodding on religion, Bush, a frequent churchgoer with a strong base among Christian fundamentalists, has made appeals for greater religious liberties a focus of his efforts to coax China toward democratic reforms.        
	Bush declared outside the Kuanjie Protestant church that it just goes to show that God is universal, God is love and no state, man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion.        
	The service, almost entirely in Chinese but translated for Bush and his family, was held in a modest building with a plain white cross on the roof and included a childrens choir performing Amazing Grace in English and Chinese.        
	Many other Christians, who make up only a small part of Chinas religious faithful, worship at so-called underground churches.         
	After meeting Hu, Bush also saw Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Chinas vice-President, Xi Jinping.        
	Bush has also been receiving updates from aides on the rapidly-changing developments on the fighting between Russia and Georgia. And he expressed sorrow for the death of a relative of a US Olympic team coach who was killed by an unemployed Chinese man yesterday.        
	As Bush and Hu sat down for their talks, the Chinese leader focused his remarks to reporters on the Olympics and thanked Bush for his fourth trip to China, the most by a sitting US President.        
	This is a true testament to the importance you place on relations with China, Hu said through a translator.

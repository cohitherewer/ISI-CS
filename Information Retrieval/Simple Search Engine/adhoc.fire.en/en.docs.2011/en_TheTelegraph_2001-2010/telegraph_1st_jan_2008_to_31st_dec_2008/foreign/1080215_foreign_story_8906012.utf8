The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Malaysia to hold early elections on March 8
                                                                                                               Malaysia to hold early elections on March 8
                            
	Putrajaya (Malaysia), Feb. 14 (Reuters): Malaysia will hold a general election on March 8, the Election Commission said today, with the Premier taking the country to the polls early despite growing discord over race and religious issues.        
	The next election was not due until May 2009.        
	Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, in power since 2003, secured the dissolution of parliament yesterday and is viewed as certain to win the poll, but with a reduced majority.        
	He faces a likely swing against the ruling coalition, with minority ethnic Chinese and Indians particularly unhappy with his government, which is dominated by ethnic Malay politicians. Analysts say he is calling a poll now because the electoral mood is unlikely to improve through the rest of his term and that the economy, his main selling point, is slowing down.        
	The vote is also crucial for the Opposition, with the future of its de facto leader, Anwar Ibrahim, at stake.        
	Abdullah dismissed Anwars suggestion that he called early polls in order to exclude Anwar, who is barred from standing for public office until April because of a past criminal record.

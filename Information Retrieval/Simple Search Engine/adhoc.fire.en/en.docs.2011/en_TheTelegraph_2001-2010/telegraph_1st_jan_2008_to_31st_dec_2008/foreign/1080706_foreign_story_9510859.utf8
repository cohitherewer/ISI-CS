The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | AQ Khan case closed, says Pak minister
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AQ Khan case closed, says Pak minister

	Islamabad, July 5 (AP): Pakistans foreign ministry insisted today that its nuclear proliferation case was closed, a day after the disgraced architect of its atomic programme claimed the army under President Pervez Musharraf helped spread the technology.        
	Abdul Qadeer Khan told The Associated Press yesterday that Pakistans army supervised a 2000 shipment of used P-1 centrifuges to North Korea. It must have been sent with the approval of Musharraf, the then-army chief who took power in a 1999 coup, Khan alleged.        
	It was a North Korean plane, and the army had complete knowledge about it and the equipment, Khan said of the shipment. It must have gone with his (Musharrafs) consent.        
	The comments caused a stir in Pakistani media, and newspapers played the story prominently on their front pages today. However, Mohammed Sadiq, spokesman for the foreign ministry, offered only limited comment.        
	The nuclear proliferation issue is a closed case, Sadiq said, reiterating a longtime Pakistani stance. We do not think that a debate is required on it.        
	Also today, Khalid Kidwai, the head of the division that handles Pakistans nuclear arsenal, denied during a briefing with select reporters that the army or Musharraf were aware of the centrifuge transfer, according to Pakistani news channels with journalists present at the briefing.        
	Musharrafs spokesman, Rashid Qureshi, yesterday rejected Khans claims. I can say with full confidence that it is all lies and false statements.        
	Still, Khans allegations would match expert assessments that running such a network would have been difficult without some involvement from Pakistans security apparatus, despite repeated denials from Pakistan of government or army involvement.         
	Khan has been agitating for an end to his virtual house arrest and backed off his 2004 confession that he was solely responsible for spreading nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya.        
	In a speech yesterday, Musharraf made no mention of Khans allegations, but said he would not quit the presidency  as political opponents have been demanding.

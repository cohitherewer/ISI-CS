	New York, Nov. 25: If that headache plaguing you this morning led you first to a Web search and then to the conclusion that you must have a brain tumour, you may instead be suffering from cyberchondria.         
	On Monday, Microsoft researchers published the results of a study of health-related Web searches on popular search engines as well as a survey of the companys employees. The study suggests that self-diagnosis by search engine frequently leads Web searchers to conclude the worst about what ails them. The researchers said they had undertaken the study as part of an effort to add features to Microsofts search service that could make it more of an adviser and less of a blind information retrieval tool.         
	Although the term cyberchondria emerged in 2000 to refer to the practice of leaping to dire conclusions while researching health matters online, the Microsoft study is the first systematic look at the anxieties of people doing searches related to health care, Eric Horvitz said.         
	Horvitz, an artificial intelligence researcher at Microsoft, said many people treated search engines as if they could answer questions like a human expert. Horvitz is a computer scientist and has a medical degree. His fellow investigator, Ryen W. White, is a specialist in information retrieval technology.

	Blinded in air    
	 London, Nov. 7: A man who had a stroke and went blind while flying a plane was guided safely to the ground by a Royal Air Force jet scrambled to come to his rescue, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Jim Neill, 65, was flying his Cessna plane at 15,000 ft when he suddenly lost his sight while suffering a stroke last Friday. Nill, who had taken off from Prestwick airport and was on his way to Colchester in Essex, radioed for help and the RAF responded, sending a jet to his aid. The military aircraft flew alongside Neill and guided him down.     
	Kid driver    
	 Tokyo (AFP): A nine-year-old Japanese boy drove a car alone for 3km to see his grandmother, saying he was confident at the wheel after playing video games. I am sorry, I just wanted to go to my grandmothers house, the boy was quoted as saying when a police officer found him.

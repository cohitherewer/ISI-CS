	Simon lawsuit    
	 New York, July 20 (Reuters): US singer and songwriter Paul Simon has sued a Japanese clock-maker for $5 million for copyright infringement, claiming the company used one of his songs as a composition on its clocks.      
	Simons lawyers accused clock company Rhythm Watch Co Ltd , and its US subsidiary Rhythm USA Inc of using Simons song Bridge Over Troubled Water on 40,000 of its clocks in the last three years without his permission.      
	The lawsuit called the song one of the best- known songs throughout the world in popular music and cited Rhythms Grand Nostalgia Clock as one that plays Simons song without permission as well as other popular songs including My Way.    
	Pope cap     
	 Sydney (Reuters): Pope Benedict XVI, who generally wears a white skull cap known as a zuchetto, was recently given a Mickey Mouse cap with ears. But, to the disappointment of photographers who would have had a field day with such a shot, he did not try it on, but passed it to his aides. A group of young people from Orange County, California, gave the Pope the black cap while they were lunching with him during World Youth Day festivities.    
	All for fuel    
	 New York (Reuters): Some US motorists sick of getting clobbered at the pump seem willing to do just about anything for free fuel, from giving up the right to name their children to stealing from day-care centres to donating blood. In Orlando, Florida, David Partin pledged to name his son after local radio hosts to win a $100 gas card as part of a contest. Partin will collect the card in December, when his son is born, if he can produce a birth certificate proving the baby is named Dixon Willoughby Partin, after the hosts. At the Shady Lady Ranch brothel in Beatty, Nevada, clients who spend $300 or more this month will receive $50 gas vouchers as part of a promotion to beat the summer slump in business.    
	Air stripper    
	 London: A football team on board a US airliner helped to subdue a fellow passenger after he stripped naked and tried to open an exit door, reports The Sunday Telegraph. Three members of the New England Revolution, an American Major League team, sprang into action after the man, whom witnesses said appeared to be in a distressed state, made a beeline for the emergency door at 30,000ft, said the teams general manager, Craig Tornberg.

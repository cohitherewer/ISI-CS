                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jolie tipped as next Catwoman
          LAURA CLOUT                          Berry as Catwoman in the 2004 film                                  
	London, July 29: Angelina Jolie wants to play the role of Catwoman in a future Batman movie.         
	The actress, who gave birth to twins earlier this month, is reported to have already made enquiries with film executives about playing the part.         
	Julie Newmar, who played the feline villain in the 1960s Batman television series, said Jolie would make a fantastic Catwoman should the character be reprised. The latest Batman blockbuster, The Dark Knight, has shot to number one at the box office, pulling in $300 million in a record 10 days.         
	Newmar, 74, said: Angelina would own the part. My industry friends tell me she has already made enquiries about the role. I can understand how it would pique her interest. Catwoman is Batmans one true love. She added: Shes tremendously popular with women because shes both a heroine and a villainess.         
	Other actresses to take on the role include Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether, Michelle Pfeiffer and Halle Berry.         
	The original Catwoman first appeared in the Batman comics as his whip-carrying adversary, with a taste for high-stake thefts. Since the 1990s, the character has become less supervillainess and more anti-hero, as well as being one of Batmans most enduring love interests.        
	Michelle Pfeiffer portrayed the character in 1992s popular film Batman Returns. Halle Berry starred in a stand-alone Catwoman film in 2004.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In India, volunteers pitch in for Obama

	New Delhi, Nov. 4: The US elections have kept Sridhar Venkatesh very busy for the past few weeks.         
	The US citizen, along with fellow Democrat supporters in India, has been burning the telephone lines urging swing voters in America to vote for Barack Obama.         
	Venkatesh is a member of the Indian chapter of Democrats Abroad, a group of volunteers working for Obama, the Democrat presidential nominee.         
	It has been busy days for a while now. We, the Democrat supporters, have been reaching out to US voters, telling them to vote for Obama. I have done it whenever I got time, Venkatesh told The Telegraph over the phone from Chennai.         
	Venkatesh and his associates have planned parties across the Indian metros to watch the counting of votes  and hopefully watch history in the making if the US elects its first African-American President.         
	We have also been working on US nationals based in India to cast their postal votes, Cammie Vallepalli, a Democrat supporter based in Bangalore, said.         
	There are an estimated 70,000 US citizens in India, but there are no figures available on how many of them vote.         
	In New Delhi, six members of Democrats Abroad India made over 200 calls on Sunday night, urging citizens in key swing states to visit a booth and cast their vote  preferably for Obama.         
	The volunteers have been at it for a year, organising events from voter registration to voting for Democrat primaries and facilitating the shipment of postal ballots.         
	It has been tough and hectic for us. We urged the US nationals in India to cast their ballots without fail. Some states accept votes by fax, like California, and others accept postal ballots if they are postmarked November 4, a member in Delhi said.

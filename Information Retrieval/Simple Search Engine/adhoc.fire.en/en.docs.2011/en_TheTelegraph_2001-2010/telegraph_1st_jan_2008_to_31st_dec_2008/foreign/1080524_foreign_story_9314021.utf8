                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sino-Russia attack on US
                            
	Beijing, May 23 (Reuters): China and Russia today condemned the USs plans to set up a missile defence system that Washington says is crucial to protecting the security of it and its allies.        
	Both sides believe that creating a global missile defence system, including deploying such systems in certain regions of the world, or plans for such cooperation, do not help support strategic balance and stability, and harm international efforts to control arms and the non-proliferation process, Russia and China said in a joint statement.        
	It harms the strengthening of trust between states and regional stability. In this respect (the two sides) express their concern, it said.        
	The statement was signed in Beijing by Chinese President Hu Jintao and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who is visiting China.

               Actor Josh Brolin in a scene from No Country For Old Men. Brolin will play President Bush in Oliver Stones film
              
	London, Jan. 21: Oliver Stone is planning to make a new film about the life and presidency of George W. Bush, and is in talks with actor Josh Brolin to play the title role. 
    
	The director has begun quietly running the script by his Wall Street co-writer Stanley Weiser past financiers and is hoping to start filming by April. 
    
	The plan is for the film to be released by November, when presidential elections are held, or at latest by January when Bushs successor will take up his or her place at the White House. 
    
	Stone  who has expressed strong views on Bushs decision to invade Iraq  has said, in an interview with Vanity Fair, that he intends the film to be a fair, true portrait of the outgoing US President, focusing on his family relationships, his childhood and his conversion to Christianity. 
    
	The focus on key moments in the Presidents life would help explain how Bush came to power, the director said. 
    
	It will contain surprises for Bush supporters and his detractors, said Stone. Its a behind-the-scenes approach, similar to Nixon, to give a sense of what its like to be in his skin. But if Nixon was a symphony, this is more like a chamber piece, and not as dark in tone. People have turned my political ideas into a cliche, but that is superficial.
    
	Im a dramatist who is interested in people, and I have empathy for Bush as a human being, much the same as I did for Castro, Nixon, Jim Morrison, Jim Garrison and Alexander the Great. 
    
	Stone  who has made films about President John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon  declined to give his personal opinion of George W. Bush. I cant give you that, because the filmmaker has to hide in the work, Stone said. Here, Im the referee, and I want a fair, true portrait of the man.

                                                                                                            Riot police in Yangon ahead of key event
                            
	Yangon, Jan. 4 (Reuters): Myanmars junta deployed riot police and fire trucks at potential flashpoints in Yangon today to prevent pro-democracy protests on the 60th anniversary of independence from Britain.        
	Riot police took up positions outside the former capitals City Hall and the Shwedagon and Sule pagodas  all key locations in mass anti-junta protests that erupted in September.        
	One government official, who did not want to be named, said local authorities had also been ordered to prepare gangs of Swan-Arr-Shin, or Masters of Force, thugs in case pro-democracy activists tried to demonstrate.        
	The junta, the latest face of 45 years of army rule in the former Burma, limited its celebrations to a military ceremony in the remote new capital, Naypyidaw, and a broadcast message from junta supremo Than Shwe.        
	Repeating an oft-touted slogan, the 75-year-old Senior General urged Myanmars 53 million people to make a firm resolve to build a new, peaceful, modern and developed discipline flourishing nation.

	Sphinx puzzle    
	 London, Dec. 9: The Sphinx may originally have had the face of a lion, according to a British team who claim to have solved one of historys most puzzling riddles, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Egyptologists have long believed that the huge statue on the bank of the Nile depicted an ancient pharoahs head on the body of a lion.      
	The 65ft high, 260ft long limestone sculpture was thought to have been built in the image of a great ruler, probably King Khafra, around 4,500 years ago.      
	But the geologist Colin Reader, who has studied the erosion patterns around the Sphinx in Giza, is now claiming that it was actually constructed several hundred earlier, well before the nearby Great Pyramid.      
	He believes that the style of the Sphinx supports the view that it is older than the other tombs on the site, raising the possibility that the statue had been modified and embellished by later generations.      
	Jonathan Foyle, a historical architect who worked with Reader on his research, has suggested that the statue may have originally have had a different face  most likely that of a lion, as would fit with the rest of the statue.    
	Black bugs    
	 Sydney: An Australian town has been invaded by a plague of dangerous caterpillars, reports The Daily Telegraph. Yandaran, in southern Queensland, has issued a desperate plea for help after it was infested with millions of processionary caterpillars, whose hairs can cause skin irritations in humans and make dogs seriously ill. The black bugs moved in to the town 18 months ago and cannot be eradicated. In scenes likened to a horror movie, they have swarmed over the towns public spaces and back gardens, covering trees, lawns and fences in a thick, moving blanket of insects.    
	Web wives    
	 London: Housewives while away more of their leisure hours on the Internet than anyone else, a new survey has shown, reports The Daily Telegraph. Bored women spend nearly half (47 per cent) of their free time surfing the Web, a higher proportion than workers, the unemployed and even students. And British housewives spend 28 per cent of their free time online, with the figure rising to 32 per cent among 18 to 24 year olds.    
	God letters    
	 Jerusalem (AP): Israeli postal authorities have delivered hundreds of letters to God from across the world to the Western Wall in Jerusalem. A popular Jewish custom holds that prayers will be answered by God if they are written and placed in the 2,000-year-old retaining wall of the ancient Jewish Temple. Every year Israeli officials bring letters addressed to the wall or to God and stuff them into the cracks between the stones in the wall. The sites chief rabbi carried a cardboard box on Tuesday marked Letters to God.

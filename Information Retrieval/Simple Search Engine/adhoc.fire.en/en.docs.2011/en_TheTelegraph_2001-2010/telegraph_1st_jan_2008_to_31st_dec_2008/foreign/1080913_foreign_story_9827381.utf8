                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Venezuela, US in envoy tit-for-tat
                            
	Washington, Sept. 12 (Reuters): The US state department said today it had told Venezuela its ambassador to the US would be expelled in a tit-for-tat diplomatic dispute with Latin Americas Left-wing leaders.        
	In an expletive-laden tirade yesterday, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said he was expelling the US ambassador in Caracas to support Bolivias Leftist President, Evo Morales, who on Wednesday accused the US envoy in La Paz of fomenting violent protests and asked him to leave the Andean nation.        
	We regret the actions of both President Hugo Chavez and President Evo Morales to expel our ambassadors in Venezuela and Bolivia respectively. This reflects the weakness and desperation of these leaders as they face internal challenges, US state department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters.

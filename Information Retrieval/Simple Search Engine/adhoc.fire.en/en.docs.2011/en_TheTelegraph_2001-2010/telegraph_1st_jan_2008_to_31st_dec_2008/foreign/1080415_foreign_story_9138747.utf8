The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Prachandas boys restless for army entry
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Prachandas boys restless for army entry
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                           Nepalis celebrate the new year in Kathmandu on Monday       
	Kathmandu , April 14: As Nepals Maoists continue their spectacular run towards a majority, it is becoming clear they will push for some critical changes even before the new Constituent Assembly can finalise a new governance structure for the country. Chief among them is the integration of the 31,000-strong Peoples Liberation Army into the armed forces.         
	Our soldiers need better training and equipment and the Nepali Army needs to be democratised, Maoist supremo Prachanda told The Telegraph on the eve of elections. This integration and the creation of a new national army is a priority and has to be achieved within a year.         
	PLA soldiers, who surrendered as part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2006, are currently restricted to barracks in seven cantonments across the country under supervision of the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN). They earn Rs 3000 stipends and are meant to remain disarmed until they can merge with the national army. They are restive in the barracks, a Maoist leader said. Often they do not get their stipends on time, but more importantly, they cannot understand why they cannot be accepted and respected as nationalist soldiers. They have been the vanguard of our movement, now they want their rewards and they must get it.         
	But even though the Maoists are set to dominate Nepals agenda now on, the integration of the two armies is easier said than done. The PLA and the Nepali Army were embattled for more than ten years during which they inflicted heavy casualties on each other. Higher ranks dont see eye to eye on a number of key issues including composition and leadership.         
	The Nepali Army has traditionally been, and remains, a deeply royalist force dominated by the feudal Chhetris and Thakuris; it ranks have been recruited almost exclusively from among hill tribals at the expense of aspirants from the Terai, or, Madhes region. It is, in the words of one retired army officer, a force tailor-made to suit the purposes of a monarchy rather than of a modern democractic country.         
	The current Army Chief, General Rukmangad Katuwal, was adopted by the Shah royals and raised inside Kathmandus Narainhity Palace. General Katuwal is known to be personally loyal to King Gyanendra and averse to any integration with the PLA. He probably has his reasons. He senses, perhaps rightly, that if the integration is fast-tracked, his days at the helm are numbered. Besides, the nature of the Nepali Army itself undergo radical changes. Reliable sources in the Nepali establishment suggest that General Katuwal may succeed in delaying the inevitable, using a few levers still at his command  he is very close to New Delhi, for instance, a proximity smelted by united opposition to the Maoists  but not beyond a point. We are living through radical and fundamental changes, a seasoned Kathmandu-watcher said. Everybody must be prepared for new ways, the army probably most of all because they are the ones the Maoists really came up against.         
	The PLA is not only anti-monarchist by definition, it is also a much more inclusive force, having drawn into its ranks fighters from all parts of Nepal. In the way it is composed, the Maoists would like the new national army to be much more like that PLA, which means royalist elements will be either sidelined or purged to create a more egalitarian, less feudal force.         
	It isnt surprising, therefore, that General Katuwal has gone out of his way in recent weeks to deny that he has been negotiating integration with Maoist leaders. Prachanda has openly said General Katuwal is being ridiculous. Emphasising that there already exists a theoretical and formal agreement on integrating the two armies, he told The Telegraph. quot;I do not understand why he (General Katuwal) keeps saying such things. It is not necessary to hide all this any more, we have been having talks, I have myself met army generals and other senior ranks and held discussions. We know some generals are not happy, but this integration has to happen, there is no other way things can be.         
	As his party bags more and more seats, it is increasingly apparent to all Prachandas word will weigh heavier than the powerful General Katuwals.

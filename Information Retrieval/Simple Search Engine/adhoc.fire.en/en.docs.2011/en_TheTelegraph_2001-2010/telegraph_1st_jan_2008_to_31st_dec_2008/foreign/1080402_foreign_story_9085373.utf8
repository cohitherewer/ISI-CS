The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bush murdered on Hamas puppet show
                                                                                                               Bush murdered on Hamas puppet show

	London, April 1: A childrens puppet show in which a Palestinian boy stabs President George W. Bush to death has been broadcast on a Hamas-owned television station in the Gaza Strip.        
	The boy declares: I place my trust in Allah. I need to kill you, before stabbing the US President in the chest in the programme on the al-Aqsa station.        
	The clip, which was broadcast on Sunday, will increase concerns that the isolated Hamas regime is using modern propaganda techniques to encourage children to launch terrorist attacks.        
	The puppet show  an amateurish production filmed in front of a beige cloth  shows the Palestinian boy entering the White House to confront Bush over the deaths of his father and mother during recent wars in Iraq and Lebanon.        
	You and the criminal Zionists also killed my younger and older brothers in the Gaza holocaust. Im an orphan, you criminal! he says.         
	I have come to take revenge with this sword  revenge for my mother and my sisters, he continues.         
	You took everything from me, Bush! I must take revenge on you, with this sword of Islam, the Prophets Al-Battar sword.        
	The quaking Bush puppet  which bears little physical resemblance to the US President  begs for his life to be spared, offering the boy food and toys for all his friends at the White House if he is allowed to live.        
	But the Palestinian child informs him that the White House has already been taken over by Muslims and has been turned into a great mosque which Bush is too impure to inhabit.         
	I will kill you just like Muaz killed Abu Lahab. I will kill you, Bush, because that is your fate, the child exclaims, before stabbing the puppet repeatedly. The clip  translated by The Middle East Media Research Institute (Memri), an independent monitoring organisation  ends with the boys words: Ahhh, I killed him.        
	Last year al-Aqsa prompted a similar controversy by broadcasting a show featuring a Mickey Mouse-like character who urges Palestinian children to support armed resistance.        
	The Israeli foreign ministry denounced the programme and issued a lengthy statement accusing the programme-makers of seeking to indoctrinate Palestinian children to violence, hatred and murder.         
	The issue of what children are exposed to in Israel and the occupied territories is highly sensitive. History books in Israeli schools contain maps that do not mark the so-called Green Line surrounding Gaza and the West Bank.

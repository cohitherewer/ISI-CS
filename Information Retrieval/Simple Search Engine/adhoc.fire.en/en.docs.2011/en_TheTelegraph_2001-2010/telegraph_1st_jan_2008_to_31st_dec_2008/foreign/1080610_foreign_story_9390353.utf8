The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fuel fury spreads in Europe
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fuel fury spreads in Europe
                              French truckers block traffic on the ring road near Bordeaux, France, on Monday. (Reuters)                            
	Madrid, June 9 (Reuters): Spanish truck drivers blocked the border with France to all goods traffic today as fuel price protests in Spain, France and Portugal raised fears of food and petrol shortages.        
	Spanish and Portuguese drivers began indefinite strikes, and lines of trucks up to 8 km long formed on the French side of the border after Spanish picketers smashed the windscreens of foreign goods drivers who tried to enter Spain.        
	French and Spanish truckers also staged go-slow protests, causing long lines of trucks for 30 km in Bordeaux, France, and 20 km or more around Madrid and Barcelona.        
	The drivers were all demanding action to offset the effect of high oil prices, now at record highs of over $139 per barrel.        
	Spaniards fearing fuel shortages queued to fill their tanks and 40 per cent of petrol stations ran out of supplies in Spains hardest hit region, Catalonia, according to one industry group. Long lines formed at Spanish and Portuguese supermarkets after truckers said they could run out of fresh food in days.        
	No one is earning enough money to eat any more: not the truckers, not the fishermen, nobody, and someone has to find a solution, said Jaime Diaz, president of Spains National Road Transport Confederation.        
	Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero postponed a major speech on the economy to grapple with the first big strike to hit Spain during its worst economic slowdown in 15 years.        
	But his Socialist government said there would be no electricity or petrol shortages as truckers picketed distribution centres and called for a minimum haulage tariff to counter a 35 per cent rise in fuel costs over the past 12 months. In Portugal, one group of truckers threatened to block the main roads running south to the Algarve tourist region to prevent goods reaching the area.        
	Few places in Europe are suffering more than Spain, the euro zones fourth largest economy.        
	Nepal today announced sharp increases of about a quarter in fuel prices to stem losses by the state-run oil firm and help overcome a domestic oil shortage. The Nepal Oil Corporation had been subsidising the retail price, prompting it to become short of funds to buy sufficient quantities of fuel from India.

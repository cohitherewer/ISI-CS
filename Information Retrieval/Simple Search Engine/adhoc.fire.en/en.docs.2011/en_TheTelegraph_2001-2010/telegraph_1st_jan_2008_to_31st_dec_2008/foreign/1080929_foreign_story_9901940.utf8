	New York/Islamabad, Sept. 28: US secret forces are intensifying their cross-border raids into Pakistani tribal areas because of fears of a high-profile al Qaida attack during the American election campaign, The Sunday Telegraph has learned.         
	The Pentagon has ordered that raids on suspected terrorist targets within Pakistan be stepped up to pressurise al Qaida leaders and distract them from preparing attacks on American targets elsewhere.        
	The aim is to disrupt their scope for planning and keep their leaders on the move so that it is more difficult for them to co-ordinate complicated plots, a senior US intelligence official said.        
	The operations launched from neighbouring Afghanistan have led to sharply increased tensions with Pakistans armed forces since President George W. Bush recently authorised assaults involving boots on the ground without prior approval by Pakistans government.        
	Those hostilities almost turned lethal last week when Pakistani troops shot at two clearly marked US helicopters, and the two sides then traded fire. The Pentagon said the helicopters were just inside Afghan air space but Pakistani officials insisted they had crossed the volatile border.        
	There were no injuries in the clash but US and Pakistani officers have arranged meetings this week to discuss the tensions.         
	While Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari praised US support for his country as a blessing on Friday in New York, senior officials in Islamabad angrily warned US troops not to intrude on its territory.        
	The US has been increasingly alarmed about the growth of attacks on Nato forces in Afghanistan launched from safe havens established by Islamic terror groups in the lawless mountainous tribal districts just inside Afghanistan.        
	Robert Gates, the defence secretary, told lawmakers last week that an estimated 30 to 40 per cent of attacks in Afghanistan were staged by fighters based in, or commanded from, Pakistan  a significant rise on previous years.        
	The approach of the US election has fuelled fears that al Qaida or its allies, including the increasingly active Haqqani network, will seek a headline-grabbing strike against a symbolic American target such as an overseas embassy.        
	Last weeks devastating truck bomb attack on Islamabads Marriott Hotel further highlighted security concerns in Pakistan. The blast claimed the lives of 53 people, including two US military personnel, the Czech ambassador and a Danish intelligence officer.        
	The level of sophistication and destruction was a message to the international community and the Pakistanis that we can pretty much hit you any place, any time, said Seth Jones, a senior regional analyst with the Rand Corporation, a leading security think-tank.        
	Kamran Bokhari, West Asia director at Stratfor, an intelligence analysis company, said the scale of the attack  involving up to 1,000kg of explosives  was a clear indication that al Qaida or its allies were involved.        
	The target and modus operandi have the signature of a sophisticated jihadi operation, he said.

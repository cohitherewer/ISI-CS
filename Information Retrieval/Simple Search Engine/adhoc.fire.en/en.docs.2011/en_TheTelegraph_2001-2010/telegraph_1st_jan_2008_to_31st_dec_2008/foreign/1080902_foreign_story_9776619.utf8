	London, Sept. 1: The Duke of Edinburgh has taken on the credit crunch by asking his favourite tailor to alter a pair of trousers he first wore 51 years ago.         
	Prince Philip has asked his Savile Row tailor John Kent to change a favourite pair from the baggy style more popular in the 1950s into something more contemporary.         
	The original suit was made of heavyweight worsted cloth, with a distinctive grey and brown herring-bone stripe. The seams have now been unpicked and resewn to narrow the legs.         
	Patrick Grant, one of the directors of the firm Norton amp; Sons, who Kent works for, said: John has been making the Princes clothes for many years and has a royal warrant. About six weeks ago, the Prince sent him a pair of trousers that he wanted recutting to give a slimmer, more fashionable look.

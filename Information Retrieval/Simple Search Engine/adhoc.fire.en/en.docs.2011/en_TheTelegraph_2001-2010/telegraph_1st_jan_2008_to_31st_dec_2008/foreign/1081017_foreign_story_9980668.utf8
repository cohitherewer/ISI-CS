                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       UK unveils new business visa rules
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Oct. 16: Britain provided more details today of a new business visa as part of an overall strategy by Gordon Browns embattled Labour government to be seen to be acting tough on immigration in the run-up to the next general election.        
	 Although Indian businessmen coming to Britain for bona fide work generally have little trouble in getting visas  even multi-entry ones  the government seems determined to make life as difficult as possible with a bewildering array of new rules.        
	 At a time when the battered British economy needs as much help as possible from foreign investors, the government is having to placate the Right-wing in politics as well as public sentiment by frequent pronouncements on the need to cut down abuse in immigration.        
	 The message seems to be contradictory: You are very welcome to come but we dont want you to come because you could be an illegal immigrant.        
	 Under strict new rules those wishing to come to the UK on business for up to six months must apply for a dedicated new business visa and prove they will be carrying out the following activities:        
	Attending meetings or conferences;        
	Arranging deals, negotiating or signing trade agreement or contracts;        
	Undertaking fact-finding missions, checking details or goods; and        
	Conducting site visits and promotional activities.        
	In June new visa routes for business, tourist and family visitors were announced in a shake-up of Britains short-term visa system. The Statement of Intent published today sets out in more detail how the new business visa will work.        
	 Border and Immigration Minister Phil Woolas said: Now we are introducing an Australian-style points system for selective migration, it makes sense to tighten visit visas at the same time. These changes will help create a fairer Britain with fair treatment for those who play by the rules, but tough action against those who break the law.        
	 The ministers comments suggest the government is having to look two ways at once: We want the UK to stay open and attractive to both business and visitors. At the same time we are determined to deliver a system of border security which is among the most secure in the world.        
	 Also today, the Home Office provided further detail on two new visitor routes for sportspeople and entertainers, recognising the important contribution these individuals make to British cultural life.         
	 These new routes mean that an historical concession which allowed sportspeople and entertainers to come here for a short time without a work permit to take part in certain events will be retained.        
	 Under these new routes the following people will now be able to enter the UK using a dedicated new visa:        
	Sportspeople and support staff coming for specific events, such as Wimbledon;        
	Amateur sportspeople joining UK amateur teams for up to six months;        
	Professional entertainers coming to the UK to take part in music competitions;        
	Amateur entertainers travelling to the UK for a specific engagement;        
	Professional entertainers coming to take part in a charity show or where they will receive no fee; and        
	Professional and amateur entertainers taking part in a permit-free festival such as the Edinburgh Festival.

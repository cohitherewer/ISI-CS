	Berlin, Sept. 26 (Reuters): German police boarded a Dutch airliner at Cologne airport today and arrested two men suspected of planning to take part in terrorist attacks.        
	A police spokesman identified the suspected Islamist militants, on a KLM aircraft about to take off for Amsterdam, as a 23-year-old Somali and a 24-year-old German born in Mogadishu.        
	It all went off in quite an unspectacular manner, he said. Police said they suspected the men were planning a violent form of jihad, and had found farewell letters.        
	It looks as if they were on their way to a terrorist training camp, possibly in Pakistan or Afghanistan, said terrorism expert Rolf Tophoven.        
	Somalia is riven by a civil war pitching Islamist rebels against an Ethiopian-backed government. A large number of Somali refugees have moved to western Europe over 17 years of conflict.        
	The origin of the (suspects) is not surprising because Somalia has for some time been a place where al Qaeda commandos stay and make preparations, said Tophoven.        
	Unlike Britain and Spain, Germany has not suffered a major recent attack on its own soil but Germans have been fearful since the northern port of Hamburg was used as a base for planning the Sept. 11 attacks on U.S. targets.        
	Officials had discovered documents in the suspectsluggage which pointed to terrorist intentions, said security sources, but police stressed there was no indication the two were about to launch an attack.        
	German police authorities removed two passengers from the plane...All the passengers had to get out for a check of all the luggage, and they removed the suspects luggage, said a spokesman for KLM.        
	The flight, KL1804, continued its journey to Amsterdam just over an hour later.

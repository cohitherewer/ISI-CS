The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama to confront crisis head-on
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obama to confront crisis head-on

	Chicago, Nov. 7: President-elect Barack Obama said today the US was facing one of its greatest economic challenges and vowed to confront the crisis head-on as soon as he takes office in January.        
	Investors are awaiting Obamas choice of treasury secretary who will spearhead economic recovery, but the President-elect made it clear he would not be rushed into making hasty appointments.        
	I want to move with all deliberate haste, but I want to emphasise deliberate as well as haste, he said.        
	At his first news conference since being elected on Tuesday, Obama noted the latest Labour department figures which showed that US unemployment hit a 14-year-high in October after employers slashed jobs by an unexpectedly steep 240,000.        
	We are facing the greatest economic challenge of our lifetime and were going to have to act swiftly to resolve it, Obama said, as his team of economic advisers, who include businessmen and economists, stood in a line behind him.        
	The brief news conference in Chicago followed a meeting with his 17-member transition economic advisory board on how to tackle the worst economic crisis confronting the US since the Great Depression of the 1930s.        
	Obama said he wanted the Democrat-controlled Congress to pass a second stimulus package as soon as possible to stabilise the economy, which analysts say may be in deep recession by the time he is inaugurated on January 20.        
	We are going to need to see a stimulus package passed either before or after the inauguration. I want to see a stimulus package sooner rather than later.        
	With US automakers also reporting billions in losses today, Obama urged the Bush administration to accelerate a $25 billion retooling assistance plan already passed by Congress.        
	The automakers are lobbying for up to $50 billion to prevent a collapse that could cost over two million jobs.        
	In his first foreign policy pronouncement as President-elect, Obama called for an international effort to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, a day after Irans President urged him to implement a fairer US policy in West Asia.        
	Obama, who has said he does not rule out direct talks with Irans leaders, also called on Tehran to end what he called the countrys support for terrorist organisations.        
	Obama said he would review a letter from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, congratulating him on his election, and respond appropriately.        
	But he said the US approach to Iran could not be done in a knee-jerk fashion. I think weve got to think it through, he said.

	Sydney, April 16: Thousands of Chinese expatriates are mobilising to defend the Olympic torch from pro-Tibet scum when it passes through the Australian capital.         
	Australian authorities fear the torch relay will lead to clashes reminiscent of London and Paris when it is taken on a 12-mile route. Chinese migrants and students are being urged to defend the torch from Tibetan and Falun Gong scum and splittists.         
	Whether you carry a Chinese passport or are an Australian citizen, I believe that each and every one of you, the sons and daughters of China, are as one with us in loyalty and love for the motherland! one letter being circulated among Chinese Australians reads. The Chinese embassy was backing the peaceful show of strength, reports said. A student leader, Zhang Rongan, said diplomats were helping to organise buses, meals and accommodation for protesters.         
	Chinese paramilitary guards, who have been accused of heavy-handed behaviour in London and Paris where they ran alongside the torch, have been strictly prohibited by Australian authorities from having any security role when the torch reaches Canberra on April 24. Australian officials are adamant that the blue tracksuit-wearing Chinese guards travelling with the torch will be confined to vehicles and said they would be arrested if they grappled with any protesters. The answer is no they wont [have any responsibility for security] and, in fact, they could be subject to arrest if they laid a hand on somebody, said Ted Quinlan, chairman of the Canberra relay task force.

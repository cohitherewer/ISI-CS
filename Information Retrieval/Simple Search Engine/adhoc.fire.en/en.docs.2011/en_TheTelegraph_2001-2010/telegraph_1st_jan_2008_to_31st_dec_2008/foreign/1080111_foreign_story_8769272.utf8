	Salma service
  
	 Los Angeles, Jan. 10 (AP): New mom Salma Hayek also has a new job: spokeswoman for the One PackOne Vaccine programme, which will provide tetanus shots for needy mothers and their infants in Africa and Asia.
   
	For every pack of Pampers diapers sold in the US and Canada between April 1 and June 30, the company will donate funding to Unicef for one maternal or neonatal tetanus vaccine.
   
	In our own small way, this is an opportunity for moms like me here in North America to help other mothers on a global level, Hayek, 41, said. Hayeks daughter, Valentina Paloma Pinault, was born in September.

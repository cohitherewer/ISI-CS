The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama to defy critics, court celebrity vote
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obama to defy critics, court celebrity vote
          TIM SHIPMAN                          Obama in Honolulu, Hawaii. (Reuters)                                  
	Washington, Aug. 9: Barack Obama is to defy the critics who have branded him a shallow celebrity politician by holding the most star-studded political convention in American history.         
	A list obtained by The Daily Telegraph shows an unprecedented number of Hollywood personalities and rock stars being lined to play a role in the Denver convention, where Obama will formally receive the partys nomination at the end of the month.         
	The decision to let some of them take to the centre stage is a calculated gamble by Obama to stick to his guns in courting the celebrity vote. It comes after his Republican rival John McCain landed a telling blow last week, mocking him as the Paris Hilton of the White House race in a so-called attack ad.         
	Obamas strategists have concluded that the publicity gains from rubbing shoulders with actors like George Clooney, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon will outweigh the risks of appearing lightweight.         
	The list of those approved for credentials to attend the event includes the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who recently filmed a campaign advertisement for Obama.         
	Hollywood royalty, including Quentin Tarantino, Spike Lee, Warren Beatty, Susan Sarandon, Forrest Whitaker and Scarlett Johansson, will also be in Denver, as well as singers Kanye West and Wyclef Jean. Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones may also put in an appearance.         
	It is a high risk strategy in a country where Hollywood is associated with the liberal values despised by many in Middle America.         
	The Republicans released an advert targeting Obama, featuring images of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears with a voice over: Hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead?         
	The spot immediately gave McCain more YouTube hits than Obama for the first time since February. Narrowing polls showed that the Republican message had struck a nerve with voters.

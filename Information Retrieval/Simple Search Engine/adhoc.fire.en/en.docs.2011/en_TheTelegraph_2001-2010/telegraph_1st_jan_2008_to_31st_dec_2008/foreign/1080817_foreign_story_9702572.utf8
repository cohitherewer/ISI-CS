	Kathmandu, Aug. 16: Four months after the Maoists won the Constituent Assembly elections, the former rebels completed the first part of their political agenda after Prachanda became the first Prime Minister of the Nepal republic.         
	The 54-year former school teacher was yesterday elected as the Prime Minister with a thumping majority trouncing his only rival  former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress. While Prachanda polled 464 of the 551 votes, Deuba managed to get only 113.         
	Assembly chairman Subash Chandra Nemwang announced Prachandas victory after the counting was completed. Caretaker Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who was present in the Assembly, was the first to congratulate Prachanda.

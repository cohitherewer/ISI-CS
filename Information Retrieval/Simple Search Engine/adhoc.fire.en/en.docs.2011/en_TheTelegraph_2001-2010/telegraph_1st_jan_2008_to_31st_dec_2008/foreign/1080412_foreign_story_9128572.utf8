	London, April 11: Washing fruit and vegetables is not enough to rid them of harmful bacteria that cause illness, scientists have warned.        
	Salmonella and E.coli can cling together to form a film that protects them when the surface of food is washed, it is claimed. Other bugs can work their way inside the leaves and crevices of lettuce, spinach and other fruit and vegetables where they cannot be rinsed away.        
	The research, presented yesterday at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society, suggests that even using disinfectants to wash food does not guarantee that it is safe.         
	Many pre-prepared salads are washed with chemical sanitisers such as chlorine but the bacteria can still persist, the conference was told. In 2006 more than 12,500 people contracted salmonella, which is predominantly transmitted through meat, raw eggs, milk and contamination of cooked food by infected raw food.

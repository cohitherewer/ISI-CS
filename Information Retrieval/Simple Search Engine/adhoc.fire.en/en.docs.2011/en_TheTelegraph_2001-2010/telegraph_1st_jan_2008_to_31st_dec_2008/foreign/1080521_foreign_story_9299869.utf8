	Coat case    
	 New York (AP): Lindsay Lohan is being sued by a New York City college student who claims the Mean Girls actress took her mink coat without permission and kept it for more than two weeks.      
	Maria Markova says the 21-year-old Lohan took the $12,000 golden sheared mink coat while in a Chelsea nightclub in January.      
	The 22-year-old Markovas lawyer, Merrill Cohen, says she called Lohans people and demanded the coat. She says Markova got the coat back on February 14.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US seeks talks
                                                                                                               US seeks talks
                            
	Beijing, April 2 (Reuters): US treasury secretary Henry Paulson raised the sensitive topic of unrest in Tibet during a visit to Beijing today, urging a resolution to the issue through dialogue.        
	Paulson was the most senior US official to visit China since protests broke out in Tibet that burst into a deadly riot on March 14. The violence was followed by more protests across ethnic Tibetan areas. As you might imagine, I expressed our concern about the violence and urged a peaceful resolution through dialogue, Paulson said.        
	I made that point, I felt, in a very appropriate way to the appropriate people, he said. Paulson met President Hu Jintao, Vice-Premier Wang Qishan and foreign minister Yang Jiechi, among other officials. He is due to meet Premier Wen Jiabao tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Deadly dozen diseases on rise
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Deadly dozen diseases on rise

	New Delhi, Oct. 7: Cholera, ebola and plague are among 12 diseases that a new report has dubbed as the deadly dozen infections whose footprints are likely to expand into new territories with climate change.         
	The report from the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society is based on an analysis of how higher average temperatures and changes in rainfall and habitat is likely to influence the reach of various disease-causing microbes.         
	Avian influenza, intestinal parasites, sleeping sickness, tuberculosis and yellow fever are among the diseases that could spread with rising temperatures, according to the report released at the World Conservation Congress in Barcelona today.         
	Several earlier studies have also suggested that climate change can influence illness patterns around the world.         
	Research has predicted that higher temperatures would allow mosquitoes to thrive longer during the year and thus raise the risks of malaria, dengue and Japanese encephalitis. Earlier studies had also indicated that changing rainfall patterns could lead to resurgence of cholera epidemics.         
	Even minor disturbances (in ecosystems) can have far reaching consequences on what diseases they might encounter and transmit as climate changes, said Steven Sanderson, president of the Wildlife Conservation Society.         
	The report said cholera occurs when water temperatures rise, while outbreaks of ebola haemorrhagic fever  which can kill 9 out of 10 infected people  have been related to unusual variations in rainfall and dry seasons.         
	Changes in rainfall are also expected to alter the distribution of rodents and fleas and raise the risk of plague, the report said.         
	Climate change can also push the tsetse fly into new areas. Sleeping sickness, caused by the bite of the fly, kills 40,000 people each year mainly in eastern and sub-Saharan Africa. New mosquito breeding patterns could push yellow fever into new areas, the report said.         
	It said severe winter storms or droughts could disrupt normal movements of wild birds, increasing their contact with domesticated poultry and raise the risk of spreading H5N1 virus which causes a deadly form of avian influenza.         
	The report has listed babesiosis and lyme disease  both transmitted through tick bites  among the deadly dozen, warning that the infections could affect animals and people.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | No malice in W: Oliver Stone
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       No malice in W: Oliver Stone
                              US actor Josh Brolin as President Bush in a scene from W. (AP)                            
	Los Angeles, Oct. 10 (Reuters): Oliver Stones film portrait of President George W. Bush was always going to be controversial given the directors liberal leanings.        
	So Stone decided to open W. in US theatres less than three weeks before Americans select their next President  a calculated move aimed at prodding voters to think about the past eight years and the future.        
	The movie is part drama, part satire, yet the director of JFK and Nixon argues it is no hatchet job on Bush  and so far, critics agree. The final verdict awaits the October 17 debut for one of this autumns most widely anticipated films.        
	Whoever wins this election, Bushs impact has changed the world, Stone told Reuters. This man has left us with three wars  in Iraq, Afghanistan and the war on terror  and the legacy of the pre-emptive strike.        
	These are legacies that will haunt his successor for years. Its good for people, before the election, to think about who they elected eight years ago and about where we are as a country right now, the three-time Oscar winner said.        
	With Josh Brolin in the title role, W. is a rare movie about a sitting US President, made by a director whose past films have been criticised for mixing fact and fiction. Yet Stone says audiences will not find the partisan portrait his critics might expect from the director of Vietnam war film Platoon and Cuban documentary Looking for Fidel.        
	It was not our intention to bring malice or judgment on George W. Bush and his administration. He and his administration clearly speak for themselves, Stone said.

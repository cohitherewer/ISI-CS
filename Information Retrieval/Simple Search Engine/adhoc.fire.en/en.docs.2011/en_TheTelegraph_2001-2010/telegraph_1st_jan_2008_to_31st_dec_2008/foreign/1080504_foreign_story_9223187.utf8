          RICHARD ALLEYNE                          St Johns College, Cambridge University                                  
	London, May 3: A Cambridge undergraduate has been accused of demeaning women for taking part in the British finals of Miss Universe.        
	Hollie Booth, 20, who is in the first year of a natural sciences course at Kings College, has been picked from more than 500 women to be one of the 41 finalists in the beauty contest, which will be held in London tomorrow.        
	But rather than being congratulated by fellow students, she has spent most of her time fending off accusations that the competitions are an affront to women. Booth, from Birmingham, gained A grades in math, physics, chemistry and biology at A-level and an A in further math at AS-level. She has 10 A* GCSEs.        
	Sandrine Lvque of Object, an organisation that campaigns against gender stereotyping, said: This is another sign of a worrying trend in which we are seeing the resurgence in quite outdated institutions such as beauty pageants. It is as if we are going back to the 1970s. These contests are all about treating women as sex objects.        
	But Booth, who is also a member of the universitys cheerleaders, is angry at the criticism. She said: Everybody is a sexual object in some way, shape or form: human beings are sexual people. If we werent, we wouldnt be here. Male muscle competitions are no different, and I bet you dont get a load of men burning their Y-fronts over it. Its not degrading in any way and gives women an amazing opportunity. Some feminist groups take things a little bit too far.         
	If she wins the British final of the worldwide beauty search, which is run by the American tycoon Donald Trump, she will enter the 57th annual Miss Universe final which will be held in Vietnam in June. Booth, whose father is a development manager for a construction firm, entered Miss Universe because she has previously worked for the events chosen charity, The Joshua Foundation.

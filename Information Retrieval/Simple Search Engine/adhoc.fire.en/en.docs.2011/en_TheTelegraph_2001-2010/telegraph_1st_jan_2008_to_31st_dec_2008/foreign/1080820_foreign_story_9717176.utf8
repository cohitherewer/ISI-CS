	Dogs in bags    
	 London, Aug. 19: Celebrity pet-owners like Paris Hilton, Britney Spears and Geri Halliwell have prompted a sharp rise in the demand for miniature handbag dogs, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The number of chihuahuas insured by Sainsburys has leapt 417 per cent since 2006, apparently spurred on by celebrities who carry their small dogs. In the same period the overall number of small pedigree breeds the supermarket chain insures has risen by 41.3 per cent.      
	Heiress Paris Hilton is often photographed holding her chihuahua, Tinkerbell, while singer Britney Spears has owned three of the small-breed pets.       
	Spice girl Geri Halliwell has a shih-tzu named Harry, and even took the dog with her when she met Tony Blair at Chequers. However, Sainsburys has warned against choosing a pet on the basis of fashion.

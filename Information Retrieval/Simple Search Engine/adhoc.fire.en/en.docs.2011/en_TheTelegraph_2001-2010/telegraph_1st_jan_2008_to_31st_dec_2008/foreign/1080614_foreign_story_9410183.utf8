                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Blow to EU after Ireland no to treaty
                            
	Dublin, June 13 (Reuters): Irish voters rejected a treaty today to overhaul the EUs unwieldy institutions, putting the entire blocs reform plan in peril and humiliating Irelands political leaders.        
	The pact, known as the Lisbon treaty, failed by a margin of 53.4 to 46.6 per cent in the only EU country to put it to a popular vote.        
	No vote supporters cheered loudly for several minutes, interrupting an official as he read out the results.        
	Prime Minister Brian Cowen called the vote a source of disappointment to my colleagues in government and to me. In a democracy, the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box is sovereign.        
	The treaty was an effort to resurrect EU reforms that were torpedoed by French and Dutch voters in 2005. This time all countries but Ireland avoided a referendum. The No vote means a country with fewer than 1 per cent of the EUs 490 million population could doom the treaty.

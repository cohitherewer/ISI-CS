          LUCY COCKCROFT                          Simply a lie                                  
	London, July 28: Sir Sean Connerys son Jason has spoken to defend the James Bond actor from accusations that he is some sort of monster or tyrant who has mistreated him.         
	Jason Connery, 45, also an actor, said he was truly sick of reading articles which claim he will be cut off from his fathers wealth.        
	The allegations were made by his mother, Diane Cilento, who claimed in an interview that he would not be inheriting a penny of Sir Seans 85 million fortune.        
	Connery, who starred in the TV series Robin of Sherwood, said: I feel compelled to respond to the article because it was so full of outrageous and hurtful lies and fabrications.        
	I am truly sick of reading about my father and our relationship and of his being portrayed as some sort of monster or tyrant who rules my life by cutting me off from his wealth. This all could not be farther from the truth.        
	He added that his father had earned this money, through nothing but his own tireless hard work, and what he does with it and who he gives it to is completely up to him. However he insisted: He and I have never had a conversation where he said: You will never receive a penny or anything to that effect. That is simply a lie.        
	Connery, who developed his interest in acting while at Gordonstoun School for Boys in Scotland, stressed his Oscar-winning father had been supportive and full of invaluable feedback throughout his career. The article, based around an interview with Cilento, Sir Seans former wife and Connerys mother, had alleged that father and son had a fractious relationship.

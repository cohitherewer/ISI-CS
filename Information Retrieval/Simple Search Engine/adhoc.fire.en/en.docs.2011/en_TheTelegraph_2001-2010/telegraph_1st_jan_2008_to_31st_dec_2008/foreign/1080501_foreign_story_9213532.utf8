          ANDREW MCKIE                          Hofmann: Wonder drug                                  
	London, April 30: Albert Hofmann, the Swiss scientist who invented LSD and became the first person in the world to experience a full-blown acid trip, has died. He was 102.         
	He was working as a chemist in Basel, when he synthesised lysergic acid diethylamide. On April 19, 1943, he took the substance before cycling home. That day has become known among aficionados as Bicycle Day as it was while he was riding home that he experienced the most intense symptoms brought on by the drug.         
	At home I lay down and sank into a not unpleasant intoxication-like condition, characterised by an extremely stimulated imagination, Hofmann said of the experience.        
	In a dream-like state, with eyes closed (I found the daylight too unpleasantly glaring), I perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colours, Hofmann said, according to a profile for a meeting on LSD, held in Switzerland in 2006 to mark his 100th birthday. After some two hours this condition faded away.        
	Rick Doblin, who studied Hofmanns work as part of his own research and knew Hofmann well, confirmed he died of a heart attack at 9am yesterday at his home in Basel.         
	As well as LSD, Hofmann later became the first person to synthesise psilocybin, the active constituent of magic mushrooms.         
	He also discovered the hallucinogenic principles of Ololiuqui (Morning Glory), lysergic acid amide and lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide.         
	In retirement, Hofmann served as a member of the Nobel Prize Committee. He was a Fellow of the World Academy of Sciences.         
	In 1988, the Albert Hofmann Foundation was established to assemble and maintain an international library and archive devoted to the study of human consciousness and related fields.         
	He disapproved of the appropriation of LSD by the youth movements of the 1960s, but regretted that its potential uses had not been explored.         
	Hofmann  who believed LSD was useful in analysis of how the mind works, hoping it could be used to recognise and treat illnesses like schizophrenia  defended his wonder drug and problem child for decades after it was banned in the 1960s.

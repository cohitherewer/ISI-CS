	Cookie rogue
 
	 Kuala Lumpur, Feb 4 (Reuters): Malaysian police have arrested a thief who fell asleep after snacking on cookies in the home of his victim and was discovered curled up in bed clutching a stolen purse, a newspaper said today.
 
	V. Sathya, an insurance manager in the northern Malaysian state of Terengganu, said his nine-year old son was startled to find the intruder sleeping in his bed, with a blanket pulled over his head, after the family returned from a shopping trip.
 
	He shouted and ran out of his room, Sathya told the Star newspaper. Even then the burglar did not wake up and carried on sleeping while holding on to one of my wifes purses.
 
	The thief also ate up the cookies the family had prepared for Chinese New Year celebrations next weekend.
 
	My wife had prepared various delicacies over the past few days but the rogue ate everything, said Sathya, who is married to an ethnic Chinese. 
 
	Jolie Heart
 
	 Santa Barbara, California (AP): Angelina Jolie travelled up the California coast to receive the Santa Barbara International Film Festivals Performance of the Year award. The 32-year-old actress was honoured on Saturday for her portrayal of Mariane Pearl, wife of slain journalist Daniel Pearl, in the film A Mighty Heart. It was one of the few awards that Jolie has collected personally.

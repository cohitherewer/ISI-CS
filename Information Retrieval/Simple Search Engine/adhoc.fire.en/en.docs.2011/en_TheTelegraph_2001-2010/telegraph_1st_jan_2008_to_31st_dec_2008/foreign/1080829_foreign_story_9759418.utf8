	Dhaka, Aug. 28 (Reuters): Six army officers sentenced to death or life in jail in Bangladesh for the prison murders of four politicians over 30 years ago have been acquitted by the high court, officials said today.        
	In 2004, a lower court sentenced three officers to death and 12 others to life in prison for their role in the 1975 killings, but today two of the capital sentences and four of the life terms were overturned.        
	We have acquitted some of the accused as police failed to produce adequate evidence against them, excerpts from the verdict read. Most of those involved have been on the run for over three decades, although four of the original gang of 15 are serving sentences on other convictions.        
	The prison murders came shortly after the assassination of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family by army rebels in August 1975.        
	The 15 originally convicted all held the rank of major or above and were charged with murdering four of Mujiburs detained associates.        
	Sheikh Hasina, one of his two surviving daughters, filed a murder suit against the accused after she became Bangladeshs Prime Minister in 1996.                        Tareque Rahman      
	Khaleda son gets bail        
	Tareque Rahman, elder son and political heir of Bangladeshs detained former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, has been granted bail by a court and is likely to be released soon, lawyers and officials said.        
	A government minister said Khaleda is also likely to be released from jail where she has been held on corruption charges. The details are still being worked out.

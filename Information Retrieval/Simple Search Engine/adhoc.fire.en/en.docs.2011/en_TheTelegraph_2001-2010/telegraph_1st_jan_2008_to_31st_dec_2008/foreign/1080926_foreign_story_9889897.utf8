	Bunny crunch    
	 London, Sept. 25: Playboy bunnies have become the latest victim of the credit crunch, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	 Tycoon Hugh Hefner has been advised to cut back on staff at his multi-million dollar glamour empire as it struggles to cope during the global economic turmoil.       
	The 83-year-old has been told to lay off some of his staff at his Los Angeles and New York offices as soon as this month or go bankrupt. The company has recently seen shares fall from 6.20 to 1.55.       
	 An insider at the company told the Daily Star that bosses had been aware of the worsening situation for a while. The news will be another blow to Hefner who recently discovered that two of his bunnies may have been cheating on him.     
	Dental dare    
	 London: A German dentist overpowered a female patient in her home and yanked out two dental bridges from her mouth because she had failed to pay her bill, The Daily Telegraph reports. The dentist from the Bavarian town of NeuUlm is now under investigation for assault and theft. He arrived at the womans home and without saying a word forced open her mouth and removed 320 worth of dental work which the womans insurance company had refused to pay.

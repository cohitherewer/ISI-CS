	Islamabad, July 6 (Agencies): A suicide bomber killed at least eight people and wounded 23 in an attack on police guarding Islamists marking the anniversary of an army commando raid on Islamabads Lal Masjid.        
	PTI put the toll at 19, including 18 policemen.         
	The attack will raise questions about the new governments policy of trying to end militant violence through negotiations.         
	President Pervez Musharraf, whose power has withered since his allies were defeated in the February election and who has been facing calls to step down, said on Friday more radical mosques would emerge if extremism and militancy were not tackled.        
	The blast happened several hundred metres from the city-centre mosque, shortly after a tightly guarded meeting of Islamists there had ended.        
	Worshippers could be seen streaming out of the mosque after the explosion. Sirens were heard across the city as ambulances raced towards the scene.        
	There were conflicting casualty figures with several senior policemen and city officials saying more than 10 people had been killed. A security official said 12 people had been killed, all but one or two policemen.        
	But the interior ministry said eight people had been killed and 23 wounded.        
	The police were going back to their stations when it happened, said senior police officer Kamran Adil.        
	The primary target was our men.        
	Body parts, pools of blood and police equipment littered the road and nearby walls were pocked by shrapnel.        
	The governments top interior ministry official, Rehman Malik, told reporters the bomb had been caused by a suicide bomber and the police had found the upper part of his body.        
	The attack is likely to add to worry among stock investors, whose confidence has been undermined by political squabbling, insecurity and economic problems, including inflation running at more than 20 per cent.        
	Stocks have been sliding and the rupee set a new low against the dollar last week.         
	Earlier today, several thousand Islamists listened to fiery speeches at a protest meeting at the mosque to mark the first anniversary of the army raid on the complex.        
	More than 100 people were killed when commandos stormed the Lal Masjid complex, which included a madarsa, on July 10 last year, after a week-long siege that began when gunmen from the mosque clashed with the police outside.        
	Speakers told the crowd, most of them men, that Musharraf was to blame for the bloodshed last year.        
	Pervez Musharraf, you thought you could crush the Islamic movement by attacking the Lal Masjid, but we are telling you, you have failed, Shah Abdul Aziz, a cleric and former member of the parliament, told the crowd.        
	It was done at the behest of America and Bush. But I want to tell America jihad will continue, it will never stop, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Palin takes populist war to Obama
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Palin takes populist war to Obama

	Minneapolis/St Paul (Minnesota), Sept. 5: A final, eight-week run for the White House has begun in earnest with the end of the nominating conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties.         
	As the US presidential campaign enters its most intense phase, it appears that the populist contest may be between the 47-year-old Barack Obama, born to a Kenyan father and Sarah Palin, a 44-year-old greenhorn in national politics, to whom many American voters relate to as the girl next door.         
	Palins debut in national politics, her speech at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night, was watched by 37.2 million Americans, according to Nielsen Media Research Inc, the organisation which tracks television viewership in the US.         
	Obamas unorthodox acceptance speech at a stadium before 84,000 people in Denver last week similarly had a television audience of 38.4 million people during prime time.         
	These figures cover only commercial television channels and do not include public broadcast networks, which may have brought in another estimated four million viewers.         
	Viewership for Obama and Palin topped the average figures for the Beijing Olympics at 27.7 million and even for the hugely popular American Idol show at 28.1 million.         
	Viewership figures for Republican presidential candidate John McCain, who accepted the partys nomination last night, are not yet available, but they are certain to be far less than those for Obama or Palin.         
	In 2004, when George W. Bush accepted the nomination for his second White House run, about 10 million Americans fewer than Palin watched his address to his party.         
	Last week, when the Democratic Partys vice-presidential choice, Joe Biden spoke in Denver, he had a national audience of only 24 million. McCain is 72 and will become the oldest first-term President in history if he is elected in November. Biden is 65.         
	Both have been around in Washington for several decades unlike either Obama or Palin. The curiosity factor over their candidacies and Americas yearning for a generational change will, therefore, make the November election a contest between Obama and Palin at the populist level.         
	The only factor that can change this situation is if Palins candidacy, already controversial, ruins the chances of Republicans putting up a serious fight in this years election.         
	Skeletons continue to tumble out of her cupboard after a series of allegations, including ethics violations, were made a day after McCain unexpectedly picked her as his running mate. The National Enquirer, a scurrilous, but popular tabloid sold mostly at supermarkets across America, this week ran a story alleging that Palin has had an extramarital affair with her husbands business partner.         
	The McCain campaign is threatening to sue the paper.         
	Normally, an allegation in this tabloid would be dismissed as gossip, but the paper has recently acquired some credibility over its relentless exposure of an extramarital affair by two-time Democratic presidential aspirant John Edwards.         
	This morning came another revelation that Palins lawyer has started questioning potentially damaging witnesses against the governor in a legislative investigation in Alaska that she misused her position as governor and tried to get her former brother-in-law dismissed from his government job.         
	The Palin family was angry with the state trooper for divorcing the governors sister. In his acceptance speech, McCain tried to distance himself from the unpopular legacy of President Bush. I dont work for a party, he said. I dont work for a special interest. I dont work for myself. I work for you.

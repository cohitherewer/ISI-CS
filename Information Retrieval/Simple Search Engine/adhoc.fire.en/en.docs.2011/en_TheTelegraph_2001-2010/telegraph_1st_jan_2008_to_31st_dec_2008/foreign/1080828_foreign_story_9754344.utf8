	Denver, Aug. 27: At this years Democratic National Convention here in Denver, it is easy to get that nagging feeling that something is, well... not right.         
	Maybe a better word is different.        
	As the convention enters its penultimate day, it is possible to put a finger on what is different.        
	This convention is reminiscent of the meeting in the Central Hall of Parliament in December 1984, when Rajiv Gandhi was elected leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party following his landslide victory which outstripped Jawharlal Nehrus record in the Lok Sabha.        
	Like in the Central Hall almost 14 years ago, there is a generational change in Denver. Gone are many of the speakers Democrats have been used to listening to at their conventions for decades as a matter of routine.        
	Jesse Jackson, that veteran of many battles for coloured people and a presidential aspirant in 1984 and 1988, was replaced as the opening speaker during prime time on the opening day of the convention by his son, Jesse Jackson Jr, a member of the US House of Representatives from Illinois, who is also a close, personal friend of Barack Obama, who is only 47.        
	Also gone was the Reverend Al Sharpton, one of the best orators in the party, but an old face for civil rights and progressive causes. Sharpton gave one of the best speeches at the 2004 convention, which matched that of Obama, who was the partys keynote speaker four years ago.         
	Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving offspring of John F. Kennedy, took the stage in Denver. The shy, hitherto apolitical Caroline, was one of two persons whom Obama asked to prepare a shortlist of his vice-presidential choices.        
	Senator Edward Kennedy, another veteran of Democratic national conventions for almost half a century, made what may be his farewell speech to the party plenary.         
	Several thousand delegates openly wept as Kennedy spoke. He was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour in May and underwent brain surgery in June. It was only at the eleventh hour, at his insistence, that doctors allowed the Senator to travel to Denver. Even then, it was not clear until the time a video tribute was screened at the convention whether he could stand the strain of all the adulation he received from the delegates.        
	Then, for the first time, a woman is the chairperson of the 2008 Democratic National Convention: Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the US House of Representatives. Pelosi is not young and does not represent any generational change, but she does signal gender change at a convention that failed to nominate a woman  Hillary Clinton  as candidate for the White House almost by a whisker.        
	More than 50 per cent of this years Democratic convention delegates are women.         
	In a gesture that underlined Obamas reliance on the youth vote for a victory in the November election, the convention organisers shortlisted 10 delegates under the age of 30 to speak on the opening night. Amanda Kubik, 27, a graduate student from North Dakota, was chosen from this shortlist, even if she had the floor only for two minutes.

                          Apple CEO Steve Jobs . (AP)                    
	Cupertino, California, Oct. 14 (Reuters): Apple Inc today cut the price on its entry-level notebook computer to $999 and introduced a line of aluminum-clad machines starting at $1,299 in moves catering to budget-minded buyers at a time when recession fears loom over the global economy.        
	Many analysts had expected the entry-level notebook price to fall to $899.        
	Chief Executive Steve Jobs, looking thin but active, put the focus on the new line of MacBooks, although he took a few moments at the end to joke about his health.        
	His blood pressure was 110 over 70, he said. And thats all were going to be talking about Steves health today, he added lightly, referring to concerns earlier this year that the cancer survivors health was deteriorating.        
	He said he would not take questions on the economy or his health.        
	The new line of metal notebooks, starting at $1,299, are in what Gartner analyst Van Baker called the sweet spot of Apples line. Previously a white plastic-body machine held the spot. The biggest news is the $1,299 MacBook, he said.        
	The $999 price will be for an updated model of the white-body notebooks. The new aluminum machines will use Nvidia Corp graphics and Intel Corp processors.        
	When asked if Apple would get into the market for small netbook notebook computers, Jobs said,Its a nascent market, and that Apple would see how it went.

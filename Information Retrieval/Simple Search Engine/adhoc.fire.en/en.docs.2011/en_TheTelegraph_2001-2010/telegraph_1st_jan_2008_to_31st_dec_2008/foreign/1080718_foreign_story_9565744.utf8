                              Janeena Basra                            
	London, July 17 (PTI): An Indian-origin beauty queen has unwittingly sparked a controversy by winning a contest in a region where she does not reside.         
	Janeena Basra, 23, who is a resident of Leeds, was declared winner of the Miss Halton Pride in Cheshire, across the Pennines. She triumphed over Donna Hayes, who is considered a native local contestant.         
	Halton locals believe the winner should be from nearby Runcorn or Widnes and not someone who is not a resident of the area. More than 50 comments appeared on a local newspaper website voicing displeasure over Basras win.         
	Where is the justice in a girl from Leeds being crowned? wrote a reader while another wrote: Isnt it about time that Miss Halton was picked from girls who actually live in Halton?        
	Winning xthe Halton title qualifies Basra to contest the finals of the Miss England contest to be held in London tomorrow.         
	The winner of the contest will represent the country at the Miss World contest in Ukraine.

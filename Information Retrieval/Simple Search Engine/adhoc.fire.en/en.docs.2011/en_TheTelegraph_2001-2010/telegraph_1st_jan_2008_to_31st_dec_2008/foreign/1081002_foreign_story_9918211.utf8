	Leo, Kate reunited    
	 London, Oct. 1: Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are to be reunited on screen for the first time since the film Titanic, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	DiCaprio and Winslet are to star in the upcoming 1950s-set film Revolutionary Road  which sees them share a passionate kiss reminiscent of their on-screen romance in the 1997 blockbuster.      
	Directed by Winslets husband, British film-maker Sam Mendes, the film is based on the 1961 novel by Richard Yates and set in New York and Connecticut.       
	Dicaprio and Winslet play warring spouses Frank and April Wheeler, who get married for the wrong reasons and find themselves torn between their own desires and pressures to conform to fifties America and raise their two children.      
	The film will release in the US on December 26 and in the UK on January 30 next year.       
	It is the first time the two actors have played opposite each other since the Titanic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Wife choice helped Obama quit smoking
                                                                                                               Wife choice helped Obama quit smoking
                              Better man                            
	Washington, Feb. 28 (AP): Barack Obama said he has successfully quit smoking cigarettes despite the pressures of a closely contested and lengthy presidential campaign.        
	Ive been chewing on this Nicorette, which tastes like youre chewing on ground pepper  but it does help, the Democratic candidate said in an interview that aired today on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.        
	His wife, Michelle, had used his smoking as leverage when the two were discussing whether he should run for President. She would agree only if Obama agreed to give up smoking.        
	I had been sneaking three cigarettes, four cigarettes a day for a while, and she said if youre going to do this youve got to stop  precisely because the stress was going to increase, and itll just get worse, Obama said. So thats an example of my wife making me a better man once again.        
	 The Illinois senator told talk show host Ellen DeGeneres that dancing on her show had helped him win voters. I just want to say that we were kind of in a slump until I was dancing on the show, he joked, referring to his appearance on her show last autumn. My poll numbers skyrocketed after that. Everybody saw me bust a move on Ellen  thats all it took.

	London, Oct. 5 (PTI): Prince Harry, the third-in-line to the British throne, is said to have abandoned his military training in Canada and rushed back to London to attend to his girlfriend Chelsy Davy who is recovering in a city hospital.        
	Chelsy, who was admitted to a hospital last week after she complained of toothache and had to be also operated upon subsequently, had told friends she could not wait to see Harry, following which the prince decided to visit her.

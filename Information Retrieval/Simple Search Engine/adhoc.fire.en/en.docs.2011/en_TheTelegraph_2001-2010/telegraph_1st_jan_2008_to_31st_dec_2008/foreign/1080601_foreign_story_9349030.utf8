The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sharif party slams Bush for backing Musharraf
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Sharif party slams Bush for backing Musharraf
                            
	Islamabad, May 31 (AP): Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League today criticised President George W. Bush for lending support to beleaguered President Pervez Musharraf.        
	Bush telephoned Musharraf yesterday and backed his continuing role in promoting Pakistans ties with the US, the White House said.        
	Musharraf has been a key ally in the US-led war on terror. But his opponents are cranking up their calls for his resignation as head of state.        
	A PML(N) spokesman said that Bushs call could harm Pakistan-US relations.        
	He should have advised Musharraf to step down. This would have earned a lot of respect for President Bush and the United States of America in the hearts and minds of the people of Pakistan, Sadiqul Farooq told The Associated Press.        
	Our party has not taken President Bushs call as a friendly and pro-democratic step, Farooq said.        
	Musharraf ended his eight-year domination of Pakistani politics by resigning from the army last year and holding elections in which his political allies were routed.        
	He has vowed to cooperate with the new civilian government.        
	But the two-month-old coalition government is held together by the desire to strip the unpopular President of his remaining powers, including the right to dissolve parliament.        
	Asif Ali Zardari, whose Pakistan Peoples Party leads the government, recently described Musharraf as a relic of the past.

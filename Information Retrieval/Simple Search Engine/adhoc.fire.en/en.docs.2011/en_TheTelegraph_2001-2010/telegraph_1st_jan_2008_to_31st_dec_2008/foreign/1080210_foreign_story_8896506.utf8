The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Dollys assets a liability
                                                                                                               Dollys assets a liability
                              Big voice, big smile                            
	Los Angeles, Feb. 12 (Reuters): Dolly Partons breasts may be two of the wonders of the entertainment world, but the country music icon says they are a pain in her back.        
	Parton, 62, said yesterday that she would postpone her upcoming North American tour after doctors told her to take it easy for six to eight weeks to rest her sore back.        
	Hey, you try wagging these puppies around a while and see if you dont have back problems, the folksy singer-songwriter said in a statement.        
	The tour was due to begin on February 28 in Minneapolis, two days after the release of Backwoods Barbie, her first album of mainstream country music in 17 years. She hopes to hit the road in late April.        
	Parton, also famous for her big voice, big wigs and big smile, has long joked about her famous bust.         
	When she received a songwriters award in New York last year, she noted that shes been known for two things throughout her career.        
	Im talking about my music and my lyrics, she said.        
	Parton, a member of both the country music and songwriters halls of fame, has been enjoying a renaissance since she released the first of a trio of bluegrass-tinged albums in 1999.        
	As with other veterans such as Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard, Parton found that she was no longer welcome at country radio, and changed tack by delving into roots music.         
	Her releases garnered widespread critical acclaim and a fond examination of her 40-year career.

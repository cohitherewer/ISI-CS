	London, Dec. 20: A one-year-old boy has been found living rough on the streets, apparently being kept alive by cats.         
	The boy, whose ordeal mirrors that of the character Mowgli from Rudyard Kiplings The Jungle Book, was discovered by police in Misiones, in Argentina, surrounded by eight wild cats.         
	Doctors believe the animals snuggled up with him during freezing nights which would otherwise have killed him.         
	The boy was seen eating scraps foraged by the animals while they licked him, it has been claimed.         
	Policewoman Alicia Lorena Lindqvist discovered the child by a canal in the Christ King district of the city.

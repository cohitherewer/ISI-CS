The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Seen on Mars: avalanche
                                                                                                               Seen on Mars: avalanche
                            
	Pasadena (California), March 4 (AP): A robotic spacecraft circling Mars has snapped the first image of a series of active avalanches near the planets north pole, scientists said yesterday.        
	The image, taken last month, reveals at least four avalanches of fine ice and dust breaking off from a steep cliff and settling on the slope below. The cascade kicked up massive debris clouds.

	Rio de Janeiro, April 30 (AP): Ronaldo went into hiding yesterday after an encounter with cross-dressing prostitutes that prompted police to investigate whether to charge one with trying to extort money from the three-time Fifa Player of the Year.        
	The AC Milan striker, in Brazil recovering from a knee surgery, cancelled two TV appearances, and local media said he will continue physiotherapy at his home.        
	Police said Ronaldo committed no crime, but he was accused by one prostitute of using drugs and not wanting to pay. Prostitution is legal in Brazil.        
	It is necessary to clarify that no formal accusations were made against Ronaldo, read a statement on the players website. An advocate of social causes, Ronaldo has never used drugs and has always been admired by children in Brazil and around the world. There are indications of an extortion attempt in which the Milan striker is the only victim.

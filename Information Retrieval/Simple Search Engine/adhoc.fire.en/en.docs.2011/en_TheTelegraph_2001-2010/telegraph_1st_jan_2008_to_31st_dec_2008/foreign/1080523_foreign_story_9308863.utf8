The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Food price rise to persist: UN 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Food price rise to persist: UN

	Rome/Paris, May 22 (Reuters): High food prices are here to stay for the foreseeable future, potentially forcing millions more into hunger, two reports from the UN and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed today.        
	A surge in commodity prices in the last year was not a blip and prices will remain at or above current levels for at least the next decade as some of the main underpinning factors  demand for a richer diet, the rise of biofuels and high oil prices  will remain, one of the reports said.        
	Food is no longer the cheap commodity that it once was, said Hafez Ghanem, assistant director-general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).        
	Rising food prices are bond to worsen the already unacceptable level of food deprivation suffered by 854 million people. We are facing the risk that the number of the hungry will increase by many more millions of people, he said.        
	In a 10-year look-ahead at likely food price scenarios, to be published next week, the FAO and the OECD saw no return to pre-crisis levels.        
	On average over the coming 10-year period, nominal prices for cereals, rice and oilseeds are expected to be 35 per cent to 65 per cent higher than on average in the past 10 years, said a summary of the Agricultural Outlook report.        
	Prices in real terms are projected to be 10 per cent to 35 per cent higher than in the past decade.        
	Even a bumper harvest expected this year will do little to ease the plight of the worlds poor, the FAO said in its twice-yearly Food Outlook which gives short-term estimates.        
	Good weather and increased plantings will provide a 3.8 per cent rise in world cereal output, with wheat up 8.7 per cent. That has meant the price surge has started to level off, but prices will not plummet back to pre-crisis levels, the FAO said.        
	Rice, a staple for more than half the earths population, will remain in short supply in global markets, and poor countries that rely on food imports could see food bills up 40 per cent this year after a similar price hike in 2007.         
	The sustained rise in imported food expenditures (for poor countries)... constitutes a very worrying development, it said. Their annual food import basket could cost four times as much as it did in 2000.        
	Even if harvests continue to be good, record low stocks need to be replenished and many of the factors that came together to create the perfect storm for the global food price surge remain.        
	The elements are going to be there, said Ali Gurkan, the FAOs head of commodity markets.        
	As well as increased demand for a richer diet from rapidly developing India and China, the relatively new practice of turning food into fuel will remain strong, as will crude oil prices which boost demand for biofuel and increase farming and freight costs, he said.

	London, Jan. 3: The energy-saving light bulbs that will be made compulsory in homes in a few years can trigger migraines, campaigners have claimed.
    
	The Migraine Action Association (MAA) said some of its members alleged the fluorescent bulbs had led to attacks of the powerful headaches.
    
	By 2011, Britain will be the first European country to phase out traditional bulbs as part of a strategy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 
    
	The MAA is calling on the government to avoid a complete ban on old-style bulbs, by providing an opt-out for people with health problems. 
    
	Last year it was claimed that the green bulbs can cause people with epilepsy to experience symptoms similar to the early stages of a fit.
    
	There have also been complaints from people with lupus, a chronic immune disease that causes pain and extreme tiredness.
    
	Low energy light bulbs use only a quarter of the energy consumed by traditional versions and are estimated to save 2,000 times their weight in greenhouse gases.
    
	Several versions use a technology similar to fluorescent strip lights and some migraine sufferers say they produce a flickering effect that triggers their condition.

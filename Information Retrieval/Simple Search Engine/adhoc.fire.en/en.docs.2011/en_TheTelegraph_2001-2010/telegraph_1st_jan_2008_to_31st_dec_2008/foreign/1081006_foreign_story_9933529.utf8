	Terry-ble kid    
	 Canberra, Oct. 5 (Reuters): The parents of a 7-year-old boy who broke into an Australian zoo and fed a string of small animals to its resident crocodile are likely to be sued after police said the boy was too young to be held responsible.      
	A turtle, four western blue tongue lizards, two bearded dragons, and two thorny devil lizards were fed or led into the jaws of a three-foot, 440 pound saltwater crocodile named Terry.    
	Ig-Nobel     
	 Washington (Reuters): A researcher who figured out that Coke explodes sperm and scientists who discovered that people will happily eat stale chips if they crunch loudly enough won alternative Ig Nobel prizes recently. Other winners included physicists who found out that anything that can tangle, will tangle and a team of biologists who ascertained that dog fleas jump farther than cat fleas.     
	Tallest dad    
	 London: The worlds tallest man, Chinas Bao Xishun, became the worlds tallest father this week with the birth of his first child, reports The Sunday Telegraph. The boys initial height, 22in, seems a compromise between his gigantic father and average-sized mother. Although slightly taller than average for newborn children, Baos boy came up well short of the 29.5in claimed as a record birth length last year, also in China. Bao, a 7-ft-9-in herdsman from Inner Mongolia, last year married Xia Shujuan, a pygmy by contrast at 5-ft-6 in.

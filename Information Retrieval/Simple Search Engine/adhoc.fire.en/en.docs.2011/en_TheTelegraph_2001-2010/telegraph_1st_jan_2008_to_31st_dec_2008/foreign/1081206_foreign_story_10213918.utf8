	Sneeze amp; spread    
	 London, Dec. 5: A single sneeze by a commuter on a packed bus or train can give up to 150 fellow passengers a cold in just five minutes, scientists discovered, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	People who travel to work on public transport are almost twice as likely to catch colds as those who work from home, new research has found. Without the use of a handkerchief or tissue, a typical sneeze will blow 100,000 germ-filled droplets into the air, which are then transferred to the seats. The study found that 98 per cent of people who regularly travelled to work by bus, and 96 per cent who took the train, caught colds last winter.     
	Bard fans    
	 Edinburgh (Reuters): Author J.K. Rowling said on Thursday that it was demand from Harry Potter fans that prompted her to publish her latest work The Tales of Beedle the Bard. The idea actually came from you, by which I mean Harry Potter fans, Rowling told around 200 primary school children gathered at Edinburghs Parliament Hall for a tea party that officially launched Beedle. There was quite a lot of high feeling from Harry Potter fans that only someone who had 2 million could afford to read the book.

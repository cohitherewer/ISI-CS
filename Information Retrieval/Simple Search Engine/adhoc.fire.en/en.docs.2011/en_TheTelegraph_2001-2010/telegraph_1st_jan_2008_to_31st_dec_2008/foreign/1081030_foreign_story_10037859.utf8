	Credit comedy    
	 London, Oct. 29: A comedy tribute to the economic tough times has become an Internet hit, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	And the 30-year-old  who goes under the name Antan Debt and the Overdrafts  has been propelled back into the limelight through his Credit Crunch Song.       
	The music video opens with Yeoman dressed in a business suit  jump behind the wheel of his Porsche.       
	But after losing his job, car and having his house repossessed, Alex finds himself wandering the street begging for change wearing a torn shabby suit.       
	To the tune of 60s cult song The Monster Mash, Alexs lyrics are a comedy take on the plight of millions who are trying to make ends meet. He sings: Im trying hard to stay happy in these desperate times, as far as I can tell were all in gross decline.       
	My pockets are all empty and my bank is too, Ive lost my job, I dont know what to do.

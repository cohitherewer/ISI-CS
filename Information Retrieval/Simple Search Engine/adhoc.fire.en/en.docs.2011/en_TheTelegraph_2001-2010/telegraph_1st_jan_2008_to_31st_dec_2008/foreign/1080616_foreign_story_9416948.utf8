	London, June 15: An Anglican church has held a homosexual wedding for the first time in a move that will deepen the rift between liberals and traditionalists.         
	Two male priests exchanged vows and rings in a ceremony that was conducted using one of the churchs most traditional wedding rites  a decision seen as blasphemous by conservatives.         
	The ceremony broke Church of England guidelines and was carried out last month in defiance of the Bishop of London, in whose diocese it took place.         
	News of the wedding emerged days before a crucial summit of the Anglican Churchs conservative bishops and archbishops, who are threatening to split the worldwide church over the issue of homosexual clergy.         
	Although some liberal clergy have carried out blessing ceremonies for homosexual couples in the past, this is the first time a vicar has performed a wedding ceremony, using a traditional marriage liturgy, with readings, hymns and a Eucharist.         
	Both the conservative and liberal wings of the Anglican communion expressed shock last night.        
	Henry Orombi, the Archbishop of Uganda, said that the ceremony was blasphemous. He called on Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to take decisive action if the Anglican Church were not to disintegrate. Archbishop Orombi added: What really shocks me is that this is happening in the Church of England that first brought the Gospel to us.         
	The leadership tried to deny that this would happen, but now the truth is out. Our respect for the Church of England will erode unless we see a return to traditional teaching.         
	Michael Scott-Joynt, the Bishop of Winchester  a powerful conservative figure  said that the service represented a wedding in all but name. He said: Strictly speaking it is not a marriage, but the language is clearly modelled on the marriage service and the occasion is modelled on the marriage service. This clearly flouts church guidelines and will exacerbate divisions within the Anglican Communion.         
	The bishop said that it was up to Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, to act, adding that it would become a high-profile test case of Church authority.         
	Can we stand for the clear teaching of the Church of England or are we powerless in the face of these actions, which I regret enormously have taken place, he said.         
	The service was held at St Bartholomew the Great in London  one of Englands oldest churches.

	Lonely luck    
	 Taipei, Oct. 31 (Reuters): Police in Taiwan served a lonely man cake and sang happy birthday after arresting him for stealing a goose to celebrate on his own, an officer in charge said today.      
	Police in the southern township of Neipu treated the 49-year-old suspect, surnamed Lee, yesterday after they caught him stealing the bird from a betel nut plantation, said officer Hsiao Chi-liang said.      
	It was his birthday and he stole it to celebrate, so we bought him a cake, Hsiao said. He was very surprised. Officers took pity on Lee because he was poor and lived in a shabby home.

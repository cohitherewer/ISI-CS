The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fuel shortage hits US
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fuel shortage hits US
                            
	Atlanta, Sept. 30 (Reuters): A severe fuel shortage has gripped parts of the southeastern US, causing long lines at filling stations and symbolising for some people their fears about the wider economy.        
	The shortage began two weeks ago in Atlanta, the regions largest city, when oil refineries on the Gulf Coast were shut down by hurricanes Gustav and Ike earlier this month. Parts of north Georgia, western North Carolina and parts of Tennessee were also affected. The effects on motorists have been dramatic. Most service stations in Atlanta are out of petrol, with plastic bags placed over the pumps or signs saying out.        
	As a result, drivers are cruising the city hunting for petrol  often with a fuel metre needle hovering close to empty. When they find petrol, its often above $4 a gallon.        
	Traffic is lighter on the citys streets and highways as some residents share rides and limit their journeys.        
	Lines and elaborate queuing systems have developed at petrol stations on days when oil companies deliver fuel. Motorists report showing up at fuel stations before dawn to beat the line only to find dozens of cars ahead of them.        
	Its been very tough, said Rhonda Forrest, 45, who said she slipped out of work on Monday to fill up her tank when she learned that a fuel station in the citys upmarket Buckhead district was open.        
	The shortage has also had a psychological impact. Like many US cities, Atlanta is car dependent and residents say they had until now taken refuelling for granted. Some motorists said in interviews the lack of fuel was simply an inconvenience. Others said that while they understood that the shortage was a supply issue, it was hard not to connect it to problems in the wider economy.        
	US lawmakers rejected a $700 billion bailout plan for the financial industry yesterday in a shocking vote that sent global stock markets sliding. It was the latest blow to the economy that has seen a a credit crunch and a string of bank failures in recent weeks as well as a year-long wave of home foreclosures.

          ANDREW ALDERSON                        Harry, William (below)                                      
	London, Sept. 7: Prince William and Prince Harry are to embark on one of the worlds most arduous motorcycle rides to raise money for orphans and AIDS victims.         
	The brothers, aged 26 and 23 respectively, will make a 1,000-mile trek across South Africa and Lesotho in a journey that will resemble that of Ewan McGregor and Charlie Boorman, in their television series Long Way Down.         
	The event this year is not for the faint-hearted: the ride is almost entirely off road in temperatures up to 40 degrees Celsius.         
	Hazards include bandits, erratic drivers and poisonous snakes.         
	The week-long trek, which will take in some of Africas most remote and dangerous regions, has been on, then off, and is now on again, say friends of the princes.         
	It was originally mooted at New Year, but seemed to have been scuppered by security concerns. However, the princes are understood to be determined to take part.         
	Neither of their girlfriends, Kate Middleton and Chelsy Davy, will go on the trip but they may join the princes in Africa at the end of the ride.         
	It is understood that the trek was Harrys idea but that William was equally enthusiastic. Harry is a keen motorcycle rider and was photographed riding a Honda while serving as a soldier in Afghanistan this year.         
	William has had a long love affair with bikes. He owns a Honda Blackbird.         
	Both brothers are passionate about Africa: William spent part of his gap year there, while Harry has visited the continent several times. His girlfriend was born and raised in Zimbabwe.         
	Harry set up a charity, Sentebale, to help orphans and AIDS victims in Lesotho. Almost a third of its people are infected with HIV/AIDS and there are about 180,000 orphans in a country of 1.8 million people.         
	The princes are expected to use 200cc bikes. Their route, travel dates and accommodation are being kept secret.         
	Andy McNab, a former Special Air Service soldier turned author, did a similar, 1,500-mile cross-country charity ride in South Africa last year.         
	Its the best and most demanding ride I have ever done, he said. You go through rivers and up inclines of nearly 60 degrees. We were each getting through six litres of water a day.

                              Laura Bush and Michelle Obama at the White House. (AP)                            
	Washington, Nov. 11: The teachers told Nicolo Posini not to get excited but the 10-year-old couldnt help himself when he saw Michelle Obama in his school.        
	I thought it was awesome because I saw the future First Lady, said the fourth-grader at Georgetown Day, one of two private schools Michelle visited here yesterday as she school-hunted for daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.        
	I got really excited, but we werent supposed to get excited, Posini said. Not out loud. Our teachers told us to show Michelle it was a regular school day and that we arent crazy kids. They didnt want us asking her for her autograph.        
	Michelle then visited Sidwell Friends School, after squeezing in a visit to the White House to meet First Lady Laura Bush as her husband, President-elect Barack Obama, met President George W. Bush at the Oval Office.        
	Isabel Dorval, a 10th-grader at Sidwell, said she was running on the field a little after 4pm when a convoy of cars arrived. About 45 minutes later, the motorcade drove off as the students waved. Michelle rolled down the window and waved back. It was cool, said Isabel, 15.        
	At the White House, Michelle was briefed on certain pieces of furniture, the carpeting and the drapes  to find out if these met her tastes. Meeting privately with Laura, the incoming First Lady was participating in a century-old Washington ritual that represents the softer side of the serious business of a presidential transition.        
	Its a tradition that may not rank with the passing of secret nuclear-launch codes, but the White House visit by the Obamas was no less freighted with significance.        
	They will literally become living symbols of the country to the world, for all of history, said Carl Sferrazza Anthony, who has written several books about First Ladies. It will redefine their identities.        
	The outgoing First Lady led her successor on a White House tour that focused primarily on the upstairs private residence, including three bedroom suites and three living areas. These areas, along with the Oval Office, are subject to redecoration, as opposed to the public rooms.        
	A stop on the tour that is always of particular interest, Anthony said, is the First Ladys sitting room, whose windows afford a direct view of the Oval Office below: She can really keep an eye on whos coming and going.        
	Michelle, 44  like her husband, a Harvard-educated lawyer  and Laura also spent time discussing raising daughters in the White House, Stephanie Cutter, the Obama transition spokeswoman, said. Michelle Obama was honoured to finally meet the First Lady, who was a gracious hostess.        
	Obama aide Robert Gibbs said the President-elect thought the Oval Office was pretty nice.        
	Obama has reached the stage where even the slightest burp or hiccup becomes national news. The media yesterday ran exclusives on how he dropped his daughters off at school, with a kiss for Malia and a kiss for Sasha, and how long he spent at the gym (one hour and 20 minutes).         
	After the President-elect got off his plane at Washingtons Reagan National Airport, reporters on Force One ( stands for Obama) tried to eavesdrop on him as he spoke into a cellphone.        
	Among the phrases overheard: I am not going to be spending too much time in Washington over the next several weeks and I dont want us to go lurching so far in one direction.

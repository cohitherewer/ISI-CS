	2-phone Brits    
	 London, Dec. 26: Britain is edging closer to becoming a two-mobile nation, according to the latest survey, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The poll of 1,000 people found most adults have a handset, with only the very young and very old not owning a mobile phone.       
	The average mobile phone owner now has an average of 1.8 handsets and the figure is expected to rise to two mobiles for every person soon.       
	The rise in ownership is thought to be because more people have one mobile for personal calls and another for work as companies give employees BlackBerry devices to keep in touch out of hours.       
	Market research firm Mintel, which carried out the survey, said increased ownership is also being driven by the falling costs of using a mobile.

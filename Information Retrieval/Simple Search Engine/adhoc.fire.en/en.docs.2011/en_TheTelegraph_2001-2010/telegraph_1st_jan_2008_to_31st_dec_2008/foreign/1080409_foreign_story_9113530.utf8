	San Francisco, April 8: The Olympic torch arrived in San Francisco this morning amid heightened security concerns and a suggestion from Olympic organisers that disruptive protests could put the rest of the round-the-world relay at risk.        
	On its only US stop, the torch arrived by plane in San Francisco just before 7 am, and is due to be carried tomorrow on a six-mile jaunt alongside San Francisco Bay. Thousands of protesters are expected to gather, with actor Richard Gere and Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu scheduled to lead a candlelight vigil in support of Tibetan rights, and a counter-relay and other events planned by a variety of groups.        
	After watching protesters scuffle with police along the relay route in Paris and force athletes to scurry for cover into a waiting bus, San Franciso officials told the Los Angeles Times they were worried about tomorrows leg of the torchs journey.        
	This is not a contained route, security-wise, and there are lots of opportunities for trouble, Sergeant Neville Gittens, a spokesman for the San Francisco police, told the newspaper. We are watching whats going on very closely and will make changes to our plans as we figure them out.        
	In Paris yesterday, thousands of rowdy demonstrators forced cancellation of the last leg of the torch ceremony with repeated attacks on the procession, escalating international protests over Chinas human rights record ahead of the 2008 Games in Beijing.         
	In recent weeks, pressure has been mounting on the International Olympic Committee to respond to complaints from activists and politicians that Chinas lack of political freedom is incompatible with the values enshrined in the Olympic Charter.         
	Officials have said that they are concerned about Tibet but that the IOC is not a political organisation and cannot strong-arm the host government.        
	On Monday, amid reports of the developing chaos in Paris, Rogge mentioned Tibet by name again.         
	Im very concerned with the international situation and whats happening in Tibet, he said at a ceremony in Beijing. The torch relay has been targeted. The International Olympic Committee has expressed its serious concern and calls for a rapid, peaceful resolution in Tibet.

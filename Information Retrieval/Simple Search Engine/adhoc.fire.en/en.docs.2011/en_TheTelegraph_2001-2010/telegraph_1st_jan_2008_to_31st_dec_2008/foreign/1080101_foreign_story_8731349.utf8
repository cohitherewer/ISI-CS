	Nairobi, Dec. 31 (Reuters): Kenyan police battled protesters in blazing slums today after disputed elections returned President Mwai Kibaki to power and triggered turmoil that a local TV station said had killed at least 124 people.
    
	Fatal riots convulsed the nation, from Opposition strongholds in the west near the Ugandan border to Nairobis shanty-towns and the port of Mombasa on the Indian Ocean Coast. 
    
	Reuters reporters estimated at least 70 deaths, based on witnesses and body counts. But broadcaster KTN said by mid-afternoon the toll had reached at least 124.
    
	The violence threatens to deter investors from east Africas largest economy and damage Kenyas reputation as an oasis of relative stability in a volatile and war-scarred region.
    
	Much fighting pitched Luos, who back defeated Opposition leader Raila Odinga, against Kibakis ethnic Kikuyu group. In the western town of Kisumu, a hotbed of opposition support, 21 bodies lay in and around a hospital mortuary, witnesses said. Most had gunshot wounds.
    
	In Nairobis Mathare slum, police threatened to shoot people coming out of their homes, witnesses said. Police are saying on loudspeakers from trucks that anyone found outside will be shot dead, said taxi driver Argwings Odera.
    
	Odinga called for a mass rally on Thursday in Nairobis main Uhuru Park, named for the word freedom in Swahili.
    
	We expect a million Kenyans to attend, he said.
    
	For the last 48 hours the people of Kenya have seen their nascent democracy shackled, strangled and finally killed.
    
	In Nairobis Kibera slum, youths chanted: No Raila, No Peace!. When they lit bonfires in the road and torched a petrol station, police moved in to fire teargas and bullets in the air.

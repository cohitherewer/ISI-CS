The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Luggage chaos at Heathrow

	London, March 27: Thirty-three flights have been cancelled and luggage problems have caused chaos as Heathrows new fifth terminal got off to a bumpy start.        
	In addition to the cancellations, which included incoming and outgoing flights, three planes left without baggage and incoming passengers were forced to wait up to two hours for their luggage to come through.         
	BAA, the airport operators, insisted that the difficulties were no more than teething troubles at the 4.3 billion terminal. But scores of passengers felt differently as they were confronted with a series of glitches from a set of escalators breaking down to pay machines at the car park not working properly.         
	BAAs problems were not helped by the presence of 300 T-shirt wearing protesters. While not directly interfering with passengers, they formed conga lines around the terminal and generally got in the way of already frustrated passengers.         
	This was a less than auspicious start for a terminal which was supposed to bring an end the Heathrow hassle which has ensured the airport is loathed by airlines, passengers and politicians alike.         
	Last year, Ken Livingstone, Londons mayor, said the airport shamed the capital.         
	Terminal 5 (T5) was supposed to bring an end to the delays faced by in and outbound passengers. Its new sophisticated baggage handling system was also supposed to mean that British Airways no longer lost more suitcases than any other major airline.         
	But it proved too sophisticated for some members of the first shift who, on turning up for work, found they were unable to log on to the system at all. As a result the first flights to Brussels, Amsterdam and Edinburgh left without any luggage whatsoever.         
	There were similar difficulties with inbound passengers facing long waits for their baggage to come through.         
	David Thatcher, 60, from Manchester, voiced the frustration of many after waiting 90 minutes for his bag to come through before picking up a flight to Japan. It is complete chaos in there. I am meant to be getting a connection in Terminal 3, thats gone now.         
	They cant handle the bags, the people down there dont know what they are doing. They are putting the bags on the wrong conveyor belt, they havent been trained properly.

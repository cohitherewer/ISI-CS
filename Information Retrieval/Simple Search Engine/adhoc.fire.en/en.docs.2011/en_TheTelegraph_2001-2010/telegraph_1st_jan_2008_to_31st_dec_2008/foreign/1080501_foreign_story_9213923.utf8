	Strange stalker    
	 New York, April 30 (Reuters): A man on trial for stalking Uma Thurman told her parents he had met the actress in a previous life and threatened to kill himself if he was not put in contact with her, Thurmans parents testified yesterday.      
	Jack Jordan, 37, is accused of harassing Thurmans family with emails, loitering for hours on the steps of Thurmans Manhattan apartment and visiting her trailer on a movie set.      
	The actresss mother, Nena Thurman, testified that Jordan called her Woodstock, New York, home and sent more than 19 emails from 2005 to 2007 to her husband, Robert Thurman, a professor of Indo-Tibetan Studies at Columbia University.      
	He told me in so many words that he and my daughter had known one another in a previous life and were destined to be together, that he knew this, but she didnt know it, Nena Thurman told a New York court of a phone call she received from Jordan.

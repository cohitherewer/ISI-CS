	Fat cats to fast    
	 Kathmandu, Dec. 24 (Reuters): Authorities in Nepal said today they have stopped feeding tigers in the countrys only zoo for one day a week to keep them from piling on the pounds.      
	One of three fat cats at Jawalakhel zoo in the Nepali capital now weighs in at about 220kg, having gained 40kg on a diet of buffalo meat in just eight months.      
	The diet for Kancha, which means the youngest child, and two other Royal Bengal tigers is enforced in consultation with foreign zoos which also have a tight feeding regime for the endangered animals.      
	We dont give the tigers anything to eat on Saturdays except water, zoo official Binad Karmacharya said.      
	 The practice of feeding tigers for six days a week is good for their health. An adult of the species can weigh up to a majestic 300kg.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Maoists urged to lead govt

	Kathmandu, July 23: Nepals former communists should spearhead the new government, political opponents said today, a day after the Maoists abandoned plans for leadership because their choice for President had been rejected.        
	Nepals parties met today to try and resolve the political stalemate. However, no agreement had been reached, said Arjun Narsingh of the Nepali Congress, which received the second-largest number of votes in April elections.        
	We still believe and want the Maoists to form and lead the new government. That was our earlier decision and we stick by it, Narsingh said. We will not be an obstacle for them in this matter.        
	Iswor Pokhrel of the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist (CPN-UML) also said today that the new government should include the former guerrillas.        
	The Maoists secured the most votes in the April election for a Constituent Assembly, but did not win a majority of seats. Since that poll, Nepals main parties have been unable to agree on how to form a coalition government.        
	Maoist-backed independent Ramraja Singh lost Mondays presidential vote to Ram Baran Yadav, who was backed by the Nepali Congress, the CPN and the Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum  the second, third and fourth largest parties, respectively.        
	Maoist leader Prachanda said yesterday that his party would act as the Opposition after Singh lost the vote.        
	After our candidate was defeated in the presidential election, we have lost the moral grounds to lead the new government, Prachanda said.        
	Yadav, a doctor and a former health minister, was sworn in by Chief Justice Kedar Prasad at the former foreign ministry headquarters which has been redesignated as Rashtrapati Bhavan.         
	Soon after being sworn in, Yadav administered the oath of office to his deputy, Vice-President Parmanand Jha.        
	Both Yadav and Jha belong to the Madhesi community from the Terai plains bordering India. While Yadav sported the Nepali national outfit and a Nepali cap, Jha reinforced his Indian roots by wearing a dhoti kurta and took his oath in Hindi.         
	Shortly after the swearing-in ceremony, Prime Minister Koirala called on Yadav and submitted his resignation.        
	In the letter, Koirala said he resigned to pave the way for the formation of the new government. Koirala was the third person in the family to become Prime Minister. He was elected general secretary of the Nepali Congress party in 1976.        
	President Pratibha Patil congratulated Yadav, saying that his election represented a new chapter in Nepals historic democratic transition.         
	The Constituent Assembly dissolved the countrys centuries-old monarchy in May and is supposed to rewrite the Constitution and govern the nation.         
	Maoists gave up their armed revolt in April 2006 to join a peace process after 10 years of insurgency that left more than 13,000 people dead.

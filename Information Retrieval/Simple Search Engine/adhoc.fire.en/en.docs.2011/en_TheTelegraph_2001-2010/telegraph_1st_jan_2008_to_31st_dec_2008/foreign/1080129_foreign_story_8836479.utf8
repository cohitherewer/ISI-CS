                                                                                                            Day-Lewis tribute
                            
	Los Angeles, Jan. 28 (AP): Daniel Day-Lewis dedicated his Screen Actors Guild Award to Heath Ledger.        
	 Day-Lewis, who was honoured yesterday as leading actor for his performance in There Will Be Blood, gave an acceptance speech that echoed comments he made last week about Ledger. In Brokeback Mountain he was unique, he was perfect, Day-Lewis said.

	Nude charge    
	 Wellington, April 1 (Reuters): A policeman in a small New Zealand town did not let the fact that he was naked hold him back from chasing a thief trying to steal his car.      
	The off-duty constable was asleep at his home in Balclutha, in the lower South Island, when his wife woke him in the early hours, the New Zealand Press Association reported.      
	 the policeman realised the sound his wife heard was someone attempting to start the couples car, he didnt let the fact he was stark naked hold him back, bursting out the door with nothing more than a torch.      
	The offender bolted with the officer in hot pursuit, but was soon picked up by a police patrol. The offender... startled by the sight of a naked constable with just a torch coming towards him, took off, police said.    
	Ocean iron    
	Canberra (Reuters): A group of 72 Australian scuba divers has flattened the world record for ironing under water, taking the plunge off a pier near Melbourne with ironing boards and irons, and their linen. So-called extreme ironing has spawned a cult following in recent years. The Australian group, who pipped the previous mark of 70, are seeking entry to the Guinness World Records after taking their linen into murky, 3-metre-deep ocean on Saturday. It was cold and I think they were bloody crazy, local councillor Tom Connor, who with police helped authenticate the new record, said.

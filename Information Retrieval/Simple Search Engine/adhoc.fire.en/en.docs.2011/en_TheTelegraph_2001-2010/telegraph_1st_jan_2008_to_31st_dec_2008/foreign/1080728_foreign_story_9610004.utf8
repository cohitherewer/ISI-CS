	Santiago De Cuba, July 27 (Reuters): Cuban President Raul Castro dashed expectations he would announce new economic reforms yesterday in a speech that instead warned Cubans not to get used to hearing good news.        
	The speech marking the 55th anniversary of the start of the Cuban revolution broke little new ground as Castro stressed austerity for Cuba and appeared to dampen rising expectations.        
	Cubans had said they hoped Castro would say more about how far and how fast he wants to take Cuba down the road of reform.

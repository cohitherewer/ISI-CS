	Taipei, July 4 (Reuters): Historic regular flights between Taiwan and China began today, in a show of conciliation between the long-time rivals that could draw millions of Chinese visitors to the island.        
	The first of the flights, a China Southern Airlines plane, landed at Taipeis Taoyuan airport after leaving Guangzhou in southern China early in the morning.        
	No such regular flights, aside from a few charters on select holidays, have flown since 1949, when defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan after the Chinese civil war.        
	China claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and has vowed to bring the island under its rule, by force if necessary.         
	But with Taiwans new President Ma Ying-jeou and Beijing seeking to ease tensions and expand economic flows, the first batch of tourists has become a symbol for broader hopes.        
	The advantages of mainland tourist visits to Taiwan are not only stimulus for related industries, job opportunities for citizens and other tangible interests. Its also for mutual peace, a deepening of exchanges, elevating our international image and other non-tangible points, Taiwan Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said yesterday.        
	Negotiators from China and Taiwan agreed last month to the weekend flights. They also decided to let as many as 3,000 Chinese tourists a day visit the island.        
	Although the routes are dubbed weekend charters, they run from Friday to Monday. The 36 round trips per week will eliminate time-consuming Hong Kong or Macau stopovers for Taiwanese, about one million of whom live on the mainland.

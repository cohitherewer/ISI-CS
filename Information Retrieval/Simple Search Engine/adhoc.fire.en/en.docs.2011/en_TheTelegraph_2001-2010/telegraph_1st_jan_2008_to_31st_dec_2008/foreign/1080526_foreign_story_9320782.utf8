	Johannesburg, May 25 (AP): The death toll in two weeks of anti-foreigner violence in South Africa has reached 50, police said today, as thousands displaced by the violence coped with rain and cool temperatures.        
	A Bangladeshi was killed in the violence after his shop was looted yesterday in the town of George in the Western Cape province.         
	The revised death toll was eight more than the previous figure. A police spokesman also said today that the army will continue supporting police trying to quell the violence.        
	Yesterday, the army said one of its soldiers shot and killed a man who was attacking a woman in a slum that has seen attacks on foreigners.        
	Theres no change at this stage until such time as we are satisfied peace is being restored, said Gauteng provincial police spokesman Govindsamy Mariemuthoo. He said few incidents and no deaths or injuries were reported overnight.        
	Thousands of foreigners remain in makeshift camps after being chased from their homes by stick  and knife-wielding mobs of South Africans who accuse immigrants of taking jobs and blame them for crime. A church service was held today at one of the camps.        
	The violence has centered on squatter camps and notoriously bleak dormitories built during the apartheid era for single men who were allowed to work in the cities, but not to bring their families.        
	President Thabo Mbeki, who on Wednesday called in the army for the first time since the end of apartheid in 1994 to aid police, was to address the nation on the violence later today, according to the state broadcaster.        
	 Mbeki condemned the violence yesterday, saying during an appearance in Cape Town that there can never, ever be justification for criminal, violent activity against anyone.

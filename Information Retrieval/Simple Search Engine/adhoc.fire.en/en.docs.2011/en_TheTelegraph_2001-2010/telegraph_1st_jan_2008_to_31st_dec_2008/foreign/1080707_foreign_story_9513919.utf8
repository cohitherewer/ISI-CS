	Ankara, July 6 (Reuters): Two former Turkish generals were arrested today on charges of forming and leading a terrorist group and seeking to overthrow the Islamist-leaning government, the state-run Anatolian News Agency said.        
	A court ordered the arrest of Sener Eruygur, once head of the paramilitary gendarmerie, and Hursit Tolon, the former first army commander. They were sent to a prison in Istanbul.        
	Eruygur is head of the Kemalist Thought Association, which helped organise mass anti-government demonstrations last year.        
	They were among 21 people detained last Tuesday in a police investigation into allegations of a coup. Eight of the detained including a prominent businessman had already been arrested.        
	Media reports said a secret plan was seized during the swoop which called for illegal protests on July 7 across 40 provinces, assassinations and attacks on security forces.        
	The two former generals were suspected of being members of a shadowy, ultra-nationalist secularist group known as Ergenekon, which was already under investigation.

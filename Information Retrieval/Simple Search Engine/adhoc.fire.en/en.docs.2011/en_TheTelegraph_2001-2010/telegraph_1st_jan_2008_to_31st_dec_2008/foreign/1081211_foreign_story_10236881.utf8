The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Marquez writing new novel
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Marquez writing new novel
                            
	London, Dec. 10: Colombias Nobel prize winning author, Gabriel Garca Mrquez, is working on a new novel, according to reports.         
	The new book by 82-year-old master of magical realism will be a love story, his friend and fellow writer Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza said. However, the author is struggling to come up with a version he was happy with, the Guardian reports.         
	He has four versions of it, Apuleyo said. He told me that he was now trying to get the best from each of them.         
	Apuleyo, who co-wrote a book of conversations with Garca Mrquez called The Smell of the Guava Tree in 1982, said the Nobel prize winner had become hugely self-critical.         
	But news that he is writing again will come as a relief to fans, who were concerned when the author announced in 2006: Ive stopped writing ... 2005 was the first year in my life that I didnt write a line.        
	Garca Mrquez blamed a lack of enthusiasm for his inactivity.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

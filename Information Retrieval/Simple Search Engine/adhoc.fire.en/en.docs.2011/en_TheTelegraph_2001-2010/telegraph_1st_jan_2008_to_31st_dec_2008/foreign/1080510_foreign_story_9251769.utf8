	London, May 9 (Reuters): England is an irritating and insular country full of overweight, binge-drinking, reality TV addicts, a new guide warned tourists today.        
	But in the new Rough Guide to England, the English are also hailed as a nation of animal-loving, tea-drinking charity donors who love nothing better than forming an orderly queue.        
	Gone, it seems, is the genteel image of a country awash with Englishmen politely tipping their bowler hats, staggering through the London fog and being kinder to pets than children.        
	The writers confessed to bafflement over the quirky English, concluding that of the 200 countries the guide reviews there is none so fascinating, beautiful and culturally diverse yet as insular, self-important and irritating as England.

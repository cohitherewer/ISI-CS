                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US: Afghan civilians killed in raid
                            
	Kabul, July 17 (Reuters): US-led coalition troops killed eight Afghan civilians in an air strike in the western province of Farah during a Tuesday raid against suspected militants, the US military said.        
	The acknowledgement came as reports of more civilian deaths caused by a fresh air raid by foreign forces emerged today from the neighbouring province of Herat.        
	Tuesdays air strike was summoned after a coalition convoy came under sustained attack from machine gun and indirect fire from a number of houses adjacent to a road in the Bakwa district of Farah, the US military said.        
	The coalition convoy returned fire and called for close air support on the enemy positions. A house was hit; eight civilians were killed, two others injured, it said in a statement late yesterday.        
	Coalition forces never intentionally target non-combatants, and deeply regret any occurrence such as this where civilians are killed and injured as a result of insurgent activity and actions, it said.        
	In todays raid, at least four men were killed, a spokesman for the regional police command said. Witnesses said 17 people were also wounded and taken to hospital.

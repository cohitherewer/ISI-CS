                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US aid lands in Yangon

	Yangon, May 12 (Reuters): The first US military aid flight to Myanmar landed in Yangon today but emergency supplies remained at a trickle for 1.5 million people facing hunger and disease in the cyclone-ravaged Irrawaddy delta.        
	The C-130 military transport plane left Thailands U-Tapao air base carrying water, mosquito nets and blankets to the military-ruled country, branded an outpost of tyranny by Washington.        
	The Myanmar juntas navy Commander-in-Chief Soe Thein greeted the US supplies, which were accompanied by Admiral Timothy Keating, head of the US Pacific Command, and Henrietta Fore, administrator of the US Agency for International Development.        
	In New York, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said he was immensely frustrated at the unacceptably slow delivery of aid in general. He said he had been unable to contact Myanmars senior general, Than Shwe, despite repeated attempts and had sent him a letter today.        
	US AID administrator Fore told reporters in Bangkok that she had won permission to fly in two more planes tomorrow but there was no breakthrough on the important issue of letting foreign helicopters and boats ferry supplies into the delta.        
	Its a good first step, she said, adding that Washington was increasing its humanitarian aid to $16 million, from just $3.5 million.         
	We will take it one day at a time. Delivery of the aid shipment was broadcast on Myanmar state television.        
	Keating said the US navy would have three ships in international waters off the coast of Myanmar in 36 to 48 hours.         
	It also had 4,000 Marines and a large number of cargo-carrying helicopters on stand-by in Thailand.        
	Were limited only by the permission from the authorities in Burma, he said at the Thai air base.        
	While a stream of aid flights had landed in Yangon, only a fraction of the relief needed was reaching the delta as a result of flooding and because the junta was keeping foreign aid and logistics experts out of the country or stranded in Yangon.

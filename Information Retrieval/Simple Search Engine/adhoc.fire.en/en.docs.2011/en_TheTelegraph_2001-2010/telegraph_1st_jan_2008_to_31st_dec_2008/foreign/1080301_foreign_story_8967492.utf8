The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Israel leader vows bigger holocaust
                                                                                                               Israel leader vows bigger holocaust

	Jerusalem, Feb. 29: A senior Israeli politician provoked controversy today when he warned that Palestinians firing rockets from Gaza would be punished with a bigger holocaust from Israeli armed forces.        
	The use of the Hebrew word for holocaust, shoah, tends to be used exclusively in Israel to describe the Nazi persecution of Jews.         
	Palestinian activists routinely claim to be suffering a shoah at the hands of Israel, but the Jewish state normally denies any moral equivalence between the suffering of Palestinians today and European jewry under the Nazis.         
	Matan Vilnai, deputy defence minister, broke that taboo when he used the term shoah during an interview on Army Radio.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

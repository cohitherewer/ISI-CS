	Naomi baby love    
	 London, Sept. 15: Supermodel Naomi Campbell has said that she would love to have a baby now that she has found a new lover, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	I understand when people say: Listen to your body, your body tells you. So yes, Id love to have a baby, said the 38-year-old who has been linked to Russian tycoon Vladimir Doronin.      
	The supermodel started work at the Mission in East London last week, as punishment for kicking and spitting at police at Heathrow in April. She said that she had even asked volunteer workers to come to her Fashion for Relief catwalk show.

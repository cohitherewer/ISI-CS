	Madonna message    
	 Los Angeles, Nov. 15 (Reuters): Pop diva Madonna is asking fans to donate money so that she can build a girls school in Malawi for underprivileged children.      
	 a video posted on her website, the singer described her inspiration for building the multimillion dollar project. There are very few girls in Africa in general who are encouraged or allowed to go to secondary school, so after spending a lot of time there I realised that one of the ways I could help is to build a girls school, said Madonna, who officially adopted a young Malawian boy, David Banda, in May.      
	I would really be grateful if you would get involved and help me in any way that you can, with donations, spreading the word, visiting my website, reading about the progress that weve made so far, Madonna said in the appeal, which was posted on Thursday.    
	Post ashes    
	 London: A deceased postman has become an unlikely celebrity in Holland after his ashes washed up there, reports The Daily Telegraph. After John Leas cremation, one of his sons put his ashes in a bottle with photographs of Lea and a few details about his life, such as the fact that he had been in the army and travelled a lot. Kevin Lea, 48, then dropped the bottle from a ferry half way across the Channel while on a trip to France after deciding his father needed one last big adventure. It has since twice come ashore in Holland, leading to his father appearing in national papers and on TV. Lea senior, from Weymouth, Dorset, died last summer aged 78, leaving behind wife Pat and eight of his nine children.

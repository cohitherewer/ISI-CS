	Kathmandu, Aug. 6 (PTI): The Maoists have forced the organisers of Nepals oldest and most prestigious beauty pageant to postpone the event that was scheduled to be held tomorrow.         
	The Dabur Vatika Miss Nepal 2008 beauty pageant has been postponed indefinitely after the Maoist threats to disrupt the show.        
	The pageant, sponsored by Dabur Nepal, carries a Nepal Rs100,000 (Rs62,500) first prize along with a Kinetic scooter for the winner. The first and second runner-ups will get Nepal Rs60,000 and Nepal Rs40,000 respectively.         
	The Maoist activists said they would not allow such an anti-women event inspired by capitalist and feudalist elements in the country.         
	General secretary of the Maoist-affiliated All Nepal Womens Organisation (Revolutionary), Amrita Thapa, has spearheaded the anti-pageant campaign for months.        
	The beauty pageants are being organised by colonial rulers through the involvement of multinational companies to expand their business influence, Thapa said in Kathmandu. She stressed that since Nepal has already become a federal democratic republic we must stop such practices.

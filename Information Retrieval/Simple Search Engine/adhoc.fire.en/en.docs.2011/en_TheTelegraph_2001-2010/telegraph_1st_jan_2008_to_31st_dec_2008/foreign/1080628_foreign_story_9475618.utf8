	Harare, June 27 (Reuters): Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused President Robert Mugabe of forcing Zimbabweans to vote today in an election in which the 84-year-old leader is the only candidate.        
	Tsvangirai, who has taken refuge in the Dutch embassy for the last six days, said millions of people were staying away from the polls. He returned to the embassy after speaking. What is happening today is not an election. It is an exercise in mass intimidation with people all over the country being forced to vote.

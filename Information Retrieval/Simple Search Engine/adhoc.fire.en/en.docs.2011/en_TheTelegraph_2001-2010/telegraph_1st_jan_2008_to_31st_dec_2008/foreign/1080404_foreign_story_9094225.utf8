	Harare, April 3 (Reuters): Zimbabwes election results were further delayed today as President Robert Mugabe called a meeting of his top leadership to discuss how to face the biggest crisis of his 28-year rule.         
	Amid uncertainty over whether Mugabe will be able to hang on to power, authorities said results of elections to the upper house of parliament  which must precede the presidential results  had been delayed by logistical problems. They had been expected today.         
	Zimbabweans have been waiting since last Saturday to hear whether Mugabe was defeated in the vote, as the Movement for Democratic Change opposition says based on its own tallies.         
	The Opposition, and many Zimbabweans, believe the unprecedented delay in issuing results masks attempts by Mugabes entourage to find a way out of the crisis.         
	Ruling ZANU-PF party sources said Mugabe would chair a leadership meeting called tomorrow.         
	Senior ZANU-PF official Didymus Mutasa declined to comment on whether the party was planning for a runoff against MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, although another official said earlier it was ready for a vote and would win it. All I can confirm is there is a politburo meeting. Thats enough, thats all I can say at the moment, said Mutasa, the party secretary for administration.        
	Analysts said Mugabe was believed to have convened the leadership to discuss their next move after ZANU-PFs first defeat in a parliamentary election and to gauge how much support there was for him running in a second round.        
	Party projections show Mugabe failing to win a majority for the first time since he took power after independence from Britain in 1980.         
	But they also show Tsvangirai falling short of the required absolute majority to avoid a second round.         
	Political commentator John Makumbe, a fierce Mugabe critic, said there was concern that the party would try to engineer a way of staying in power despite election defeat.        
	The concern for the people on Zimbabwe is, are the members of the politburo going to stick to the laws of the land or are they going to backtrack, he said.         
	All the signs are that Mugabe, a liberation war leader still respected in Africa, is in the worst trouble of his rule after facing an unprecedented challenge in the elections because of the collapse of the Zimbabwean economy.

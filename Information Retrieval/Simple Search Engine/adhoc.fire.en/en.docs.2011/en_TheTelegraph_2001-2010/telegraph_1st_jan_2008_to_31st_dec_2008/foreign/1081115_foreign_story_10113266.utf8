  - Clinton tipped to be secretary of state                                 Hillary, Obama: Teaming up?				                                 
	London, Nov. 14: Hillary Clinton has emerged as a candidate to be US secretary of state for President-elect Barack Obama, months after he defeated her in an intense contest for the Democratic presidential nomination.         
	Putting the New York senator, and wife of former President Bill Clinton, in the position could help heal whatever lingering divisions remain in the Democratic Party after Hillarys bitter battle with Obama.         
	Her selection as top US diplomat could also mean a more hawkish foreign policy than that advocated by Obama during his presidential campaign.         
	Hillary flew to Obamas home town of Chicago yesterday. According to her office she was travelling on personal business. Neither her aides nor aides to the President-elect would say whether she was interviewed for the job by Obama, who spent a great part of the day behind closed doors in transition meetings at his Chicago office.         
	Any speculation about cabinet or other administration appointments is really for President-elect Obamas transition team to address, said Hillarys senior adviser, Philippe Reines.         
	NBC and The Washington Post reported that Hillary was under consideration for the top US diplomatic position. CNN reported that while walking into an awards ceremony in New York on Monday, Hillary was asked if she would consider taking a post in the Obama administration. It did not sound like she had ruled it out.         
	I am happy being a senator from New York, I love this state and this city. I am looking at the long list of things I have to catch up on and do. But I want to be a good partner and I want to do everything I can to make sure his agenda is going to be successful, Hillary said.

          ANITA SINGH                          New venture                                  
	London, June 3: Hollywood actor Brad Pitt is to fulfil his long-held dream of becoming an architect by designing a five-star hotel complex in Dubai.         
	The project will be socially conscious and a world leader in environmental sustainability, according to the property company behind it.         
	The resort will comprise an 800-room luxury hotel and adjoining leisure complex, and will play host to star-studded events and awards ceremonies. Its precise location is yet to be announced.         
	Pitt, 44, will be among a team of design consultants and said the project underpinned his belief in environmentally-friendly architecture.         
	Whilst acting is my career, architecture is my passion. Selecting this development as my first major construction project has been a simple decision, he said.         
	We will be unveiling precise plans in the next few months, but you can expect something that is not only stunning to look at, but will also be an incredible attraction to visit or stay at.         
	The Oscar-nominated star has a long-standing interest in architecture and is currently helping to build 150 homes in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, an area devastated by Hurricane Katrina.         
	He has said previously: Im really into architecture, structure and design. Give me anything and Ill design it. Im a bit nutty with it.        
	The Dubai project was announced by developers Zabeel Properties, who have appointed LA-based architecture firm Graft to oversee it.         
	Zabeel chief executive Robert Norton said: Our master plan and design concept will be world-leading and were delighted to be collaborating with Brad Pitt and the team at Graft, which is recognised for its innovative building design. This project will display our uncompromising focus and commitment for developing high quality and environmentally sustainable real estate in this region.         
	Pitt and partner Angelina Jolie are currently awaiting the birth of their twins.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

                                                                                                               Key Italian Muslim baptised
                            
	Vatican City, March 23 (AP): Italys most prominent Muslim commentator, who has long spoken out against Islamic fanaticismt, has converted to Roman Catholicism during the Vaticans Easter vigil service presided over by the pope.        
	Magdi Allam, 55, is the deputy editor of the Corriere della Sera newspaper and writes often on Muslim and Arab affairs. He was born a Muslim in Egypt, but was educated by Catholics and says he has never been a practicing Muslim.        
	Pope Benedict baptised Allam and six other adults during yesterdays service in St Peters Basilica. As a choir sang, Benedict poured holy water over Allams head and said a brief prayer in Latin. Later in the service, Allam also received his first Communion along with the other candidates.        
	We no longer stand alongside or in opposition to one another, Benedict said.

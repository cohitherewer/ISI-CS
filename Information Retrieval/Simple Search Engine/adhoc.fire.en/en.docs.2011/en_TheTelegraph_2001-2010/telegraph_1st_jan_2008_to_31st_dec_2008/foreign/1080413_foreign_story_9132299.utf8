          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                              
	Kathmandu, April 12: How many abolitions would it really take for the Nepali monarchy to be finally abolished?        
	At least four times since the Peoples Revolution of April 2006, the world has been told that King Gyanendra is history. The revolution itself was a triumphant anti-palace putsch; the only thing the rebellious throng didnt do was to scale the walls of Narainhity, the Shah dynastys seat mid-Kathmandu, and take over.         
	A month later, another death knell was sounded. Parliament, restored by Gyanendra under pressure, snatched away a critical royal preserve  his command of the armed forces. All royal property, other than personal assets which are staggering in themselves, was nationalised.        
	Republican aspiration sought more, and got. A parliamentary decree robbed the monarchy of the long-held privilege of presiding over religious ceremonies; Gyanendra was avatar of Vishnu no more.        
	Then, of course, came the famous third amendment to the Interim Constitution in December 2007. It declared Nepal, in quite unequivocal terms, a federal democratic republic. The 238-year-old monarchy had finally been factored out of the power equation. Or so they thought.        
	The optimists call this a gradualist process of dismantling the monarchy, and they may have a point because a drastic overthrow may provoke a backlash in conservative Nepal.         
	But Vishnu or no Vishnu, King or so-called king in small type, Gyanendra is still the boss of Narainhity, still able to manoeuvre enough levers to make Nepali republicans nervous about achieving their end.         
	The fact is, says one, Gyanendra is still the King. Prachanda is still having to employ most of his rhetoric against him, thats a sign he is not out. Until the new Constituent Assembly puts its seal on republicanism, nobody can be sure. Gynanendra is a tenacious and scheming man, and shows no sign that his hunger for power has ebbed.         
	Nepals reclusive monarch is a widely despised man, probably even more than his notorious son Paras. His popularity rating is more an unpopularity rating  a recent poll by the Kathmandu-based research group Inter Disciplinary Analysis (IDA) gave him 2 per cent.         
	As Nepals Maoists race ahead in the polls and triumphal red flag rallies stream through Kathmandus streets, anxiety must be gathering on Narainhity and its isolated occupant. Maoist chairman Prachanda has repeatedly made it clear Gyanendra can only live in this country as an ordinary citizen, no more.         
	If he does not stop conspiring, if he still wants to intervene in public affairs, sorry, he told The Telegraph on his campaign trail the other day. We will have to punish him then, he will have to face trial, there are so many allegations.         
	Is the end approaching then? Or can Gyanendra yet pull off a survival trick from his dhaka topi?         
	The royalists  two factions of the Rashtriya Prajatantrik Party (RPP), in the main  are doing poorly but their pro-king rhetoric remains shrill. Kamal Thapa, the president of one RPP faction, says: We are not against democracy, we want democracy too but who says there can be no democracy under a king?         
	The royalists may only be an irrelevant presence in the Constituent Assembly, but they are banking on silent support from elsewhere.        
	Where exactly is that located though? In the army, for a start. It isnt officially under Narainhitys command anymore but strong sections remain deeply loyal to Gyanendra.         
	But can the army be up to much in the face of such an overwhelming mandate? Most observers reckon no. The message of the people is overwhelming, says a former Nepali diplomat.         
	There could be political backing for the monarchy, though. The Nepali Congress, still the leading political force, remains deeply conservative. Although it is committed to a republic, it may not be averse to a ceremonial monarchy.         
	One possibility often talked about in Kathmandus rarefied power circles is that Gyanendras grandson, the five-year-old Hridayendra, be installed ceremonial monarch under a regent. Increasingly cornered, Gyanendra will go for it, if only to keep a toehold in the power structure. But the Maoists, exulting and bullish, will probably want to squelch that toe underfoot as they march along.

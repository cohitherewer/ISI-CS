	Johannesburg, May 22 (Reuters): Soldiers went into South African townships today to help police end attacks on African immigrants that have killed at least 42 people.        
	Soldiers backed the police in early morning raids in Johannesburg and air force helicopters patrolled Alexandra township after President Thabo Mbeki approved army intervention to quell unrest that has threatened to destabilise Africas largest economy.        
	At least 15,000 people have been forced from their homes in 11 days of attacks by mobs that accuse immigrants of taking jobs and fuelling crime. Mozambique said over 10,000 of its people had fled back to the country.        
	The police, supported by the soldiers, conducted early morning raids on three dormitory hostels near Johannesburg, the first army involvement to stop the attacks.        
	Firearms and ammunition were seized and 28 men were arrested. None of them were immediately linked to the violence, police spokesperson Sally de Beer said.        
	The attacks have increased political instability at a time of power shortages and disaffection over Mbekis pro-business policies. Soaring food and fuel prices helped push tensions to breaking point.        
	It is another blow  although I wouldnt advise panicking at this point in time, said BNP Paribas bank strategist Elizabeth Gruie of the attacks. We have to see how the government can deal with that in the very short term.        
	The deputy leader of the ruling African National Congress, Kgalema Motlanthe, criticised the police delay in responding to the violence which erupted in Alexandra township on May 11 and spread rapidly.        
	The delay encouraged people in similar environments to wage similar attacks against people who came from our sister countries in the continent, Motlanthe said at an international media industry conference in Johannesburg.        
	We are confronted by one of the ugliest incidents in the post-apartheid era.        
	Mozambique said 10,047 migrants and their families had returned from South Africa since the violence broke out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US stealth bomber crash
                                                                                                               US stealth bomber crash
                            
	Hagatna (Guam), Feb. 23 (Reuters): A US B-2 stealth bomber crashed at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam just after taking off but the two pilots on board ejected safely.        
	They have been evaluated by medical authorities and are in good condition, it said in a statement. An inquiry will be held into why the aircraft, which cost almost $1.2 billion each, crashed, an air force spokesman said. Guam, a US Pacific territory within striking distance of regional hotspots, has had a bomber presence since March 2004 and B-52s, B-2s and B-1s deploy on rotation from bases on the US mainland.

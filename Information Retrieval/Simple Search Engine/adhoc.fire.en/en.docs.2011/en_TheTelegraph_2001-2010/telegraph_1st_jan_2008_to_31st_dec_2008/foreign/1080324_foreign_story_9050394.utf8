The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nicole yawns at Urban gig
                                                                                                               Nicole yawns at Urban gig
          NATALIE PARIS                          Only smiles here                                  
	London, March 23: If rocker Keith Urban ever wondered what wife Nicole Kidman thinks of his music, pictures taken during a concert should tell him all he may not wish to know.        
	Photographed fidgeting in the audience at a concert in Australia, the actress seemed distinctly unimpressed by her husband giving his all for her entertainment onstage.        
	While the Grammy-award winner regaled the crowd with a string of hits, The Golden Compass star could be seen yawning through what fans said was a storming set.        
	Alternately inspecting her fingernails and playing with her bangles, Kidman sat behind a large fan which looked to be the only thing keeping her awake as she fought to keep her eyelids from drooping.         
	When she did glance stage wards, the 40-year-old was photographed wearing a look that can only be described as one of grim determination to make it through the evening. The Hollywood actress married Urban, a country music star, in a low- key candle-lit ceremony in Sydney in 2006.        
	Urban was said to have later serenaded his new wife with a love song, Making Memories of Us. One assumes there was no yawning at the back then.

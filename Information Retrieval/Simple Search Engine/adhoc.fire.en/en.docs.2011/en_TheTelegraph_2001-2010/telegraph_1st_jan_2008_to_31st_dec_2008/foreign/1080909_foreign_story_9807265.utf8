	Islamabad, Sept. 8 (PTI): On the eve of being sworn in as President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari today appealed to former ally Nawaz Sharif to rejoin the Pakistan Peoples Party-led coalition government.        
	However, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief refused to budge even though he assured Zardari healthy cooperation in strengthening democracy.        
	Zardari asked Sharif to return to the alliance when the former Prime Minister met the PPP co-chairman to congratulate him on his victory in last weeks presidential polls.        
	Senior PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal, who was present at the meeting, said Sharif told Zardari that the party would play a healthy role in the Opposition.        
	The PML-N pulled out of the alliance last month after accusing Zardari of reneging on several promises, including the reinstatement of judges deposed by former President Pervez Musharraf.         
	Iqbal described the meeting between Sharif and Zardari as a courtesy call and said the two sides did not have any detailed discussions. Zardari will be sworn in as President tomorrow. However, Sharif will not attend as he is leaving for London to be with his wife.

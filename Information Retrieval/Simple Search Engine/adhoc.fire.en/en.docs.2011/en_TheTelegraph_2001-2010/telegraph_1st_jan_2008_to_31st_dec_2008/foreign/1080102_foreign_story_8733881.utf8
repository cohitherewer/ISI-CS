The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Minister admits taking part in sex video
                                                                                                            Minister admits taking part in sex video
                              Chua Soi Lek: Adamant                            
	Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 1 (Reuters): A Malaysian minister admitted today he was featured in a widely circulated sex video, triggering a fresh scandal that could deeply embarrass the government ahead of snap elections.        
	Health minister Chua Soi Lek said he has apologised to the Prime Minister and other party leaders over the scandal, but added that he would not resign from the cabinet.        
	I am the man in the tape. The girl is a personal friend, the 60-year-old Chua said in a statement released at a news conference in his home state of Johor bordering Singapore.        
	His admission came hours after the local Star newspaper said two DVDs, showing a man resembling a senior politician and a woman engaging in various sexual acts, were being widely distributed in the state.        
	Chua, who is married, said he did not make the DVDs, which the Star said were closed-circuit recordings in a hotel room. One DVD lasted 56 minutes and the other 44 minutes. I would like to emphasise I did not make the tape myself, he said.Who have done this is not important. What is most important is that my family, wife and children have accepted my apology.        
	Chua, a leader of the Malaysian Chinese Association part of the ruling coalition, said he had met the Prime Minister over the incident.

	Nashua (New Hampshire), Jan. 9: The architects of John McCains 2008 campaign set out last year to avoid exactly where the Arizona Republican found himself last night: an insurgent emerging victoriously from New Hampshire with little money, little national presence and only the hope that momentum would take him to the White House.
    
	Having tried that already in his unsuccessful 2000 race, McCains effort to assemble a gold-plated operation collapsed in the summer, forcing him to adopt his old insurgent pose and once again reinvent his campaign on the fly. Tomorrow, we begin again, McCain told cheering supporters last night.
    
	Now even his supporters are wondering whether he can take his adrenaline-fuelled campaign national, a transformation he could not make eight years ago.
    
	Thats the open question, said Terry Nelson, who resigned as McCains campaign manager in July as his once-formidable campaign structure imploded. I think John McCain today is the frontrunner for the nomination, but his status is going to have to be re-confirmed in places like Michigan and South Carolina, and hes going to face his own hurdles in doing that. Hes not the George Bush of 2000. He just doesnt have that kind of campaign.
    
	Theres still a need for a larger overarching strategy to win the nomination, another former McCain aide added.
    
	Campaign aides and supporters say there are some fundamental differences between the two McCain bids. He has better organisations in the next two Republican primary states  South Carolina and Michigan  than he previously did. 
    
	Hes now polling better among Republican voters and maintaining his support among independents who fuelled his old bid. And perhaps most importantly, he does not face a titanic, establishment campaign like George W. Bushs in 2000.
    
	The dynamics are so different this time; theres no alternative like George W. out there, said Senator John Thune , a McCain supporter.
    
	Still, the shoestring campaign emerging from New Hampshire is a far cry from what McCain had once wanted.
    
	I remember when we won Michigan [in 2000], McCain turned to me and said: How did we do that? And I said I dont have [an] idea, recalled John Weaver, McCains former political strategist and a casualty of the July shake-up. This year, we didnt want that to happen. We wanted to know where we were going.

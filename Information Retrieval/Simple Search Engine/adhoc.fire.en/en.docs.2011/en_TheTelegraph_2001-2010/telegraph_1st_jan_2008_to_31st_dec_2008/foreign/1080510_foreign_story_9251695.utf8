	Bangkok, May 9 (AP): In the eyes of Myanmars military rulers, everyone is a potential enemy. Even foreign aid workers.        
	As the international community waits to deliver desperately needed aid to Myanmars cyclone survivors, it is getting a lesson in the mind-set of the countrys military rulers: reclusive, xenophobic generals who despise the western world.        
	Six days after Cyclone Nargis slammed into Myanmars western coast, killing more than 22,000 people, the impoverished countrys needs remain enormous. After initially pleading for the worlds help, the junta now seems determined to shun it.        
	The military regime is extraordinarily xenophobic. They are afraid of everything, said Sean Turnell, a Myanmar expert at Australias Macquarie University.        
	Among the juntas fears are internal uprisings, a US invasion, globalisation and its capacity to dilute traditional Myanmarese culture. In the aftermath of Saturdays cyclone, the junta appears to be afraid of losing face with its people.        
	If they cant handle the situation and they let westerners come in with helicopters, this will demonstrate to their own people the shortcomings of the military, Turnell said. They are more concerned with control and maintaining an omniscience in front of their people than saving lives.        
	A foreign militarys presence in Myanmar would mark a major concession for the junta. Theyre afraid that if foreign soldiers come in they are the spearhead to overthrow the government, said Josef Silverstein, a retired Rutgers University professor who studied Myanmar for more than a half century.         
	From the juntas perspective: Aid workers could be carrying weapons to give to the people, they could give them ideas of how to overthrow the government.

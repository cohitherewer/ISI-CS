	Toronto, Feb. 18 (PTI): An Indian businessman, whose fast food restaurant was destroyed in a suspected arson attack in Vacouver last week, has committed suicide.        
	Manjeet Nanas body was found on a beach near Squeamish while her car was recovered between Furry Creek and Porteau Cove on Friday, police said. They added that the death was a suicide.        
	Nandas restaurant and a few other shops were gutted after an explosion ripped through a commercial block. The mother of three and her husband Harjit were questioned by authorities but never suspected in the case.        
	Investigators believe a fire was deliberately set inside Nandas restaurant with the use of a chemical. I am very shaken up, Nanda had said after the incident.

	Madonna surprise    
	 Los Angeles, Nov. 8: Britney Spears made a surprise appearance on stage during Madonnas Sticky amp; Sweet tour, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Spears joined Madonna at the Dodgers stadium in Los Angeles during the song Human Nature. It was the first time they had shared a stage since their infamous kiss during the MTV Video Music Awards in 2003.      
	The audience  which included celebrity fans Jennifer Lopez, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu  erupted as Spears walked on stage and delivered the line: Its Britney, bitch.      
	While Madonna, 50, cavorted in a black leotard and fishnet tights, 26-year-old Spears dressed conservatively in a white blouse and baggy silk trousers.      
	The singer is on the comeback trail after a meltdown which saw her lose custody of her children and spend time on a psychiatric ward. She lamented the passage of a gay marriage ban in California.

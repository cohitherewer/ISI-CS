	Harare, June 22 (Reuters): Zimbabwean Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai pulled out of a run-off election against President Robert Mugabe today, saying a free and fair poll was impossible in the current climate of violence.        
	Speaking only hours after his Opposition Movement for Democratic Change reported its rally had been broken up by pro-Mugabe youth militia, Tsvangirai called on the UN and the African Union to intervene to stop genocide in the former British colony.        
	We in the MDC have resolved that we will no longer participate in this violent, illegitimate sham of an election process, he told reporters in Harare.        
	The MDC and Tsvangirai, who beat Mugabe in a March 29 vote but failed to win the absolute majority needed to avoid a second ballot, have repeatedly accused government security forces and militia of strong-arm tactics to ensure a Mugabe victory in the June 27 poll.        
	Tsvangirai repeated this today, saying there was a state-sponsored plot to keep the 84-year-old Mugabe in power.         
	We in the MDC cannot ask them (the voters) to cast their vote on June 27, when that vote could cost them their lives, he said.        
	There was no immediate reaction from Mugabe who in the past has blamed election violence on the Opposition.        
	But his justice minister, Patrick Chinamasa, said Zimbabwe would proceed with next Fridays poll unless Tsvangirai officially notified the election authorities he was pulling out.        
	In a later statement, the MDC said army helicopters were patrolling over Harare and Bulawayo, the second largest city, and that Zimbabwe was effectively under military rule.        
	More than 2,000 youth members of Mugabes ruling ZANU-PAF party were on the rampage, attacking citizens in central Harare, the MDC said.        
	In Washington, a White House spokesperson said: The government of Zimbabwe and its thugs must stop the violence now.        
	All parties should be able to participate in a legitimate election and not be subject to the intimidation and unlawful actions of the government, armed militias and so-called war veterans, Carlton Carroll, a White House assistant press secretary, said in a statement.        
	French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Mugabe was using violence to gag the people of Zimbabwe.

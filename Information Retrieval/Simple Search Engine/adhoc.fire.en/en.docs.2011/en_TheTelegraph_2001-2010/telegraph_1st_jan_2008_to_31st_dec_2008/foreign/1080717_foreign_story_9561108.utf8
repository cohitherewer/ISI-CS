                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US to send envoy to Iran talks
                            
	Washington, July 15 (Reuters): In a shift in policy, the US will send an envoy to talks between Iran and major powers over Tehrans nuclear programme, a senior US official said yesterday.        
	US under secretary of state William Burns will join EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana and envoys from China, Russia, France, Britain and Germany in a meeting with Iranian nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili in Geneva on Saturday, the official said.        
	They will discuss Irans response to an offer made by world powers last month to give up sensitive nuclear work. The US had said previously it would not be involved in any pre-negotiations with Tehran unless it gave up uranium enrichment. The US official made clear the ground rules were that Burns would not act as a negotiator.

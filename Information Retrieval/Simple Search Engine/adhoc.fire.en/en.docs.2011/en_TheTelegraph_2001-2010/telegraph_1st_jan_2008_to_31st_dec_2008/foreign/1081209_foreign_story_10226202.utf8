The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cuba praise for a US Che
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cuba praise for a US Che
                              Actor Benicio Del Toro as Che Guevara in Che                            
	Havana, Dec. 8 (Reuters): Cubans over the weekend applauded a US directors new movie on Ernesto Che Guevara for its accurate portrayal of his fabled role in Cubas revolution.        
	They packed into two cinemas to see Che, a four-hour epic directed by Steven Soderbergh, at its first screening in Cuba during Havanas annual Latin American film festival.        
	Puerto Rican actor Benicio Del Toro, who plays the Argentine-born revolutionary, was joined at the screening by Leonardo Tamayo.         
	He fought with Guevara in Bolivia, where Che was captured and executed in 1967 for trying to lead an insurgency. The film covers two parts of Guevaras life  his role in the 1959 revolution in Cuba with Fidel Castro, and his struggle and death in Bolivia.        
	Its great. It really reflects the life of Che and his fight in Bolivia and how he was assassinated, said Eugenio Martinez, a retiree at one screening. Its satisfying to see that his fight was not in vain.        
	Havana festival organisers had said in July that Che would not be shown if it attacked Fidel Castro, the ailing 82-year-old who led Cuba for 49 years after taking power in the 1959 revolution.        
	Cuba said the film was shot in Spain and Bolivia because the US government, which has a four-decade trade embargo against communist-run Cuba, barred Soderbergh from making the movie on the island.        
	The first part of the film is set in Cuba, where Guevara helped Fidel Castro overthrow the dictator Fulgencio Batista in a long guerrilla campaign that ended in December 1958; the second takes place in Bolivia, where Guevara went in 1966 to start a revolution that he hoped would spread throughout Latin America.        
	The film appeared in Cuba as President-elect Barack Obama is raising expectations he will ease restrictions on the island. Granma, the newspaper of Cubas ruling Communist Party, praised Del Toro but said Fidel Castros character lacked charisma.

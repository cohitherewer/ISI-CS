          CATHERINE ELSWORTH                          The Bratz dolls                                  
	Los Angeles, May 28: The toy company behind the Bratz doll franchise stole the idea for its pouty-lipped figures from arch rival Mattel, lawyers for the Barbie manufacturer said.         
	A lawyer for Mattel, the worlds largest toy manufacturer, told a California court that the rights to Barbies wildly popular rival belong to Mattel, not Bratz makers MGA Entertainment.         
	This was because they were created by a designer who was still working for Mattel at the time he envisioned the line, John Quinn told the court in Riverside, 60m east of Los Angeles.         
	This explains how a small company that never designed a fashion doll... was able in a short period of time to come up with a doll that became a global hit, Quinn said         
	The two California-based toy makers are facing off in a copyright infringement case brought by Mattel against MGA that got underway yesterday.         
	Mattel claims the Bratz dolls were designed by Carter Bryant, a former employee who came up with the concept while still working for the company in 2000.         
	In his opening statement, Quinn told jurors that when Bryant came up with the idea for Bratz, he was still under contract with Mattel, having signed an agreement giving the company the rights to anything he designed while working for them.         
	But instead the designer secretly took the designs to MGA, enabling it to launch the multi-million dollar franchise that has been eating away at Barbies sales since 2001.         
	Quinn said: MGA never had the rights to these drawings. They were always Mattels.         
	Quinn also accused MGA of changing its story about the origins of the dolls, trying to keep Bryants involvement a secret and even claiming CEO Isaac Larian or his son thought up the urban-themed line.         
	MGA, which denies Mattels allegations, has countersued. It accuses Mattel of altering the design of its My Scene dolls to resemble the Bratz line more closely.         
	In his opening statements, Thomas Nolan, a lawyer for MGA, said Bryant came up with the Bratz concept in 1998 and only added colour to his original sketches while working for Mattel.         
	He didnt redraw them. He didnt change the concept, Nolan said. This was Carters impression of what was out there in 1998.         
	Mattel had also sued Bryant but last week reached a confidential settlement with the designer and dropped its lawsuit against him. Both sides have listed him as a witness in the trial.                             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

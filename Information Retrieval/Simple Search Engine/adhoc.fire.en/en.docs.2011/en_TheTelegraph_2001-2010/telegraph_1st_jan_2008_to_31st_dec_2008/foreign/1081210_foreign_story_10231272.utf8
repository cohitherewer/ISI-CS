	Washington, Dec. 9: President-elect Barack Obama has ordered his first new tuxedo in 15 years for his inaugural celebration. And he has invited the marching band from Punahou School, his high school in Hawaii, to join the parade. (Nearly 1,400 bands have applied; only a few dozen are chosen.)        
	Plans for Obamas inauguration on January 20 are slowly taking shape. But with increasing numbers of people out of work and American soldiers enmeshed in two wars, inaugural planners face the task of keeping the tone respectful while still celebrating Obamas achievement.        
	Theres no question that people are in tough times, said Linda Douglass, a spokeswoman for Obamas inaugural committee. But we hope that this will be an event in which we celebrate our common values and shared aspirations. She added: What we are looking to achieve is a tone that is hopeful.        
	Obama formed his inauguration committee only recently, and it has yet to establish a schedule for the day or reveal what events it may be planning after the noon swearing-in ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol. Much of the day is pro forma, but Presidents like to tailor the details on everything from selecting the marching bands to which inaugural balls will be designated as official. And all will be dissected for meaning.        
	According to Democratic officials, among the options being considered during this years events, one of them will have Obama and Vice-President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. take part in some form of community service in Washington. This will be done suitably to reflect the mood of the nation.         
	If they did so, they would most likely call upon people around the country to do the same in their own towns, which could help mitigate any criticism of inaugural celebrations.

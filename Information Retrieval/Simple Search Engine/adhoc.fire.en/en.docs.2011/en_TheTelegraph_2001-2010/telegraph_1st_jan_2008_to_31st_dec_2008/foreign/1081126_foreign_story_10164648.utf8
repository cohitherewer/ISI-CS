                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Protests hit Thai airport, city flight
                            
	Bangkok, Nov. 25 (Reuters): Flights were cancelled at Thailands main airport today after anti-government protesters stormed the building, leaving thousands of travellers stranded and threatening the countrys tourism industry.        
	Outgoing flights at the Suvarnabhumi airport were suspended at 7.30pm (IST) tonight, airport director Sereerat Prasutanont said. The Thai Airways flight from Bangkok to Calcutta (TG313), which was scheduled to land at 12.30am, was cancelled. The departure hall has been closed, Prasutanont told TPBS TV. Flights that are ready to depart can leave, but those that are not ready must cancel their flights, he said. The airport is the main gateway for 14.5 million visitors to Thailand each year        
	The move came after members of the Peoples Alliance for Democracy (PAD) broke through police lines and roamed through the sprawling $4 billion terminal, southeast of Bangkok, as startled tourists looked on.The airport invasion capped a dramatic day that also saw PAD protesters firing on pro-government supporters on a major road leading to the old airport to the north of the city. Footage aired by public broadcaster TPBS showed at least two PAD security guards firing half a dozen rounds from handguns.         
	There were chaotic scenes at Suvarnabhumi, a major regional air hub that handles 76 flights an hour, after protesters broke through lines of riot police. There are lot of people with sticks and baseball bats. They looked ready for a fight, Belgian tourist Ben Creemers said. Outside the terminal, thousands of PAD members waved plastic hand-clappers.

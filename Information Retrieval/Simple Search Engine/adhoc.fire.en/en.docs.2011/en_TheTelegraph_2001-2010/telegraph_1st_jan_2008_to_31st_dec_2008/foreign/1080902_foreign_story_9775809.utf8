	Islamabad, Sept. 1: Police launched a search operation in northwest Pakistan today for two Chinese telecommunications engineers and two Pakistanis who went missing last week near the Afghan border.        
	Al Qaida- and Taliban-linked militants have targeted Chinese nationals in Pakistans northwest in the past.        
	The Chinese, along with a Pakistani driver and guard, disappeared from Dir region, some 200km northwest of Islamabad, on Friday when they were returning to a guest house after fixing a telecommunication tower there.        
	Were trying our best but so far, were absolutely clueless. The last time they were seen was near the tower on Friday evening. Thats what we know, Fida Hassan Shah, senior police officer in the region, said by telephone.        
	They even did not inform police about their movement which is necessary for security reasons. Dir borders with Pakistans tribal region of Bajaur and Swat Valley where security forces have launched military operations against pro-Taliban militants.        
	Shah said the engineers, working with Chinese telecom company China Mobile, had been based in the area for the last month. Anyone, criminals or militants, could have done this. No one actually saw them being picked up by someone nor has anyone claimed responsibility.A Taliban spokesman in Swat Valley did not rule out that the Chinese might have abducted by militants in Dir.

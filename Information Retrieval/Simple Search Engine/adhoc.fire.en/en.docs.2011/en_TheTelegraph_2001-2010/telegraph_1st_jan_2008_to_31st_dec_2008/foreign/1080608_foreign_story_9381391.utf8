	Naked nuisance    
	 Mexico City, June 7 (AP): Mexicos government guardians of history did not mind the fact that a seemingly naked soap opera star was promoting the glories of Hidalgo state.      
	But they say they were miffed that Iran Castillos curves drew eyes away from a famed aqueduct and convent  and convinced state officials to pull the more provocative of the ads.      
	The ads showed tourism attractions such as the Atlantes monoliths, a cathedral and an aqueduct overlaid on Castillos apparently naked form.       
	The campaign created a sensation in the Mexican press even before it ran. Officials from the National Institute of Anthropology and History complained that state officials failed to get permits to show Castillo with the monuments and suggested the ads violated the sites dignity.    
	Anne pinch    
	 Los Angeles (AP): Anne Heches five-year marriage to Coleman Laffoon is officially over, but not without a pinch to her pocketbook. A judge ruled that Heche must pay $275,000 to her ex-husband, along with monthly child-support payments of $3,700 for the care of their 6-year-old son, Homer, according to court documents released on Friday. Heche will also have to pay 75 per cent of Homers private-school tuition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bloomberg seeks third mayor term
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bloomberg seeks third mayor term
                            
	New York, Oct. 2 (Reuters): New York mayor Michael Bloomberg today said that he would seek a change in the law so he could run for a third term in 2009.        
	He argued that the financial crisis demands a leader of his business acumen.        
	Voters imposed limits of two four-year terms on elected city officials in 1993 and 1996, but Bloomberg, a former Wall Street trader, will ask the city council to extend the limits to a third term. This would permit him to enter the mayoral race.        
	We may well be on the verge of a meltdown and its up to us to rise to the occasion, Bloomberg said. So should the city council vote to amend term limits, I plan to ask New Yorkers to look at my record and then decide if I have earned another term.

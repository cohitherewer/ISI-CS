	London, Oct. 28: Drinkers hoping to drown their sorrows and forget all about the credit crunch are heading to a Florida bar thats made of money.         
	Every single wall and ceiling in the No Name Bar is plastered with dollar bills. In fact, it is estimated that the pub is decorated with more than 50,000 worth of cash. Since the mid-1980s, patrons have been writing their names and messages on notes and stapling them to every surface of the Florida Keys venue.         
	The origins of the tradition are unclear but it is rumoured that there was so much illicit money passing through the Keys at the time that people started to hang it on the walls.         
	Now the interior of the tavern looks like someone has left the mother of all tips  with even the toilet doors plastered in hard currency. British holidaymaker Vicky Simpson, 25, said: Id heard that the bar had bank notes on the ceiling but I couldnt believe it when I saw they were everywhere  on the walls, on the bar and even on the corridor leading to the toilet.

                              no baby bump                            
	London, July 19: Actress Nicole Kidman could be accused of making childbirth look easy if her latest pictures are anything to go by.         
	Spotted out with her husband Keith Urban, the Australian star looked remarkably slim considering she had only given birth to her daughter Sunday just two weeks ago.         
	Dressing down in a denim jacket and wide-legged trousers, there was almost no trace of her baby bump to be seen.         
	As she shopped for bedding for her new addition there was every sign that Kidman would soon be back to her slender, willowy self within weeks.         
	The couple named their little girl after Sunday Reed, the muse of Australian artist Sidney Nolan.         
	Kidman and country singer Urban, are said to love a quote by Nolan, which hangs in a Sydney art gallery and reads: When you are young you are given a good view of life, because of your closeness to birth.         
	Sunday Reed was born in 1905 and was a charismatic figure with an unorthodox private life. Nicoles daughter was born early on Monday morning in a Nashville hospital near the couples ranch home. She is their first child.         
	The family left the hospital late on Monday evening, adding to speculation that Kidman had a natural birth rather than a caesarean, which can take longer to recover from.

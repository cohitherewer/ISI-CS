          MEGAN LEVY AND AGENCIES                          Sean Connery                                  
	London, Feb. 24: Oscar-winning actor Sean Connery said he believed Scotland would become an independent country within his lifetime.         
	The former James Bond star, who has Scotland Forever tattooed on his forearm, felt that the country was within touching distance of achieving independence.        
	Writing for the Scottish Sunday Express, Connery praised Scotlands first minister Alex Salmond and the work of the government since it took power in May 2007.         
	The 77-year-old has lived in the Bahamas for several years, but has promised to move back to Scotland after independence.         
	Ive always been hopeful about Scotlands prospects. And I now believe more than ever that Scotland is within touching distance of achieving independence and equality, he wrote.        
	He adds that the first step towards this was winning Scotlands parliament in 1997. The second was electing a government last year.         
	I believe we have what it takes to take the third step, and I am convinced it will happen in my lifetime, he said.

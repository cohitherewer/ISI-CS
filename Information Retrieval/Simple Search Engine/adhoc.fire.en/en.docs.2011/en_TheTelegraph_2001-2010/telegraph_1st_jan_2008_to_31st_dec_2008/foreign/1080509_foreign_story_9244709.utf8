The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Madonna in another on-stage lesbian kiss
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Madonna in another on-stage lesbian kiss

	London, May 8: Ageless pop matriarch Madonna has been up to her old lesbian tricks again, locking lips with a female dancer during a raunchy dance routine.         
	Madonna  whose new album, Hard Candy, is in shops now  grabbed the much younger dancer during a free gig at the Olympia theatre, Paris.         
	The singer, who is married to Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels director Guy Ritchie, turns fifty this year. Some commentators have suggested that this latest episode is intended to keep her feeling fresh and relevant to younger audiences.         
	The self-styled Material Girl has a history of high-profile Sapphic behaviour. Five years ago she famously engaged in a lengthy French kiss with the starlet widely tipped to replace her as Queen of Pop, Britney Spears.         
	An unnamed onlooker told The Mirror newspaper: Madonna took a massive gulp from a champagne bottle, eyed up the dancer and then went in for the kill. It was pretty full-on and they both looked like they were enjoying it.

	Islamabad, Jan. 20 (Reuters): Pakistan villagers said army helicopter gunships launched strikes today in an area regarded as a stronghold of a Taliban commander linked with the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto.
    
	The air attack on positions held by fighters loyal to Baitullah Mehsud, a commander with close ties to al Qaida, followed overnight shelling of villages around Ladha, a town in the remote South Waziristan tribal region.
    
	There were no fresh casualty reports available, but the military said yesterday that it had captured 40 militants, and killed 90 during operations in the area on Friday.
    
	Military spokesperson Major-General Athar Abbas said there were exchanges of fire between security forces and militants in Ladha, but denied the army used gunships, saying that two helicopters had been used to deliver supplies to troops.
    
	Mehsud was linked to a spate of suicide attacks last year, and his supporters are believed to be giving sanctuary to al Qaida fighters and Pakistani militant groups angered by President Pervez Musharrafs alliance with the US.
    
	CIA director Michael Hayden, in an interview published by the Washington Post on Friday, backed Pakistani authorities by blaming Mehsud for Bhuttos assassination. 
    
	A Pakistani security official said yesterday a 15-year-old would-be suicide bomber had told interrogators he would have been next in line to kill Bhutto had she survived that attempt.
    
	The boy and his alleged handler were caught in Dera Ismail Khan, the main town in a region near South Waziristan. They were the first significant arrests in the case. The boy said he was trained in Mehsuds territory, according to the security official.
    
	Although Bhutto said she would confront religious forces that supported militancy, many people are more ready to believe Pakistans own security agencies had a hand in her killing.
    
	Meanwhile, Musharraf, whose popularity at home has slumped over recent months, set off on a four-country trip to Europe today that will take him to Brussels and Paris, before attending the World Economic Forum in Switzerland ahead of talks in London.
    
	The Pakistani leader, who quit as army chief after securing five more years as President in November, is expected to come under pressure to give assurances a national election due on February 18 will be fair.

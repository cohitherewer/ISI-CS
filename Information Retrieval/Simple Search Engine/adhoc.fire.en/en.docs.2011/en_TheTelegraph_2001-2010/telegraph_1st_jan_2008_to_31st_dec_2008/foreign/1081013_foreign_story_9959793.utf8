	Beijing, Oct. 12: Chinas leaders are locked in an ideological battle over the future direction of the countrys economy in the wake of the world financial crisis.         
	For four days, the Chinese Communist Party elite has been meeting behind closed doors in Beijing to thrash out what new policies should govern the fastest-growing economy in the world, and how to prevent the global financial crisis from damaging Chinas continued prosperity as much as that of the West.         
	For hardliners among the 204 members of the partys ruling Central Committee, the trauma western financial institutions are experiencing is proof both of the superiority of Chinas economic policies and its political system.         
	Two weeks ago, an editorial in the Peoples Daily newspaper, the mouthpiece of the party, attacked western-style democracy, while lauding the Chinese one-party system and its tight control over the economy.         
	The advantages are increasingly evident. Western countries are mired in low growth and the USs severe financial crisis is a manifestation of the dead end of liberalism and the destruction of the myth of American institutions, said the editorial.         
	But the meeting is taking place just as ominous signs are emerging that the financial meltdown in the US is having an impact on China. Chinas stock market, the Shanghai Composite Index, has recorded its worst ever week and is hovering just above the psychologically crucial 2000 mark.         
	Despite cutting interest rates as part of the international effort on Wednesday, the government has been powerless to stem the losses. The index has dropped by almost 70 per cent from its record high of 6030 in October 2007.         
	Meanwhile in Hong Kong the Hang Seng Index fell by 16 per cent last week. Many of the estimated 150 million investors who rushed to buy shares when the index was peaking have lost their life savings and pensions.        
	At the same time, the property boom of the last few years has come to an abrupt halt. High prices and a surplus of new homes meant that in September, traditionally the best month for house sales, there were the lowest number of transactions so far this year.         
	Developers in the worst-hit cities, Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, have been slashing prices by up to 30 per cent in an effort to attract buyers. I think house prices will fall by another 10 to 15 per cent by the end of the year, said Yang Shaofeng, the general manager of the Beijing Lianda Sifang Real Estate Co and the author of one of Chinas most widely-read property blogs.         
	Since 2006 a lot of money has gone into the housing market and the stock market, and thats created a bubble. Now, the bubble is bursting. Many of those who invested in shares feel the government hasnt done enough to minimise the losses suffered by the market.

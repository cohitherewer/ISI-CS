	Tripoli, Sept. 5 (Reuters): Top US diplomat Condoleezza Rice arrived in Tripoli today on the first trip by a US secretary of state to Libya since 1953, and said it was proof that Washington had no permanent enemies.        
	Rice was set to meet Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi during her brief trip, which Washington hopes will end decades of enmity and violence and comes five years after Libya gave up its weapons of mass destruction program in 2003.        
	Rice told reporters travelling with her to Tripoli: It demonstrates that when countries are prepared to make strategic changes in direction, the US is prepared to respond. Quite frankly I never thought I would be visiting Libya.

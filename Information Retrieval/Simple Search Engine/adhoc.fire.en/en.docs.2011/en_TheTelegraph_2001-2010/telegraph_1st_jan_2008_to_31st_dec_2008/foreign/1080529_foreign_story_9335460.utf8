The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Coalition asks Olmert to quit
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Coalition asks Olmert to quit
                              Olmert                            
	Jerusalem, May 28 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmerts main coalition partner demanded today he leave office over corruption allegations, dealing another blow to the leader in turmoil threatening to derail peace talks.        
	Defence minister Ehud Barak issued the call  and raised the prospect of an early election  a day after a US businessman told an Israeli court how he had handed Olmert envelopes stuffed with thousands of dollars in cash.        
	I do not think the Prime Minister can simultaneously run the government and deal with his own personal affair, said Barak, a former Prime Minister whose Labour party is Olmerts biggest partner in a fragile coalition government.        
	Therefore, out of a sense of what is good for the country and in accordance with the proper norms, I think the Prime Minister must detach himself from the day-to-day running of the government, Barak told a news conference.        
	Olmerts office declined comment. Israel Radio said Olmert, who is negotiating peace with the Palestinians and pursuing indirect talks with Syria, held a closed meeting with confidants and told them he had no intention of heeding Baraks call.        
	Olmert has ridden out similar storms since taking office in early 2006 and Barak was less than clear on what steps he might take, and when.        
	Barak also stopped short of action that would immediately bring down the government and trigger an election that could backfire on him. Polls suggest the right-wing Likud under Benjamin Netanyahu would handily defeat Labour.        
	Barak spelled out Olmerts options as suspension, vacation or resignation or declaring himself incapacitated. He added: We will not be the ones to determine this.        
	Commentators noted Barak took no action on demands he made last year for Olmert to go after the costly 2006 Lebanon war.        
	Weve seen this movie before, political analyst Ravid Drucker said on Channel 10 television after the news conference. The left-wing Meretz party said Baraks latest comments were not a real ultimatum and were just hot air.

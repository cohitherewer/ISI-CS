	London, Sept. 30: Bureaucrats in an Italian town are trying to impose a new rain tax on residents.         
	Authorities in Ravenna in the Emilia Romagna region have added 3 per cent to water bills to maintain and improve drainage systems by arguing that heavy rain causes severe damage to infrastructure, buildings and agriculture in the Po valley.         
	The local water board, which wants to backdate the new tax three years, claims that the payments will save it 1 million euros (800,000) a year.         
	Gianluca Dradi, head of environmental policy for Ravenna city council, likened the proposal to a utility service, similar to paying taxes for streets to be cleaned. Including the cost in water bills is more equitable, he told the Repubblica newspaper.         
	Those who pay more for their water use, such as factories, will pay proportionately more than households, which by comparison will pay relatively little, he added.         
	However, consumer organisations in Ravenna are urging householders not to pay up. This is just another tax in disguise, said Roberto Passino, a spokesman for a protest group.         
	Ravenna, in northeastern Italy, is connected to the Adriatic by a canal which was overwhelmed by floods in 1636. A network of canals was built to divert nearby rivers and drain marshland, creating a protective belt of agricultural land around the city.         
	The Po delta receives 750mm of rain a year, mostly in November, December and January.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

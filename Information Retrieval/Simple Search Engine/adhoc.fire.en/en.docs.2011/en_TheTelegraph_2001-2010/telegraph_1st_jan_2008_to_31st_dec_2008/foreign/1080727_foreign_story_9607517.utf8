	London, July 26: Seventy years after fleeing the Nazis, a 93-year-old woman whose family was immortalised in The Sound of Music has returned to Austria to visit her former home.         
	Im back home again, said Maria von Trapp in Salzburg, after spending several nights in her childhood home, which has been transformed into a hotel.         
	Located in an upmarket district of Salzburg, the Villa Trapp once belonged to the von Trapps, who gained global fame in the 1965 blockbuster starring Julie Andrews, which tells the story of a trainee nun who captures the heart of a lonely widower after introducing his seven children to the joy of music. The hotel is expected to open to guests in October. Fans of the classic musical will have the chance stay in the house the von Trapps lived in between 1923 and 1938 before emigrating to the US.         
	Von Trapp, who was flown in from America to see the hotel plans along with several relatives, appeared enthusiastic about the venture. Im sleeping in the room where my brother slept ... its very nice to be back again, she said.         
	In real life, the von Trappss property was confiscated by the Nazis and SS chief Heinrich Himmler moved in. SS barracks were built in the garden and the property was secured with barbed wire and armed guards.         
	After the war, the Missionaries of the Precious Blood bought the villa from the family in 1947. The religious order later moved into a nearby building and rented it out to the business partners who spent 500,000 euros to convert it into a hotel. The Salzburg villa does not appear in the movie, which used a lakeside castle and other locations for the exterior garden scenes.         
	All the interior shots were filmed in a Hollywood studio, and the famous opening scene of Andrews running across an alpine meadow was shot over the border in Bavaria, Germany.         
	The von Trapps are expected to stay in Austria until early August.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

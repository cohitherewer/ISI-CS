	Boston, March 15 (AP): Oscar winner Ben Affleck and his actor wife, Jennifer Garner, are putting their Hollywood clout behind Barack Obama for a fundraiser.        
	They will host an event for the Democratic presidential candidate tomorrow at Rumor, a Boston nightclub. The $250 pre-party tickets, which buys some one-on-one time with the couple, are sold out. A $50 ticket buys entry into the club, where Garner and Affleck, who are affectionately called Bennifer Part 2, will mingle. Obama will not be attending.        
	Affleck recently agreed to help judge a contest sponsored by www.MoveOn.org to find the best ad supporting Obamas campaign.

	Malabo (Equatorial Guinea), June 18 (Reuters): The son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was a leader of a 2004 coup plot in oil-rich Equatorial Guinea that was backed by Spain and South Africa, a British mercenary told a court today.        
	Former special forces officer Simon Mann testified that Mark Thatcher was not just an investor in the plot to oust Equatorial Guinea President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.

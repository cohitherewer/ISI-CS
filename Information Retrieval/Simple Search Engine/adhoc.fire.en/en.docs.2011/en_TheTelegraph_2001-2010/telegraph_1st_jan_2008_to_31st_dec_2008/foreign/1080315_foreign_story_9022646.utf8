	Beijing, March 14 (Reuters): Tibetans burned shops and cars today and demanded independence in the biggest protests in the region for two decades, prompting condemnation from China and an appeal for calm from the Dalai Lama.        
	Peaceful street marches by Tibetan Buddhist monks over the past few days gave way to angry crowds of hundreds who confronted anti-riot police in the remote region  testing Chinas rule just as it readies for the Olympic Games.        
	China said the protests were organised, premeditated and masterminded by the Dalai clique and vowed to restore control, Xinhua news agency said, while Tibets exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, called on China not to use brute force.        
	Now its very chaotic outside, an ethnic Tibetan resident said by telephone. People have been burning cars and motorbikes and buses. There is smoke everywhere and they have been throwing rocks and breaking windows. Were scared.        
	Radio Free Asia, quoting witnesses, said Chinese police fired on protesters, killing at least two. A source told Reuters that two Tibetans were shot dead near the Ramoche Monastery near the capital, Lhasa. The deaths could not be further verified.        
	The Chinese governments first public reaction suggested a harsh response may come.        
	The violence, involving beating, smashing, looting and burning, has disrupted the public order, jeopardised peoples lives and property, Xinhua quoted an official as saying.        
	The plots by the very few people against the stability and harmony of Tibet run counter to the will of the people and are doomed to fail, he said, adding that the government was fully capable of maintaining social stability in the region.        
	Residents near the Jokhang temple in old Lhasa said they had seen lines of anti-riot police, but none spoke of gunfire. We are waiting to see what will happen tomorrow, said an ethnic Tibetan woman. It could get much worse.        
	Up to 400 protesters gathered around the market near the Jokhang temple early today and were confronted by about 1,000 police, according to a witness cited by Matt Whitticase of the Free Tibet Campaign in London.        
	An ethnic Tibetan resident said some protesters shouted for independence from China. Its no longer just the monks. Now they have been joined by lots of residents, the man said.        
	The eruption of anger comes despite Beijings repeated claims that the Tibetan people are grateful for improved lives and it threatens to stain preparations for the Olympics in August.        
	These protests are a manifestation of the deep-rooted resentment of the Tibetan people under the present governance, the Dalai Lama said.        
	I, therefore, appeal to the Chinese leadership to stop using force and address the long-simmering resentment of the Tibetan people through dialogue with the Tibetan people.        
	The protests present hard choices for President Hu Jintao, who was party boss in Tibet in 1989 when China imposed martial law there to quell anti-Chinese protest, as the US and EU urged Beijing to avoid a harsh response.

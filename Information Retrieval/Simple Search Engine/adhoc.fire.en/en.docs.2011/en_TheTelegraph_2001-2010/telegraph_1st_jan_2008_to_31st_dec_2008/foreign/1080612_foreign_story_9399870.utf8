	Dhaka, June 11 (PTI): Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was today released from prison after an apparent deal between the military-backed government and her party, the Awami League.        
	The home ministry said her parole could be revoked without reason, which was seen by some as a warning for her to steer clear of politics.        
	She is being released on parole for eight weeks as per the medical boards recommendation, but it may be cancelled any time without assigning any reason, a statement from the home (interior) ministry said.        
	Hasina was likely to leave for the US via Britain tomorrow, a senior prison official said. Party officials said she was expected to meet party leaders and government advisers tonight for a range of political and election talks.        
	The 60-year-old Hasina was released from her makeshift prison inside the parliament complex after the interim government issued an executive order allowing her to undergo treatment abroad, inspector general of prisons Brigadier General Zakir Hassan said.        
	The Awami leader immediately went to her Sudha Sadan home under heavy security as her party workers gathered in strength outside the prison to welcome her.        
	Hasinas lawyer Fazle Noor Taposh said she may not preside over any party meeting before leaving the country. He said Hasina got a visa for Canada on Monday while she already has visas for the US and Britain on her passport. She will be treated in Orlando, Florida, for hearing ailment and eyes. Later, she will go to Canada to visit her daughter, party sources said.

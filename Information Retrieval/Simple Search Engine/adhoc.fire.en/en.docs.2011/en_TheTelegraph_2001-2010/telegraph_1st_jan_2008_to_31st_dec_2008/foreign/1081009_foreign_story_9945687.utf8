	New York ,Oct 8 (AP) Research in Motion Ltd, maker of the BlackBerry, is taking on Apple Inc with a touch-screen phone that puts a new twist on the technology.        
	 RIM is known for its email-oriented phones with large keypads. With the new model announced today, the Storm, RIM is for the first time giving up the physical keypad in favour of a large screen, just like the one on Apples iPhone.        
	 But RIM has listened to users who find the iPhones glass screen awkward to type on because its virtual buttons provide no tactile feedback. The Storms whole screen is backed by springs, and when pressed, it gives under the finger.        
	 The long-rumoured Storm will be available from Verizon Wireless in the US and from Vodafone Group PLC overseas before the holidays, the companies said. No price has been disclosed yet. In an unusual twist, the phone will work both on Verizon Wireless network and on Vodafones, even though they use incompatible technologies. Like a few other Verizon Wireless handsets before it, the Storm will be equipped with radios to handle both networks, making international roaming a possibility.        
	 The iPhone, carried by AT amp;T Inc in the US, can already roam internationally.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Oval Office really nice
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Oval Office really nice

	Washington, Nov. 11: Michelle Obama kissed Laura Bush lightly on the cheek. President-elect Barack Obama gave President Bush an athletic pat on the shoulder.         
	With those simple gestures, carried out yesterday afternoon on the South Portico of the White House, a time-honoured ritual of American democracy  the peaceful transfer of power  officially began.        
	For the nation, it was an obvious first as an African-American came to tour the White House as President-elect. But for Obama, the visit marked a series of personal firsts:        
	 His first trip back to the nations capital since his victory over Senator John McCain last week.         
	 His first limousine ride in Washington; on the campaign trail, Obama typically rode in a SUV.        
	 His first time inside the Oval Office; although Obama had been to the White House before, he had never set foot inside the storied office that symbolises American power around the world.        
	The visit was choreographed to provide images of a smooth transition and a warm and friendly welcome for the new first family, and the two couples obliged. But there was as much substance as style; the session came in the thick of a financial crisis that has Washington swirling with talk of a second stimulus package, an expanded bailout for the insurance giant A.I.G. and help for struggling automakers.         
	For an hour and five minutes, Bush and Obama sat in the Oval Office with no aides or note-takers, and discussed the economic crisis and the security challenges facing the nation. Obama pressed Bush to offer aid to automakers; Bush raised the free trade pact with Colombia, stalled in the Democratic-led Congress, people familiar with the session said.        
	Both sides were circumspect and declined to disclose details of their talk, preferring to let the images speak for themselves. Good, constructive, relaxed and friendly, said the White House press secretary, Dana Perino, summarising Bushs impressions.        
	It was bit of a momentous day, Obamas press secretary, Robert Gibbs, told reporters on the flight back to Chicago, adding that Obama found the President to be gracious.        
	I dont know that I would characterise him as awestruck, Gibbs said of Obama. What he said to me is: Its a really nice office.         
	The Obamas began their day in Chicago, travelling separately to Washington so that Michelle Obama could stay on and look at schools for the couples daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.         
	The couple was due at the White House at 2pm, but arrived 10 minutes early, no doubt pleasing the always punctual Bush.         
	The men were sartorially in sync in dark blue suits, white shirts and sky blue ties; after the couples posed for photographs at the South Portico, the two leaders could be seen strolling along the Colonnade, past the White House Rose Garden, pausing for a few moments before they walked through the glass doors of the Oval Office for the first of two private meetings.        
	Laura Bush and Michelle Obama, who had not met before, took a more extensive tour. For Michelle Obama, the visit was a chance to begin working on the logistics of moving her family.

	Washington, Oct. 29: Barack Obama has finally shown a sign of stress, twenty-one months into his campaign for the US presidency: grey hair.         
	Obama, the Democratic candidate, began the race as a sprightly 45-year-old with a jet black crop, whose boyish looks could have seen him thought ten years younger.        
	However, as he enters the final few days of his campaign, with hundreds of sleepness nights behind him, patches of salt and pepper that have sprouted all over his head mark out Obama, now 47, as a man firmly in middle age.        
	Obama has seemed resigned to his more mature look. The grey is coming quick. By the time Im sworn in, Ill look the part, he told supporters in Colorado in July.        
	Obamas Chicago barber, who goes only by the name Zariff and usually cuts the candidates hair each week at a cost of about 13, told Politico.com that his clients amount of grey was normal for his age. Asked whether the senator had ever considered colouring his hair, Zariff said: No, most definitely not. It will be quite some time before we go there.         
	Despite there being no conclusive proof that greying is caused by stress, studies suggest it plays a part. Research carried out by Tyler Cymet, of Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, found patients under stress for two or three years went grey sooner than expected.         
	While the grey emerged while his battle with John McCain, Obama has attributed the change in his appearance to the effort required of him to overcome a previous foe.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Upbeat Hillary in final Iowa plea

          TOBY HARNDEN                          Hillary Clinton in Sioux City, Iowa. (AFP)                                  
	Ames (Iowa, Dec. 2): Hillary Clinton, her voice hoarse from relentless campaigning, made a final appeal to Iowans yesterday to vote for her as the only candidate ready to lead from day one in the White House.        
	She made her final case as her aides desperately tried to discredit a local poll that gave her rival Barack Obama a seven-point lead going into tomorrows Iowa caucuses, the start of the presidential nomination process.        
	An ebullient Obama declared: I intend to whup em so good that it wont even be close.        
	Hillarys 40-minute New Years Day speech, attended by 200 staunch supporters and nearly as many journalists, included several attempts to portray Obama as an ingnu, unable to lead, and herself as uniquely experienced.        
	Electing the young Illinois senator, Hillary, 60, argued  while never mentioning him by name  would require a leap of faith that would expose America to danger at a time of unprecedented challenges.         
	Obama, 46, is increasingly confident that victory is within his grasp tomorrow. His campaign manager told reporters: We think were going to enter caucus night with enough supporters identified to win even under the most aggressive scenarios.        
	Victory in Iowa, five days before the equally pivotal New Hampshire primary, would propel him to the Democratic nomination, David Plouffe added. We do not think we could be better positioned.        
	The Des Moines Register poll put Obama on 32 per cent, the former First Lady on 25 per cent and former senator John Edwards  who has a powerful organisation in Iowa  on 24 per cent. This is the largest local poll lead of any Democrat in Iowa.        
	On the Republican side, the poll showed Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister backed by many religious conservatives, six points ahead of Mitt Romney. Second place for either could doom his candidacy.        
	Hillarys chief strategist lambasted the poll as depicting an unprecedented departure from historically established turnout patterns in the caucus while other surveys all show Hillary trending up and leading or within one point of the lead. The Clinton campaign also sought to blunt the bad news by announcing it had raised more than $100 million in 2007, setting a new fundraising record.

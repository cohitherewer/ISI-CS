          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, July 26: The Pakistan government has replaced its permanent representative at the UN, Munir Akram, for his opposition to refer slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos probe to the UN.         
	The former Speaker of the Sindh Assembly and a close friend of Pakistan Peoples Party chief Asif Ali Zardari , Hussain Haroon, will take over from Akram.         
	A talented career diplomat, Akram has been posted to the UN since May 2002. He got the third extension in February this year after a meeting with President Pervez Musharraf. Akram is the second top bureaucrat after chief of the Federal Board of Revenue, Abdullah Yousaf, to be removed by the present government. Both were considered close to Musharraf.

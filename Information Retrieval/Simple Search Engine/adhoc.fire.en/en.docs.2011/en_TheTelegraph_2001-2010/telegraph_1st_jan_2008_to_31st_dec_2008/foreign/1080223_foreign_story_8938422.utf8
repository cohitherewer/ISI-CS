The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fahim leads race for PM post
                                                                                                               Fahim leads race for PM post
                              Makhdoom Amin Fahim                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 22 (PTI): Senior Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader and Benazir Bhutto loyalist Makhdoom Amin Fahim today emerged as the frontrunner for the Prime Ministers post in the new coalition government.        
	This new development comes a day after PPP chairman Asif Ali Zardari and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif decided to stitch together a new governing coalition.        
	The newly-elected PPP MPs today met for the first time after it emerged as the single largest party in the elections and unanimously authorised Zardari to choose the candidate for Prime Minister.        
	Fahim, 68, who is the peoples party vice-chairman, was the public face in Bhuttos cabinet. PPP and PML-N sources said the widely-respected leader was a leading contender for the post.        
	The names of PPP Punjab president Shah Mehmood Quereshi, former National Assembly Speaker Yusuf Reza Gillani and firebrand lawyer Aitaz Ahsan were also in the race for the top post.         
	According to reports, there is every likelihood that a formal announcement of the candidate for Prime Minister and formation of the government could take a few days.

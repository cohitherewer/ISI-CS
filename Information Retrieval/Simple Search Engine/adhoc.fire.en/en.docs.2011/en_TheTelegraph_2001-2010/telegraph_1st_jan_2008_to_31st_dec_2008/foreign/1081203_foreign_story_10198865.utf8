          MICHAEL ABRAMOWITZ AND GLENN KESSLER                          Obama greets children in Philadelphia. (Reuters)                                  
	Washington, Dec. 2: Leaving the news conference in Chicago yesterday where he introduced his national security team, President-elect Barack Obama strolled out of the room arm in arm with his choice for secretary of state and one-time rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton.         
	The gesture may have been a subtle indication that Obama is aware that one of the biggest questions about his choice of Clinton is the kind of relationship they will be able to forge in the months ahead.        
	Many of the most successful secretaries of state, though not all, enjoyed great influence with the Presidents they served, giving them crucial leverage with foreign leaders and inside the national security establishment.         
	But Obama and Clinton are only starting to develop the kind of rapport that could lead to that trust, and the ultimate success of the senator from New York in her new role may depend as much on Obamas willingness to admit her to his inner circle as her ability to master the intricacies of West Asia peace process or North Koreas nuclear weapons programme, according to senior foreign policy officials from past administrations.        
	Democrats familiar with the transition said the two have spent time over the past several weeks discussing the parameters of the job and how they would work together: Clinton received assurances that she would have the kind of access to Obama she needs, as well as the authority to pick her own team.         
	They said the Obama team would like her to select James Steinberg as her deputy, but that hardly seems a problem, since Steinberg worked closely with her husband as deputy national security adviser.        
	Ironically, Steinberg recently co-authored a book raising questions about the wisdom of appointing all-stars  foreign policy experts and prominent members of Congress with little connection to the new President  in key national security jobs.         
	While such appointments can help foster a sense that a new President has made the transition from campaigning to governing, Steinberg and co-author Kurt M. Campbell pointed to numerous examples of the appointments leading to discord and disappointment, especially in the Clinton administration.        
	Some close to Clinton and Obama say the two are well aware of these potential pitfalls.         
	Melanne Verveer, Clintons chief of staff when she was First Lady, said Clinton was heavily influenced by watching her husband conduct foreign policy.         
	She learned the importance of there not being sunlight, if you will, between the secretary and the President in terms of foreign policy, quot; Verveer said.         
	She really understands the importance of speaking with one voice, and that is the Presidents voice.

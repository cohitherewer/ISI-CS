	Bethlehem, Dec. 21: The monks who tend the grotto under the Byzantine basilica of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem should enjoy lives of quiet, meditative service to the lofty ideals of their faith.         
	When they wash the grottos marbled altar and guard its silver lamps, they are watching over the cradle of the Christian world: the exact spot where Jesus Christ is believed to have been born.        
	Yet despite this sacred trust, a 10-year row between the different sects that manage the church has forced the Palestinian governments Muslim leaders to intervene to prevent the basilicas ancient lead roof from collapsing.        
	Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian national authority, has taken the unprecedented step of issuing a decree that the church must be repaired.         
	So tattered has the roof become that pilgrims inside the church were forced, during heavy rainstorms, to shelter under umbrellas and watch water cascade down the Crusade-era murals adorning the basilica walls.        
	But while the rafters rotted above them, the Armenian Orthodox, Franciscan and Greek Orthodox monks who share guardianship of the site fell to blows over the territory controlled by each sect.        
	In one incident, in 2007, the long-bearded monks scuffled, using fists, brooms and iron rods, simply because one group had tried to wash parts of a wall claimed by another.        
	That fight, however, was nothing compared to the dispute over the maintenance of the church.         
	According to the World Monuments Fund, a UN body that listed the church as one of the 100 most endangered sites in the world, the basilicas custodians have failed to collaborate on its repair for almost 1,000 years.         
	Furthermore, a botched repair, organised by the Greeks a few years ago, only accelerating the rate at which roof timbers rotted.        
	Discretely announced in a Jerusalem paper, Abbas decree was careful to say the three groups would be fully consulted by a special committee set up by the Palestinian authorities.        
	His intervention, however, appears to have worked where religious harmony did not: the heads of the three churches have agreed to put aside their squabbles and accept the planned renovation.

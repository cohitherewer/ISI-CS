	Kabul, Jan. 15 (AP): A Taliban spokesman warned today that militants would increase attacks against restaurants in Kabul frequented by westerners, a day after eight people died in a brazen assault on a luxury hotel in the Afghan capital.
    
	Officials said they had arrested four men following yesterdays assault on the Serena Hotel.
    
	Among those detained was one of the attackers disguised in a police uniform. We will target all these restaurants in Kabul where foreigners are eating, Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said. We have jihadists in Kabul right now and soon we will carry out more attacks against military personnel and foreigners.
    
	Afghan officials accused a militant connected to an insurgent leader in Pakistan of masterminding the attack. At least one American, a Norwegian reporter and a Filipina hotel worker were among the dead. Police said they also found a video made by two of the attackers in a home in Kabul.

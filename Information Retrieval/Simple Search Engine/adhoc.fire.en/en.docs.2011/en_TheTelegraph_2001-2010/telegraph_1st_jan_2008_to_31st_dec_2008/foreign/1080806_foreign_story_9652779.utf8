          SARAH KNAPTON                          Getting better                                  
	London, Aug. 5: Morgan Freeman is recovering in hospital and is in good spirits following a car crash.         
	 The Oscar-winning actor was airlifted to a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, following the accident on a rural Mississippi highway yesterday.         
	His condition was initially described as serious but Freemans publicist Donna Lee confirmed the 71-year-old star had only suffered a broken arm, broken elbow and minor shoulder damage.         
	Lee told website TMZ.com the actor was in good spirits, and was expected to make a good recovery. The crash happened north of the small town of Ruleville in rural Tallahatchie County in the Mississippi Delta.         
	Highway Patrol spokesman Sergeant Ben Williams confirmed the car Freeman was driving had overturned several times but said there was no indication drugs or alcohol were involved. Both Freeman and a passenger were wearing seatbelts.         
	Clay McFerrin, editor of Sun Sentinel in Charleston, arrived at the crash scene soon after it happened about four miles west of Charleston. McFerrin said : They had to use the jaws of life (hydraulic cutters) to extract him from the vehicle.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       China to build Pak nuke plants
                            
	Islamabad, Oct. 18 (Reuters): China has agreed to build two nuclear power plants in Pakistan, and Chinese firms and banks are planning to invest to help an old ally desperate for financial support, Pakistani officials said today.        
	Foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said President Asif Ali Zardari intended to visit China every three months to promote economic integration between the two countries.        
	Chinas agreement to help build two new nuclear plants for civil power generation contrasts with the US refusal to offer Pakistan a nuclear deal similar to one given to rival India. Richard Boucher, US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs, arrived in Islamabad today for a series of meetings.        
	He met Rehman Malik, the head of the interior ministry, and was expected to hold talks with Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani.        
	Pakistan and China have signed agreement for Chasma-3 and Chasma-4 ... 680 MW of electricity will be generated from these two new plants, Qureshi said.

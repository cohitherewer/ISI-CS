                              William with Kate                            
	London, May 7 (PTI): For Prince William, all is fair in love.        
	Just days after landing a chopper on girlfriend Kate Middletons garden, he now plans to miss a royal wedding only to go on a holiday with her. The second-in-line to the British throne will take Middleton away for two weeks later this month. As a result, will not be able to attend his cousin Peter Phillipss wedding to Autumn Kelly on May 17, The Sun tabloid reported today.         
	William apologised and has already got the couples blessing, an unnamed royal source was quoted by Sun as saying.        
	It may be recalled that the 25-year-old William got into a controversy last month for landing his Royal Air Force chopper in the paddock of Middletons home in Bucklebury, England.        
	Middleton and her parents, Michael and Carole, watched from their home as the prince practised a series of landings and take-offs in the chopper during a training exercise.         
	William has been in the RAF for quite a few months and obviously wanted to show off his skills to his girlfriend. Theres nothing more macho than landing a helicopter in your girlfriends back yard.        
	He clearly hasnt lost the hunger to impress Kate. If youve got to practise taking off and landing in a field, it might as well be one close to the prospective in-laws, a royal insider said.

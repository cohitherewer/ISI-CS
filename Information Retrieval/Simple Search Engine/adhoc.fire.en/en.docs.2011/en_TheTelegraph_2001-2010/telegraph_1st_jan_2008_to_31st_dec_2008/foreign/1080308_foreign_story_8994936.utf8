The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Indian slaves toil in US Gulf Coast
                                                                                                               Indian slaves toil in US Gulf Coast
          K.P. NAYAR                          New Orleans after it was battered by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005                                  
	Washington, March 7: About 100 Indian workers have taken the lead in highlighting the pathetic conditions under which migrant labourers toil to rebuild hurricane-ravaged areas in Americas Gulf Coast.         
	In a rare incident of its kind, they walked off their jobs at a shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, this week and are approaching the US department of justice accusing their employers, Signal International LLC, of illegal trafficking in humans.         
	The company recruited more than 500 workers from India for the reconstruction of areas damaged by hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.         
	About 100,000 migrant workers, mostly Hispanic, black and Asian, have been brought to Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas after the devastating hurricanes for rebuilding work, which regular American workers will not do.         
	Migrant labourers can be employed cheaply by companies on the Gulf Coast, many of which have profited immensely from the largely chaotic and poorly supervised relief and reconstruction efforts.         
	What is shocking about this situation is that the Indian embassy here has given $5 million (Rs 20 crores) for hurricane relief to the Americans, but is now unable to prevent the exploitation of Indian workers by companies which may be profiting from some of that Indian money.         
	Discontent over allegedly broken promises by employers and mistreatment has been growing among Indian labourers for some time. Last year, Sabulal Vijayan, one Indian labourer slit his wrists and tried to commit suicide.         
	There was no other option for me, Vijayan told reporters who visited the striking workers yesterday.         
	The situation forced me to do so. Signal was retaliating against me for organising my people for our rights, he said.         
	The New Orleans Worker Justice Coalition, an alliance of organisations which have come together for creating worker empowerment, is assisting the striking workers to navigate the maze of rules that will ensure that these aliens are not breaking any laws. Under US laws, the striking workers may be allowed to stay in the country if they became witnesses in a federal investigation.         
	At a news conference conducted through an interpreter from the coalition, some of the workers told tales of how they had pawned jewellery and sold property to pay as much as $20,000 (Rs 8 lakhs) to recruiters in pursuit of the American dream.         
	The workers said they were promised green cards but were instead given H2B work visas of only 10 months duration. Upon arrival in Pascagoula, they were put up 24 people to a room, for which the employers deducted $1,050 (Rs 42,572) a month from their salaries, it was alleged.         
	Saket Soni, the interpreter, was quoted in the Mississippi media as saying: I have never seen these kinds of conditions... It was impossible to sleep in such a prison. For 24 people, there were two toilets and four showers.        
	The Coalition has confirmed that across New Orleans, the devastation of which captured world attention, workers are living in abandoned cars, working in toxic conditions, chasing after a web of sub-contractors for their wages, and running from police and immigration authorities who have intensified their enforcement efforts while labour law enforcement is lax. A year ago some workers protested against living conditions at the Pascagoula site and an investigation by authorities was conducted in its wake.         
	Signal said its facilities were then inspected by the department of labour and other agencies which found the company to be fully compliant.         
	Yesterday the company claimed in a press release that it had spent $7 million to construct state of the art housing complexes for its workers. Signal conducts all its operations to the highest standards and in full compliance with the law, the press release said.         
	Signal recruited over 500 workers, believing that this would be a win-win both for Signal and the workers.        
	Signal would increase its number of skilled workers... by providing them with good jobs that would pay them above the prevailing wages for their skills and significantly greater wages than they could earn in their home country, the release added.

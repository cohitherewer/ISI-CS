The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Studios in final offer to actors
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Studios in final offer to actors

	Los Angeles, July 1: Hollywood studios made a final offer late yesterday to the Screen Actors Guild hours before their labour contract with the largest actors union was set to expire.        
	The offer included benefits similar to those granted to writers, directors and the industrys smaller actors union, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers told Bloomberg News.        
	The entertainment industry is in a de facto strike with film production nearly shut down and television production threatened, said the alliance, the bargaining entity for Time Warner Inc, Walt Disney Co, News Corp. and other studios.        
	At the same time, however, producers sent the clearest sign yet that they would not lock out actors if negotiators did not settle on a contract before the current pact expired.        
	Advertisements in trade publications argued that the entertainment industry had suffered enough from previous work stoppages over contract disputes. Lets keep working, the alliance said in full-page ads in Variety and the Hollywood Reporter.        
	The ads cited figures from the Milken Institute showing that the 100-day writers strike that ended in February had put more than 37,000 people out of work and resulted in $2.3 billion in lost wages.        
	The Screen Actors Guild appeared ready to keep negotiating, saying on Sunday that it had not called for a strike authorisation vote by members.        
	The exchange came as Hollywood waited nervously to see whether the dispute would halt TV and film production.        
	Making of Tom Hankss Angels and Demons, based on the book by Dan Brown, could be affected if the dispute halts film production.        
	Last week, SAG accused the studios of offering a contract worth less than one already approved by leaders of the smaller American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. SAG made the claim amid demands in Hollywood that it accept the same deal.

	Salim Baba, which was shot and co-produced by Francisco Bello and directed by Tim Sternberg on location in Calcutta, has been nominated for the best documentary short Oscar. The 14-minute film offers a study of Salim Muhammad from north Calcutta who screens discarded film fragments for slum children on a hand-cranked projector.

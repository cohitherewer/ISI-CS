	London, Oct. 11: The BBCs lavish spending on first-class flights, champagne, and limousines is to be cut to foot the bill for the corporations soaring energy costs.         
	The 50,000 annual budget for champagne, which is couriered to the homes of award-winning staff and presenters, has already been axed on the personal orders of Mark Thompson, the director-general. They will receive instead a well done card from the Thompson.        
	A new round of savings has been ordered as a result of energy bills that are expected to climb 50 million more than anticipated by 2010. A worse than expected licence fee settlement has already led to the sacking of 1,800 staff.         
	Employees have been ordered to make significant reductions after the taxi bill rose to 13.8 million, up six per cent from the previous year. The bill is the equivalent of full licence-fee payments by 100,000 householders or 36,500 a day.

	Pole title    
	Amsterdam (Reuters): It was a busy time for pole dancers in Amsterdam at the weekend. While the red light districts troupe were gyrating as usual on Friday night, a host of girls from Albania to Spain flew in to compete for the European pole dance championship title. Wearing sportswear reminiscent of Olympic gymnasts, girls performed dance routines based around two 6-metre poles  one rotating.

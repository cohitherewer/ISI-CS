	Shenzen (China), May 3 (Reuters): Beijing called the Dalai Lama a criminal today, as representatives of the exiled Buddhist leader gathered for a meeting tomorrow in China to discuss the most serious unrest in Tibet for nearly two decades.        
	The condemnation suggested the government was in no mood to compromise following riots and protests in Tibet which have shaken Chinas preparations for the Beijing Olympics. Patriotic people of Tibet strongly condemn and vehemently denounce the litany of crimes committed by the 14th Dalai Lama, said the official Tibet Daily.

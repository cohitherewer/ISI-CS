	Kathmandu, Jan. 30 (Reuters): A bomb exploded near a government-sponsored political rally in southern Nepal today wounding at least 35 people, police said.
    
	The blast in the town of Birgunj in the southern plains of the Himalayan nation, where thousands had gathered for the rally, followed two earlier explosions in the area including one last night.
    
	We have 55 people wounded in all, a police official said from Birgunj, 62 km from Kathmandu. The toll included those from the overnight blast as well as from today.
    
	A doctor at the local hospital said at least three persons were in critical condition following the blast at the rally.

          J. HEMANTH                           People cheer outside the parliament house in Kathmandu on Wednesday. (Reuters)                                  
	Kathmandu, May 28: Nepals political parties voted at a special assembly on Wednesday to abolish the 239-year-old monarchy and declare the country a republic.        
	Delegates voted 560 to 4 in favour of abolishing the monarchy.         
	As the Constituent Assembly gathered late in the evening at the International Convention Centre here for its historic first meeting, a blast outside the southern gate injured at least six persons.         
	Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and Maoist chairman Prachanda were inside the centre when the bomb went off.         
	Police said the blast was triggered by the little-known militant group Ranbir Sena, which supports the monarchy.         
	The government has told the unpopular King Gyanendra to vacate his pink pagoda-roofed Narayanhity palace in Kathmandu within a fortnight, or be forced out. He has made few comments on his future plans, except to say he wanted to remain in Nepal.        
	Koiralas address  he briefed members on political decisions taken earlier in the day on the structure of the new government as well as the agenda for the constituent assembly  kicked off the session.        
	The meeting began nearly 10 hours behind schedule as parties struggled to arrive at a consensus on the structure of the new republican government, which is to be sworn in next week. Koirala and Prachanda participated in the discussions that carried on at the Prime Ministers official residence through the day.        
	The disagreement was on the powers of the President and the Prime Minister.         
	CPN (ML) general secretary C.P. Mainali, who participated in the meeting, said agreement was finally reached late in the evening. All the parties agreed that the ceremonial President would function as head of the state while the Prime Minister would have executive powers. At the same time, the President will be guided by the decisions of the cabinet, he said.        
	The parties could not decide on the nomination of 26 members to the Constituent Assembly.         
	Earlier in the day, hundreds of people  most of them Maoists and some from the Nepali Congress  thronged the streets of Kathmandu chanting slogans in favour of a republic and denouncing Gyanendra who will cease to be king of Nepal by dawn tomorrow.         
	Palace sources said Gyanendra spent his last day as monarch holding discussions with a cross-section of people, mainly royalists and members of the erstwhile royalist regime. The discussions appeared to centre around future strategies for himself and his family.        
	Thousands of Maoists, now members of the assemblys biggest political party after joining the political mainstream, marched in the capital carrying hammer and sickle flags and pumping their fists in the air as they shouted Down with the monarchy!        
	It has been a dramatic decline and fall for a king once waited upon by thousands of retainers. Many Nepalis revered the monarch in majority-Hindu Nepal as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the god of protection.        
	Now, his portrait has been wiped off bank notes and his name has disappeared from the national anthem. He has been asked to pay his own electricity bills.        
	The king will be given 15 days to leave and the palace will be turned into a historical museum, peace and reconstruction minister Ram Chandra Poudel said.        
	This is the peoples victory, said Kamal Dahal, a 22-year-old former Maoist guerrilla. With todays declaration of a republic, we have achieved what we fought for.

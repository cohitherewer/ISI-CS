                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       China probes tainted milk
                            
	Beijing, Sept. 12 (Reuters): China has questioned 78 people in a health scare involving a tainted baby milk formula linked to the death of one infant and the development of kidney stones in dozens of others across the country, state media said today.        
	Chinas quality watchdog also launched a nationwide probe into all baby milk powders as a local dairy producer admitted its formula had been contaminated with melamine, a toxin linked to the deaths and illness of thousands of pets in the US last year.        
	Authorities were investigating whether the tainted milk had caused the death of one baby in the northwestern province of Gansu and development of kidney stones in more than 50 others there and in other provinces this year.

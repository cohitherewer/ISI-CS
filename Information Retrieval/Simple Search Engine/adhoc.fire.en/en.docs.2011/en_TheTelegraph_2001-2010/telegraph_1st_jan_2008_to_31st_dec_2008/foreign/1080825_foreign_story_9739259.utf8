										      RICHARD GRAY      London, Aug. 24: A solar- powered spy plane developed by British scientists has broken the record for the longest time spent in flight after remaining in the air for three- and-a-half days. 
    With solar panels along its 60ft wingspan, the Zephyr promises to revolutionise military intelligence. 
    The unmanned aircraft stores power from the sun in its batteries, allowing it to continue through the night and, potentially, stay in the air for months at a time. 
    Unlike conventional spy planes, which need regular refuelling and so make relatively short flights, it will give commanders an unbroken picture of the battlefield. 
    The engineers who created the Zephyr also believe it will have important civilian applications, including search-and-rescue operations and police surveillance.

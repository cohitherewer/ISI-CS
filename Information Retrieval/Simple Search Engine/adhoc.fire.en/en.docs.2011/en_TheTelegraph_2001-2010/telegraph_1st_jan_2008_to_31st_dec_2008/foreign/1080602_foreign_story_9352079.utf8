                          William and Kate                    
	London, June 1 (PTI): Prince Williams girlfriend Kate Middleton should grab a full-time job before the couple announces their engagement, the British queen has said.        
	The 82-year-old, who is considered one of the most hard-working members of the royal family, has made it known in private that Kate, 26, should be settled in a career before marrying William, the Daily Mail has reported.        
	The queen is worried that Williams public image could suffer if his girlfriend is not recognised as a working professional in her own right, according to sources close to the queen.         
	The queen has had conversations with a few trusted friends about how to tackle what is being called the Kate problem. On the few occasions the queen has met Kate, she has thought she is a nice enough girl. But the queen has admitted she has no idea what Kate actually does, a source said.        
	Privately she is very concerned about what the repercussions could be if Kate is not in a stable job as and when William is ready to propose. The queen is very close to her grandson and they, of course, discuss Kate.

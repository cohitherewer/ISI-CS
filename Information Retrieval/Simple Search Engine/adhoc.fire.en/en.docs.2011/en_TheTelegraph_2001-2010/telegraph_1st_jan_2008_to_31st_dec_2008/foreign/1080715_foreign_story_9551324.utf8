	London, July 14: Dieters struggling to shed a few pounds have a new excuse for failing to lose weight  the grey British weather.         
	Scientists claimed people who were overweight had lower levels of vitamin D, which is created when skin is exposed to sunlight. The study found that low levels of the vitamin in blood interfered with the function of a hormone called leptin, which tells the brain when the stomach is full.        
	It means the waistlines are unlikely to get any slimmer this summer, with forecasters predicting more wet weather.         
	Researchers at Aberdeen University found that obese people produced 10 per cent less vitamin D than people of average weight.         
	The study also found that excess body fat absorbs vitamin D, stopping it entering the bloodstream.         
	The findings, published in the journal Bone, are based on a study of 3,100 women living in northeast Scotland between 1998 and 2000. The data included estimates of how long the women had been exposed to sunlight over the previous year and the amount of vitamin D obtained from food sources such as eggs and oily fish.

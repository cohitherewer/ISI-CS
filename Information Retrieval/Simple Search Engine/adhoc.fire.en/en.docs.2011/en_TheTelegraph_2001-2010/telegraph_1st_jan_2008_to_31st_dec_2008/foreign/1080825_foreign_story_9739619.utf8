The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US navy in Georgia, Russia   acts tough
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US navy in Georgia, Russia   acts tough
                                  
	Batumi, Georgia, Aug. 24 (Reuters): A US navy warship delivered humanitarian aid today for victims of Georgias brief war with Russia while Moscow ignored western demands to pull its remaining troops from the Caucasus countrys heartland.        
	On the diplomatic front, France called for a meeting of European Union leaders to discuss the crisis and to review the blocs relations with Russia. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ties with Moscow could be scaled back if its troops were not withdrawn.        
	Russia says residual troops are peacekeepers needed to avert further bloodshed and to protect Georgias separatist, pro-Moscow provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Moscow withdrew the bulk of its forces from Georgia proper on Friday.        
	The Russia-Georgia conflict broke out on August 7-8 when Georgian troops tried to retake South Ossetia. A Russian counter-offensive pushed into Georgia proper, crossing its main east-west highway and nearing an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan.        
	A Reuters reporter in Batumi, 80km south of the port of Poti where Russian troops are still present, saw a giant crane unload 55 tonnes of aid from the USS McFaul.        
	Two other US ships were due to follow the guided missile destroyer to the port. The US, a strong ally of Georgia, has already delivered some aid by military cargo plane but is now shipping in beds and food.        
	The US is our great friend. They have arrived at such a difficult time. It means we are not alone, Georgian defence minister David Kezerashvili told reporters in Batumi.

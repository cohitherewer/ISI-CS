	Dhaka, Jan. 3 (Reuters): A surprise offer by Bangladeshs army-backed authorities to send two detained former Prime Ministers abroad for medical treatment has wrong-footed their parties just months away from promised elections.
    
	The interim governments law and information adviser, Mainul Husein, said yesterday that authorities were ready to consider letting the two women leave the country for treatment if they or their parties requested it. The gesture was aimed at Sheikh Hasina and perennial rival Begum Khaleda Zia, both held in jail for months for alleged corruption and abuse of power.
    
	Hasina is already on trial before a special court and Khaleda is likely to follow suit. If convicted, they would be barred from contesting the election, legal experts say.
    
	While it was not immediately clear whether Mainul was speaking for himself or the government, his remarks apparently baffled leaders of Hasinas Awami League and Khaledas Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
    
	I am not sure ... it depends on whether Sheikh Hasina is herself willing to go abroad for treatment, said Zillur Rahman, acting chief of the Awami League.
    
	BNP leaders appeared suspicious about the offer.
    
	We have not heard that Khaleda Zia is seriously ill to warrant a travel abroad for treatment, said Rizvi Ahmed, the partys acting office secretary. 
    
	He said the offer was a reflection of the governments previous plan to send the two leaders into exile.
    
	Mainuls offer came two days after Hasina fell sick during a court hearing on her corruption charge. Party officials and physicians said she was suffering from high blood pressure, impaired hearing and eye troubles.
    
	They said that she might like to receive treatment abroad, preferably in the US where her son and daughter live, but that it might not be possible under a state of emergency which bars detainees or people on trial from leaving the country.
    
	Officials and media speculated today that the government could arrange a special parole for Hasina, and also for Khaleda, if they wished to be treated abroad.

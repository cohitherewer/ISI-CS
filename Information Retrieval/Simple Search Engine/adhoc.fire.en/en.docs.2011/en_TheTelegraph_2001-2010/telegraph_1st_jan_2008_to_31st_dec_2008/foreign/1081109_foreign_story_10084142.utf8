	New York, Nov. 8: Arizona State University, anticipating at least $25 million in budget cuts this fiscal year  on top of the $30 million already cut  is ending its contracts with as many as 200 adjunct instructors.         
	Boston University, Cornell and Brown have announced selective hiring freezes. And Tufts University, which for the last two years has, proudly, been one of the few colleges in the nation that could afford to be need-blind  that is, to admit the best-qualified applicants and meet their full financial need  may not be able to maintain that generosity for next years incoming class. This autumn, Tufts suspended new capital projects and budgeted more for financial aid. But with the market downturn, and the likelihood that more applicants will need bigger aid packages, need-blind admissions may go by the wayside.         
	The target of being need-blind is our highest priority, said Lawrence S. Bacow, president of Tufts. But with whats happening in the larger economy, we expect that the incoming class is going to be needier. Thats the real uncertainty.         
	Tough economic times have come to public and private universities alike, and rich or poor, they are figuring out how to respond. Many are announcing hiring freezes, postponing construction projects or putting off planned capital campaigns.         
	With endowment values and charitable gifts likely to decline, the process of setting next years tuition low enough to keep students coming, but high enough to support operations, is trickier than ever. Dozens of college presidents, especially at wealthy institutions, have sent letters and email to students and their families describing their financial situation and belt-tightening plans. At Williams College, for example, president Morton Owen Schapiro wrote that with last years negative return on the endowment and the worsening situation since June, some renovation and facilities spending would be reduced and non-essential openings left unfilled.        
	Many students, increasingly conscious of costs, are flocking to their state universities; at Binghamton University, part of the New York State university system, applications were up 50 percent this autumn. But with this years state budget problems, tuition increases at public universities may be especially steep. Some public universities have already announced mid-year tuition increases.

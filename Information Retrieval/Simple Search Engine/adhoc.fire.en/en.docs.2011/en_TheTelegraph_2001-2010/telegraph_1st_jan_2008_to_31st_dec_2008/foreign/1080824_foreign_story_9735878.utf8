          RICHARD EDWARDS AND ROBERT WINNETT                          Tarique Ghaffur                                  
	London, Aug. 23: One of Britains most senior police officers launched a legal action against the Metropolitan Police on the grounds that he has allegedly been harassed, degraded and humiliated because he is Asian and a Muslim.         
	 Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, who is of Indian origin, officially lodged the discrimination claim against his own force and Commissioner Sir Ian Blair.         
	The action was leaked in June and legal papers claim that Ghaffur has been further victimised by threats that he would be sacked unless he suspended the employment tribunal proceedings. It is the first time an officer of such seniority has sued the police, which now has 28 days to respond.         
	A dossier compiled by Ghaffur in the past three years alleges that the level of racial discrimination in Scotland Yard has worsened and that senior ethnic minority officers face a hostile atmosphere.         
	It claims that the combined effect has been to create a degrading environment for him. Sir Ian, who has often been accused of being too politically correct, is furious at the revolt from his No.3 and firmly denies racism.

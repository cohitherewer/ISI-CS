The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jolie room pictures fake, says hospital
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Jolie room pictures fake, says hospital

	Paris, July 9 (AP): The windows of Angelina Jolies hospital room have been coated with a special material to prevent paparazzi from taking pictures of the pregnant star, the hospital says.        
	The Lenval hospital in Nice says photos that purport to show Jolie and partner Brad Pitt in their room are fake.         
	The hospital said the photos  which have been published on the Internet or in magazines  were either manipulated or showed other patients at the hospital.        
	In a statement, the hospital said it is totally impossible to see inside the couples room from the outside due to screens covered with a material that lenses cannot see through.        
	Hospital spokeswoman Nadine Bauer said screens were put on especially for Jolie.        
	So any pictures released are either posed fakes set up by paparazzi or they are pictures of other patients, the hospital said in a statement. We hope this is clearly understood out of respect for all patients in this clinic.        
	Jolie is expecting twins. She has been resting and been monitored by doctors in the seaside hospital in southern France ahead of the birth.        
	At a brief news conference last week, Jolies obstetrician said the actress was doing fine. Dr Michel Sussmann said she would remain in the hospital until the babies are delivered in the weeks to come.

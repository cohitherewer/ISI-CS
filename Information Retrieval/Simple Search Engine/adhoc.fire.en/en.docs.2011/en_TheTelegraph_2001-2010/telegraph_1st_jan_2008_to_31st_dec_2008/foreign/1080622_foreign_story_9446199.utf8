The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Koirala to quit after new President elected
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Koirala to quit after new President elected
                              No tension                            
	Kathmandu, June 21 (PTI): Nepal Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala today said he would step down as soon as a new President was elected, a day after the Maoists quit his cabinet over the delay in the formation of a new government.        
	 At a meeting of the ruling multi-party alliance to break the two-month deadlock over government formation, Koirala said he will resign with due process and urged the Maoists not to resign.        
	There is a technical problem that since Koirala is both Prime Minister and head of the state, to whom should he submit his resignation, Nepali Congress general secretary Bimalendra Nidhi said after the meeting.        
	Koirala asked the Maoist leaders to withdraw their resignation and assured them that he will resign by following due procedure. He hinted that he will resign as soon as the new President is elected, Nidhi said. So the new President has to be elected first before he can resign, the Nepali Congress secretary said.        
	 However, the Presidents post is at the centre of a bitter tussle among the three main parties  the Maoists, the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist).        
	 The Maoists, under intense pressure from the other two parties, gave up their claim to the post but opposed Koiralas candidacy.        
	Dont take unnecessary tension, relax and take it easy, I will resign with due process. Lets now concentrate our efforts towards amending the Constitution and fully implementing the peace process, Koirala told party leaders, including Maoist chief Prachanda, at his Baluwater residence.        
	There is still a need for consensus and cooperation at this moment, when we are drafting the new Constitution with the mandate of the people Koirala was quoted as saying by Nidhi.        
	 As soon as the meeting began, Koirala said: I will fully cooperate from my side to form a new government, please be assured.        
	Prachanda and other leaders appreciated his statement and continued further discussion without any disruption, Nidhi said.        
	During the meeting, discussions were held on two issues: restructuring the Maoist military and paramilitary organisations and amending the Constitution to include the provision of forming and dissolving the government with a simple majority, Nidhi said.        
	These two issues had been at the centre of the dispute between the Maoists and other parties since the April 10 Constituent Assembly elections where the former rebels emerged as the largest party.        
	The other issues discussed at the meeting were returning land seized by the Maoists, halting their acts of intimidation, extortion and terrorising people and integrating the rebel combatants into the Nepali army and other security agencies, Nidhi said.

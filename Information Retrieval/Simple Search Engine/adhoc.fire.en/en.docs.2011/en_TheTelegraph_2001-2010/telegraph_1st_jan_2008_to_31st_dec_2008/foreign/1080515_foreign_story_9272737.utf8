	London, May 14: Albert Einstein regarded religions as childish and primitive legends, a private letter he wrote a year before his death has revealed.         
	The great scientists views on religion have long been debated, with many seizing upon phrases such as He [God] does not throw dice as evidence that he believed in a creator. But the newly-unveiled letter, a response to the philosopher Eric Gutkind, has cast doubt on the theory that Einstein had any belief in God at all.         
	In the letter, dated January 3, 1954, he wrote: The word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weakness, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this.         
	Einstein, who died the following year aged 76, did not spare Judaism from his criticism, believing Jewish people were in no way chosen by God. He wrote: For me the Jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people.

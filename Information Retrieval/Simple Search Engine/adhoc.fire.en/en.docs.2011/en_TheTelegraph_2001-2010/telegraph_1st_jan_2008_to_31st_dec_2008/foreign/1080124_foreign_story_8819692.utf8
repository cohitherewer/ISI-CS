	New York, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Actor Heath Ledger, the gifted leading man acclaimed for his role as a gay cowboy in the film Brokeback Mountain, was found dead in his Manhattan apartment yesterday, possibly of a drug overdose, police said.
    
	The Australian-born Ledger, 28, was found face down and naked at the foot of the bed by a housekeeper at his apartment in the SoHo neighbourhood, police spokesman Paul Browne said.
    
	He was pronounced dead at the scene but no cause had been determined.
    
	We are investigating the possibility of an overdose. ... There were pills within the vicinity of the bed, Browne said, adding that the prescription medicine included sleeping pills.
    
	A New York citys medical examiner conducted an autopsy on Ledger today and said a cause of death for the film star would be determined in 10 days to two weeks.
    
	The autopsy was finished and the cause of death for Ledger will be pending further study. We have to do additional testing and investigation. Its going to be about 10 days to two weeks, said Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the office of chief medical examiner.
    
	The housekeeper found Ledger at 2026 GMT, and tried to wake him for his appointment with a masseuse, who was also in the home, Browne said. Ledgers body was wheeled out of the fifth-floor apartment in a stretcher, covered in a black body bag, about three hours after he was found.
    
	Screen star Mel Gibson, who starred alongside Ledger in the film The Patriot, said his thoughts and prayers were with the younger actors family. I had such great hope for him, Gibson said in a statement released by his publicist. He was just taking off and to lose his life at such a young age is a tragic loss.
    
	Ledger was nominated for an Academy Award as best lead actor for 2005s Brokeback Mountain, but the Oscar went to Philip Seymour Hoffman.
    
	The handsome star last year broke up with actress Michelle Williams, who played his wife in Brokeback and was the real-life mother of their two-year-old daughter, Matilda. He once said he was ready to die because he could live on in his child.
    
	Having a child changes every aspect of your life  for the better, of course. The sacrifices are large, but what you get in return is even bigger than the sacrifices you make. I feel, in a sense, ready to die because you are living on in your child, Ledger told In Touch Weekly in November.
    
	The couple tried to keep a low profile by living in Brooklyn but still appeared often in the gossip pages. He moved to Manhattan after the breakup.
    
	He was a very simple guy. You wouldnt know he was an actor unless you saw him on TV, Tamba Mossa, the buildings superintendent, said.
    
	A crowd of about 200 people and 75 reporters gathered outside his building on Broome Street, with fans snapping pictures on their cellphones. I feel a bit silly being one of the ones gawking, but its horribly sad. In Brokeback Mountain, it was one of the first times I was moved by an actor of my own generation, said Drew Klein, 25, who works in film production. He means a lot to us. We look up to actors like Heath Ledger, said Jack Payne, an acting student.

	Los Angeles, Jan. 3 (AP): The Golden Globe Awards were thrust into deeper jeopardy when the striking writers guild refused to negotiate with Globe organisers about staging a picket-free ceremony.
    
	The actors union then said it would advise celebrity nominees and presenters to boycott the show, which is scheduled to be televised on January 13 on NBC. That would rob the boozy, informal affair of the star power that makes the Globes the official kickoff to Hollywoods awards season.
    
	The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which stages the Globes, had hoped last-minute negotiations with the Writers Guild of America would allow the show to go on. But the guild said last afternoon that striking writers still intend to picket. 
    
	 The WGA has great respect and admiration for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, but we are engaged in a crucial struggle that will protect our income and intellectual property rights for generations to come, it said. We will continue to do everything in our power to bring industry negotiations to a fair conclusion.
    
	Jorge Camara, president of the HFPA, said earlier yesterday that the organisation was negotiating with the guild to reach an an interim agreement that would ultimately permit the Golden Globe Awards to be broadcast as scheduled, without picket lines. Twenty million people watched last years ceremony on NBC. The network had no comment yesterday.
    
	Some Hollywood observers have theorised that without scripts and celebrities, awards shows might have to return to the relatively private affairs they were before television rather than risk embarrassment. 
    
	Yet the organisations behind the Oscars and Globes are heavily dependent on the tens of millions of dollars their broadcasts bring in from network licensing deals, which may force them to televise their shows anyway.

	Islamabad, June 24 (PTI): A disappointed Pakistan government today said it will move the supreme court against a high court ruling barring former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from contesting the June 26 byelections.         
	Angered by the high court ruling, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) lawmakers walked out of the National Assembly. They said the fate of the ruling coalition was now in the hands of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).        
	Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told the Assembly that the whole country was disappointed by the Lahore high courts judgment disqualifying 59-year-old Sharif from contesting the byelections.        
	After detailed consultations with PML-N leaders and federal ministers besides telephone conversations with Mian Nawaz Sharif, the government has decided to file an appeal in the supreme court against the decision of the Lahore high court, Gilani said.        
	The government will request the apex court to postpone the June 26 byelection in the constituency from which Sharif had intended to contest, he said.        
	Earlier, law minister Farooq Naek told the Assembly that the government would appeal against the high court ruling. The court cannot pass a verdict in this matter as it was a poll-related issue that can only be decided by an election tribunal, Naek said.        
	His comments failed to pacify PML-N lawmakers who walked out of the Assembly and staged a protest on the avenue outside the parliament building. They were joined by lawyers who shouted slogans against Musharraf and the judges who swore an oath of allegiance to the President.

	London, July 9: The mystery of Nicole Kidmans decision to call her newborn daughter Sunday has been solved.         
	The little girl is named after an Australian artists muse with a scandalous private life, according to the actresss father.        
	Fans were baffled by the actresss decision to call the little girl Sunday Rose Kidman Urban  especially as the baby was born on a Monday.        
	But Kidmans father, Dr Antony Kidman, has explained all. She is named after Sunday Reed, the muse of Australian artist Sidney Nolan.        
	There was a lady named Sunday Reed who was a prominent patron of the arts in Victoria, Dr Kidman said.        
	I have read a bit about Sunday Reed and her husband John  she was a key mover and shaker in the arts around the beginning of the century. The name Sunday struck me as being a nice name for a woman, so my wife and I mentioned it.

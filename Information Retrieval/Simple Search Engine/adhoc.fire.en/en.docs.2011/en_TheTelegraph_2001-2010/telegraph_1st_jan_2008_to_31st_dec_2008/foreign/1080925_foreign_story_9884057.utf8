                              Keira: New role                            
	London, Sept. 24: Keira Knightley has been lined up to play Zelda, the wife of the acclaimed author F. Scott Fitzgerald, in a film about their life, according to new reports.         
	Knightley, currently featuring in the film The Duchess, is said to be in negotiations to play the role of Zelda Sayre. Some claim that Sayres marriage to Scott Fitzgerald, the author of The Great Gatsby, inspired him to produce the Jazz Ages best novels, while other say she stifled his creativity. Their troubled relationship is set to be examined in a new biopic called The Beautiful and the Damned.

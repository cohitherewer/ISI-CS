	Washington, Dec. 15: A raging fire badly damaged the church attended by Alaska governor and former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin causing about $1 million in damage, officials said yesterday.         
	Police believe the fire may have been caused by an arsonist.        
	Firefighters were called late on Friday to Wasilla Bible Church in Palins hometown of Wasilla, Alaska and found flames and smoke pouring from windows in the three-story building.        
	Five people who had been in the building  valued at between $4 and $5 dollars  escaped unharmed, officials said.        
	We are definitely treating it as suspicious and as potential arson at this point, said James Steele, chief of the area fire department.        
	We just dont have any leads at all as far as the intent or motive in this, Steele added.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

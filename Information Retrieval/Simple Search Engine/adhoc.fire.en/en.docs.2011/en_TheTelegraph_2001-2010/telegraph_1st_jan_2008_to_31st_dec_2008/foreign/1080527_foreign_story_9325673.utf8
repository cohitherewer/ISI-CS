                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Security push before monarchy ends

	Kathmandu, May 26 (Reuters): Nepal has banned demonstrations in and around the royal palace and King Gyanendras private home in Kathmandu, fearing trouble two days before a special assembly is due to formally abolish the 239-year-old monarchy.        
	Supporters of the former Maoist rebels, who have led the campaign against the monarchy, are expected to gather in the streets to celebrate the expected assembly decision on Wednesday.        
	But royalists say the decision to abolish the monarchy should not be taken in a haste.        
	This is to control all types of provocations, said peace and reconstruction minister Ram Chandra Poudel about the move to ban gatherings at key places in Kathmandu.        
	Any one could try to take advantage of the sensitive situation and create trouble.        
	Authorities have also banned demonstrations at the official residence of the Prime Minister and the convention centre where the assembly will meet.        
	The assembly elected in April is scheduled to turn Nepal into a republic, a key part of a peace process ending a decade-long civil war which killed more than 13,000 people.        
	We have urged the people to come to the streets on that day to celebrate the republic day, said Dinanath Sharma, a senior Maoist leader.        
	This will mark the formal end of the feudal monarchy. It is a historic day.        
	Hindu-majority Nepal has remained a monarchy all through its history and the king was traditionally revered as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the god for protection.        
	But that popularity plunged since King Gyanendra fired the government in 2005 and imposed an absolute rule only to bow down to weeks of anti-king protests and hand power to political parties a year later.        
	The Maoists, who secured a surprise victory in the April elections and are expected to head a new interim government, have urged Gyanendra to move to his private home before the meeting and help a smooth transition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bomber kills 6 party workers
                                                                                                               Bomber kills 6 party workers
                                  
	Islamabad, Feb. 11 (Reuters): A suspected suicide bomber killed six people today in an attack on a group of political workers canvassing for February 18 parliamentary polls in Pakistans restive tribal region of North Waziristan, witnesses said.        
	An independent candidate, Nisar Ali Khan, contesting for a National Assembly seat in the region escaped unhurt, but nine of his supporters were wounded in the attack near Mir Ali, a town frequented by Taliban and al Qaida fighters.        
	We were having a meeting at a roadside place with Nisar and his supporters when the explosion occurred, said Haji Nakim Khan, a tribal leader, who was among the wounded.        
	We found severed legs at the site of attack, so we think it was a suicide attack.        
	Though independent, Khan was aligned to the Awami National Party (ANP), a secular party representing ethnic Pashtuns in the North West Frontier Province.        
	There was no immediate official confirmation of the incident, which came two days after another suicide bomber killed 16 persons and wounded 25 at an ANP election rally in the northwestern town of Charsadda.        
	Violence has intensified in Pakistan in the run-up to an election that was due to be held on January 8, but was delayed until February 18 after the assassination of Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in gun and suicide bomb attack on December 27.        
	More than 400 people have been killed in clashes between troops and militants and bomb and suicide attacks since the start of the year. The government has blamed an al Qaida-linked militant leader, Baitullah Mehsud for the attack on Bhutto and many other attacks.

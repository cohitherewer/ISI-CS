	London, July 16: Some of the clearest pictures ever of the surface of Mars have been beamed back to Earth from a European Space Agency probe.        
	The images show parts of a deeply incised region called the Echus Chasma.        
	Planetary geologists believe the steep-sided valleys were created by channelling groundwater. They bear striking physical similarities to canyons found in arid and semi-arid regions on Earth.        
	The pictures were taken by the High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on board ESAs Mars Express probe. Situated just north of the Martian equator, the Echus Chasma is believed to be one of the largest water source regions on the Red Planet, according to the ESA.        
	The pictures show side valleys, or sapping canyons, created by water flowing from the high Lunea Planum plateau into the main basin of the Echus Chasma, the Kasei Valles, which extends some 2,000 miles to the north.        
	The canyons pictured are about 100km long, 10km wide and up to 1,000m deep.        
	However, in places the cliff walls of the main Kasei Valley are 4,000m high.        
	The images also show other features of interest to those studying the physical processes that have shaped Marss surface, including two five-mile wide impact craters and evidence of volcanic activity in the form of a 15-mile long magma dyke.        
	The images were created by combining a number taken from different orbits to produce computer pictures that can be viewed from different angles.        
	On Monday, scientists unveiled plans to bring back rocks  and perhaps even life  from the Red Planet as a preliminary step to putting a man on Mars.         
	Prof. Monica Grady, from the Open University, said: If you cant bring a rock back you are not going to be able to bring people back.        
	Theres a real feeling that bringing samples back from Mars is absolutely essential if we are going to continue our Martian exploration programme.        
	She co-chaired a panel of 31 international experts who wrote a proposal for an exploratory mission to take place between 2018 and 2033, with a view to sending astronauts in coming decades.

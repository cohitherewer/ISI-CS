	Los Angeles, Jan. 28: Heath Ledger may have died from natural causes, not a drug overdose, because the amount of drugs in his system was too low to have killed him, it has been reported.        
	TMZ.com, the celebrity website that broke the news of the actors death last Tuesday, quoted sources intimately connected with the investigation saying that the 28-year-old may have died from a heart attack.        
	Its now appearing that the level of toxicity (from medication) in Ledgers system was low enough that it may not have caused his death. These sources say Heaths heart stopped, the website reported.        
	Initial tests on the body of the star of Brokeback Mountain proved inconclusive, but Ledgers family has insisted that he would not have taken his own life.        
	In an article published yesterday, Sarah Lyall, who conducted the last interview with the actor in November, said Ledger did not seem depressed, or suicidal or whacked out from drugs when they met.        
	What he seemed was exhausted, Lyall told the Observer. It looked to me like the sort of fatigue you get not from being tired of life, but from being too full of it  too full of plans, too full of self-analysis, too full of noisy thoughts that wont stay quiet.        
	The actress Naomi Watts, Ledgers former girlfriend, was reported to have visited the Los Angeles mortuary where his body was being kept.         
	She was also said to have joined Ledgers family and friends in a private memorial ceremony.        
	His body was expected to be flown to Australia today, where it was thought that a funeral would be held in Perth, his home city.

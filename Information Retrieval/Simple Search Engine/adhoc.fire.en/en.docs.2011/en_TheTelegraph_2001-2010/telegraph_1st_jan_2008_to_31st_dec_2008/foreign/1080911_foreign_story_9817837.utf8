The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | No foreign troops in Pak: Army chief
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       No foreign troops in Pak: Army chief
                            
	Islamabad, Sept. 10 (Reuters): Pakistans army chief said today his country would not allow foreign troops to conduct operations on its soil after a cross-border incursion by US commandos.        
	The strongly-worded statement by General Ashfaq Kayani coincided with comments by the US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, that a more comprehensive strategy was being formed to combat the threat from the Taliban and al Qaida in the region.        
	Kayani, who met Mullen and other senior US commanders on an aircraft carrier in the Indian Ocean on August 28, delivered a clear message that foreign forces would not be tolerated on Pakistani territory, without directly referring to the Mullens comments.        
	The sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country will be defended at all cost and no external force is allowed to conduct operations ... inside Pakistan, a military statement quoted General Ashfaq Kayani as saying. Helicopter-borne US commandos carried out a ground assault in Pakistans South Waziristan.

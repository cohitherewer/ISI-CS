  - Package aims to create or save 2.5 million jobs by 2011        LORI MONTGOMERY                           Obama: Bid for economic revival                                        
	Washington, Nov. 23: President-elect Barack Obama is developing a plan to create or preserve 2.5 million jobs over the next two years by spending billions of dollars to rebuild roads and bridges, modernise public schools, and construct wind farms and other alternative sources of energy.        
	The plan, which Obama announced yesterday during the weekly Democratic radio address, is more expansive  and undoubtedly more expensive  than anything proposed so far to revive the nations deteriorating economy.         
	Obama said the darkening economic outlook demands that Washington act swiftly and boldly to diminish the risk that the nation could lose millions of jobs next year.        
	The news this week has only reinforced the fact that we are facing an economic crisis of historic proportions, Obama said, citing chaotic financial markets, rising jobless claims and the spectre of a deflationary spiral that could increase our massive debt even further.        
	He provided few details and no price tag, but said his economic team was working on a plan big enough to meet the challenges we face that I intend to sign soon after taking office.        
	While cast as a response to a rapidly worsening crisis, the plan could enable Obama to shift massive sums to domestic priorities that Democrats say have long been neglected, such as health care and education.         
	Obama said the plan would be a down payment on the type of reform my administration will bring to Washington.        
	Obamas address echoed many of the same ideas Democrats on Capitol Hill have been advocating for nearly a year.        
	Obama said his plan would launch a two-year nationwide effort to jump-start job creation in America and lay the foundation for a strong and growing economy. Well put people back to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, modernising schools that are failing our children, and building wind farms and solar panels, as well as producing fuel-efficient cars.        
	These arent just steps to pull ourselves out of this immediate crisis; these are long-term investments in our economic future that have been ignored for far too long, he said.        
	Economists have called on the federal government to spend at least $150 billion and as much as $500 billion to ease the effects of what is expected to be the most painful and prolonged recession since World War II.         
	House Democrats have been talking about a new package worth at least $150 billion, and possibly much more.         
	The campaign did not release an estimate of the number of jobs that his latest proposal would create. But congressional aides who have been involved in developing stimulus proposals said any plan to create 2.5 million jobs is likely to be significantly larger  probably well over $200 billion, or between 1 and 2 per cent of the gross domestic product.

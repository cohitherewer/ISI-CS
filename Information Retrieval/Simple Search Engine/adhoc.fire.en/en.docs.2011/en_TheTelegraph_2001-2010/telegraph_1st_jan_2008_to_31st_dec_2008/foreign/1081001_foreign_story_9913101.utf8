The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kayani tightens control over ISI
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kayani tightens control over ISI
  - Military operations head is spy chief                             Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha                                  
	Islamabad, Sept. 30: The chief of the Pakistani army, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, today appointed a new head of the nations premier spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).        
	The appointment consolidates Kayanis control over an agency that the US contends has been helping the Taliban mount operations against American forces in Afghanistan.        
	An army statement today said that Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha was appointed as the director general of the ISI. Pasha, who is considered to be close to Kayani, replaces Lt Gen Nadeem Taj who was hand-picked by former President Pervez Musharraf.        
	Pashas appointment was approved by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani.        
	Pasha has been overseeing Pakistani military operations against Taliban and al Qaida militants in the countrys northwest. He had also commanded troops for the UN mission to Sierra Leone in 2001-2002 and was appointed as an adviser on peacekeeping operations by the world body last year.        
	Taj, a distant relative of Musharraf, has been transferred to head the Gujranwala-based 30 Corps. He was appointed as ISI chief in September last year.        
	 Kayani led the spy agency before he became army chief last November. That was when Pervez Musharraf relinquished the role, nine months before resigning as President.         
	Under Pakistans new civilian government, Kayani has been deliberately making his mark on the army.         
	Todays announcement of the new spy chief, along with a roster of appointments of new senior generals, put his personal stamp on the top echelon of the military.        
	As head of the intelligence agency, Pasha will be dealing directly with the CIA and face Washingtons determination to stop attacks by Taliban and al Qaida forces in Afghanistan. Pasha assumes the role at a time of mounting tension between the US and Pakistan.        
	American Special Forces crossed earlier this month from Afghanistan into Waziristan in Pakistans tribal area on a raid against al Qaida operatives who provide much of the technical and strategic back up for the Taliban fighters. The American raid sparked a tough public repudiation of Washington from Kayani.         
	He said Pakistan would defend its borders at all costs, an extraordinary statement from one ally to another.        
	In August, Pasha accompanied Kayani to a secret, highly unusual meeting between top Pakistani military leaders and American commanders, including the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, on the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier.        
	Pakistani officials said the appointments were part of a regularly scheduled reshuffle, and had little to do with the new civilian government. They said the choices were entirely those of Kayani.

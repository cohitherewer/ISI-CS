	London, March 1: The Prince of Wales spoke with pride about his sons role on the front line as Prince Harry arrived back in Britain today following his emergency withdrawal from Afghanistan.        
	The prince said he was enormously proud of Harry, and he now understood what the families and loved ones of soldiers endured when they were serving abroad. As you can imagine its obviously a great relief as far as Im concerned to see him home in one piece, he said.         
	Prince Charles heaped praise on the families of servicemen, who he said endure so much and support their loved ones with such understanding. He also expressed his frustration that Prince Harrys deployment had been cut short.        
	I feel particular frustration that he was removed unexpectedly early because apart from anything else, he had been looking forward to coming back with the rest of his regiment, he said.         
	The prince added: Its been quite difficult also having to keep quiet about the fact he was serving in that part of the world. People kept saying to me: You must be so frustrated about Harry not being able to serve abroad.        
	Prince Harry flew back to Britain today after a media leak led to him being withdrawn 10 weeks into a 14-week tour of duty in Afghanistan.        
	The 23-year-old second lieutenant in the Household Cavalry touched down in a military plane at the Royal Air Force base at Brize Norton in central England, where he was met by his father, and his brother, Prince William.        
	The plane landed at about 11.30amGMT and several dozen soldiers emerged before the prince. Harry is one of about 170 soldiers to arrive back in the UK from Afghanistan today.        
	Wearing combat fatigues and carrying his kit and body armour, the prince filed down the steps of the jet with his comrades.        
	There was no official welcome on the tarmac and the troops made their way to the terminal building. Harry left Afghanistan on a flight last evening amid concerns he would be a target for extremists if he stayed.        
	Meanwhile, there are reports today that Prince William  second in line to the throne  will deployed on board a warship after his Royal Navy training later this year.        
	Before he boarded his flight, Harry was moved from his base, only 500 yards from Taliban enemy lines in the volatile Helmand province, to a secret and secure location after his presence in Afghanistan was leaked on an American website.         
	Taliban insurgents have threatened to step up attacks on British forces after the news broke of Harrys secret deployment in the war zone.         
	A Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that his presence in Helmand province meant that the royal family had joined in the aggression against Muslims.         
	Prince Harrys presence in Afghanistan encourages our fighters to launch more attacks on British forces. We think Prince Harry has been sent to Afghanistan only to boost the sagging morale of the British forces which are in serious trouble.         
	For us he is just part of occupation forces. Instead of killing innocent people, the prince should try to influence the British government to withdraw troops from Afghanistan.        
	Obama praise        
	Barack Obama has praised Prince Harrys service in Afghanistan and warned that Britains Nato allies must do more to help his fellow soldiers fighting in Helmand province.

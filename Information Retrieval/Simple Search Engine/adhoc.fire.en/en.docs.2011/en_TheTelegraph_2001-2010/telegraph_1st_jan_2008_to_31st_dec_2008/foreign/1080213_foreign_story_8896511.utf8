                                                                                                               Troops fan out
                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 12 (AP): Tens of thousands of troops began fanning out across Pakistan today to bolster security ahead of next weeks parliamentary elections, but senior military officials say they would not try to interfere with the vote.        
	Also today, at least nine people were wounded in a bomb blast near the office of a candidate in the southwestern province of Baluchistan, underscoring fears that violence could mar the election.        
	Interior ministry spokesman, Javed Iqbal Cheema, said troops were mobilising and moving nationwide to help maintain peace and order during the election, but promised none would be stationed at voting booths  a move that could serve to intimidate voters.

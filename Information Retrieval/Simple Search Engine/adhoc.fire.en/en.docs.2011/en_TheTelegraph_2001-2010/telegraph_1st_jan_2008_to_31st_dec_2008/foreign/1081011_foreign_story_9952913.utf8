	London, Oct. 10: It was the perfect gift for the ultimate hard man of world politics: a tiger cub presented to the former Russian President Vladimir Putin for his 56th birthday.         
	The two-month-old female Siberian tiger cub, a rare species native to northeastern Asia, will eventually be housed in a zoo or wildlife reserve.         
	Putin was photographed stroking the 20-pound cat. He has yet to decide between the names Mashenka and Milashka. The cub lay in a wicker basket with a tiger-print cushion on the verandah of his Moscow residence. But he refused to say who had given him the animal, which he showed to Russian reporters.

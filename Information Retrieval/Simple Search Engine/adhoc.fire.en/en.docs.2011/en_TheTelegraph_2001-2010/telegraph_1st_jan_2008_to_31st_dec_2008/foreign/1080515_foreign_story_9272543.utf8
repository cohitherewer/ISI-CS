                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Zardari hopes Sharif will remain as partner
                            
	Islamabad, May 14 (Reuters): The leader of the main party in Pakistans fractured six-week-old coalition government, Asif Ali Zardari, said today he hoped former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs party that resigned from the cabinet this week would remain a partner.        
	Sharif, who heads the second biggest party in the coalition, said Monday his members were quitting after failing to reach agreement with the main coalition party, Pakistan Peoples Party, to reinstate judges dismissed by President Pervez Musharraf.        
	In his first public comments on the split in the coalition, Zardari, former Premier Benazir Bhuttos widower, said he wanted Sharif to remain a partner. I am not looking at a minus Nawaz position, Im looking at a plus Nawaz league position, where I take him on every step, Zardari said. Even if we agree to disagree on some (issues) we should agree on most of them, he said.        
	Sharif has promised that his party, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), would still support the government while no longer being part of it. But Zardari said he had a majority in parliament without Sharifs party and, in at hint he could bring Musharrafs allies into government, said he wanted reconciliation with all politicians, even old enemies.

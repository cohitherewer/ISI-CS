                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US troops reinforce base after attack

	Kabul, July 14 (AP): US troops today reinforced a remote military outpost after well-armed militants got inside and killed nine American soldiers in the deadliest assault on US forces in Afghanistan in three years.        
	Yesterdays assault has deepened doubts about the US militarys ability to contain Islamic militants. Attacks in Afghanistan are becoming more complex, intense and better coordinated than a year ago, US officials say.        
	 Militants with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars attacked the remote base in the village of Wanat in the mountainous northeastern province of Kunar at about 4.30am yesterday, with insurgents firing from homes and a mosque.        
	It was a concerted attempt to overrun the small base near the Pakistan border that was built only about three days ago, said an official with Natos International Security Assistance Force.        
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasnt authorised to release the information, estimated the attacking force was several hundred.        
	An unknown number of militants got inside the outpost, the reason the fighters were able to inflict such high casualties, said a second military official who also spoke on condition of anonymity.        
	After the breach, US troops pushed back against the invading militants, and attack helicopters swooped in. The second official said more than 40 insurgents were killed in the fighting. Fifteen US soldiers also were wounded.        
	We mourn the loss of life here, US state department spokesman Sean McCormack said. Instead of looking at it necessarily from the perspective of the Taliban or terrorists being more aggressive in coming after Nato or US forces or Afghan forces, in this particular case it was an example of Nato, US and Afghan forces being aggressive in combatting cross-border infiltration.        
	The latest assault came at a time of rising violence in Afghanistan. Monthly death tolls of US and Nato troops in Afghanistan surpassed US military deaths in Iraq in May and June. And last Monday, a suicide bomber attacked the Indian embassy in Kabul, killing 58 people in the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since 2001.

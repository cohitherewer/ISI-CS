          URMEE KHAN                               
	London, July 5: Police in Wales were called to investigate a mysterious flying saucer, only to discover it was the moon.         
	The moon was mistaken for a bright, stationary UFO which had been loitering for at least half an hour, by a confused local in south Wales who made a 999 call to the police.         
	Today officers released a transcript in order to highlight the time wasted by unnecessary 999 calls. The bizzare conversation ran as follows:         
	Control: South Wales Police, whats your emergency?         
	Caller: Its not really. I just need to inform you that across the mountain theres a bright stationary object.         
	Control: Right.         
	Caller: If youve got a couple of minutes perhaps you could find out what it is? Its been there at least half an hour and its still there.         
	Control: Its been there for half an hour. Right. Is it actually on the mountain or in the sky?         
	Caller: Its in the air.         
	Control: I will send someone up there now to check it out.         
	Caller: OK.         
	After the police patrol car arrives, the script reveals the exchange between the control room and the police officer sent to the scene.         
	Control: Alpha Zulu 20, this object in the sky, did anyone have a look at it?         
	Officer: Yes, its the moon. Over.         
	A police spokeswoman said: This was a recent example of an inappropriate 999 call to South Wales Police. Yes, we can all see the comical side but calling 999 with an unnecessary non-emergency call could block a genuine call for vital seconds and put lives at risk.         
	Other bizarre calls cited by the police force included someone asking for help voting for Rhydian on The X-Factor and another requesting a pound coin for their supermarket trolley.

	Washington, Jan. 29 (AP): So close, yet so far away and so bitter. 
    
	Rival Democrats Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama came within 30 cm of each other just before President George W. Bushs State of the Union speech last night and managed not to acknowledge each other, and certainly not touch.
    
	Hillary, clad in scarlet, crossed the aisle between their seats on the House floor. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Democratic icon who had endorsed Obama earlier in the day over Hillary, reached out his hand when she came close. She took it; they shook. 
    
	Meanwhile, Obama, dressed in a dark suit, had turned away. 
    
	The rivals then retreated to their seats, only the aisle and four senators between them. Obama sat next to Kennedy during Bushs speech. It was the latest chapter in the increasingly nasty fight between the two leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.

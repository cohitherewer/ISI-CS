	Beichuan, China, May 17 (Reuters): Thousands of Chinese fled their homes today amid fears a lake could burst its banks, hampering rescue efforts after the deadliest earthquake in more than three decades killed about 29,000 people.        
	Rescue workers returned to Beichuan county, near the epicentre of the quake, in Sichuan province, but many residents were too frightened to return, nervous about a lake formed after aftershocks triggered landslides blocking the flow of a river.        
	After briefly evacuating, rescue work returned to normal at Beichuan, an official website said, blaming the evacuation on a false alarm.        
	A paramilitary officer had told Reuters earlier that the likelihood of the lake bursting its banks was extremely big.        
	The situation was very dangerous because there are still tremors causing landslides that could damage the dam, said Luo Gang, a building worker who left the southeastern port city of Xiamen and rushed home to look for his missing fiancee.        
	Rescue work had been complicated by bad weather, treacherous terrain and hundreds of aftershocks.        
	Although the time for the best chance of rescue... has passed, saving lives remains the top priority of our work, President Hu Jintao told distraught survivors just over a week after a jubilant China celebrated the Olympic torch relay reaching the summit of Mount Everest.        
	As the weather becomes warmer, survivors were worried about hygiene and asked questions about their long-term future.        
	What we dont need now is more instant noodles, said truck driver Wang Jianhong in the city of Dujiangyan. We want to know now what will happen with our lives.        
	There has been growing concern about the safety of dams and reservoirs which have been weakened in the mountainous province of Sichuan, an area about the size of Spain.        
	In Sichuan and neighbouring Chongqing, 17 reservoirs were damaged, with some dams cracked or leaking water. Several are on the Min river, which tumbles through the worst-hit areas between the Tibetan plateau and the Sichuan plain.        
	The Lianhehua dam, built in the late 1950s northwest of Dujiangyan, showed cracks big enough to put a fist in.        
	When the dam is in this shape, we cannot feel relaxed, said farmer Feng Binggui who has moved from his village below the dam into the hills.

	London, Dec. 31: J.K. Rowling has admitted she might be persuaded to write another Harry Potter book  in ten years time.
    
	The author revealed there have been times when she has thought about penning an eighth book in the hugely popular series. However she said that, if she did, the young wizard himself is unlikely to be the star of a new novel. 
    
	The 42-year-old told Time magazine: There have been times since finishing, weak moments, when Ive said: Yeah, all right to the eighth novel. 
    
	If, and its a big if, I ever write an eighth book about the (wizarding) world, I doubt that Harry would be the central character. I feel Ive already told his story. But these are big ifs. Lets give it 10 years.
    
	Rowling, who Time placed at number three in its Person of the Year list, is now thought to be working on an adult novel and a political fairy tale. 
    
	Harry Potter dominated both the 2007 book and DVD best-sellers lists released by Amazon.co.uk last week. 
    
	The seventh and final book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, sold more units via the online retailer than any other product.
    
	It smashed book sale records when it launched in the summer. It was followed by the DVD of Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix.

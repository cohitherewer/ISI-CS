	London, July 15: Games giant Microsoft outlined its plans to win over casual gamers by announcing new videogames designed to appeal to families.         
	These include a karaoke game for the Xbox 360 console, and a new online gaming area in which players can compete against one another in virtual quiz shows.         
	Don Mattrick, senior vice- president of interactive media at Microsoft, stressed the importance of appealing to a wide audience of all ages and interests. Today, our industry belongs to everyone, he said.        
	Lips, a game in which players use wireless microphones to sing along in time with the music, will appeal to a young, mostly female user base.        
	There will be more than 40 songs to choose from when the game is launched this Christmas, and players will be able to plug their MP3 player into their Xbox and sing along to their own music collection.         
	Microsoft also overhauled the look and feel of its online Xbox user experience, introducing avatars  customisable, cartoon-like representations of individual players  similar to those found on the Nintendo Wii, as well as new social elements to the platform.         
	These include an online mode in which up to eight people can share photos or chat live over the Internet.         
	And Microsoft announced a deal with Netflix, the US movie rental service, to allow Xbox 360 users to download videos over the Internet.         
	These films could then be watched on individual consoles, or viewed simultaneously online by a group of friends in a virtual cinema.         
	Were entering a new age in entertainment, and Xbox 360 is uniquely positioned to become the heart of the living room, said Mattrick.         
	A study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimates that consumers will spend more than $48 billion (24 billion) on computer games in 2008.                             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

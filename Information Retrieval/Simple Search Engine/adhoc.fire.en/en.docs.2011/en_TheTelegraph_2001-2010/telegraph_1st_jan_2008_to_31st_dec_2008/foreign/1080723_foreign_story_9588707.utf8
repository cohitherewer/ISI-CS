	Washington, July 22 (Reuters): Laser treatment can remove wrinkles better than some newer procedures, dermatologists reported today.        
	Carbon dioxide laser resurfacing was very effective and while there were some side-effects, such as lightening or darkening of the skin, they almost always cleared up, Dr Daniel Ward and Dr Shan Baker of the University of Michigan reported.        
	Use of the laser allows precise treatment, giving the surgeon more control over the resurfacing procedure than is possible with other techniques such as chemical peels and dermabrasion, they wrote in the journal of Facial Plastic Surgery.        
	Carbon dioxide lasers vaporise water molecules inside and outside cells, damaging the surrounding tissue. Skin cells respond by producing collagen, which in turn fills in wrinkles.         
	Dermatologists had been looking for alternatives, because the process can either bleach the colour out of the skin or cause uneven darkened patches. It can also cause outbreaks of herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores.

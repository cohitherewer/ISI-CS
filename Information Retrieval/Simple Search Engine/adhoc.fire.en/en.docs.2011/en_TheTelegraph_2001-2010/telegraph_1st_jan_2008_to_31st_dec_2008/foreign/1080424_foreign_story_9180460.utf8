	London, April 23: Jemima Goldsmith has received death threats from Islamic extremists for supporting a Muslim group which preaches tolerance of other religions.         
	Jemima is a patron of the Quilliam Foundation, a think tank that was recently set up by two reformed members of the extremist organisation Hizb ut Tahrir.         
	The group has received death threats by phone and email that are intended for all members of the organisation and it has been reported that one even referred to Jemima by name.         
	During the launch of the think tank yesterday, Jemima, the former wife of Pakistan cricketer Imran Khan, admitted she had been nervous about voicing her support for the group. She said she had been a little wobbly, adding, if there was no response from the dark side, then we would be failing.         
	The organisation has received criticism on Islamic websites. One site labels Jemima as a fujiar, an Arabic word for someone who publicly commits sin. The website has posted pictures of Jemima in a bikini and says: This is the same socialite Jemima who is regularly pictured in chick mags in mini skirts and low-cut dresses hopping in and out of nightclubs, and she is going to be lecturing us on true Islam?!

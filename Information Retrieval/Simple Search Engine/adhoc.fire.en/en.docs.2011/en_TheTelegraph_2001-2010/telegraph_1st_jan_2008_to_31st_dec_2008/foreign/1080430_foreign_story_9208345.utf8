	Mel on Edge    
	 Los Angeles, April 29 (Reuters): Mel Gibson, who has kept a low profile since his drunken anti-Semitic outburst in July 2006, is set to headline his first feature film since 2002, Daily Variety reported today.      
	The 52-year-old Hollywood actor has committed to play a police investigator in Edge of Darkness.

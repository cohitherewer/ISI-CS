	Port-au-Prince, Nov. 8 (Reuters): A ramshackle church school collapsed in a shanty town on the outskirts of Haitis capital yesterday, burying dozens in rubble and killing at least 75, many of them children, rescue workers said.        
	The three-storey La Promesse school caved in while class was in session, and some of the walls and debris crushed neighbouring residences in the Nerettes community near Port-au-Prince, injuring still more, civil protection service official Nadia Blachard told Haitian radio.        
	There are 75 killed and 124 wounded, including 20 in serious condition, Blachard said.        
	Crowds of screaming parents swarmed the ruins in the aftermath searching for their children. The work continued after nightfall with the help of UN peacekeepers, relatives and rescue services. At the scene, crying and screaming parents searched desperately for their children while bodies of students lay crushed under blocks of concrete.

	Beverly Hills, Jan. 22 (Reuters): The gritty dramas No Country For Old Men and There Will Be Blood scored eight Academy Award nominations each today, leading a sombre field in an Oscar season overshadowed by the Hollywood writers strike.
    
	The British period romance Atonement scored seven nominations before the awards ceremony in late February, as did the legal thriller Michael Clayton. All four films were nominated for best picture, along with the quirky teen comedy Juno.
    
	Australian actress Cate Blanchett, another Oscar laureate, received two nominations  for her title role as the British monarch in Elizabeth: The Golden Age, directed by Shekhar Kapur, and for her supporting role as Bob Dylan in Im Not There.
    
	The other lead-actress contenders were British veteran Julie Christie for Away From Her, French actress Marion Cotillard for La Vie en rose, Laura Linney for The Savages and Canadian actress Ellen Page for Juno. Christie previously won an Oscar for 1965s Darling.
    
	No Country For Old Men and There Will Be Blood each got only one acting nomination. Spanish actor Javier Bardem was cited for his supporting role as a cool-headed killer in No Country For Old Men and British actor Daniel Day-Lewis for his lead role as a misanthropic oilman in There Will Be Blood.
    
	Both films were nominated for best director, along with Michael Clayton, Juno and the fact-based French-language story The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. 
    
	The lions share of films nominated in major categories deal in dark themes of human tragedy and struggle  a fact that Oscar producer Gilbert Cates said was not entirely coincidental. 
    
	Day-Lewis will compete against George Clooney for Michael Clayton, Johnny Depp for the bloody musical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Tommy Lee Jones for the Iraq war-themed In the Valley of Elah and Viggo Mortensen for the mobster thriller Eastern Promises.

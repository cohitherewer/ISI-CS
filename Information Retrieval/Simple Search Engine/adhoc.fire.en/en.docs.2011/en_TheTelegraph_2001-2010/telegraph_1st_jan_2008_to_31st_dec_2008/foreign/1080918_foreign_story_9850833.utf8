	London, Sept. 17: Carla Bruni has admitted she sometimes wakes her husband, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, in the middle of the night by playing her songs.         
	The former supermodel turned singer-songwriter said her husband was very kind about her music.        
	 Bruni appeared alongside rock bands Metallica and Kings of Leon on music TV show Later... with Jools Holland.         
	She said Sarkozy helped her make music. I disturb him with it in the middle of the night, Bruni said. Its a very different world for him but hes very kind and listens to all my doubts. Bruni said she managed to keep her new life as the First Lady of France and her role as a singer separate. I dont really mix them up. I separate them. I play my music then I go with my husband when he needs me.        
	Bruni, 40, married Sarkozy in February.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Karachi, Dec. 15 (Reuters): Many Pakistani truckers have halted taking supplies to Western forces in Afghanistan because of an upsurge in militant attacks on goods and equipment trucked through Pakistan, transport company officials said today.        
	Nato has been looking for alternatives to the main supply route in Pakistan after a surge in attacks by al Qaida-linked militants, including the destruction of about 300 trucks in five attacks last week. A main truckers association said it had stopped sending goods to northwest Pakistan from Karachi. We have stopped supplies for Nato forces for security reasons, said Noor Khan Niazi, president of the Karachi Goods Carriers Association.

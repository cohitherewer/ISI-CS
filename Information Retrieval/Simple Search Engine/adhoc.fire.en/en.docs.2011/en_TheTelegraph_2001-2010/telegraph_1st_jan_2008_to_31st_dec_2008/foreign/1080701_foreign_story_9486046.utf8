                              Geert Wilders                            
	Amsterdam, June 30 (Reuters): Dutch prosecutors said today they will not take action against a politician who angered Muslims worldwide with a film critical of the Quran because he is protected by the right to free speech.        
	Prosecutors received dozens of requests for an investigation after anti-immigration politician Geert Wilders produced a film in March which accuses Islam of inciting violence, prompting protests and condemnation in many Muslim countries.        
	They had also received complaints about comments Wilders made in newspaper interviews including one in which he compared Islams holy book Quran to Hitlers Mein Kampf.        
	That comments are hurtful and offensive for a large number of Muslims does not mean that they are punishable, Dutch prosecutors said in a statement, adding that they saw no grounds for prosecuting Wilders for inciting hatred or discrimination.        
	Freedom of expression fulfils an essential role in public debate in a democratic society. That means that offensive comments can be made in a political debate.        
	Wilderss Right-wing Freedom Party has nine out of the 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. Politicians need to have room to voice their opinions. The film has sparked calls for boycotts of Dutch products in some Muslim countries, but has not lead to the kind of violence that was directed against Denmark in 2006 after papers published cartoons of the Prophet.

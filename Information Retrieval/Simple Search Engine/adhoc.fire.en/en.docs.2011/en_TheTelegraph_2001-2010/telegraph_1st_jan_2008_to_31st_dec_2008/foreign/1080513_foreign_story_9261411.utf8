	Kathmandu, May 12: King Gyanendra, facing imminent ouster from the throne, and Queen Komal made perhaps their last royal appearance at a shrine outside Kathmandu today.        
	They offered annual prayers to the goddess Kali in an elaborate ritual that involved the sacrifice of five animals at the Dakshinkali temple, 25 km south of Kathmandu. This particular ritual has been performed by every monarch of the Shah Dynasty for the last 239 years.        
	The Nepali Army did not secure the temple area for the royal party. About two dozen policemen provided security as the royal couple ventured out of the Narayanhitti Palace for the first time since the April 10 Constituent Assembly elections.        
	This is a ritual for peace and prosperity for the self and the family, priest Sekhar Prasad Pandit said after performing the 45-minute prayers.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: India today hailed Pakistans democratic elections while pointing out that it is an internal matter for the country.        
	The recent elections in Pakistan are Pakistans internal affair. Since you have asked, the government of India welcomes the fact that the people of Pakistan have been able to express themselves clearly and in a democratic manner on their own future, the foreign ministry spokesperson said.         
	In an apparent reference to the delay in setting dates for the next round of talks, India said it stands ready to resume talks as soon as a duly constituted government is in place in Pakistan.         
	It remains our hope that we will be able to resolve outstanding issues and build a mutually beneficial relationship with Pakistan in an atmosphere free of violence and terrorism, the spokesperson said.         
	India said it wishes to see Pakistan develop and prosper within a stable democratic order.        
	The BJP hoped that the democratic forces will provide Pakistan a truly representative government with full peoples participation. It also hoped that the new government will be able to exercise proper democratic control over the Pakistan army.         
	The CPM said the election results show a rejection of authoritarian military rule in Pakistan. The verdict... is a reaffirmation of their faith in parliamentary democracy.

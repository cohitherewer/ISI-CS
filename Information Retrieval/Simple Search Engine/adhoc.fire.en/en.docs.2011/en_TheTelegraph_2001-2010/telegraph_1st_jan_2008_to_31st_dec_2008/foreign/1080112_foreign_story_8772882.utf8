	Kuwait, Jan. 11 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush wrapped up his mission to Israel and the occupied West Bank today, emboldened enough to have predicted a peace treaty within a year but with no major breakthroughs for his efforts.
    
	Concluding his first presidential visit to the Holy Land, Bush arrived today evening in Kuwait, the first of five stops with Arab allies he hopes will aid the fragile peace process and help contain Irans growing regional clout.
    
	Tonight Bush will meet Kuwaits ruler and thank him for his support and for democratisation efforts in the state that have seen women being allowed to vote and run for office.
    
	He will talk about the fight against extremists and radicals as well as the Middle East peace effort, Lebanon and Iraq, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters.
    
	Kuwaiti newspapers said the emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, will tell Bush his country is worried that any US strike against nearby Iran would destabilise the Gulf region, which is crucial to world oil supplies.
    
	Bush is likely to hear a similar message from other Gulf Arab leaders who eye their Shiite Muslim neighbour with concern and want to curb its nuclear programme, but without resort to war.
    
	Kuwait, which also neighbours Iraq and is a base for thousands of US troops, has said it will not allow the US to use its territory for any strike against Iran.
    
	Bush flew out of Tel Aviv after painting an upbeat picture from talks this week with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas intending to build on a US-hosted international peace meet in November.
    
	Sending a symbolic message, Bush ended the first leg of a week-long Middle East tour by visiting the Mount of Beatitudes, where Jesus is believed to have intoned blessed are the peacemakers, and the ruins of Capernaum on the Sea of Galilee.
    
	Challenging sceptics, Bush said yesterday there would be a signed peace treaty before he left office in January 2009.
    
	Olmerts spokesman said Israel endorsed Bushs call for a rapid peace deal but made clear it does not see the final establishment of a Palestinian state this year.
    
	Mark Regev said Israel hoped for a historic agreement in 2008 that would outline the framework of a future Palestinian state, with implementation contingent on Palestinians meeting security commitments.
    
	The White House had kept expectations low for progress toward a two-state solution during Bushs visit.

	Washington, May 13 (Reuters): The US plans to contribute $500,000 to help with earthquake relief efforts in China in anticipation of an appeal for aid by the International Red Cross, the White House said today.        
	Its an initial contribution in response to the event, said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino. As other engineers tour the area and the needs become evident, well consider what if any additional funding is needed, she said.        
	President George W. Bush spoke to Chinese President Hu Jintao earlier today to offer condolences and US assistance, Perino said. In discussions on the struggling cyclone relief efforts in Myanmar, a Chinese ally, President Hu offered to continue to assist our efforts, she said.        
	Bush yesterday condemned Myanmars military junta for failing to act more quickly to accept international help after Cyclone Nargis devastated the country.

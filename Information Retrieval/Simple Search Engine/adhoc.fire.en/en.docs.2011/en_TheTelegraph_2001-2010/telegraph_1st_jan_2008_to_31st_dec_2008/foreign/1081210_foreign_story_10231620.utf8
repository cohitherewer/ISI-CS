	Washington, Dec. 9 (AP): Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and designated successor Hillary Rodham Clinton dined together for the first time since the former First Lady was tapped to become the next top US diplomat.        
	State department spokesman Sean McCormack says Rice and Clinton enjoyed a private two-hour catered meal of sea bass, wild rice, mushroom soup and fruit at Rices apartment in Washingtons Watergate complex last night. Aside from the food, he says they chewed over foreign policy issues and challenges that will face the new Barack Obama administration.        
	Rice and Clinton  who will be the countrys third female secretary of state after she is confirmed by the Senate  first met in the 1990s when Hillary brought her daughter, Chelsea, for a visit to Stanford University where Rice was the provost. The pair have had a cordial relationship since and Rice has said she believes Clinton will make a great secretary of state.        
	Earlier yesterday, Clinton made her first visit to the state department since Obama named her as his choice for the next secretary of state. She spent several hours with members of the departments transition team.

	Ely (Nevada), April 20 (AP): A dog that ran off during a road-trip rest stop apparently made her way nearly 129km across Nevadas high desert and two mountain ranges to return home a week later.        
	Moon, a Siberian husky, was reunited on April 14 with owner Doug Dashiell, who had last seen her on April 6 near Railroad Valley, about 124km from his home in Ely.        
	Moon, nearly 2 years old, was no worse for the wear, with the exception of stinking like a skunk that apparently sprayed her somewhere along the journey.        
	Ive had trouble with her running away before. Shes always come home, Dashiell said. But he didnt expect her to show up this time. After seven days  no way, he said.        
	Then the White Pine Veterinary Clinic called Dashiell and told him Moon was back in town.

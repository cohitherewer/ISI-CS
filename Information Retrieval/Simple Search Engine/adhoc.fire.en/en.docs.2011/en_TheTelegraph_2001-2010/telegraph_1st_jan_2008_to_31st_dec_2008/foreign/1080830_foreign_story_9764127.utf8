The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Once a superstar, Jackson turns 50
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Once a superstar, Jackson turns 50
                            
	Los Angeles, Aug. 29 (Reuters): Singer Michael Jackson turned 50 today, a shadow of the superstar once known as the King of Pop whose records thrilled millions before his bizarre personal life eclipsed his musical brilliance.        
	Unlike Madonnas 50th birthday bash and launch of another world tour earlier this month, the singer who wishes he was Peter Pan appears to have no special celebrations planned and a much-touted musical comeback has so far come to nothing. A semi-recluse since his harrowing 2005 trial and acquittal on child sex abuse, Jackson has been living out of the spotlight for the past few months.        
	In a telephone interview with ABC television programme Good Morning America, Jackson said he will just have a little cake with my children and watch some cartoons, and he added that he feels very wise and sage, but at the same time very young.        
	Recent pictures of Jackson in Las Vegas showed him dressed in pajamas and slippers, and one had him sitting in a wheelchair, wearing a surgical mask. Jackson family friend and lawyer Brian Oxman told Reuters the singer sometimes used the wheelchair to get around.

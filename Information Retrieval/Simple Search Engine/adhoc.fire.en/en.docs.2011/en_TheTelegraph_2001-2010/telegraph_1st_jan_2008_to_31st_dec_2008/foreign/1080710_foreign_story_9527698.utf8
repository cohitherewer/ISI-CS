The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jude caught talking on phone while driving
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jude caught talking on phone while driving
          ANITA SINGH                          In trouble                                  
	London, July 9: Jude Law, the actor, could find himself in trouble after he was photographed driving while apparently using his mobile phone.         
	It is illegal for motorists to use a hand-held mobile but the star appeared to flout the rules as he drove near his home in Maida Vale, northwest London. He allegedly manoeuvred the car with one hand on the steering wheel while holding the phone to his ear.         
	Using a phone while driving has been outlawed since 2003, with a maximum fine of 5,000 and up to nine points on a motorists licence.         
	Under tough new guidelines proposed last year, drivers could face a two-year jail term. Law, 35, appeared deep in conversation.         
	Perhaps he was talking to Lily Cole, the 20-year-old model and face of Marks and Spencer. Cole and Law were seen together recently at a Radiohead gig in London and have been on several dates since.         
	The actor, star of Cold Mountain and The Talented Mr Ripley, is not the first celebrity to be accused of breaching the mobile phone ban. Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson was photographed allegedly driving along the M40 in Oxfordshire at 70mph with a mobile clamped to his ear.         
	Glamour model Jordan was fined 200 last month and given three penalty points after she was caught chatting on her phone while driving in London.

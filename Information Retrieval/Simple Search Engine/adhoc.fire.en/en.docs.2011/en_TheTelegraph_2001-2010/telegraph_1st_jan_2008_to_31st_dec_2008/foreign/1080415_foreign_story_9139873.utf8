                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Berlusconi wins third term as PM
                            
	Rome, April 14 (Reuters): Conservative billionaire Silvio Berlusconi won a third term as Italys Prime Minister today with an unexpectedly strong mandate to deal with deep economic and social problems.        
	Centre-Left rival Walter Veltroni conceded defeat after early results from a two-day election projected a big majority in both houses of parliament for the 71-year-old media magnate. I called the leader of the People of Freedom, Silvio Berlusconi, to acknowledge his victory, the 52-year-old former mayor of Rome said.        
	Berlusconi, who has vowed to cut taxes, had been widely expected to win the lower house. But a strong Senate majority would help him push through reforms needed to pull Italy away from recession.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Italians too slovenly, says Armani
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Italians too slovenly, says Armani

	Rome, June 23: Giorgio Armani, the godfather of Italian style, has poured scorn on his home country for slipping into slovenliness.         
	As he unveiled a collection of trim blazers and sharply cut suits in Milan, Armani said Italians had let themselves go.         
	It is time to straighten ourselves out, we are too slovenly, he said. He blamed the lack of decent dressing on a culture of atrocious permissiveness.         
	He said: Everything seems to be allowed, even eating and drinking in a church square while stripped to the waist. Armani, 73, said Italys cities had suffered as a result. The centre of Milan has become a souk, as has the centre of Florence. The degradation is insane.         
	Once upon a time, you would head straight for the Corso Vittorio Emanuele [Milans equivalent of Londons Bond Street], but now there are brutes all around.         
	And when you walk you have to look out for the cans dropped in the street in front of you, he said.         
	Armani, who has built his empire on understated elegance, insisted that he was not suffering from nostalgia. The world changes  I do not want to hark back to the olden days and reject the new, he said.         
	However, he admitted injecting a severity into his catwalk show in order to communicate respect, which is a rare commodity these days.         
	Italians are famous for having a strong sense of fashion and spend more on their clothes, as a proportion of their salaries, than any other country in Europe.

	Tinley Park, Illinois, Feb. 3 (AP): A gunman fatally shot five people in an apparent robbery at a store in a suburban Chicago strip mall and fled yesterday, prompting police to sweep through neighbouring shops as terrified customers watched.
    
	The victims  all females  were killed at a Lane Bryant clothing store at the Brookside Marketplace, police sergeant. T.J. Grady said.
    
	Officers found the victims at the back of the store after getting a 911 call around 10:45 am, Grady said.
    
	The police searched for the gunman using a helicopter and dogs, and stopped buses, but concluded that the man left the store southwest of downtown Chicago.
    
	In a Target store across the parking lot from Lane Bryant, terrified customers were herded to the front as police with pistols and rifles drawn went up and down the aisles and into storerooms searching for the gunman.

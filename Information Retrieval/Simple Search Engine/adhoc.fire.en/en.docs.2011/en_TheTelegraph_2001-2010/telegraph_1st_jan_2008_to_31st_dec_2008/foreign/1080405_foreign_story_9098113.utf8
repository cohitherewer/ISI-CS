	London, April 4 (Reuters): Queen Elizabeths 86-year-old husband Prince Philip has been taken to hospital with a chest infection, Buckingham Palace said today.        
	The blunt-talking prince, who the palace said was working from his hospital bed, has been an energetic figure in the House of Windsor. He was admitted to hospital yesterday afternoon after suffering from a heavy cold.

	Paris, Dec. 12 (AFP): French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy is taking a clothing company to court to stop it from selling a shopping bag featuring a photo of the former supermodel in the nude, a lawyer said today.        
	The white canvas bags went on sale this month on the French island of Reunion, produced by local clothing firm Pardon which plans to sell them throughout France soon, said Pardon manager Peter Mertes.        
	A court in the Reunion capital of Saint-Denis will hear the request from President Nicolas Sarkozys wife to ban sales of the bag. This bag makes use of Bruni-Sarkozys image without her consent and for commercial gain, said Iqbal Akhoun, a spokesman in Saint-Denis for the first ladys lawyer Thierry Herzog. The 40-year-old former supermodel is also seeking $167,000 in damages.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Clooney swipe at Hollywood

	London, Feb. 5: George Clooney, one of Hollywoods most bankable stars who earns up to 15 million a movie, has taken a swipe at the film industry, saying he believes the golden age of cinema is dead.        
	The Oscar-winning actor said film studios were producing cinema masterpieces at the rate of ten a year in the 1960s and 1970s and todays movies lacked ground-breaking drive. In a thinly-disguised attack on the modern-day values of Hollywood, the 46-year-old makes clear his belief that computer-generated imagery and visual pyrotechnics are no substitute for a good story. Clooney places the glory years of cinema firmly between 1964 and 1976 when he says studios produced almost a masterpiece a month and directors like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Alan J. Pakula and Sidney Lumet pushed new boundaries.        
	Its 12 years and you could find ten films a year that are masterpieces, the actor told the Radio Times. They dont make those films anymore. You couldnt come near making those films. Clooneys conviction is such that a few years ago he gave each of his friends a gift of 100 DVDs from his favourite 12-year golden period. They included Cold War classics like Fail-Safe, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold and Dr Strangelove as well as Bound for Glory, a biographical film about the folk singer Woody Guthrie.        
	He also loves Network, Lumets satire about a television networks struggle for ratings and Scorseses Taxi Driver with its standout performance by Robert De Niro.        
	After a stuttering start to his own Hollywood career in the late 1990s, which included the universally-panned 1997 caper Batman and Robin, Clooney has set out to make his own landmark, intelligent films. They included Syriana, an innovative thriller about the global influence of the oil industry, for which he won a best supporting actor Oscar in 2005. This year he is nominated for best actor for his role in the corporate corruption thriller Michael Clayton. But Clooney implies there is little new on the silver screen and even his own latest triumph owes much to the films of the 1970s, particularly Pakulas The Parallax View which starred Warren Beatty as a reporter investigating a shadowy, murderous organisation.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

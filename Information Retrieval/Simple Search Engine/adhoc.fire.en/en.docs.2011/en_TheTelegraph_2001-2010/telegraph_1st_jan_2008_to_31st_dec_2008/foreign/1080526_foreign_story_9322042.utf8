	Clooney helmet    
	Augusta, Kentucky, May 25 (AP): A Kentucky museum dedicated to George Clooneys late aunt just wanted the actors helmet from the movie Leatherheads.      
	Turns out, the museum for singer and actress Rosemary Clooney will get the leather headgear and the rest of the football uniform.      
	This will be a nice addition, curator Steve Henry said. In the future we are hoping to accumulate at least one costume from each of his new movies.      
	Clooneys uniform will be placed among his aunts memorabilia.      
	We were at the premiere of Leatherheads in March and were told the entire football costume, from the cleats and socks to the helmet we had originally asked for, was ours to have for the museum, Henry said.     
	Boar chase    
	 Berlin (Reuters): German police pursuing a car thief through a dark forest turned rescuers when the man became cornered by a family of angry wild boar.      
	Officers caught the mans passenger after the pair rammed into a squad car on a cross-country chase. But they lost track of the 18-year-old driver when he fled into the forest.      
	Then he ran into the family of boars, and the head of the family squared up to him, a police spokesman said. So he stood there, put his hands up, and called for help.      
	Officers rescued the man from the boars, then arrested him.    
	Foot poser    
	 Vancouver (AP): Another severed human foot has been discovered washed ashore on Canadas Pacific coast, but police are no closer to solving the gruesome mystery.      
	The foot, still wearing a shoe, was on a small island south of Vancouver, and is the fourth discovered in the region in the past 10 months.      
	The previous cases all involved right feet still in sneakers.

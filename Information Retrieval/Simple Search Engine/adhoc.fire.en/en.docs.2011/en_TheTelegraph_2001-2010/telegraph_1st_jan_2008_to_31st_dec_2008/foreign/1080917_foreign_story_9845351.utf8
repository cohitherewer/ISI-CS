	London, Sept. 16: Russias political strongman Vladimir Putin has promised to give judo lessons to diminutive French President Nicolas Sarkozy.         
	Speaking to a French newspaper, Russias Prime Minister and former President said Sarkozy wanted to learn some of his black-belt martial arts skills.         
	He is interested in martial arts and we have decided to do some training together, said the burly Russian leader in an interview with Le Figaro.        
	Officials at the office of the 5 feet 4 inches Sarkozy said they could not comment on the forthcoming judo sessions. Any training bout between the two leaders might be less friendly than Sarkozy would hope.         
	When the pair first met in Moscow last October, Sarkozy warned his counterpart to behave responsibly on the world stage.                             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

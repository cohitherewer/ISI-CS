The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Dylan pause in Hollywood
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Dylan pause in Hollywood

	New York, Aug. 16: Barry Feinstein, the rock roll photographer, was digging through his archives last year when he came across a long-forgotten bundle of pictures, dozens of dark, moody snapshots of Hollywood in the early 1960s.         
	And tucked next to the photographs was a set of prose poems, written around the same time by an old friend: Bob Dylan. It was the lost manuscript, Feinstein recalled in a telephone interview from his home in Woodstock, New York. Everybody forgot about it but me.         
	The poems were so lost that Dylan, when told of the discovery, had forgotten that he had written them. (In his defence, it was the Sixties.)         
	But after languishing in storage for more than 40 years, the text and photographs will be published in November in a collection titled Hollywood Foto-Rhetoric: The Lost Manuscript.        
	The new book, to be published by Simon amp; Schuster, includes more than 75 of Feinsteins photographs and 23 of . Dylans prose poems, which are each marked alphabetically to correspond to a photo.         
	The book was created during a period in the 1960s when Feinstein was a 20-something flunky at a movie studio, he said, having arrived in Hollyood eager to be part of the industry and having landed a job working for Harry Cohn, the legendarily abrasive president of Columbia Pictures.         
	He roamed around movie sets, snapping pictures backstage and in dressing rooms, and during off hours he drove around Hollywood with his camera in tow.         
	The result is a collection of pictures that are sometimes dreary and sometimes tongue-in-cheek, shots of movie props and roadside stands, topless starlets and headless mannequins.         
	After assembling the photographs, Feinstein thought of Dylan, whom he had met before on the East Coast. I asked him as a joke: Wanna come out and maybe write something about these photographs? Feinstein said. So he came out and wrote some text.         
	Dylan, then in his 20s, arrived in Hollywood, examined the photographs and wrote his own prose poems to accompany them. No one involved in the book can recall exactly when Dylan wrote the poems, which are by turns sparse, playful, witty and sarcastic. But the words faintly recall Tarantula, Dylans book of prose poems that was written in 1966, and they bear a strong resemblance to the 11 Outlined Epitaphs in the liner notes of The Times They Are A-Changin, his 1964 album.

	Britney support    
	 Los Angeles, July 26 (Reuters): Singer Britney Spears will pay $20,000 a month in child support to former husband Kevin Federline for the care of their two children and will make a final payment of $250,000 to his lawyers, according to a final custody agreement filed in court yesterday.      
	The monthly child support payment is a $5,000 increase over what Spears and Federline agreed to last year,

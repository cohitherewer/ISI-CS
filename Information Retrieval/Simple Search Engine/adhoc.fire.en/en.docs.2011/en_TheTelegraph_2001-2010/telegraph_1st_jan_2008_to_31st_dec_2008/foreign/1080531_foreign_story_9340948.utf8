	New York, May 30: (Reuters): Staying connected with family and friends may delay memory decline among the elderly, a new research confirms.        
	Our results suggest increasing social integration may be an important component of efforts to protect older Americans from memory decline, Lisa F. Berkman from the Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, and colleagues conclude in a report in the American Journal of Public Health.        
	They looked at the impact of social integration on changes in memory over six years in 16,638 Americans aged 50 and older.         
	Memory was gauged by immediate and delayed recall of a 10-word list, and social integration was assessed by marital status, volunteer activity, frequency of contact with children, parents, and neighbours.        
	The average memory score declined from 11 in 1998 to 10 in 2004, the investigators found.        
	People with high social integration and low social integration had similar memory scores in 1998 but that changed over the subsequent six years.        
	Memory among the least socially integrated declined at twice the rate as among the most socially integrated.

	Islamabad, June 7 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said today that he has no immediate plan to resign or go into exile in a bid to quash rising speculation that he will quit office soon.        
	US ally Musharraf, who came to power as a general following a coup in 1999, has cut an increasingly isolated figure since the parties supporting him were defeated in an election in February.        
	Musharraf has stubbornly held onto the presidency despite losing parliamentary backing and public support. Rumours hit fresh heights in the past week that he was planning to step down and leave the newly elected civilian leaders to run the country.        
	I am not tendering resignation now, he told a group of journalists in a briefing that was later broadcast by all Pakistani news channels.        
	But, with the government proposing sweeping changes in the Constitution to curb his powers, Musharraf indicated that he would not like to be reduced to a ceremonial head of state. I will keep watching. I cant become a useless vegetable, he said.        
	Benazir Bhuttos widower Asif Ali Zardari, who now leads the party heading the coalition, has called Musharraf a relic of the past.        
	Zardari has also said his Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) did not recognise Musharraf as a constitutional President, and has drafted a constitutional package that would reduce him to a figurehead role.        
	Nawaz Sharif, the Prime Minister Musharraf overthrew and who now leads the second largest party in the National Assembly, wants his usurper impeached or tried for treason.        
	Musharraf is believed to be seeking indemnity for suspending the Constitution and imposing emergency rule for six weeks last November. The PPP leadership is trying to make his exit dignified, according to a Zardari adviser.        
	Despite Musharrafs public stance, political insiders say he recognises that he will have to quit rather than be the cause of further upheavals. It has also become a matter of timing. Musharraf gave no indication of when that might be in his comments today.        
	He said he had sound relations with President George W. Bush, but that would have little influence on events. My going or staying depends on Pakistan and me and nobody else, he said.        
	The US and other western allies are less worried about Musharraf no longer being in power than they are about the risk of a nuclear-armed Muslim nation plunging into more turmoil if his departure turns nasty.         
	There are fears that the political debate over what to do about Musharraf is distracting the coalition at a time when the Pakistani economy is deteriorating rapidly.

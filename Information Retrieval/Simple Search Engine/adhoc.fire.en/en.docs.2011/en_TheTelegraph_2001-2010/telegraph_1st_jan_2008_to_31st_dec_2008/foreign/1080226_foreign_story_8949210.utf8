The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jolie belly bump sparks speculation
                                                                                                               Jolie belly bump sparks speculation
                            
	Los Angeles, Feb. 25 (AP): If the bump on her belly is any indication, Angelina Jolie really is pregnant.        
	The actress created a stir at Saturday nights Spirit Awards when she showed up with partner Brad Pitt on her arm and a noticeably pregnant bulge.        
	Jolie ignored reporters questions on the awards show carpet, but People magazine reported on its website that a source close to the couple confirmed that she and Pitt are thrilled to be adding to their brood. Pitts publicist, Cindy Guagenti, declined comment to The Associated Press.        
	Jolie and Pitt are parents of a one-year-old daughter, Shiloh, and three children adopted from Cambodia, Ethiopia and Vietnam. Their adopted children are Maddox, 6; Pax, 4; and Zahara, 3.        
	Jolies appearance helped give a theme to Saturdays Spirit Awards, where the big winner was the teen pregnancy comedy Juno.

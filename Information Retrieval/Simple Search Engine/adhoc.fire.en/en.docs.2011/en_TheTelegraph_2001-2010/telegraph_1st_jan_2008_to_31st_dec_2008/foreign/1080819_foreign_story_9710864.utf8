	Kathmandu, Aug. 18: Maoist chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal, or Prachanda, was today formally sworn in the first Prime Minister of the Nepal republic.         
	While taking the oath of office from President Ram Baran Yadav at the Presidential Palace in Kathmandu, the 54-year-old former Maoist rebel indicated his intention to set new standards in Nepal.         
	First, Prachanda chose to take his oath in the name of the people rather than in the name of god.         
	Second, the former rebel wore a suit instead of the Nepali national attire  Daura Suruwal.         
	Finally, Prachanda decided to head for China in his first overseas trip to attend the closing ceremony of the Beijing Olympics on August 24. Prachandas decision is in stark contrast to his predecessors who had all made a beeline to New Delhi after assuming office.         
	Soon after the ceremony a smiling Prachanda, accompanied by his former Maoist security guards, met the ambassadors. It is quite clear that the peace process has to be taken to a logical conclusion and it will be my priority to prepare a new Constitution, he said in his new office.        
	Prachandas entire family, including father Muktiram Dahal, were present at the ceremony. Others who attended were the Vice-President, Parmananda Jha, Chief Justice Kedar Prasad Giri and Constituent Assembly chairman Subhash Chandra Nembang.         
	Conspicuous by his absence at the ceremony was outgoing Prime Minister and Nepali Congress chief, Girija Prasad Koirala, who had differences with the Maoists over power sharing in the new government.         
	Ambassadors from the US, India, China, Japan, Russia and UN representative Ian Martin were among the diplomats who attended the ceremony.         
	Earlier, Prachanda presided over his partys central committee meeting and announced that he would restrict his cabinet to 20 members with five portfolios being allocated to the major constituents of the ruling coalition.         
	Prachanda was picked on Friday by the Assembly meant to write a new Constitution and double as an interim parliament.

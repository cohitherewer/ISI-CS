	Baghdad, July 19: British Prime Minister Gordon Brown raised the prospect of a British withdrawal from Iraq today when he set out a four-point plan paving the way for a handover of power next year.         
	The Prime Minister made his announcement during a visit to Baghdad amid tight security, his third trip to Iraq since taking over from Tony Blair.         
	He said there had been significant progress in efforts to ensure that Iraqi security forces could take over from British forces in the south of the country.         
	Brown has until now resisted pressure to make any signal about the possible timing of a withdrawal of the 4,100 UK troops currently in the country, almost all of whom are garrisoned on the outskirts of Basra.         
	But he has faced increasing demands to set a date by Labour MPs who say it would transform the governments chances and boost Browns poor popularity ratings.         
	US presidential candidate Barack Obama has added to the pressure by vowing to withdraw US combat troops within the next 16 months.         
	Brown, who flew into Baghdads green zone in a military helicopter for talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and President Talabani, again insisted that British troops will stay until they get the job done.         
	But in a departure from previous statements, he gave his strongest hint yet that he may be preparing the ground for a full withdrawal in 2009, before the next elections.         
	The Prime Minister said: Our aim is to see the Iraqis in a position to take full responsibility for the armed forces and the security of the area. Im not setting an artificial timetable today but what I can say is that there is significant progress in these areas. Brown struck an optimistic note on the security situation pointing to a drop in attacks in Iraq, from six incidents a day six months ago to one incident every six days now.

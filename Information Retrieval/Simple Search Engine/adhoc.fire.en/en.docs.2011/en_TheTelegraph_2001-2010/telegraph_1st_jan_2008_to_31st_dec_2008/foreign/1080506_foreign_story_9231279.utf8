	 London, May 5: The bodies of three dead babies have been found stuffed in the basement freezer of a house in western Germany.         
	One person, believed to be the childrens mother, has been arrested, a prosecutors spokesman said.         
	The gruesome discovery was made last night after police received a tip and searched the home in Wenden in North Rhine-Westphalia.         
	Police have determined the infants were not stillborn, but did not say how old they were or what the cause of death was. More details about the case are expected to be released by police at a news conference later.         
	The incident follows a string of similar cases in Germany.         
	In February, police were called to a home in northern Germany where a dead infant was discovered in a cellar.         
	In January, a 28-year-old German woman was charged with manslaughter after the remains of three babies were discovered in her house and the home of a relative.

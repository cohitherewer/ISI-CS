	Paris, Sept. 11 (Reuters): A fire on a freight train forced the closure of the undersea Channel Tunnel today, halting all rail traffic, including passenger services, between France and Britain, the tunnel operator said.        
	No one died in the blaze, which started on a lorry carrying chemicals aboard the train, and all the 32 truck drivers on the shuttle were led to safety. There are no deaths. The truck drivers... were evacuated through the service tunnel, transport minister Dominique Bussereau said.        
	Officials in northern France said six people were slightly injured after inhaling fumes.

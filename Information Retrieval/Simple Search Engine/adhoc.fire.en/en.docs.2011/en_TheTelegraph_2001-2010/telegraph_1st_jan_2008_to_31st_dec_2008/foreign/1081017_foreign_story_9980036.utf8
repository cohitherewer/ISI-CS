                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Clashes halt UN aid in Lanka
                            
	Colombo, Oct. 16 (Reuters): A UN convoy carrying food and aid to more than 230,000 refugees in northern Sri Lanka was forced to turn back today due to artillery shelling and fighting, officials said.        
	The convoy was only the second to enter the war zone since the government last month ordered most aid agencies out, saying it could not guarantee their safety.        
	The 50-truck convoy had left Vavuniya, 250km northeast of Colombo, at noon carrying 750 metric tonnes of food to a growing number of people trapped by fighting between government forces and separatist Tamil Tiger rebels.        
	There was fighting close to the convoy and we decided to turn them back. Right now we are trying to get security assurances from both sides so we can start the process again tomorrow, UN spokesman Gordon Weiss in Colombo said.         
	The clashes came as the vehicles passed Pullyankulam, where it was due to turn east towards refugee camps.

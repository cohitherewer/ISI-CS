The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bangla verdict splits Bihari refugees 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bangla verdict splits Bihari refugees 
                            
	Dhaka, May 20 (Reuters): A court ruling to grant Bangladeshi citizenship to the children of stateless Bihari Muslims after 37 years in refugee camps has divided their community, with older Biharis still yearning to be allowed to settle in Pakistan.        
	Some 300,000 Urdu-speaking Biharis have lived in 66 squalid camps in Bangladesh since the former East Pakistan emerged as an independent country in 1971.        
	We endured a lot of pain at the camps. Now it is going to be over, we are Bangladeshis and will have equal rights, said 27-year-old Fatema Begum.        
	Crammed into the camps with poor sanitation, power supply and no healthcare or education, the refugees had hoped for years that Pakistan would take them to their chosen homeland.        
	But frustrated over the long delay, the new generation Biharis below the age of 37  who have been born and grown up in the camps  recently made a legal move to win them Bangladeshi citizenship. The high court granted them that right on Sunday.        
	This is a historic achievement. We had been waiting for decades, while living an inhuman life in the camps, said Sadakat Khan, president of the Stranded Pakistanis Youth Rehabilitation Movement.        
	Our people do not have access to government jobs, children cannot go to school. We cannot even open a bank account, he said at a Dhaka refugee camp. Why we should go to Pakistan? We dont belong to Pakistan. We dont want to go to Pakistan.        
	But many of the parents of the young Biharis opposed the long-sought privilege. We have full respect for the court but we reject its ruling. Pakistan is our home and we want to exercise our citizen rights only after going there, said Shoukat Ali, leader of the Stranded Pakistanis General Repatriation Committee.

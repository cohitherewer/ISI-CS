	London, May 30: David Beckham has bought a Californian vineyard as a birthday present for his wife Victoria, according to reports.         
	The England and LA Galaxy footballer is said to have paid a seven-figure sum for the Napa Valley winery which will be run by a specialist team.         
	The Sun reported that the couple, who became wine buffs while living in Spain when Beckham played for Real Madrid, plan to bottle their own top quality lines for themselves, friends and family.         
	The sportsman is said to have revealed the surprise by handing his Spice Girl wife a bottle with her name on the label during a day trip to a winery in the area last month.         
	Pictures on the Internet show the couple chatting and apparently taking photographs among rows of green vines during the excursion in which they were accompanied by celebrity friends Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Kate Beckinsale, Seal, among others.         
	The Beckhams look set to join a long line of celebrities cultivating grapes, including singer Cliff Richard  who makes wine in Portugal, British rocker Sting who has a site in Tuscany, Italy, and French actor Gerard Depardieu who helps run several estates in Bordeaux and Languedoc in France, Spain, Argentina and Morocco.         
	Dubbed the wine lovers Hollywood, Napa Valley has been attracting celebrity owners since the 1970s when film director Francis Ford Coppola bought land.

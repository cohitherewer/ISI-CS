	New York, Nov. 8 (PTI): US cyber intelligence experts suspect that a spate of attacks on the computer networks of White House and Pentagon was carried out by Chinese hackers.        
	However, according to a report in the Financial Times, they conceded that it was difficult to trace the exact source.        
	The Times quoted senior officials as saying that Chinese hackers had penetrated the White House computer network on multiple occasions and obtained emails between government officials.        
	We are getting very targeted Chinese attacks so it stretches credulity that these are not directed by government-related organisations, US governments cyber intelligence experts were quoted as saying.        
	They, however, conceded that it was extremely difficult to trace the exact source of an attack beyond a server in a particular country, the Times said.

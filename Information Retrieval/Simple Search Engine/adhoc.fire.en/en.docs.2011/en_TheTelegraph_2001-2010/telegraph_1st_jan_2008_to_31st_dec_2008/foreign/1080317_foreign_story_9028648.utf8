	March 16: During the 1989 Tiananmen revolt, Deng Xiaopings order to clear the Square before sunset came after a prolonged stand-off with the students.        
	High-level leaks showed that the Party elders hesitated before resorting to violence under the eyes of the world, in a way they would never have done under Mao Zedong.        
	In 2008, the year of the countrys coming out under the aegis of the Olympics, the Chinese have reason to hesitate even longer before submitting to the urge its leaders doubtlessly feel to impose order at any cost.         
	Even if access to Tibet is restricted for reporters, news of brutalities will inevitably get out, with incalculable consequences for the image of the new China.        
	What drove Deng to massacre hundreds of students was fear that the authority of the Communist Party itself was at stake. What would cause the Chinese to take drastic action in Lhasa now would be the territorial imperative  a feeling that foreigners were scheming against them, and their control of the province was in doubt.        
	For years the outside world has prevaricated, as they see it. When the Dalai Lama fled to India in the turmoil of 1959 the UN condemned the violation of Tibets human rights, but said nothing about its status.         
	In China, this has never been an issue. Even after the overthrow of the Manchu dynasty in the 1911 revolution, when China became a republic, it maintained its historic claims to the whole of the territory. So although eruptions against Chinese rule have been historically sporadic, the roots of conflict are long-standing.        
	Although it was Mao who brutally invaded the province in 1950, a year after the communists came to power, under his more benign successors, there has been no lessening of Chinas determination to maintain its rule.        
	It was Chinas current President, Hu Jintao, who furthered his career by energetically repressing an uprising early in 1989 in which 200 demonstrators were killed, months before Tiananmen.         
	Beijings leaders are relatively sophisticated folk who have travelled the world, but any suggestion that the West is questioning Chinas ownership of Tibet or has a say in how it should be governed is liable to evoke atavistic reactions. Hence the sensitivities  or pusillanimity  of many western governments in their attitude to the Dalai Lama.        
	In 1989, Deng Xiaoping said at one of the endless politburo meetings during Tiananmen that it was not human rights that were behind western support for the students, but an attempt to undermine Chinas sovereignty.        
	Beijing will nurse much the same suspicions now, especially party old-timers, who will see the outcry over Tibet in the western media as part of a strategy to derail Chinas drive towards superpower status.        
	Historically, so far as Britain is concerned, the conservatives have some excuse for their paranoia: it was after all British forces under Colonel Younghusband who first intruded into Lhasa in 1903-04, killing many in the process. Tibet had become embroiled in the great game played out between the Russian and British empires, of which Younghusbands expedition was a dramatic episode  a tale well told in Peter Flemings 1961 bestseller, Bayonets to Lhasa.

	London, Dec. 1: Talking on a hands-free mobile phone while driving is more dangerous than speaking to a passenger, a study suggests.         
	Researchers from the University of Utah analysed the performance of 41 motorists who drove a simulator for an eight-mile course while having a conversation on a hands-free mobile, a conversation with a partner in the car and no conversation.        
	They found that talking on the hands-free mobile had the most damaging effect on the drivers performances.        
	While talking on mobiles, drivers were more likely to drift in their lane and were four times more likely to miss their turning for the end of the journey. However, they did also tend to keep a greater distance between their car and the car in front. The drivers were mostly young adults and were of both sexes.        
	Research for the study, a full version of which appears in the December issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, was led by Dr Frank Drews, a psychologist at the University of Utah.        
	It comes after the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said road users were still being needlessly killed through the flouting of hand-held mobile phone rules five years after they were introduced.        
	A law banning the use of hand-held mobiles while driving was brought in on December 1, 2003. Last year, there were 23 fatal accidents, as well as 64 serious-injury and 259 slight-injury accidents, involving illegal mobile phone use by drivers.

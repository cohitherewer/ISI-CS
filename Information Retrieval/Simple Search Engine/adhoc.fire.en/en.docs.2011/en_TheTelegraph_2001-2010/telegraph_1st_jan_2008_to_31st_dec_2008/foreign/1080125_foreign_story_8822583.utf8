	Peeved by pet
  
	 London, Jan. 24 (Reuters): A British bus company has apologised to a girl who is led around on a leash by her boyfriend and describes herself as a human pet after one of its drivers threw her off a bus.
   
	Tasha Maltby, 19, told British newspapers she was the pet of her 25-year-old fiance Dani Graves. 
   
	Pictures showed her dressed in black Gothic-style clothing with silver buckles on a silver chain  which the driver of a bus from the firm Arriva took exception to.
   
	She told the Daily Mail newspaper yesterday that she was thrown off and told: We dont let freaks and dogs like you on. Arriva would not comment on specifics but said it apologised if the couple felt they had been discriminated against.

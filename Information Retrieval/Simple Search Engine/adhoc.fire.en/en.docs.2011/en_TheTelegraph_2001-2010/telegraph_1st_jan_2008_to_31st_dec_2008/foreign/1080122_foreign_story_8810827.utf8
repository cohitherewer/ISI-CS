	London, Jan. 21: It may explain that Monday morning feeling  research has found that Sunday is the most sleepless night of the week.
    
	Nearly 60 per cent of employees have their worst nights sleep of the week on Sundays, a survey claims, with restless nights forcing one in four to call in sick on a Monday.
    
	Disrupted sleep has also been blamed for a lack of concentration at work (46 per cent) on Mondays, increased irritability towards bosses (30 per cent) and the odd impromptu nap at the desk (20 per cent).
    
	The nationwide study of 3,500 adults, commissioned by the hotel chain Travelodge, found that Friday provided the best nights sleep, with eight in 10 people getting their least disrupted nights sleep at the end of the working week.
    
	Sixteen million adults claim that they suffer regularly from insomnia and most blame concerns over work for keeping them awake. Britons are said to lose an average of 51 minutes of sleep each night to worrying, a total of one months worth of sleep every year. Residents of Edinburgh are the biggest victims of work-related insomnia, with 47 per cent struggling to doze off every night.

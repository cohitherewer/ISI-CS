                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Polls give Obama a   6-point lead 
                                  
	Washington, Nov. 2 (Reuters): Democrat Barack Obamas lead over Republican rival John McCain firmed marginally to 6 points with support for both candidates steady before Tuesdays US presidential election, according to a Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll released today.        
	Obama leads McCain by 50 per cent to 44 per cent among likely voters in the three-day national tracking poll, up from a 5-point advantage yesterday. The telephone poll has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points.        
	There are two full days to go before election day and obviously anything can happen, but it is hard to see where McCain goes from here, pollster John Zogby said.        
	He said the polling data over the weekend showed that both candidates appeared to be consolidating support among their core supporters  women and independents for Obama, older voters and conservatives for McCain.        
	 Obama also appears to be outflanking McCain in a number of the battleground states that will end up deciding the election.        
	The poll showed Obama well ahead among voters who had already participated in early balloting, leading McCain in this group by 56 per cent to 39 per cent.

	Studenka (Czech Republic), Aug. 8 (Reuters): An international express train hit a collapsed bridge at high speed in the Czech Republic today, killing at least seven people and injuring about 70.        
	The EuroCity train, from the Polish city of Krakow to Prague, crashed at about 140 kmmph in Studenka, near the northeastern border with Poland. An international train from Krakow to Prague ran into a collapsed bridge which fell on the rails, said Czech Railways spokesman Radek Joklik.        
	Officials said six bodies were found in the wreckage and the CTK news agency reported that a seventh person, a Ukrainian, died in hospital. A rescue services spokesman said 13 were seriously hurt.

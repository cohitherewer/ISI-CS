                              Hudson: In mourning                            
	Chicago, Oct. 26 (Reuters): Chicago police yesterday asked the FBI to help find the missing 7-year-old nephew of Academy Award-winning actress and chart-topping singer Jennifer Hudson after her mother and brother were found shot dead a day earlier.        
	Julian King has been missing since Friday when Hudsons mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and brother Jason Hudson, 29, were found dead in Donersons south side Chicago home.        
	Let my baby go, Hudsons sister Julia told reporters. She appeared at a news conference along with the boys father, Greg King.        
	Chicago police spokesperson Daniel Brien said the FBI had been asked to help in the search in case the boy had been taken across state lines, in violation of federal kidnap laws.        
	Brien declined to confirm various media reports that the police had taken William Balfour into custody as a suspect in the double homicide investigation. Balfour, 27, had a relationship with Hudsons sister Julia but is not the father of the missing boy. Balfours mother said earlier her son and Julia were estranged and that he had nothing to do with the slayings.        
	The Illinois department of corrections website lists Balfour as having been convicted of attempted murder, car theft and vehicular hijacking. He was released from prison in 2006.        
	Brien said more than one person had been questioned but that no one had been charged with a crime. He did not release any names. On Friday, police spokesperson Monique Bond said of the murders: It appears to be domestic related.        
	Hudsons publicist appealed for privacy as she mourned the loss of her mother and brother.

	London, July 12: The Dark Knight has become the third-highest grossing film of all time in the US.         
	The latest instalment in the Batman series, which stars Christian Bale and the late Heath Ledger, sits atop the American charts for the fourth successive week after taking another $26.1 million at the weekend.        
	The widely acclaimed film, which has attracted controversy in Britain for its being awarded a 12A certificate despite containing depictions of graphic violence, is the first to enjoy a month-long stint in the American top slot since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in late 2003. The latest haul by the film also means it has now grossed a total of $441.5 million in the US, putting it behind only Titanic  $601 million  and the original Star Wars  $461 million  in the US all-time top ten.

	Lahore, March 11: Twenty-eight people were killed in two suicide blasts in Lahore today, one attack bearing chilling similarities to a bombing run in the Hollywood movie, The Siege.        
	The first explosion destroyed the federal headquarters of Pakistans premier probe agency and the second a house near Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) co-chairman Asif Ali Zardaris residence, Bilawal House.        
	 A suicide bomber drove a van loaded with 65kg of explosives into the premises of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) located on Temple Road and blew himself up at 9.23am (local time). The blast killed 24 people and left the seven-storey building in a shambles, officials said.        
	Among the injured were several children whose school was located near the FIA building. Interior ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema said the bomber at the FIA building killed 24 people, 12 of them agency staff.        
	The strike resembled a scene in The Siege, a 1998 film starring Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis, that dealt with a fictional situation in which New York was targeted by bombers. One attack blows up the FBIs counter-terrorism division in New York when a bomber drives an explosives-laden vehicle into the building.        
	In Lahore, around the same time the probe agency was attacked, two suicide bombers in a car struck in a mainly residential neighbourhood of the eastern city, about 10km away, killing four persons, including two children and the two bombers. In all, 170 people were wounded.        
	Were going through a very crucial phase of transition, Cheema told a news conference, referring to the new government. Perhaps, one answer could be that the terrorists are trying to put maximum pressure on the government that is in the making, he said.        
	The FIA focuses on illegal immigration and smuggling of people. It is now more obvious that the terrorists are targeting the law enforcement apparatus of the state, city police chief Malik Mohammad Iqbal told reporters.        
	Last week, a suicide bombing killed five persons in an attack on a navy college in Lahore. The latest blasts came as Opposition parties that won a February 18 election were forming a coalition government.        
	Police said the second car bomb blew up after it was stopped at the gate of an advertising agency office, near the Lahore home of Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Zardari, who led Bhuttos party to election victory last month, said this week the party would not flinch from a long fight against militancy.

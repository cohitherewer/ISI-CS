                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Maoist quit heat on Koirala
                              Koirala: Holding on                            
	Kathmandu, June 12 (AP): Maoist rebels quit Nepals interim government today in an effort to force Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala out and allow them to form a new administration.        
	According to analysts, the resignations were a pressure tactic by the former guerrillas so that the process of forming the government could be begun. The former rebels won the most seats in the April 10 elections to create a government to replace the interim administration that has run Nepal since 2006.        
	While they dont have a clear majority in the newly- elected Constituent Assembly, they do have enough support from other parties to form a coalition government.        
	But the Koirala of the rival Nepali Congress party has refused to step down and make way for a new government.        
	Women and social welfare minister Pampha Bhusal, a leading Maoist, said all five ministers from the party had resigned. We quit the government to help the process of forming a new government, Bhusal said.        
	The withdrawal from the interim government by the largest political party is likely to put pressure on Koirala. His office has not commented, and officials reached on the telephone said they have not heard anything from the Maoists and would not comment on media reports.        
	The Maoists are known for gathering thousands of people for demonstrations, but Bhusal said they had no plans to protest. We believe our resignation is enough to pave the way for formation of the new government, Bhusal said.        
	In the past, Nepals king, as head of state, would have forced the Prime Minister aside. But the monarchy was abolished last month by the Constituent Assembly, which is charged with governing Nepal while it rewrites the Constitution. Koirala is currently serving as both head of government and head of state. Since he controls the bureaucracy, the army and the police, there is no one to force him to resign.        
	The Prime Minister has not given a reason for refusing to step aside after his party lost the vote. But in the two months since the election, he has pushed to become President a post that is to be created by the Assembly. The Maoists have resisted, saying one of their members should fill the presidency.        
	Massacre probe        
	The Maoists today said the new Nepal government will launch a fresh probe into the 2001 palace massacre.        
	After the formation of the Maoist-led government, a probe commission will be formed to investigate the palace massacre as the Nepali people want an independent body to probe the incident, Maoist deputy leader Baburam Bhattarai said.         
	King Birendras entire family was killed in mysterious circumstances in the massacre after which Gyanendra became the monarch. The former king said in his statement yesterday that he had no role in the massacre, Bhattarai said.

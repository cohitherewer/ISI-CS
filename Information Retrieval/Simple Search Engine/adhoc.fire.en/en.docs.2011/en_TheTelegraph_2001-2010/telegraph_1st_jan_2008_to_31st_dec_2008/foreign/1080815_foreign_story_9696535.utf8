	London, Aug. 14: White Americans will be a minority in their country before the middle of the century, according to US government projections.         
	Higher birth rates among minority residents, especially Hispanics, is accelerating the demographic changes brought by immigration and will lead to an end of the USs white majority around 2042. The white population is older and very much centered around the ageing baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years, said William Frey, a demographer at a Washington think tank.        
	The Census Bureau released projections till 2050, based on rates for births, deaths and immigration. The USs 305 million population is expected to grow to 400 million in 2039 and 439 million in 2050. White non-Hispanics make up about two-thirds of the population, but only 55 per cent of those are younger than 5.         
	By 2050, whites will make up 46 per cent of the population and blacks will make up 15 per cent, a relatively small increase from today. Hispanic will account for 30 per cent in 2050, double their current share. Asians, who make up about 5 per cent of the population, are projected to increase to 9 per cent by 2050.

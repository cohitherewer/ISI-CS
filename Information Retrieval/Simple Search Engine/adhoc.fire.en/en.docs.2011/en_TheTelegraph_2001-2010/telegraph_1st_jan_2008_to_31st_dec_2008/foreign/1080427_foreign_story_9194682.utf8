The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US travel alert for China
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             US travel alert for China
                            
	Washington, April 26 (Reuters): The US government yesterday issued a travel alert for China, citing a higher risk of attacks within the country in the near future, including possibly at the Olympic Games in August.        
	Any large-scale public event such as the upcoming Olympic Games may present an attractive target for terrorists, the state department said in the alert.        
	There is a heightened risk that extremist groups will conduct terrorist acts within China in the near future, it said, urging Americans who live in China or travelling there to be cautious in hotels, restaurants, on public transportation, and in areas of large public gatherings. It also urged US citizens to avoid demonstrations.         
	Chinese commanders this month told the countrys paramilitary forces to ensure domestic stability and guard against any security threats that could upset the Games. China Peoples Armed Police is deployed to quell riots and unrest, and has been heavily involved in cracking down on protest and riots against Chinese policies and influence that shook the region from mid-March.

                          Anwar                    
	Kuala Lumpur, June 29 (Reuters): Malaysias de facto Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim took refuge at the Turkish embassy today because of fears he could be assassinated after fresh accusations of sodomy.        
	The developments come at a time of heightened political tension in Malaysia after the governments worst ever election result earlier this year put pressure on Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to quit.        
	Anwar, who was sacked as deputy Prime Minister in 1998 and later jailed for sodomy and corruption, has seen a revival of his fortunes since the Opposition alliances strong showing in the March election. Anwar has said the old charges were trumped up. The new accusations, he says, were politically motivated.        
	I was transported to the embassy earlier this morning fearing that my personal safety was in danger, Anwar said in a statement.        
	I have been told that my assassination has not been ruled out as a means to subvert the peoples will and bring an end to the transformational changes taking place in Malaysia, he said.        
	Anwar says he has won enough support from ruling coalition lawmakers to form a new government by September, which has sparked fears of policy shifts and unsettled investors.        
	Anwar has said he would alter oil-production sharing contracts, cut fuel prices, introduce minimum wages and redistribute oil wealth to the poor.        
	With grumblings within the ruling coalition, most probably Abdullahs days are numbered, said political analyst Yahya Ismail. So the government must find ways to cripple the Opposition.        
	The new sodomy allegations arose when Anwars private assistant, identified by Anwars party as 23-year-old Saiful Bukhari Azlan, lodged a police complaint.        
	A statement from Anwar dismissed the charge as complete fabrication.

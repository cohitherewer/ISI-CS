	London, July 29: Carla Bruni has likened herself to Jackie Kennedy Onassis, another First Lady who achieved style icon status.         
	The former model and wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy said she welcomed comparisons to the woman who brought glamour to the White House alongside her husband, John F. Kennedy.        
	She was so young and modern, and of course unconsciously I would project myself more like Jackie Kennedy than, for instance, Madame de Gaulle, who would be much more like the classical French woman behind her husband, Bruni said. There is a great photograph of Madame de Gaulle serving soup to her husband. I do serve soup to my husband sometimes, but I wouldnt get photographed that way.        
	Her choice of outfits for a state visit to Britain, from pill box hats to chic Dior suits, drew immediate comparisons with Kennedy Onassis. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Bruni disclosed that she and Sarkozy are trying for a baby. Bruni already has a seven-year-old son, Aurelien, from a previous relationship.

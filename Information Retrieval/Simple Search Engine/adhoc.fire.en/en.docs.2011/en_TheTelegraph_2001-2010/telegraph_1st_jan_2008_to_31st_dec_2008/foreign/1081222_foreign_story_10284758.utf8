	Dhaka, Dec. 21 (PTI): Bangladesh today beefed up security for former Premier and Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina after Indian intelligence agencies warned that an outlawed militant groups suicide squad trained by an ISI operative planned to assassinate her before the December 29 polls.        
	We are yet to get any information officially from India, but steps have been taken to further intensify her personal security, inspector-general of police Noor Mohammad said, a day after CNN-IBN news channel reported that a six-member team of Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami (Huji) was specially trained to kill her.        
	Additional director general of Rapid Action Battalion Colonel Gulzaruddin Ahmed said the anti-crime agency took the report on the assassination plan seriously and we have already ordered an intensified vigil on the militants.        
	Hasina was told about the threat to her life but she continued her election campaign today in northern Tangail district where she said: I am not afraid of death.         
	I survived the (August 21, 2004) grenade attack earlier but I will never bow down to anybody other than Allah, she said.        
	The CNN-IBN had reported that Hasina was warned that a Huji suicide squad planned to kill her. It said the team had been trained under a former Pakistani special forces officer named Ehetesham at a camp held in Satkhira district for the last two months.        
	Home ministry sources said chief adviser of the outgoing interim government Fakhruddin Ahmed was already informed about the threat on Hasina while the Special Security Force (SSF), which was deployed last month for the protection of Hasina and her arch rival Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh Nationalist Party, tightened the security measures.        
	The report came as Bangladesh last month ordered extra security cautions for Hasina as she was feared to be exposed to critical security risks for years after she survived an abortive attempt.        
	The home adviser of the interim government, retired Major General M.A. Matin, last month asked authorities to take precautions in providing security guards for the ex-Premier ahead of the December 29 polls while officials said she had also been informed about her exposure to the security risks.        
	The SSF, trained specially for providing security to the VVIPS including the President and the Prime Minister, retook the charge of security of Hasina and Zia last month, 20 months after they were stripped off the privilege.        
	Hasina narrowly survived a grenade attack on August 21, 2004 by suspected Huji militants when 24 people, including Awami League leader Ivy Rahman, were killed and some 400 injured.

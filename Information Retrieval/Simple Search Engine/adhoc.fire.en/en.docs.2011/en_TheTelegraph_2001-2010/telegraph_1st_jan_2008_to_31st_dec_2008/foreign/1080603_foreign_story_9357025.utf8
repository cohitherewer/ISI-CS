                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Danish embassy bombing in Pak kills 8

	Islamabad, June 2: A suspected suicide bomber blew up a car outside the Denmark embassy in Islamabad killing eight people and injuring 28 today.         
	The state-run Pakistan Television put the death toll at eight, which could not be confirmed either from the local administration officials or the interior ministry.         
	This was the second major terror attack in Islamabad since March 15 when a bomb blast ripped through an Italian restaurant killing a Turkish woman and injuring several local and foreign nationals.         
	The blast was so intense that it created a deep crater near the front gate of the Danish embassy. Eight people were killed and more than two dozen injured in the blast, a local police official said.         
	The bomb blast smashed windows of nearby homes in an upmarket district of Islamabad where other missions and diplomats houses are located.        
	There were disturbing scenes in the Federal Government Services hospital where relatives of the victims wailed in anguish as bloodstained bodies were brought in by shrieking ambulances.        
	The blast will raise fresh questions about the safety of foreigners in Pakistan, even though militant attacks have dropped off since a new government came to power after a February general election vowing to negotiate an end to violence.         
	 Pakistani officials were investigating if it was a suicide bombing. Police believe the attacker used fake diplomatic license plates. Interior secretary Kamal Shah said evidence showed the car was a Toyota Corolla carrying 25 kg of high explosives.        
	Theres no doubt it was a car blast. It would be premature to say it was a suicide attack, Shah told reporters near the embassy.        
	The blast, which came just after 0700 GMT, destroyed the embassy gate and damaged the front of the building and vehicles in the compound. It also caused extensive damage to nearby buildings and vehicles. Police and security officials said all the dead and wounded were Pakistanis.        
	Rizwan Sheikh, a planning specialist for the UN-funded group, Devolution Trust for Community Empowerment, said he was at his desk when he heard the explosion. Pieces of windows, doors and glass hit me, but thank God I didnt get any injuries, he said. Outside the building it was a doomsday scene. Everybody was running helter-skelter. I saw people crying. I saw blood. I saw human body parts.        
	A car engine was lying about 10 metres from the crater. Residents said they had feared an attack on the mission. Since the printing of the cartoons, we always had this fear, said Sana Khalid, a woman living in the area. But after what they did to our religion, they deserve it.        
	 Pakistani authorities said they were stepping up security at embassies and police were on alert in other cities.        
	The blast coincided with an anti-cartoon rally in the city of Multan attended by about 200 people.        
	 After hearing news of the bomb, some protesters shouted: Whoever commits blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammad will face more serious consequences than this, said city cleric Intizar Hussain.

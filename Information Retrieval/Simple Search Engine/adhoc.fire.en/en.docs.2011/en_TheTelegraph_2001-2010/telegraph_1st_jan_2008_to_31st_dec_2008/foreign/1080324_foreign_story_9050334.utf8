          ADAM LUSHER                          NOT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH                                  
	London, March 23: It started with two students in a garage and became a 100 billion giant relied upon by 60 per cent of Internet users.        
	Now, one of the men at the heart of the Google empire has disclosed the secrets behind its rise from almost nothing 10 years ago to the worlds most popular search engine, the fifth-largest company on the New York Stock Exchange and a global brand worth twice as much as Coca-Cola.        
	Charlie Ayers has revealed that from the beginning, Google was based not just on groundbreaking computer technology, but on a revolutionary approach to food in the staff canteen.        
	He was hired by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Googles founders, in the belief that like a Napoleonic army, an Internet giant marches on its stomach. As Googles first chef, his mission was to seduce an unruly gaggle of brilliant but wayward computer engineers into wanting to stay at the office. His success, he said, meant Googles rise to the top was fuelled by free beer, barbecues and rum.        
	It began in 1998, when Page and Brin started Google in a friends garage near Stanford University in California. A few months later, they recruited Ayers. Now 42, he remembers: They said: We are not going to charge for food here, ever.        
	I said: Thats crazy. They explained my job was to create this ambience, to build this captivated audience where people wanted to come in super-early and stay super-late. They interviewed me above a bicycle shop.        
	They thought they were going to go global. I thought: Good luck. The way they were playing with childrens toys, I had no idea they were doing any work.        
	He signed up, however, and started easing the computer engineers into the long hours culture with innovations including free beer and fortnightly big ass barbecues, and breakfast specials. He converted the googlers to a diet that ensured they kept working after lunch.        
	As explained in his new book, Eat Yourself Smart, his faith in the profit-making power of raw food extended to generous offerings of sushi  the fat found in fish helps make the cell membranes round the brain more elastic and more able to absorb nutrients easily.

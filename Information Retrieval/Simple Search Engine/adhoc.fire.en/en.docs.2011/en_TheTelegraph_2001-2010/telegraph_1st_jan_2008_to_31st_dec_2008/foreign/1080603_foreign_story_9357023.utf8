	Macca bigger    
	 Liverpool, June 2 (AFP): Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney sang yesterday in front of 36,000 fans in his home city of Liverpool  this years European capital of culture.      
	The four-hour concert was held at the Anfield stadium, home of the Liverpool Football Club.      
	Being European capital of culture is a good thing, McCartney said. About 12 years ago, Liverpool was a bit on its knees  it was not in good shape at all. But now theres quite a resurgence.      
	We are here for Macca, 62-year-old Brenda Baily, who was attending the concert with Maureen McCarthy, 66, said. He is a legend. We saw Ringo in January, but Macca is even bigger.    
	Wind gone    
	 London (AP): Gone With the Wind will soon be gone at least in London where a musical version of the famous novel and movie has failed to draw large crowds. Producers say the musical will close three months ahead of schedule on June 14 because of poor ticket sales. Londons critics savaged the stage version when it opened in April and poor word-ofmouth dampened interest in the project. The book, lyrics and music were all written by Margaret Martin, a Los Angeles writer making her first venture into musical theatre. An earlier musical version staged 30 years ago also flopped. But the 1939 movie starring Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable remains tremendously popular.    
	Huge towel    
	 Nicosia, Cyprus (PTI): A local body here manufactured the worlds largest sea towel, in an attempt to set a new world record for the Guinness World Records. Paralimni municipality on the eastern coast, which made the worlds largest sea towel, also want to make the surrounding area a popular holiday resort. On Sunday, the towel measuring 64 metres by 31 meters was spread out on the golden beach of Fig Tree Bay, covering up an area of 1900 square metres. Around 100 people worked on the project.     
	Star Stand    
	 London (Reuters): American R amp;B singer and actor Usher is sitting pretty at the top of the album charts after going straight in at number one with Here I Stand, the Official UK Charts Company said. The Tennessee-born performer, who began singing in his local church choir as a child, kept Welsh singer Aimee Anne Duffy, known as Duffy, off the top spot. She moved up one place from three to number two .

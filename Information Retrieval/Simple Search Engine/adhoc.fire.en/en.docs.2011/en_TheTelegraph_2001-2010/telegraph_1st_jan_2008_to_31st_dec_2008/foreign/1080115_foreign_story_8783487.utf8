	Kathmandu, Jan. 14 (Reuters): Thousands of supporters of Nepals seven-party ruling alliance, including Maoist former rebels, marched through Kathmandu today in a rare display of unity in the fractious coalition against the Hindu monarchy.
    
	However, a bomb explosion injured five persons at the rally. Police official Uma Chaturbedi said witnesses saw someone toss the bomb out of a car and into the crowd as it was breaking up. No one has claimed responsibility.
    
	The rally, held in a dust-choked playground in the heart of the capital, less than 500 metres from King Gyanendras sprawling palace, came three days after the government set national elections for April 10.
    
	The polls are meant to elect a Constituent Assembly to map the nations political future and formalise a recent parliament decision to abolish the monarchy after the vote.
    
	Originally, the Assembly was meant to decide the fate of the monarchy  a question now settled in a political deal with the former rebels who wanted its immediate abolition. That body will also replace the interim parliament.
    
	This rally is to demonstrate our commitment not to postpone the elections again, said Sunil Prajapati, leader of the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, a junior partner.
    
	The vote was last set for November 22 but was delayed because of a deadlock with the Maoists who wanted the king to be booted out before the polls. Maoist chief Prachanda similar meetings would be held across the country.

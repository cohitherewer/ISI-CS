	Deothang (Bhutan), Dec. 31 (Reuters): The Bhutanese people began voting today to elect members to a new upper house of parliament for the first time, a step towards democracy after a century of absolute monarchy.
    
	The tiny Himalayan kingdom has been preparing for democracy since former monarch Jigme Singye Wangchuck decided to hand power to an elected government, even as many of his citizens said they were quite happy with the way things were.
    
	Todays vote is only the first step, and it has not been without its problems  the election commission has acknowledged an unspecified number of complaints from eligible voters saying they have been unable to vote because of bureaucratic glitches.
    
	More important polls are expected to take place in February and March with elections to the lower house, when newly-formed political parties will be able to take part.
    
	In todays election, many candidates are fresh-faced 20-somethings, at least partly because of rules requiring all candidates be university graduates.
    
	All three candidates in Samdrup-Jongkhar, a district in the south, are under 30.
    
	Jigme Wangchuk, 28, is giving up teaching for politics. He is running against Sangay Lhendup, a 25-year-old stand-up comedian and political science graduate. Both hope to beat Kuenga Dorji, a 25-year-old actor with good looks and a nice singing voice.
    
	All three are promising development for this quiet nation of farmers and monks.
    
	Voters had been queuing up since 0200 GMT, all dressed, as is compulsory, in traditional Bhutanese costume  gowns for the men and long dresses for the women, some of whom were carrying babies.
    
	Democracy will be good for the younger generation, with a lot of developments taking place and there will be a lot of job opportunities, said Kuenzeng Choden, a 20-year-old trainee teacher outside Deothang town and one of Bhutans 312,817 voters.
    
	But at another station visited by Reuters today there were at least 25 people who complained they were eligible to vote but denied their franchise because of paperwork problems.
    
	I was not allowed to vote for no fault of mine, and I am very sad, said Yeshi Jamtsho, a 31-year-old carpenter, outside a polling station in Deothang. He said six of his family members were eligible to vote, but only four had got their voter cards.
    
	We have faced some logistical problems, said Kunzang Wangdi, the chief election commissioner, speaking by phone from Thimpu, the capital. Some people applied for their voter cards quite late so they could not receive them on time.
    
	The country has temporarily closed its borders as authorities fear exiled ethnic Nepali rebels, who Bhutan believes to be backed by Maoists in Nepal, could cause trouble.
    
	Tens of thousands of ethnic Nepalis fled Bhutan or were expelled in 1991 for protesting against discrimination and demanding democracy.
    
	Many of those that remain have been denied citizenship and voting rights. 
    
	For some, todays vote was an unhappy reminder of those differences.
    
	We are not terrorists, said Dorji, an ethnic-Nepali shop worker who lives in Samdrup-Jongkhar, the district capital on the Indian border. We want to live in peace in Bhutan but we have not been allowed to vote and we are treated as outsiders.
    
	The National Council, as it will be known, will have 25 members, who are barred from joining political parties.
    
	Five members will be chosen by the present monarch, King Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck, the 27-year-old Oxford graduate who took over from his father in 2006.
    
	Bhutans 312,817 voters will choose the remaining 20. But five districts failed to nominate even a single candidate in time for todays polls.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bar not to hit doctors in Britain
                                                                                                            Bar not to hit doctors in Britain
                            
	London, Feb. 7 (PTI): Doctors from India and other Commonwealth countries will be barred from coming to Britain for training and subsequent recruitment in the National Health Service under new immigration rules coming into force from February 29.        
	However, according to the president of the British Association of Physcians of Indian Origin, Ramesh Mehta, Indian doctors can come for service jobs.        
	Mehta said the new home office rules make it clear to international medical graduates that it would be difficult for them to obtain post graduate training in Britain.         
	However, the rights of those graduates who are already in Britain will be protected. The new rules, coming into effect from February 29, will not affect recruitment till 2009.

	London, April 11: A luckless Bulgarian farmer who was been married three times has decided to try his hand at marriage one last time  with a goat.         
	Stoil Panayotov exchanged his third wife with Elena the eight-year-old goat at a livestock market in March  because she couldnt provide him with a child.         
	The extraordinary deal was concluded in front of a stunned crowd in the market town of Plovdiv, central Bulgaria. The day before a friend told me that he has had no luck with women and that he really liked my wife, says the 54-year-old. The deal was reached when my wife gave her approval.        
	The goat has given birth to three kids and my wife to none. So this deal was more profitable to the goat owner, I got a second-hand goat and he got a brand new wife.         
	Last year, the marriage of a man and a Sudanese goat became the subject of international attention when the story was picked up by the BBC website.         
	The black and white goat named Rose became an internet phenomenon after her owner discovered the man, Charles Tombe, copulating with the animal.         
	In accordance with Sudanese tradition, Tombe was forced to marry Rose and pay a dowry of 15,000 Sudanese dinars (25). Rose has since died after choking on a plastic bag while eating scraps on the streets of Juba.         
	In Tamil Nadu last year, a man also made the headlines after marrying a dog on the advice of his astrologer.         
	P. Selvakumar, a 33-year-old Tamil farm labourer, believed he had been cursed after stoning two dogs to death more than 20 years ago.

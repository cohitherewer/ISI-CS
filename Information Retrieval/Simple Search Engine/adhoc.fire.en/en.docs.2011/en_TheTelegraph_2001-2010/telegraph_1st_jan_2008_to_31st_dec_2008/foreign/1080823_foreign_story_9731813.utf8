	Kathmandu, Aug. 22: The first Maoist-led government in Nepal was sworn in today amid controversy with key ally CPN (UML) boycotting the ceremony following differences with the former rebels over ministerial hierarchy.         
	Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal alias Prachanda administered the oath of office to eight ministers  four from his own party and four from the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (MJF).         
	However, six ministerial candidates belonging to the CPN (UML) stormed out of the venue when the Maoists said their leader, Baburam Bhattarai, would officiate as the head of the government in the absence of Prachanda, who is slated to leave for Beijing tomorrow to attend the Olympics closing ceremony.         
	The CPN (UML) claimed that the Maoists had agreed to give the deputy Prime Ministers post to its leader, Bam Dev Gautam.         
	CPN (UML) deputy parliamentary leader Bishnu Poudel said his party would not join the government if the Maoists stuck to their stand.         
	He said Gautam deserved to be number two in the new government as he had already served a term as the deputy Prime Minister.         
	However, Maoist leader Dev Prasad Gurung said the matter of protocol was merely technical. The issue will be sorted out after the Prime Minister returns, he said.         
	The Maoists deferred the swearing-in for a couple of hours to convene a meeting of the ruling coalition and resolve the issue. However, the meeting, which was attended by senior Maoist, CPN(UML) and MJF leaders, failed to come to an agreement on the hierarchy row even after finalising portfolios of the new ministers.         
	Despite the walkout by the CPN (UML) team led by Gautam, Prachanda decided to go ahead with the swearing-in.        
	The four new ministers from the Maoists side are Babu Ram Bhattarai (finance), Ram Bahadur Thapa Badal (defence), Dev Gurung (law, justice) and Krishna Bahadur Mahara (information and communication). The ministers from the MJF are party chairman Upendra Yadav (foreign affairs), Bijay Kumar Gachhadar (works and transport), Jay Prakash Gupta (agriculture) and Renu Yadav (education).

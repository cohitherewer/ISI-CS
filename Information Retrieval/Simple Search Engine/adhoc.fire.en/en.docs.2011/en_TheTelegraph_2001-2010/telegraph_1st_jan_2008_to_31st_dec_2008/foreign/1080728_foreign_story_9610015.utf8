                              Jobs                            
	Los Angeles, July 27 (Reuters): Apple Inc CEO Steve Jobs, who has been dogged by investor concerns about his health, does not have recurrent cancer or a life-threatening health issue, The New York Times reported on yesterday.        
	While his health problems amounted to a good deal more than a common bug, they werent life-threatening and he doesnt have a recurrence of cancer, journalist Joe Nocera wrote in a column.        
	Nocera said he spoke to the Apple CEO about his health.        
	Because the conversation was off the record, I cannot disclose what Mr Jobs told me, Nocera said.        
	In 2004, Jobs, 53, announced he had undergone successful surgery to remove a rare type of pancreatic cancer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Double boost to Obama
                                                                                                            Double boost to Obama
          K.P. NAYAR                            Obama and Caroline                                 
	Washington, Jan. 27: An incendiary first phase of the US presidential primaries ended last night with Barack Obama steadily catching up with Hillary Clinton in the quest for delegates for the Democratic national convention that will choose the partys nominee in August.        
	When the votes were counted in the Black vs White primary in South Carolina last night, Obama, the Senator from Illinois, had 167 national delegates against New York Senator Clintons tally so far of 249.        
	Obama won in South Carolina -- where roughly half the voters were black -- with 55 per cent against Clintons 27 per cent.        
	The campaign now takes a national turn spreading across the US and in 10 days 24 states will choose their delegates to the nominating conventions of either party.        
	The voting in primaries in both parties has hitherto somewhat resembled Indias vote bank politics.        
	Blacks have voted for Obama, whose father was of Kenyan descent, and women favoured Clinton, winning two states for her.        
	On the Republican side, Mormons voted heavily for the only Mormon candidate in the presidential race, bagging Nevada for former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.        
	Similarly, any faint hope that former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani can remain viable in the contest comes from the choice by thousands of New Yorker retirees who live in Florida.        
	Florida, which will have its Republican primary on Tuesday, has three million people above 65 out of a population of 18 million.        
	The Kennedy magic dramatically entered the 2008 presidential contest today when Caroline Kennedy, John F. Kennedys daughter, endorsed Obama in an op-ed article in The New York Times.        
	All my life, people have told me that my father changed their lives, that they got involved in public service or politics because he asked them to, wrote Caroline, who was six when her father was assassinated.        
	Black and white pictures of this little girl at JFKs funeral still choke up Americans. Singer-songwriter Neil Diamond wrote the hit Sweet Caroline after being inspired by a photo during the Kennedy presidency of little Caroline on her pony.        
	 Caroline has not endorsed any candidate since 1980, when her uncle, Senator Edward Kennedy ran for President.        
	I have never had a President who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them. But for the first time, I believe I have found the man who could be that President  not just for me, but for a new generation of Americans, Caroline wrote of Obama.        
	The patriarch of the Kennedy family, Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy, is set to endorse Obama at a rally on Monday.        
	Four of JFKs brother and assassinated presidential candidate Robert Kennedys 11 children are, however, supporting Clinton.        
	The eldest, RFK Jr., is a noted environmentalist while Kathleen Kennedy-Townsend was Marylands lieutenant governor.        
	Kerry Kennedy was married to New Yorks attorney-general Andrew Cuomo until recently while Rory Kennedy, the youngest, is an acclaimed film-maker.        
	Obama himself is being increasingly called Black Kennedy because he often talks about the Kennedy era on the stump.        
	Analysts have also commented on Obamas narrow ties and old-style suits that are reminiscent of the 1960s than the 21st century.        
	Clintons husband, former president Bill Clinton, played a key, if controversial, role on behalf of his wife in the South Carolina primary.        
	The former President was often accused of playing the race card against Obama, hoping to trap the Senator into being pigeon-holed as the Black candidate in the hope of winning the larger White votes across the US.         
	They are getting votes, to be sure, because of their race or gender, Bill Clinton said in the final phase of campaigning in South Carolina.        
	That is why people tell me Hillary doesnt have a chance of winning here.

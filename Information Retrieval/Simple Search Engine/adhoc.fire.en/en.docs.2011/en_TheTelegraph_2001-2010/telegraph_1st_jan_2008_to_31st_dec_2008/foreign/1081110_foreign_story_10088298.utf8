The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Al Qaida to unleash terror in UK: Report
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Al Qaida to unleash terror in UK: Report

	London, Nov. 9: Secret enclaves of al Qaida extremists based in London, Birmingham and Luton are planning mass-casualty attacks in Britain, according to a leaked government intelligence report.         
	The document, which was drawn up by the intelligence branch of the ministry of defence, MI5, and Special Branch, states that some thousands of extremists are active in the UK. They are predominantly UK-born and aged between 18 and 30, and many are believed to have been trained in overseas terrorist camps.         
	Under the heading International Terrorism, the report, which is marked restricted states: For the foreseeable future the UK will continue to be a high-priority target for international terrorists aligned with al Qaida. It will face a threat from British nationals, including Muslim converts, and UK-based foreign terrorists, as well as terrorists planning attacks from abroad.        
	The report states that the threat from the Islamist extremist community in the UK is diverse and widely distributed but adds that the number of terrorists in Britain is difficult to judge.         
	The document does state, however, that the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which is based in MI5s headquarters at Thames House in London, estimates that there are some thousands of extremists in the UK committed to supporting Jihadi activities, either in the UK or abroad.         
	A year ago Jonathan Evans, the director general of MI5, said in a speech that his organisation had identified that there were at least 2,000 individuals who posed a threat to national security and public safety. Since 2001, over 1,200 terrorist suspects have been arrested, over 140 have been charged and more than 45 have been convicted of terrorism offences, according to Home Office figures.         
	It is also estimated that there are some 200 terrorist networks functioning in Britain today who are involved in at least 30 plots. But this latest security assessment appears to suggest that the number of individuals who now pose a threat to the UK is even higher.         
	The report continues: The majority of extremists are British nationals of south Asian, mainly Pakistani origin but there are also extremists from north and east Africa, Iraq and the Middle East, and a number of converts. The overwhelming majority of extremists are male, typically in the 18-30 age range.         
	The main extremist concentrations are in London, Birmingham, with significant extremist networks in the South East, notably Luton. Extremist networks are principally engaged in spreading their extremist message, training, fund raising and procuring non-lethal military equipment to support the Jihads in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq, and sending recruits to the conflicts.         
	UK-based extremists, either under the direction of al Qaida, or inspired by al-Qaidas ideology of global Jihad, have also engaged in attack planning in the UK.         
	Although the document specifically names London, Birmingham and southeast England as areas of extremist activity, MI5 believe that the threat posed by Islamist extremists comes from across the UK.         
	The report adds: The availability of training/guidance and the necessary components to build improvised explosive devices (IED), allied with extremists known targeting preferences, mean that IED attacks against crowded places, intended to cause mass casualties, are the most likely form of attack in the UK.

	Roanoke (Virginia), April 11 (AP): Most families of victims of the mass shootings at Virginia Tech that left 33 people dead have agreed to an $11 million state settlement that will compensate families who lost loved ones, pay survivors medical costs and avoid a court battle over whether anyone besides the gunman was to blame.        
	Virginia Governor Timothy M. Kaine said yesterday that a substantial majority of families of victims of the shootings agreed to the settlement.        
	Peter Grenier and Douglas Fierberg, who represent 21 families, said the settlement was worth more than $11 million, but neither they nor the governor would discuss its terms until final papers are drawn in a few days.        
	Grenier and Fierberg said seriously injured victims will be well compensated and have their health care needs taken care of forever, and that families who lost loved ones would be similarly compensated and cared for.        
	We want to make sure the settlement is fiscally responsible for the commonwealth, Kaine said, but its kind of a fair balance of a variety of interests. Kaine called the agreement very positive, but noted that families who have not agreed to it still could file suit. Notice must be filed by April 16.

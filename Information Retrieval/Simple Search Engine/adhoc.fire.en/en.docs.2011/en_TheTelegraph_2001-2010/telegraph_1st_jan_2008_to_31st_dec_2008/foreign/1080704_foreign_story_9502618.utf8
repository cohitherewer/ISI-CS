	London, July 3: Two French exchange students visiting London were stabbed 243 times, tied up, gagged and burnt in one of the most frenzied, brutal and horrific murders ever investigated by Scotland Yard.         
	Laurent Bonomo with his fiancee Mary Bertez-Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez, both 23, were tortured in an attack that may have lasted for several hours at a southeast London flat. They were then doused in an accelerant and the bedsit was firebombed in an attempt to hide the evidence.         
	The murder has both shocked and mystified Scotland Yard. Detectives are at a loss to explain why anyone would target the young scientists, who were described as two of the brightest students of their generation and were due to return home later this month after a three month internship at Imperial College.

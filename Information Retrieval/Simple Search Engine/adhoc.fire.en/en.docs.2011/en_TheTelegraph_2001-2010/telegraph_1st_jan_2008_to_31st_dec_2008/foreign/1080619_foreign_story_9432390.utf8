The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama in scarf row
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obama in scarf row
                            
	Detroit, June 18 (AP): A young Muslim woman said she and another woman were refused seats directly behind Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama  and in front of TV cameras  at a Detroit rally because they wear head scarfs.        
	Hebba Aref said today that she and Shimaa Abdelfadeel were among 20,000 supporters who gathered to see Obama on Monday at the Joe Louis Arena when the groups they were with were separately invited by Obama campaign workers to sit behind the podium. But Aref said the campaign workers told members of both parties in separate discussions that women wearing hijabs, the traditional Muslim head scarves, were not included in the invitation and could not sit behind the podium.        
	Aref, a 25-year-old lawyer, said a member of her group was told by a campaign worker that she could not invite Aref because of a sensitive political climate.        
	Obama spokesman Bill Burton issued a statement saying such actions are quot;not the policy of the campaign. It is offensive and counter to Obamas commitment to bring Americans together and simply not the kind of campaign we run. We sincerely apologise for this behaviour, the statement read.        
	Aref said she replied by thanking Burton, but requested Obama apologise directly to her and Abdelfadeel, as well as invitations to sit behind him at a future campaign event.         
	He needs to take the matter seriously and send a strong message against any kind of discrimination, Aref said.

	London, Dec. 11: Fourteen suspected Islamic extremists thought to have links to al Qaida, including three feared to have been planning a suicide attack, have been detained in Belgium, police have said.         
	It is thought that the target of the suspected attack could have been a two-day EU leaders summit, according to unnamed justice sources quoted on the website of the broadcaster RTBF. Police detained the suspects after searching more than a dozen locations in Brussels and Liege overnight.         
	Federal prosecutors are believed to have detained the suspects purely as a preventive measure. The inquiry and susbsequent raids have been described as the most important anti-terrorism operation in Belgium.         
	The suspects have been linked to a Belgian Islamist group involved in training and fighting on the Pakistan-Afghan border, in liaison with important figures in al Qaida.

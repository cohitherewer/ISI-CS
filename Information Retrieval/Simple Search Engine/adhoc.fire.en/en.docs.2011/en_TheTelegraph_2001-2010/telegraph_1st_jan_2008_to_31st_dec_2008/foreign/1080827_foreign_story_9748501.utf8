	Compass cows    
	 London, Aug. 26: Cows automatically point to the north because they have their own in-built compasses aligning them with the Earths magnetic field, scientists have discovered, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Researchers discovered that cattle have a good sense of direction and tend to point in a northerly direction.       
	It has long been observed that cows appear to have a talent for weather forecasting and are able to predict when rain is on the way, but until now their navigational abilities have been largely ignored.       
	Their innate ability to find north is believed to be a relic from the days when their wild ancestors needed an accurate sense of direction to migrate across the plains of Africa, Asia and Europe.     
	Fest coup     
	 Venice (AP): Anyone would call it a coup to get George Clooney and Brad Pitt in the same place at the same time, what with Pitts schedule now including the care of newborn twins. The pair will appear together not once, but twice, at the Venice Film Festival  first at a fundraising event for their charity Not On Our Watch. They will be back on the red carpet on Wednesday when the Coen brothers film Burn After Reading opens the 65th edition of the festival, which runs till September 6.

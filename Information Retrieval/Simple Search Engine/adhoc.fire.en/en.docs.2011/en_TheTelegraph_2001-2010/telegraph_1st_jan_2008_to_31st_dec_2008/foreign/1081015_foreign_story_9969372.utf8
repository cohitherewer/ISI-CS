          URMEE KHAN                          Beckham: Foul play victim?                                  
	London, Oct. 14: Two housekeepers working for David and Victoria Beckham have denied stealing items from the celebrity couples home to sell on eBay.         
	Victorias parents contacted police after recognising items offered for sale on Ebay, an Internet auction site.         
	June Emmett, 56, and her husband Eric, 55, both work at the Beckhams multi-million pound mansion in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire. The house is better known as Beckingham Palace.         
	Emmett, speaking from the doorstep of their home, said she wanted to clear our names.        
	Her husband said: Its totally fabricated, we have been advised by our solicitor not to comment until this is all sorted out.         
	What is in the papers is fabricated nonsense. Totally fabricated, 99 per cent of it is totally untrue he added.         
	Hertfordshire police arrested the housekeepers at their home in Nazeing, Essex on Friday. The couple are thought to have worked for the Beckhams for 10 years.         
	A source said Victorias parents, Tony and Jackie Adams, recognised the allegedly stolen items immediately because many of them were unique.

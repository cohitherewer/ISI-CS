          WILL STEWART                          Putin                                  
	Moscow, March 16: Russian secret services have foiled an attack on President Vladimir Putin close to Red Square, it has been claimed.        
	A man with a sniper rifle and Kalashnikov assault gun was found and detained in a rented apartment overlooking Moscows St Basils Cathedral, on March 2, the day of presidential election in Russia.        
	Putin and his President- elect, Dmitry Medvedev, appeared under the cathedral for a late-night pop concert once early results indicated that Medvedev would win a landslide.        
	The popular Tvoi Den newspaper, which broke the story, claimed that both men could have been killed from the flat which was in the line of sight of a stage where they appeared.         
	The gunman was named by the newspaper as Shakhvelad Osmanov, a 24-year-old Tajik national. His sniper rifle was said to be foreign-made and to have optical lenses, it said.        
	The newspaper claimed that an informant told Russias FSB secret services officials a few days before the election that Putins assassination was being planned.        
	 The revelation came after Nikolai Patrushev, head of the FSB, said last week that his officers had foiled terrorist attacks during the election campaign. It was unclear why it had taken so long for the alleged assassination bid to be made public and why a tabloid newspaper was chosen as the outlet.         
	The FSB has not confirmed or denied the report, but Interfax, the Russian news agency, quoted an unnamed secret service official who denied the report.         
	Reports that there was some kind of plot against the leadership of the country are absolutely false, the unnamed officer was quoted as saying. The officer confirmed there had been arrests in March of people with weapons but said it had nothing to do with an assassination plot.

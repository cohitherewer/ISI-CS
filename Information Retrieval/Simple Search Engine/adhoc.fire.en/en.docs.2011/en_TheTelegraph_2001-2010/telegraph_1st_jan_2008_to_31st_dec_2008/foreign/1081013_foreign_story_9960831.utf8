The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Job offer to quell rancour
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Job offer to quell rancour
          TIM SHIPMAN                              
	Chillicothe, (Ohio), Oct. 12: Barack Obama would like to offer John McCain a job if he becomes President, in what his allies say is an attempt to end the bitter partisan rancour that engulfed the White House race last week.         
	Both presidential rivals are working behind the scenes to calm the increasingly incendiary atmosphere on the campaign trail, which erupted with lurid claims about Obamas links with former terrorist Bill Ayres and a lynch mob atmosphere at McCain rallies.         
	Two Democratic sources with knowledge of the thinking in the Obama camp say that forming a partnership with McCain would prove that Obama will reach across the aisle and also help rehabilitate McCain, who many Democrats believe has been pushed by hardline advisers into making increasingly desperate attacks on his rival.         
	By his own admission, the Republican candidate took the gloves off last week , unleashing adverts and soundbites attacking Obamas character and judgment as polls showed him on course for a landslide election victory. One well-connected Democrat, who spoke to Obama last week, told The Sunday Telegraph: John McCain is a good man. Theres no question about it. I think well see Barack Obama reach out to him and say: lets work together.         
	He pointed out that Bill Clinton and President Bush worked together on common issues despite their testy exchanges in the heat of battle.         
	And a Democratic strategist who talks regularly with Obamas senior advisors added: Obama has said all along that he will work with the best people, regardless of party affiliation. John McCain has experience and he used to have a record of bipartisanship. Were all going to need to pull together when this is over.         
	McCain will not be offered a cabinet job, but Obama may ask him to spearhead a bipartisan overhaul of veterans affairs, an issue close to McCains heart. The claims that Obama is already planning his administration come as a friend of McCain revealed that the Republican candidate is concerned that the ugly rhetoric of the last week will damage his reputation as an honest patriot if he loses on November 4.         
	The Republican strategist, who used to work for McCain, said: John knows that his reputation as a decent man is on the line but hes got devils on each shoulder telling him to hit harder.         
	That sentiment appeared to be behind McCains decision on Friday night to dial back the rhetoric, telling the crowd at one rally that they should be more respectful of Obama and insisting that his Democratic rival is a decent family man.         
	He dismissed one womans claim that Obama is an Arab and added: Hes a person that you dont have to be scared of as President of the United States.

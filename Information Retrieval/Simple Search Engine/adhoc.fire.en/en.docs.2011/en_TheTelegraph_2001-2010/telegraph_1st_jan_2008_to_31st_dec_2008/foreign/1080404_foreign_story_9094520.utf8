The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Relax, sex best in 13 minutes
                                                                                                               Relax, sex best in 13 minutes
                            
	London, April 3: A survey of sex therapists has concluded that the optimal amount of time for sexual intercourse is three to 13 minutes.        
	The findings, to be published in the May issue of the Journal of Sexual Medicine, strikes at the notion that endurance is the key to a great sex life. However, the time does not count foreplay, and the therapists did rate sexual intercourse that lasts from one to two minutes as too short.         
	Prof. Eric Corty, a researcher involved in the American study, said he hoped to ease the minds of those who believe that more of something good is better, and if you really want to satisfy your partner, you should last forever.         
	Corty told the Associated Press that the questions were not gender-specific. But he said that earlier research has shown that both men and women want foreplay and sexual intercourse to last longer.        
	Irwin Goldstein, editor of the Journal of Sexual Medicine, cited a four-week study of 1,500 couples in 2005 that found the median time for sexual intercourse was 7.3 minutes. The women involved were armed with stopwatches.         
	Marianne Brandon, a clinical psychologist and director of Wellminds Wellbodies in Annapolis, Maryland, said that it is difficult for both old and young men to make sexual intercourse last.         
	There are so many myths in our culture of what other people are doing sexually, she said. Most peoples sex lives are not as exciting as other people think they are.         
	Fifty members of the Society for Sex Therapy and Research in the US and Canada were surveyed by Corty, an associate professor of psychology at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, and student Jenay Guardiani. Prof. Corty said he hoped to give an idea of what therapists find to be normal and satisfactory among the couples they see.

          JULIET TURNER                               
	London, July 1: Bangkok is one of the hottest and most congested capitals in the world.         
	While air-conditioning makes the temperature inside the cars bearable, until recently there had been little drivers could do to make the delays less frustrating.         
	One man, however, has found a way to combine his passion for music with his job to make journeys fly by.         
	According to the Bangkok Post, Vichian Simma is the driver behind the emergence of a popular karaoke cab service on Bangkoks traffic-clogged streets five years ago.         
	It was really quiet and lonely in the rented cab, so I decided to take out a loan and buy my own, he told the newspaper.         
	Simma then kitted it out with his own karaoke equipment, much to passengers approval.         
	Some cant get enough, especially if theyve just left a bar, he told the newspaper.         
	Others tell me to drive around for a bit just so they can sing. The karaoke cab is now a ubiquitous sight on the citys streets.         
	From the outside they look like normal cabs, but inside there is a karaoke set that consists of a mini television near the front passenger seat, two microphones and a video player. Some drivers add flashing lights and disco balls to recreate that club atmosphere even in the heaviest of traffic.         
	The selection of music videos ranges from western pop classics like Madonnas Material Girl to Thai hits.         
	Songs are mostly Thai, English or Japanese, with Thai love songs being the most popular.

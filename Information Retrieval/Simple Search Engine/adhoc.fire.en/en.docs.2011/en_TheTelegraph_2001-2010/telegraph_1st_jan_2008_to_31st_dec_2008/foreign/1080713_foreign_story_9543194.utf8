                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US bank seized by federal regulators

	Washington, July 12 (Reuters): US banking regulators swooped in to seize mortgage lender IndyMac Bancorp Inc today after withdrawals by panicked depositors led to the third-largest banking failure in US history.        
	California-based IndyMac, which specialised in a type of mortgage that often required minimal documents from borrowers, became the fifth US bank to fail this year as a housing bust and credit crunch strain financial institutions.        
	The federal takeover of IndyMac capped a tumultuous day for US markets that saw stocks slide on a surging oil price and renewed fears about the stability of the top two home financing providers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.        
	IndyMac will reopen fully on Monday as IndyMac Federal Bank under Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) supervision, but tensions ran high as customers at a branch at its Los Angeles-area headquarters read a notice in the window saying it was closed.        
	At another branch down the road, a man who said he had more than $200,000 in an account  twice what is normally guaranteed by FDIC  argued with a security guard who was closing up. The FDIC, which will seek a buyer for IndyMac, estimated the cost of the banks failure to its $53 billion insurance fund at between $4 billion and $8 billion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Change at Playboy too
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Change at Playboy too
                              Hefner: New leadership                            
	New York, Dec. 8 (Agencies): Christie Hefner plans to step down next year as chairman and chief executive of Playboy Enterprises Inc after two decades on the job, the adult entertainment company said today.        
	Shares of Playboy rose 14 per cent in morning trading after Hefner, 56, daughter of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, said she would relinquish her role as CEO on January 31. She will stay on the companys board until a new CEO joins Playboy, which publishes one of the worlds best-known adult magazines.        
	Last month marked my 20th anniversary as CEO; just as this country is embracing change in the form of new leadership, I have decided that now is the time to make changes in my own life as well, Hefner said.        
	Like many magazine and newspaper publishers, Playboy has a brand name that is more widely known than read. Circulation has fallen as more people looking for adult entertainment and racier pictures of nude women turn to free sites online.        
	The company in October said it would take steps to save $12 million a year, including eliminating its DVD business.        
	Jerome Kern will serve as interim non-executive chairman, while the company searches for a replacement. Kern, president of Kern Consulting LLC and former CEO of On Command Corp, joined Playboys board in 2002.        
	I have had a remarkable career with Playboy. I never expected to go into the family business, much less to stay here this long, but I have enjoyed the challenges and opportunities the past decades have presented, Hefner said.        
	Hefner, 82, said his daughter had worked tirelessly to expand the companys franchise.

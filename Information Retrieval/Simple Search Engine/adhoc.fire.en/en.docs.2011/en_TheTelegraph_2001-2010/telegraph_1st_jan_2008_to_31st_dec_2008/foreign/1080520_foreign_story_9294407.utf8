The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mahathir fires quit salvo at PM
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mahathir fires quit salvo at PM
                                Mahathir Mohamad (top), Abdullah Ahmad Badawi                           
	Kuala Lumpur, May 19 (Agencies): Malaysias influential former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad quit the ruling party today after a long feud with his successor, deepening the cracks that appeared after the partys recent massive electoral losses.        
	In a speech to about 1,000 people, Mahathir said his decision to leave the United Malays National Organisation party, or UMNO, was prompted by his lack of confidence in Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.        
	Abdullah said he would not step down, rejecting Mahathirs demand for him to do so.        
	Why should I? Abdullah said in response to a reporters question on Mahathirs call for him to resign. I have work to do, I will continue to work, he said, adding that he was shocked at Mahathirs resignation.        
	Mahathir also urged other UMNO and cabinet members to quit.        
	I am quitting UMNO today. I will only come back when there is a leadership change, Mahathir said. We can return to UMNO when Abdullah steps down, he said in the speech in his home state of Kedah.        
	Mahathirs son Mokhzani confirmed the content of the speech.        
	The surprise decision was likely to intensify the crisis for Abdullah, who faces calls from many party members to resign to take responsibility for the partys losses in the March 8 general elections.        
	Mahathirs call could trigger large-scale desertions by loyalists, which could split the party  one that has been in power since Malaysias independence from Britain in 1957  and eventually bring down the government.        
	The 82-year-old Mahathir had been firing regular barbs at Abdullah and his supporters for more than two years, but had given no indication that he would quit the party. Instead, he had been urging party members to revolt against the Prime Minister.        
	He realises he cannot fight (Abdullah). The only way is to resign and hopefully force mass resignations from UMNO, said James Chin, a political science professor at Monash University in Malaysia.        
	However, it is premature to say Mahathir can get sufficient support, he said.        
	A senior UMNO leader dismissed suggestions that the party would break up, saying Mahathirs departure is not that important. He indicated that the party was glad to be rid of Mahathirs disruptive influence.        
	I welcome his decision. It is high time for him to leave, said Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, a cabinet minister and a member of UMNOs supreme council.        
	He is old enough to decide. He has every right to do it but he shouldnt urge members to follow him. Its up to the members.        
	Mahathir appointed Abdullah to succeed him in 2003, when Mahathir retired after 22 years as Prime Minister. But he remained active in politics, wielding significant influence among the partys grass-roots workers.        
	By late 2004 Mahathir began accusing Abdullah of nepotism, corruption and inefficiency. Party insiders say Mahathir was angry because many big infrastructure projects he had initiated were cancelled by Abdullah.

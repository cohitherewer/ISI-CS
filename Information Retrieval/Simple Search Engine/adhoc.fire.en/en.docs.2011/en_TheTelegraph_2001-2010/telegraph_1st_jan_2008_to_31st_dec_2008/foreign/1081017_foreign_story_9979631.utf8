	Hempstead (New York), Oct. 16 (Reuters): Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama begin a 19-day sprint to Election Day today after a contentious final debate that featured aggressive McCain attacks on Obamas campaign tactics and tax plans.        
	The presidential rivals complained about the negativity of the campaign during a series of testy exchanges yesterday that included repeated appeals to average Americans through Joe the plumber  the owner of a small plumbing business whom Obama met in Ohio.        
	Two quick polls after the debate, by CBS News and CNN, judged Obama the winner. Obama was also considered the winner of the first two presidential debates.        
	McCain, trailing in opinion polls ahead of the November 4 election, was on the offensive throughout the 90-minute encounter. He rebuked Obama for his frequent claims he is too close to the policies of President George W. Bush.        
	Senator Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush you should have run four years ago, McCain said in the final presidential debate, held at Hofstra University on Long Island outside New York city. Obama, 47, said he sometimes had trouble spotting a difference between the two.        
	If I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bushs policies, its because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people  on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities  you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush, Obama said.        
	McCain, 72, an Arizona senator, was under intense pressure in the third and final debate to give a strong performance that could turn around a presidential race moving decisively in Obamas favour after weeks of economic turmoil. Opinion polls show more voters say they trust Obamas leadership on the economy, which has dominated the campaign-trail discussion and dwarfed McCains expertise in foreign policy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gilani elected, judges freed

	Islamabad, March 24 (AP): A longtime loyalist of slain Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was elected Pakistans new Prime Minister today and he immediately freed judges detained by President Pervez Musharraf.        
	Minutes after the National Assembly elected Yousaf Raza Gilani, dozens of political activists and lawyers climbed over a wall surrounding the home of Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, who was sacked when Musharraf declared a state of emergency in November.        
	Chaudhry emerged onto a balcony smiling, and thanked supporters in his first public appearance since his house arrest more than four months ago.        
	I have no words to thank you for the way you struggled for nearly five months for the enforcement of the rule of law and our Constitution, he said. Pakistans state-run news agency quoted deputy Islamabad commissioner Amir Ahmed Ali as saying: All deposed judges are free to move.        
	 The prisoners are free today, Chaudhrys lawyer Aitzaz Ahsan said, flanked by several judges. Chaudhrys release would be the most powerful symbol yet of how power has slipped away from Musharraf.         
	The new government had promised to reinstate Chaudhry and other senior judges within 30 days.         
	Gilani will form a new government dominated by Musharrafs foes, who have vowed to slash the Presidents sweeping powers and review his counterterrorism policies. Bhuttos party routed Musharrafs allies in parliamentary elections last month.        
	In the House, Gilani said he would ask the National Assembly to pass a resolution seeking a UN probe into Bhuttos assassination. Gilani, a former House Speaker and longtime Bhutto aide, was elected in an emotional session of parliament.         
	Later, he immediately shook hands with Bhuttos son, Bilawal, who wiped tears from his face and smiled.

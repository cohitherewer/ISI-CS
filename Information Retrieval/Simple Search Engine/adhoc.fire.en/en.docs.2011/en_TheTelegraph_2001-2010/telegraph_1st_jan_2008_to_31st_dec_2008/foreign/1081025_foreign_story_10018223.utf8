	Lingerie jewels    
	 London, Oct. 24: A fantasy $5 million bra studded with 3,600 black diamonds has been unveiled by the Victorias Secret lingerie chain, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The bra, which also boasts white diamonds and rubies, weighs 1,500 carats and is believed to be one of the most valuable items of underwear ever made.       
	Two tear-shaped black diamonds, with a combined weight of 100 carats, hang down from the middle.       
	The one-off bra  which contains 3,900 gems in total  is modelled by Brazilian Adriana Lima in the Victorias Secret Christmas catalogue.       
	It was created by Martin Katz, the rare gem jeweller who has worked on previous luxury lingerie for the firm.       
	What better avenue, to showcase nearly 3,600 black diamonds than on the most extravagant holiday gift, he said.

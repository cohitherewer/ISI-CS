	Colombo, May 26 (Reuters): At least eight people were killed and 73 civilians injured when a bomb exploded on a train during rush hour in the Sri Lankan capital today, military officials said.        
	The military blamed Tamil Tigers for planting the bomb, which detonated in the Colombo suburb of Dehiwala.        
	Eight civilians including a pregnant woman were killed and 73 injured from the explosion, said military spokesperson Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara.        
	I was at home when I heard the explosion, when I came out I saw injured people struggling, so we sent them to the hospital using a bus and private vehicles, said Nandana Peiris, a witness.        
	A Reuters witness saw four dead bodies at the scene.        
	The military defused two bombs on two buses over the weekend and has stepped up security in public areas.

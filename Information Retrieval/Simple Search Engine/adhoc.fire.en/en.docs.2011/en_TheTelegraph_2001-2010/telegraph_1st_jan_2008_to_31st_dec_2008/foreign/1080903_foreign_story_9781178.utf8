	Bangkok, Sept. 2 (Reuters): Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej declared a state of emergency in Bangkok today and gave the army control of public order after a man died in overnight clashes between pro- and anti-government protesters.        
	Under the sweeping emergency powers announced on television and radio, all public gatherings in the capital are banned and restrictions imposed on media reports that undermined public security.        
	There is an urgent need to solve all these problems quickly. Therefore, the Prime Minister declares a state of emergency in Bangkok from now on, read the emergency order after 100 days of anti-government protests.         
	The airport, the main gateway for millions of tourists visiting one of Asias top holiday destinations, remained open. But tourism, a major employer, would take a short-term hit as Australia, South Korea and Singapore issued travel warnings, with others likely to follow. Samak, who has refused to quit, said the security action would not last more than a few days.        
	I did this to douse the fire, not to cause a fire, he told a news conference at military headquarters. However, the deployment of troops raises the spectre of an army seizure of power less than two years after the military kicked out then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Leaders of the anti-government movement said they would not be moving. They are camped out behind makeshift barricades.

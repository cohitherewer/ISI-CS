          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, Nov. 13: When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh takes the floor at a summit of world leaders here on Saturday morning, he will be weighed down by a contradiction in having personally rejected Left prescriptions on the economy and then having to advocate some of those very Left solutions to member countries of the Group of 20 (G-20).        
	If a draft of his speech reviewed by the Prime Minister before emplaning for Washington on Thursday evening is finally delivered here, Singh will acknowledge that massive state intervention is the solution to the current global economic meltdown.        
	But his own 17-year record in public life as an economic liberaliser will hold Singh back from explicitly stating that the ways of socialism offer the only way out of a massive economic collapse that is staring industrialised countries in their face, leaving developing countries highly vulnerable.        
	A paragraph in Singhs draft speech dealing with this dilemma has been tossed back and forth by his aides who are already here for pre-summit meetings and for other preparations so that Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram can make the most of their interaction with world leaders.        
	According to sources in the prime ministers office (PMO), it has so far been decided that Singh will, therefore, advocate socialist ways to the gathering of heads of state and government without, of course, calling it socialism.        
	The convoluted logic putting this across reads as follows in Singhs draft speech at the time of going to press.        
	I recognise that resort to fiscal stimulus has other implications, especially in situations when public debt is high, but if we are indeed on the brink of the worst downturn since the Great Depression, that is perhaps a risk worth taking.        
	Fiscal stimulus can be tax cuts or spending hikes. But so far, what the US and Europe have done in the context of the current economic crisis is to go in for spending hikes through stimulus packages that pump money into the financial system by takeovers of institutions in distress.        
	So when the Prime Minister talks of other implications what he means is that capitalist governments are taking the road to socialism and nationalisation  howsoever limited.         
	And when he talks of risk worth taking he is talking of the risk of being called socialist, an issue that the Washington summits host, President George W Bush is acutely aware of and wants to avoid.        
	The Prime Minister too wants to avoid being labelled a socialist, lest the Left parties, no longer his allies, mock him for changing course out of necessity and from the experience from Wall Streets problems.        
	Singh will also attempt to be non-aligned in the inevitable dispute between Bush and French President Nicolas Sarkozy at the summit over their conflicting solutions to the crisis, although both presidents will do their best to be polite and paper over their differences as far as possible.        
	Even this week, Sarkozy, who is not one to mince words described as mad the idea of an all-powerful market, which is a holy cow for Bush. Sarkozy, who now speaks for Europe because of the current French presidency of the European Union, wants bold reforms whereas Bush only wants a patchwork until January 20, 2009 when he can retire in peace to Texas.        
	The Prime Minister has, therefore, put a sentence into his draft speech which is neither here nor there.        
	We have not yet succeeded in managing the crisis and in a way, we would be in a better position to pronounce on the details of architecture on the basis of experience when the current crisis is over, is what Singh will tell the summit, according to the draft he reviewed today.        
	Between the lines, what it means is that we leaders have not done a good job of dealing with the crisis, but we may know what to do when the entire edifice of the global economy comes tumbling down.        
	The Prime Ministers aides who are already here have, however, told their American counterparts that India will maintain growth at around 7 per cent even if the world economy does not recover quickly.        
	But they are asserting that the weekend summit could do much to enable India to return to a rapid growth rate of nine per cent.

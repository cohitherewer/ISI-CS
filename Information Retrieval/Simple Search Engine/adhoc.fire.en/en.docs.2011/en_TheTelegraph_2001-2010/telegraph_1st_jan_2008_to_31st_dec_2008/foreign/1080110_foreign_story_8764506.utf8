	Surrey (British Columbia), Jan. 9 (AP): Canadian authorities again postponed the deportation of a paralysed Sikh man after protesters blocked the entrance to a temple where he was granted sanctuary, the mans lawyer, Zool Suleman, said today.
    
	Laibar Singh, 48, entered Canada in 2003 on a false passport. He worked as a labourer in Canada until he suffered an aneurysm two years ago and became a paraplegic. Canada has free health care and the government has been paying for his care.
    
	Singh has been staying at the Guru Nanak temple in suburban Vancouver since December 15, four days after the last attempt to deport him was thwarted. Singh was scheduled to be deported on December 11. However, Canada Border Services delayed it after more than 1,000 protesters surrounded the car taking him to Vancouver airport.
    
	Suleman said Singh was scheduled for deportation again early today. However, supporters flocked to the temple in Surrey, which has a large Sikh population, after word spread yesterday that border services agents will take him to the airport early this morning.
    
	A large truck blocked the temples locked gates.
    
	Suleman said he met the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, border services and temple officials and agreed that Singh would not be removed today.
    
	We appreciate that there is a valid removal order but theres also a strong community will supporting Laibar Singh to stay in Canada on humanitarian grounds, Suleman said.
    
	Its a difficult public policy debate. The dialogue will continue and we will come to some resolution on this.
    
	 Canada Border Services agent Chris Williams said officials are commited to enforcing the removal order.
    
	The federal government does not condone individuals hiding in places of worship to avoid removal, Williams said. The fact that a person is hiding in a place of worship to avoid removal does not in any way influence the governments decision concerning the case.
    
	Harsha Walia, a protester from the No One Is Illegal organisation, said an attempt to forcibly remove Singh from the temple could spark a lot of anger. Singh was initially ordered deported in June but took sanctuary in another Sikh temple in Abbotsford, British Columbia.
    
	Canadas public safety minister Stockwell Day granted Singh two extensions to remain while his refugee claim was dealt with. It was denied because the government believed he did not have sufficient ties to Canada. However, supporters have pledged money to pay the costs of his care.
    
	A deportation order was issued in December despite claims that his health would suffer if he was returned to India, where he has family.

	Detroit, Nov. 22 (AP): Ford Motor Co may sell its fleet of five corporate jets after top executives of the three Detroit automakers were harshly criticised by members of Congress this week for their travel expenses.        
	 In a statement issued yesterday, Ford said it is exploring all options for the fleet, which it said has been reduced from nine in 2005. Fords top priority is to continue making progress on our transformation plan, and we do not want anything to distract us, spokesman Mark Truby said .         
	The announcement comes just days after Ford chief executive Alan Mulally, Chrysler LLC chief executive Robert Nardelli and General Motors Corp chief executive Rick Wagoner travelled to Washington on separate corporate jets to seek $25 billion in government loans to help them make it through the worst US auto sales downturn in 25 years.        
	Congress, though, abandoned a vote on the bailout after a disastrous appearance in which the automakers were criticised for lavish corporate travel, as well as for having poor business plans and high labour costs that some members said would keep them from being competitive with Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.

          DEANNA BELLANDI                          Crosses in memory of the shooting victims in Dekalb, Illinois. (Reuters)                                  
	Dekalb (Illinois), Feb. 16: If there is such a thing as a profile of a mass murderer, Steven Kazmierczak didnt fit it: outstanding student, engaging, polite and industrious, with what looked like a bright future in the criminal justice field.        
	And yet on Thursday, the 27-year-old Kazmierczak, armed with three handguns and a brand-new pump-action shotgun he had carried onto campus in a guitar case, stepped from behind a screen on the stage of a lecture hall at Northern Illinois University and opened fire on a geology class. He killed six students before committing suicide.        
	University police chief Donald Grady said, without giving details, that Kazmierczak had become erratic in the past two weeks after he had stopped taking his medication. But that seemed to come as news to many of those who knew him, and the attack itself was positively baffling.        
	We had no indications at all this would be the type of person that would engage in such activity, Grady said. He described the gunman as a good student during his time at NIU, and by all accounts a fairly normal person.        
	Exactly what set Kazmierczak off  and why he picked his former university and that particular lecture hall  remained a mystery. Police said they found no suicide note.        
	Late yesterday, a former employee at a Chicago psychiatric treatment centre told The Associated Press that Kazmierczak was placed there after high school by his parents. She said he used to cut himself, and had resisted taking his medications.        
	Authorities also were searching for a woman who police believe may have been Kazmierczaks girlfriend. According to a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity, authorities were looking into whether Kazmierczak and the woman recently broke up.        
	Investigators learned that a week ago, on February 9, Kazmierczak walked into a Champaign, Illinois, gun store and picked up a Remington shotgun and a Glock 9mm handgun. He bought the two other handguns at the same shop  a Hi-Point .380 on December 30 and a Sig Sauer on August 6.        
	All four guns were bought legally from a federally licensed firearms dealer, said Thomas Ahern, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. At least one criminal background check was performed. Kazmierczak (pronounced kaz-MUR-chek) had no criminal record.        
	Kazmierczak had a State Police-issued FOID, or firearms owners identification card, which is required in Illinois to own a gun, authorities said. Such cards are rarely issued to those with recent mental health problems.

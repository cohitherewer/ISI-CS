	Kathmandu, April 15: The Nepal Army today clarified that it would abide by its commitment to work under the an elected government, irrespective of the party in power.         
	Major General Shiva Ram Pradhan told the Joint Monitoring Coordination Committee (JMCC) that the army has traditionally followed the orders of the legitimate government.         
	The army will continue to work in cooperation with the government as it has the mandate of the people, Pradhan told the committee which oversees the management of the cantonments of both the army and the Maoist Peoples Liberation Army.         
	Representatives of both the armies and the UN Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) attended the meeting which discussed, among other issues, the post-election scenario.         
	Pradhans clarification comes amidst speculation about the possibility of the Nepal Army not accepting a Maoist-led government. Reports also said that the Army would not accept the integration of Maoist fighters into its ranks.         
	The Nepal Armys contention is that the PLA fighters will not be able to follow the Army discipline as they are highly indoctrinated politically by the Maoist ideology.         
	The Maoists, who fought a guerrilla war for more than a decade against the Nepal Army, have described it as a feudal force which is loyal to the king. The Maoists gave the example of the February 1, 2005, royal coup during which King Gyanendra used the Nepal Army to not only quell dissent but also muzzle the independent media.         
	Maoists closer        
	The Maoists moved closer today to winning half of the directly elected seats in teh Constituent Assembly that will shape the Himalayan nations political future.        
	The former insurgents had won 114 of the 212 directly elected seats decided by this morning, the election commission said. Vote counting continued in six constituencies, while re-polling has been ordered in another 22, the commission said. Re-polling was held in six of the constituencies today and there were no reports of violence.

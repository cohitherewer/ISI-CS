	Harare, June 29 (Reuters): Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was sworn in today after being declared overwhelming winner of an election which observers said was scarred by violence and intimidation.        
	Mugabe was the only candidate and went ahead with the vote despite a wave of international censure. The US, which says it is preparing new sanctions, called today for strong international action.         
	Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew a week ago saying a systematic campaign of violence, which killed nearly 90 of his followers, had made a free and fair vote impossible.         
	The electoral commission said Mugabe won 85.51 per cent of the vote. He had 43.2 per cent in the elections in March which Tsvangirai won with 47.9 per cent, short of the absolute majority needed for a first-round victory.

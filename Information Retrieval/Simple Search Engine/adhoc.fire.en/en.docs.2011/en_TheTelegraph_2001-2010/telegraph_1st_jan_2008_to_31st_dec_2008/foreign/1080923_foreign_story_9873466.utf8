	Islamabad, Sept. 22: Pakistans top leaders, including the President and the Prime Minister, were to have attended a dinner at the Marriott Hotel on the day of the truck bombing but changed the venues at the last minute, interior ministry chief Rehman Malik said today.        
	Malik made the revelation two days after the blast killed at least 60 people.         
	The venue for the Iftar dinner, hosted by National Assembly Speaker Fehmida Mirza to mark President Asif Ali Zardaris inaugural address to the parliament, was changed to the Prime Ministers residence. It was attended by Zardari, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and top civil and military leaders.        
	The speaker had arranged a dinner for the entire leadership, including the President, the Prime Minister and armed forces at the Marriott on Saturday. But the venue was changed at the last minute, Malik told reporters in Islamabad. The venue was changed on the advice of Zardari and Gilani, Malik said.        
	Hotel to be rebuilt        
	The Marriott owners plan to rebuild the hotel in the next three months at an estimated cost of over (Pak) Rs50 crore.         
	Sadaruddin Hashwani, who constructed the hotel in the early 1980s, is not upset at all over the loss. I am not concerned at all over the loss that I had to undergo. What really pains me is the huge loss of life and my heart bleeds for this loss, he said in Islamabad. The hotel had more than 1,000 employees but Haswani said all would be getting their salaries during the period of reconstruction.

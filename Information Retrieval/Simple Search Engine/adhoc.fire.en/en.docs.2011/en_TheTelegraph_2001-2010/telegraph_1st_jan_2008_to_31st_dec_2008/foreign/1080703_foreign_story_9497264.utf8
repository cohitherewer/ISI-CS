          ANITA SINGH                          Designer holiday                                  
	London, July 2: Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has been spending big on holiday while pondering his move from Manchester United to Real Madrid.         
	The Portuguese player enjoyed a designer shopping spree in Porto Cervo, Sardinia, Italy, emerging laden with bags from Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada.        
	His girlfriend, Nereida Gallardo, stayed on board the couples chartered yacht while Ronaldo shopped with a posse of male friends. The 23-year-old has been photographed having fun in the sun with Gallardo on a Mediterranean break following Portugals exit from Euro 2008.        
	As far as Manchester United are concerned, the star is turning up for pre-season training next week, despite rumours of a 182,000-a-week move to Spain.         
	Manager Sir Alex Ferguson has given a clear indiciation that Ronaldo is part of his plans for next season. Its going to be a big season, but we have a good team and there is still some development to come in the squad, he said on Monday. The likes of Anderson, Nani, Wayne Rooney and Ronaldo will emerge... and be really top players for us.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Obama confident of victory
          TIM SHIPMAN                               
	Washington, May 11: Barack Obama believes he has already secured the private support of enough superdelegates to beat Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic White House nomination, The Sunday Telegraph has learned.        
	The Illinois senator last week switched his attention to the general election battle against John McCain after locking down more than enough pledges to reach the victory target of 2,025 delegates.        
	A senior Democrat strategist, familiar with discussions at the highest levels of the Obama camp, has revealed that Obama is now confident of the support of around 120 of the remaining 260 undeclared superdelegates.        
	His aides believe he will only need between 70 and 80 to be sure of the nomination if he wins the Oregon, Montana and South Dakota primaries as expected later this month.        
	The strategist said: The reason hes behaving like hes won it, is because he thinks he has won it. His numbers man now thinks they have enough firm support to get to 2,025.        
	Out of respect for Hillary Clinton many have insisted that their allegiance remains private until after the final primary election on June 3. Others will go public to maintain Obamas momentum if Hillary, as expected, wins handsomely in West Virginia on Tuesday.        
	By one estimate Obama grabbed the lead in superdelegates for the first time on Friday, after picking up seven public endorsements in a day.

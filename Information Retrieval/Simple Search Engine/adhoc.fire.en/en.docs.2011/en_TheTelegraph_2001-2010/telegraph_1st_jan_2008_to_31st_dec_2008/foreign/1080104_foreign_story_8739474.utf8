	Sydney, Jan. 3: An Australian snake which mistook four golf balls for a clutch of chicken eggs has been saved from a slow, painful death by emergency surgery. 
    
	The balls had been placed in a chicken coup by a couple in Nobbys Creek in New South Wales in the hope that they would encourage their hens to nest. 
    
	But the ruse also fooled the wild carpet python, which slid into the coop and swallowed the plastic balls in the hope of a tasty meal. It was later found nearby, lumpy and bloated, and rushed to the nearby Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary. 
    
	The balls were removed from its intestine by senior vet Michael Pyne, who said yesterday that the snake was making a speedy recovery. 
    
	Those golf balls werent moving any further; they were stuck where they were, Dr Pyne said.
    
	If it hadnt been found, it would have died for sure. During the surgery we could see the name of the golf balls through the intestine because [it was] so stretched. 
    
	The sanctuary regularly treats injured reptiles which come off worst after encounters with cars, pets and lawnmowers. 
    
	 The snake  nicknamed Augustus  is expected to make a full recovery and should be released back into the wild later this month. 
    
	In neighbouring Queensland, a python that bit a woman and wrapped itself around her leg had to be killed and have its fangs prised off. The 6foot-long snake bit the 26-year-old on Moreton Island, near Brisbane.
    
	It coiled itself tightly around her leg, said rescue helicopter pilot Brent Hall. Friends tried to uncoil the snake, without success.
    
	Because it was such a ferocious attack, they had trouble getting the snakes fangs out of her leg and had to kill the snake and prise the head and fangs from her leg, Hall said. The woman was airlifted to a hospital north of Brisbane, where she is in a stable condition.

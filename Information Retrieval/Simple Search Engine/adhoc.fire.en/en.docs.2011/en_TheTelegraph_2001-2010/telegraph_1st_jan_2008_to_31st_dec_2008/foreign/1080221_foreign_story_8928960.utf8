The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | If music be the medicine, play on
                                                                                                               If music be the medicine, play on
          G.S. MUDUR                          Feeling better?                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: Whether its classical, jazz, or pop, music can speed up improvement in patients recovering from stroke, according to a new study that has prompted doctors to call for the introduction of music therapy for stroke survivors.         
	Doctors in Finland have found that stroke patients who listened to music for about two hours a day showed more improvement in their memory, attention, and mood than patients who were not exposed to any music or who only listened to audio books.         
	Everyday music during early stroke recovery offers a valuable addition to the patients care, said Teppo Sarkamo, a researcher at the cognitive brain research unit at the University of Helsinki, and lead investigator of the study published today in the journal Brain. Music would be an easy-to-conduct and inexpensive means to facilitate cognitive and emotional recovery, Sarkamo said.         
	Stroke is a condition in which blood flow to the brain is cut off temporarily and can lead to multiple symptoms such as loss of memory, speech, and sometimes even paralysis. Standard therapy involved drugs, rest, and physical rehabilitation.         
	Sarkamo and his colleagues have found that three months after the stroke, patients who listened to music had 60 per cent improvement, in their verbal memory, in contrast to only about 30 per cent in the patients who did not listen to any music.         
	The ability to focus attention, perform mental operations also increased by 17 per cent in the group of patients who were exposed to music compared to no improvement in patients who did not listen to music or listened only to audio stories.         
	This could turn out to be a landmark study, said Prahlad Sethi, emeritus consultant neurologist at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, and president of the Brain Care Foundation of India.         
	Music has long been known to be soothing, and people with acute or chronic illness have sometimes been encouraged by doctors to listen to music, but this study provides us with the first scientific evidence to consider introducing music as therapy to stroke patients, Sethi told The Telegraph.

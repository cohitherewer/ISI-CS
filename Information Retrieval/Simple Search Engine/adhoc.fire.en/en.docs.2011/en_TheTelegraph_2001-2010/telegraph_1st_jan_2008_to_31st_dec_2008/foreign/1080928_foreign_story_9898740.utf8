          HENRY SAMUEL                              
	Paris, Sept. 27: Nicolas Sarkozys whirlwind romance with Carla Bruni, the supermodel who became his wife, is to be turned into a television drama.         
	But there was speculation in French media circles as to whether any big channel would risk the wrath of the President  close to several media tycoons  by buying it.        
	The film will be a mixed adaptation of two recent unauthorised biographies, for which television company Endemol has just bought the rights, charting the French first couples lightning courtship and marriage.        
	One is called Ruptures (Break-ups) by Micka Darmon and Yves Derai.The second, Carla and Nicolas: the True Story is written by Valrie Benam and Yves Azeroual.        
	Endemol Fiction, the drama arm of the producer of Star Academy, said their relationship would lend itself well to drama as it already read like a book. Which channel will dare broadcast it? asked Nouvelobs.com, the website of Nouvel Observateur magazine.        
	Martin Bouygues, who owns TF1, Frances most-watched channel, is a close personal friend of the President and godfather to his child.        
	The current head of state broadcaster France Televisions, Patrick de Carolis, has already had an angry run-in with Sarkozy over the content of his broadcasts. Carolis said he found this stupid and unfair but is battling to keep his position. Buying the film would only worsen his case, said Nouvelobs.              
	A rival channel, M6, depends on the government for the amount of advertising revenue it receives.        
	The most likely contender is the private channel Canal Plus, which has a history of challenging the establishment, notably with an in-depth account of an oil scandal.

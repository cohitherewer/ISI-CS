                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bush regrets blunt remarks
                            
	Washington, Nov 12 (Agencies): President George W Bush yesterday said in an interview with CNN that he regrets some of his blunt remarks on the war on terror.        
	Bush also regretted a statement he made in front of a Mission Accomplished banner aboard a US aircraft carrier a month after Iraq was invaded as it conveyed a wrong message.        
	I regret saying some things I shouldnt have said, Bush told CNN when asked to reflect on his regrets over his two terms as President.        
	Like dead or alive and bring em on. My wife reminded me that, hey, as President of the United States, be careful what you say, said the 62-year-old President, who will hand over power to President-elect Obama on January 20.        
	His dead or alive remark about terrorists came shortly after the 9/11 attacks when he was referring to Osama bin Laden. Bush was referring to his May 1, 2003, statement aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln where he announced an end to major combat operations in Iraq.         
	They had a sign that said Mission Accomplished. It was a sign aimed at the sailors on the ship, but it conveyed a broader knowledge. To some it said, well, Bush thinks the war in Iraq is over, when I didnt think that. But nonetheless, it conveyed the wrong message.        
	Book planned        
	Bush plans to return to Texas and may write a book after leaving office on January 20. He said that he may write a book after his term is over and added that he has also begun to think about an outline.

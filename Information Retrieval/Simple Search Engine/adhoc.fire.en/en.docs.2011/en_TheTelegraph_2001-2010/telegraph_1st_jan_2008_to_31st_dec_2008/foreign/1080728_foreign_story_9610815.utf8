	Drug garden    
	 Amsterdam, July 27 (Reuters): A 73-year-old Dutch man was astonished to learn from police that the begonias he had lovingly tended on his doorstep concealed a secret marijuana plantation.      
	Police officers suddenly noticed marijuana plants sprouting from his begonias, a police spokesperson in The Hague said. The Hague pensioner promised to destroy the marijuana plants, which he believes were planted by local youngsters, while preserving his begonias. Earlier this month the Dutch government set up a task force to crack down on marijuana cultivation in the country    
	Dog bitten    
	 Sao Paulo (Reuters): An 11-year-old boy is enjoying a flash of fame in Brazil after biting a pitbull that attacked him as he played in his uncles back yard. Gabriel Almeida, who lives on the outskirts of Belo Horizonte in the state of Minas Gerais, broke a canine tooth when he bit into the dogs neck to fend off an attack. Since then, he has been pampered in the studios of several TV stations, where he has been recounting his ordeal. I grabbed him by the neck and bit, he told Globo newspaper. Its no big deal. Its better to lose a tooth than to lose your life.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bombers strike at heart of secure arms complex

	Islamabad, Aug. 21: More than 71 people were killed today after two suicide bombers attacked Pakistans largest ordnance factories at Wah, 30km northwest of Islamabad.        
	It is the deadliest attack by the Taliban in their escalating campaign against the government. The attack came just days after the resignation of President Pervez Musharraf.        
	The factories, in the town of Wah, just off the main road that connects Islamabad to the northern city of Peshawar, make up Pakistans biggest industrial complex with 20,000 employees, according to General (Retd) Talat Masood, a former chairman of the factories.         
	Run by the ministry of defence, the complex consists of more than 16 factories that make ammunition of all kinds, as well as rifles, pistols, explosives and acid, mostly for export.        
	In choosing the target, the Taliban singled out a symbolically important industry, and one that Pakistanis thought was virtually impregnable, General Masood said.        
	The attack was well coordinated and timed during the mid-afternoon shift change to inflict maximum casualties, according to the inspector general of police in Punjab province, Shaukat Javed.         
	The two suicide bombers were on foot, and they blew themselves up in front of two gates at the factory at almost the same time, he said. Dozens of workers were injured, and the death toll seemed likely to climb higher than 71.        
	The attack was one of the deadliest in Pakistan. The previous highest death toll was 55 people killed in Kurram in the tribal areas in February when a suicide bomber blew himself up at a campaign rally two days before the parliamentary elections, according to a tally by the daily newspaper Dawn.        
	Just two days ago, the Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide attack that killed 35 people outside the emergency room of the government hospital in Dera Ismail Khan, a town on the edge of the tribal region.        
	Several hours after the bombings today, the spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, Maulvi Omar, issued a statement saying that the attack was in response to the military operation in Bajaur district in the countrys northern tribal area, where the Pakistani Air Force has been striking at Taliban forces almost daily for the past two weeks.         
	If it doesnt stop we will continue such attacks, Omar told Reuters by telephone. The Wah factory is a killer factory where arms are being produced to kill our women and children, he said.        
	The air force campaign began after the Taliban outmanoeuvred three convoys of the Frontier Corps, a paramilitary group under the command of the army, when they tried to take back a security post in Bajaur.         
	There were 56 suicide attacks in Pakistan last year, many of them by the Taliban.         
	Military installations were among the targets last year, and several of the attacks were in crowded urban areas. But no single death toll reached more than 50 last year, General Masood said.         
	After the record number of suicide attacks in 2007, there had been a tapering off by the Taliban, in large part because of peace talks between the Taliban and the government earlier this year.        
	The violence combined with political uncertainty has helped undermine investor confidence and send the countrys financial markets on a downward spiral.        
	There were bodies lying everywhere and wounded people soaked in blood were screaming for help, said Shah, the manager of a petrol station near the industrial complex in Wah.        
	Many of the wounded were either without legs or hands. I could see body parts hanging on trees, he said.        
	Since July last year, Pakistan has suffered a wave of militant violence, particularly in the northwest, in which hundreds have been killed.

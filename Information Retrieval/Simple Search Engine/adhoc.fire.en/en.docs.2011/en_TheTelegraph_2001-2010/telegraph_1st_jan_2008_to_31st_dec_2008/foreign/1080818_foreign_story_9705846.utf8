          CHRIS IRVINE                             Moss and Sinatra                                             
	London, Aug. 17: Kate Moss may have dated a string of bad boys but she was left lightheaded after she kissed Frank Sinatra.         
	The supermodel told Interview magazine the episode took place in 1995 when she was just 21, at the singers 80th birthday party in Hollywood.        
	She was attending with her then boyfriend Johnny Depp, who is known for his fiery temperament, but Ol Blue Eyes got the better of the actor and seized his chance.        
	She said: There was still a twinkle in his blue eyes. Yeah, major. I was sitting down having a cigarette, and he spotted me and made a beeline for me. He got all of his security to close in so Johnny couldnt get to me.        
	So we were encircled and hes like, how are you doing, little lady? And I said, Happy birthday, Frank, and he just lunged for me. He kissed me on the lips, then gave me a filterless cigarette. I came off all lightheaded. He was fabulous.        
	The 34-year-old catwalk beauty, who has previously dated Babyshambles frontman Pete Doherty, revealed she also met another music legend, Bob Dylan, at the same party, although this time there was no sexual chemistry.        
	She said: I put my hand out, and Bob didnt put his out. I took my hand away, and he put his out. We finally did shake.

	Johannesburg, May 21 (Reuters): Xenophobic violence that has killed at least 24 people in South Africa spilled over to the volatile Zulu heartland today and security officials discussed whether to use troops to quell the wave of unrest.        
	The attacks on African immigrants, accused by many poor South Africans of taking scarce jobs and fuelling crime, have forced thousands of people from their homes, unnerved investors and hit the rand currency.        
	Local media in the eastern KwaZulu-Natal province said at least six immigrants were wounded in an overnight attack on a Nigerian-owned tavern in the port city of Durban.        
	The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, the ruling ANCs main rival in KwaZulu-Natal, said the Durban attacks showed the anti-foreigner violence had spread to the province  home to South Africas biggest ethnic group, the Zulus.        
	We are ... saddened by reports that such barbaric acts have spread to our province and Durban in particular, it said in a statement.        
	Police and provincial officials said the attack was not sparked by xenophobia, but it increased fears the violence could spread from Johannesburg where it erupted on May 11.        
	There is a real fear that the violence will spread here, said Mary de Haas, who has been monitoring violence in KwaZulu-Natal since the 1980s.        
	Essop Phahad, a senior aide to President Thabo Mbeki, told reporters that the police, defence and justice departments were discussing whether to send troops to restive areas.        
	Obviously, youre calling the army if the police is unable to cope. As far as I know, we are not there yet but we will await the report from our security cluster, Pahad said.        
	The militant youth league of the ruling African National Congress said the government needed to do all in its power to end the violence including the deployment of the military if the need arises.        
	The police have already asked the army for equipment to help combat the violence in shanty towns and black townships, a defence ministry spokesperson said.        
	The UNs International Organisation for Migration said yesterday that the violence had displaced 13,000 people.

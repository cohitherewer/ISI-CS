                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Security beefed up for Zardari
                              Militant fears                            
	Islamabad, Aug. 29 (Agencies): Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairman and presidential nominee Asif Ali Zardari has moved into a heavily-guarded residence here over security fears, officials said today.        
	 Zardari, 52, moved from his plush residence in the heart of Islamabad to the house on the advice of his government colleagues, the Dawn newspaper said.         
	Zardari has been living in the new residence for about a week.        
	The shift to a more secure home comes after a spate of suicide bombings, the last in Wah on August 21, 50 km from the capital, killing 78. The militants have threatened more suicide bombings. Zardari has been advised to stay in a safe place and under the cover of official security, said a cabinet member.        
	The PPP presidential candidate had been advised much earlier to move to the residence but he was reluctant to do so. However, after a security breach at his residence, he decided to shift, Dawn said.         
	Zardaris party has sought to assure the US that it is committed to battling terrorists since Pervez Musharrafs resignation as President.        
	Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani told reporters today that Zardari  who is widely expected to win a September 6 presidential election by lawmakers  was staying at a hilltop mansion in Islamabads government quarters for security reasons.        
	Pakistans five-month-old government initially sought to calm militant violence by holding peace talks. But the initiatives have met with little success, and the government has since intensified military action against al Qaida- and Taliban-linked militants in northwestern Pakistan. The tribal region along the Afghan border is a rumoured hideout of Osama bin Laden.        
	The militants, who have been pounded by helicopter gunships, have threatened more suicide bombings unless the operations cease. In the last week, they have hit one of the countrys largest military installations, a hospital and a police station.

                                                                                                               Fields hero dies
                              Dith Pran                            
	New York, March 31 (AP): Dith Pran, the Cambodian-born journalist whose harrowing tale of enslavement and eventual escape from that countrys murderous Khmer Rouge revolutionaries in 1979 became the subject of the award-winning film The Killing Fields, died yesterday. He was 65.        
	Dith died at a New Jersey hospital yesterday morning of pancreatic cancer, according to Sydney Schanberg, his former colleague at The New York Times. Dith had been diagnosed almost three months ago.        
	Dith was working as an interpreter and assistant for Schanberg in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, when the Vietnam War reached its chaotic end in April 1975 and both countries were taken over by communist forces.        
	Schanberg helped Diths family get out but was forced to leave his friend behind after the capital fell; they were not reunited until Dith escaped four and a half years later. Eventually, Dith resettled in the US and went to work as a photographer for the Times.        
	It was Dith himself who coined the term killing fields for the horrifying clusters of corpses and skeletal remains of victims he encountered on his desperate journey to freedom.

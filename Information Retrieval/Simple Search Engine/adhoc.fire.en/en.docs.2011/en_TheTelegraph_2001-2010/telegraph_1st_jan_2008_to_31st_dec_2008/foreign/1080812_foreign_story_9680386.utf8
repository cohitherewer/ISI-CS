  - President vows to fight        NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                          Policemen in front of the National Assembly in Islamabad. (AP)                                        
	Islamabad, Aug. 11: Pakistans ruling coalition today set in motion the process to impeach President Pervez Musharraf for alleged misconduct, violation of the Constitution and financial irregularities.        
	However, Musharraf vowed to slug it out in the National Assembly which began a crucial session today.        
	The impeachment move gained momentum after the Punjab provincial Assembly voted overwhelmingly for a resolution asking him to quit or seek a vote of confidence in the parliament.        
	Ignoring mounting pressure from both friends and foes to quit before the National Assembly starts the impeachment process, Musharraf said he would prove false before the nation all the allegations levelled against him by the ruling coalition.        
	The 342-member National Assembly session started this evening as the Pakistan Peoples Party-led coalition said it has drawn up an unimpeachable chargesheet listing the allegations against Musharraf, who turned 65 today.        
	It will be an unimpeachable document supported by documentary evidence of all the acts of omission and commission committed by Musharraf that make him liable to impeachment several times, PPP spokesman Farhatullah Babar said.        
	In Lahore, Punjab law minister Rana Sanaullah moved the resolution against Musharraf. It was supported by 321 members in the 371-strong Assembly.        
	In a clear indication of the lack of support for the President among his allies, only 25 of the 84 Pakistan Muslim League (Q) members in the Punjab Assembly voted against the resolution.         
	The resolution is intended to crank up political pressure on Musharraf as the ruling coalition gears up to impeach him. Lawmakers chanted Go Musharraf Go! for several minutes, as the result was announced in Lahore. The other three provincial Assemblies are expected to tackle similar resolutions in the coming days.        
	Militants killed        
	Pakistani helicopter gunships attacked a militant hideout in a volatile tribal region today and killed around 50 insurgents, taking the death toll to nearly 160 in five days of fighting, officials said.        
	More than 100 militants and nine soldiers were killed in fighting sparked by an attack on a security checkpoint on Wednesday in Bajaur tribal region, near the Afghan border. Bajaur is a known sanctuary for al Qaida and Taliban militants.

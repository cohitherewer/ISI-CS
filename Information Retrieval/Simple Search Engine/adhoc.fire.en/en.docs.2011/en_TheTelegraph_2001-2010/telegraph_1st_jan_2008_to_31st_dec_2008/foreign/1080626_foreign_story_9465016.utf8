	Viva La Coldplay     
	 Los Angeles, June 24 (Reuters): British rock band Coldplays new album debuted at number one on the US pop music chart yesterday, largely bucking the sales slides that have affected other musicians, the groups label said.      
	Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends, Coldplays fourth album, sold more than 720,000 copies in the six days ending on Sunday, Capitol Records said. Its previous album, X amp;Y, also debuted at number one, selling 737,000 copies during its first week in June 2005. But total US album sales have fallen more than 20 per cent in that period, according to tracking firm Nielsen SoundScan. Stars have had to adjust their sights much lower as music piracy and competition from videogames take their toll.      
	The new Coldplay album also topped the charts in Britain, Japan, Australia, Canada, France and Germany, Capitol said. The single, Viva La Vida, is also number one in both the US and Britain.    
	Sharp work    
	 Madrid (AP): Canadian author Margaret Atwood has won the Prince of Asturias prize for letters. The jury has praised the 68-year-old for work that covers several genres with sharpness and irony. It says in a statement on Wednesday that Atwood defends the dignity of women and denounces situations of social injustice. Atwood has published more than 25 volumes of poetry, fiction and non-fiction.

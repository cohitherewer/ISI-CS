The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Voters feel euphoric
                                                                                                            Voters feel euphoric
                            
	New York, Feb. 5 (AP): Voters across the US took part in, and in many cases marvelled at, a political day today like none in American history  a 24-state, coast-to-coast scramble of presidential primaries and caucuses.        
	In an already unusual election, the first in more than half a century without a sitting President or Vice- President on the ballot, it was the first time such a broad swath of voters had a say at the same time in determining the finalists.        
	Phoenix resident Gina Nunez has never missed an election, primary or general, and found herself in the fellowship hall of a Methodist church to vote before anyone else in her precinct. Before the sun came up, for that matter.        
	She is 43 years old and knows the routine. Still, she said she could not wait to vote this time. This time, she said, it felt somehow different, more exhilarating.        
	It just feels like something new is going to happen, something differents going to happen with whoever we get, said Nunez, an elementary school curriculum coordinator who voted for Senator Barack Obama in the Arizona Democratic primary.        
	In Alaska, people in the community of Fort Yukon were braving some of the worst conditions of the winter to gather at an early-evening caucus in the lobby of a radio station. Yesterdays high temperature there: minus 48 degrees Celsius.        
	In lower Manhattan, voters faced the prospect of fighting through throngs of euphoric New York Giants football fans and a ticker-tape parade for the Super Bowl champions to cast ballots in the New York primary.        
	And in Meridian, Oklahoma, dozens of voters drove down a red clay road in light rain to the LeGrande family farm, where five voting booths were set up on an enclosed porch. I dont have any griping rights if I dont vote, Carol Stephens said there.

	Rome, Aug. 20: Senator Barack Obamas long lost brother has been tracked down for the first time living in a shanty town in Kenya, reports claimed.         
	 The Italian edition of Vanity Fair said that it had found George Hussein Onyango Obama living in a hut in a ramshackle town of Huruma on the outskirts of Nairobi.        
	 Obama, 26, the youngest of the presidential candidates half-brothers, spoke for the first time about his life, which could not be more different than that of the Democratic contender. No one knows who I am, he told the magazine, before claiming: I live here on less than a dollar a month.        
	According to Italys Vanity Fair his two metre by three metre shack is decorated with football posters of the Italian football giants AC Milan and Inter, as well as a calendar showing exotic beaches of the world.        
	Vanity Fair also noted that he had a front page newspaper picture of his famous brother  born of the same father as him, Barack Hussein Obama, but to a different mother, named only as Jael.         
	Embarrassed by his penury, he said that he does not does not mention his famous half-brother in conversation.

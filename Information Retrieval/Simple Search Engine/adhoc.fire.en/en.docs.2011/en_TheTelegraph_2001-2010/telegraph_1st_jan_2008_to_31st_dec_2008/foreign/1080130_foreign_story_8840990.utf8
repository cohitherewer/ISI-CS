	Beijing, Jan. 29 (Reuters): The widow of a disgraced lieutenant of Chairman Mao Zedong is seeking his rehabilitation 54 years after he committed suicide in jail accused of plotting to seize power.
    
	The death of Gao Gang, once Chinas economic tsar, in his prison cell in 1954 is a skeleton the Chinese Communist Party believes is best kept in the closet.
    
	Gaos widow, Li Liqun, 87, is seeking redressal on the grounds that Gao was made a scapegoat in the first leadership power struggle after the 1949 revolution, according to a copy of the widows letter to the current leadership obtained by Reuters.
    
	In her letter, Li argued that charges against her husband of opposing the Party and plotting to seize power were trumped up.
    
	Chinas state media have been silent on the sensitive issue to prevent Maos political halo from further losing its glow.
    
	Todays Chinese Communist Party cannot afford further chipping away at Maos reputation, said Roderick MacFarquhar, a Harvard University China scholar.
    
	While rehabilitation poses no threat to the partys grip on power, current leaders prefer to keep it under wraps because they draw political legitimacy from Mao, who is still revered by many in China as a demi-god despite the chaos and millions of deaths caused by his Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
    
	In her first interview with a foreign correspondent since her husbands death, Li said she hoped President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao would seek truth from facts.
    
	I know they have difficulties, Li, a card-carrying party member for 70 years, told Reuters in the living room of her run-down courtyard home in Beijing.
    
	As Chinas top state planner after the communist victory in 1949, Gao was a rising political star.
    
	A member of the partys decision-making Politburo, he was a vice-chairman of both the government and the Central Military Commission.
    
	But then Mao sought to use Gao to undermine a rival in the top leadership, telling him to investigate Liu Shaoqi, another central government vice-chairman who had angered Mao by refusing to embrace communism overnight and advocating retention of some aspects of capitalism.
    
	After widespread opposition in the party to purging Liu, Gao was made a sacrificial victim. Purged and detained, he took an overdose of sleeping pills, aged 49.
    
	Nonetheless Li, who credits Mao with bringing her and her husband together, has no desire to start a witch hunt. Her living room wall and bookshelves are bedecked with pictures of Mao, Premier Zhou Enlai and her husband happier times.
    
	I thank Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou for taking care of me and my family, said the widow. She broke into tears when recalling her past. The 100th anniversary of Gaos birth went unmarked in 2005, but the party allowed a new tombstone to be erected to replace one with no name.

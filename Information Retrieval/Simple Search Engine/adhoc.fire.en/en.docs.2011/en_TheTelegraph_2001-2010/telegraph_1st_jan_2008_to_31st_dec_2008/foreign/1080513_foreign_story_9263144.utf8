	Dhaka, May 12 (Reuters): Bangladesh will hold a parliamentary election in December and will start talks from May 22 with parties about how the vote will be held, the head of the interim government said today.        
	We are determined to hold a free, fair and credible election in the third week of December, for which the election commission will announce schedules at an appropriate time, Fakhruddin Ahmed said in a televised speech to the nation.        
	Fakhruddin, a former central back chief, said the army-backed interim government would hand over power to democratically elected politicians.         
	This will dispel any misgivings among the political parties about the time frame of the election, he said.        
	Fakhruddin, who assumed power in January 2007 after months of political violence, cancelled an election due within days and imposed a state of emergency and a ban on political activities.

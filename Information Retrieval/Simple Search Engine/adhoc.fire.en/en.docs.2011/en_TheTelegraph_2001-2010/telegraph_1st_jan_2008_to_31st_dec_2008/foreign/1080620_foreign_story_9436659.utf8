The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Al Gore electricity bill goes through roof
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Al Gore electricity bill goes through roof
          TOM LEONARD                          Hypocrite                                  
	New York, June 19: Environment campaigner Al Gore is using more electricity than ever despite pledging to cut consumption more than a year ago, a libertarian research group claims.         
	According to the Tennessee Centre for Policy Research (TCPR), the annual electricity usage at the former US Vice-Presidents large home in Nashville has risen by 10 per cent. Gores environmental activism inspired the Oscar-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth.         
	But the TCPR branded him a hypocrite in February 2007 after discovering that his eight-bathroom house in the Tennessee city consumed nearly 221,000 kilowatt-hours (KWh) of electricity in the previous year  more than 20 times the national average.         
	Gore responded by saying that he was in the process of giving the house a major energy-efficient makeover, fitting solar panels, low energy lightbulbs and a geothermal heating and cooling system.         
	However, the TPCR has got hold of his electricity bill again, this time comparing electricity consumption between the 12 months before June 2007, when it says he installed his new technology, and the year since then.         
	It says the figures show the Gore residence uses an average of 17,768 kWh per month  1,638 kWh more energy per month than before the renovations.         
	By comparison, the average American household consumes 11,040 kWh in an entire year, according to the Energy Information Administration.         
	Drew Johnson, the TCPRs president, said: A mans commitment to his beliefs is best measured by what he does behind the closed doors of his own home.

	Bangkok, April 25 (AFP): A 51-year-old Australian man who swallowed 60 condoms stuffed with hashish has died in a southern Thailand hospital , police said today.        
	 John Paul Jones died in Surat Thani Hospital on April 19 from internal infections after some of the condoms burst while he was smuggling the drugs to sell at the famous Full Moon beach party on Ko Phangan, near Ko Samui. Both islands are popular tourist destinations.        
	 Jones was rushed to hospital on April 11 by his friends. Doctors treating him for stomach pains found the drug-filled condoms in his intestine, some of which had apparently burst days earlier. Since he was hospitalised the doctor said his condition was 50-50.

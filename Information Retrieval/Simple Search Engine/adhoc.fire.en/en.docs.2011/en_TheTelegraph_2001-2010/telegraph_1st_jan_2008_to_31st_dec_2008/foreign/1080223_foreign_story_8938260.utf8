The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Underwear goes unisex
                                                                                                               Underwear goes unisex
                            
	Stockholm, Feb. 22 (AP): Sweden, a champion of gender equality, plans to introduce unisex underwear for hospital patients in a move designed to save both money and space, the project leader said.        
	The Swedish Standards Institute has developed a new style of boxer-style underwear that is considered equally suitable for male and female patients. Swedish hospitals currently have four different models of underwear.        
	Switching to one model will save money because hospitals can buy greater quantities at a better price, project leader Tuula Cammersand said yesterday. A lot of people have complained that the different types take up a lot of space because you need all the different models, she said.

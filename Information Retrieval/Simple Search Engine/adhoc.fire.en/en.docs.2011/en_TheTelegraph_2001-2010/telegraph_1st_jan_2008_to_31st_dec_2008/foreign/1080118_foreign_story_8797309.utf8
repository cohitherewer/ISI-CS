	Geneva, Jan. 17 (Reuters): Saudi Arabia, appearing for the first time before a UN womens rights panel today, faced tough questions over restrictions on virtually every aspect of a womans life in the kingdom.
    
	The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women monitors adherence to a 1979 international bill of rights for women.
    
	The Saudi delegation came under repeated fire during the debate for the system of male guardianship which requires women to seek permission to travel, work, or see a doctor.
    
	Only when women are free to make their own decisions on all aspects of their life are they full citizens, committee member Maria Regina Tavares da Silva said.
    
	Heisoo Shin, another expert, said that patriarchal rules governed virtually every aspect of a womans life in Saudi Arabia. Without a mans consent, a woman cannot study or get health service, work or marry.

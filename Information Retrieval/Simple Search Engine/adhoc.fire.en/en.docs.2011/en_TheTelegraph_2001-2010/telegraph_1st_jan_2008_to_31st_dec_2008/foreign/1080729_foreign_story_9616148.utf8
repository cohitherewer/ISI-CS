                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Students call off protest over Hindi oath

	Kathmandu, July 28: Agitating students called off their five-day protest against Vice-President Parmananda Jha for taking the oath of office in Hindi.        
	The supreme court issued notices to both Jha and the government of Nepal asking them to submit written explanations on the swearing-in ceremony within seven days.         
	The ruling comes after a writ petition was filed by lawyer Bal Krishna Neupane seeking the annulment of the oath taken by Jha.        
	The students, who had disrupted traffic all over Nepal for five days, called off the protests after the court notices.         
	In a joint statement, the eight student unions said that the strike had been withdrawn considering the countrys sensitive political situation. They also submitted a memorandum to President Ram Baran Yadav demanding an apology from Jha. The Vice-President has said his swearing-in was an attempt to promote the inclusion of Hindi as an official language in Nepal.        
	At least 30 Tibetan protesters were arrested today near the Nepal-China border as they were trying to march back to Tibet.

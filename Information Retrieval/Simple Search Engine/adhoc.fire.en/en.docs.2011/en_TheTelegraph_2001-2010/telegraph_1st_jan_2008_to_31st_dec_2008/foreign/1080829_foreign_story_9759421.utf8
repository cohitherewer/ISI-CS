          MICHAEL POWELL                          Martin Luther King Jr delivers his I Have a Dream speech in Washington DC on August 28,1963                                  
	Denver, Aug. 28: She figured this dream for dead so many decades ago.         
	Dezie Woods-Jones plans to stand with her California delegation in a stadium here and listen to Barack Obama, the first black major-party presidential nominee in the nations history, give his acceptance speech. Woods-Jones, now in her 60s, is one of a tiny handful of delegates who on the same day in 1963, August 28, stood with hundreds of thousands at the March on Washington and heard a young minister, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., deliver his soaring I Have a Dream speech.        
	I was young, naive enough to think I would see that in 5, 10 years, she said. Then you see leaders killed, you see police brutality, residential segregation in cities. About 10 years ago I thought: I wont see this. This is something for my grandchildren.        
	She paused, her eyes now red-rimmed. What to say except, Oh, hallelujah! she said. We have a lot of work, a lot, but we are so much closer than I expected.        
	These veterans of the March on Washington are the living connective tissue to the America of 1963, when the police in some cities and towns still beat blacks with truncheons, and the story of their journey is as complicated as race itself.         
	At least five veterans of that march travelled to Denver this week as Democratic delegates, among them Representative John Lewis of Georgia, who is the last man alive of the 10 who spoke that day at the Lincoln Memorial.         
	This son of sharecroppers, who was almost beaten to death by police officers in Selma, Alabama, when he marched with civil rights activists across a bridge, stood on a sun-splashed street in Denver and considered the distance travelled.        
	His bald head still bears near half-century-old scars.         
	Weve had disappointments since then, but if someone told me I would be here, Lewis said, shaking that head. When people say nothing has changed, I feel like saying: Come walk in my shoes.         
	Many veterans of the march will gather at televisions in their living rooms or sit with friends and old comrades and watch an event they would have considered impossible not just in 1963, but perhaps in 1983, or 1993. Theirs is often a cautious optimism; time has left them with a sense of the provisional nature of progress.               
	David R. Jones, now president of the Community Service Society in New York, recalled milling about in Washington in 1963, a 15-year-old there with classmates from a lefty school in Manhattan. Then King began to speak, and they fell quiet. I never saw that kind of a speech, Jones said. He was transported. But the years ahead often cast a deep shadow. Jones, who is black, was beaten by the side of the road in Maine. He fought for decades to integrate middle-class housing developments and saw young whites wave watermelons at black marchers in Brooklyn.

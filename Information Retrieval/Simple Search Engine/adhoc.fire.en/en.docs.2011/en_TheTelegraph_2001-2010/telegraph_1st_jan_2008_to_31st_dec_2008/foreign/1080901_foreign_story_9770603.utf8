                              Winehouse                            
	London, Aug. 31: Amy Winehouse has been threatened with legal action after pulling out of a concert in Paris hours before she was due to headline it.         
	The troubled singer failed to show up at the Rock En Seine festival in Paris after she was taken ill at her home in London and was unable to travel to France.         
	Organisers of the festival said they were given just two hours notice that Winehouse would not be appearing and that there was no explanation of the exact reasons for her absence.         
	A statement posted on the festival website said organisers had decided to start legal proceedings against her because of the circumstances of her cancellation.         
	It said: We were told by (Winehouses) agent at 8pm that she would not be there, and we were forced to cancel the performance. We have still not been given any explanation of the exact reasons for her absence.         
	Winehouse had been due to arrive at the venue  the Saint Cloud park just outside Paris  on Friday evening to top a bill that included the Raconteurs, The Streets and Kate Nash.         
	The statement continued: We are very sorry about this situation and share the disappointment of the festival-goers.         
	Winehouses spokesperson declined to comment on the threat of legal action. He said: Amy Winehouse is currently at home recovering. The illness is nothing serious, nothing that some time in bed and not singing wont cure.        
	Her next performance is on September 6 when she is due to headline the Bestival festival on the Isle of Wight. Her spokesperson confirmed that she would still be honouring this commitment.         
	Last month Winehouse collapsed at home and had to be taken to hospital after a reaction to medication. In June it emerged that she has developed the chronic lung disease emphysema. Despite her ill health she performed later that week at Nelson Mandelas birthday concert in Hyde Park and later at Glastonbury, V Festival and T in the Park.

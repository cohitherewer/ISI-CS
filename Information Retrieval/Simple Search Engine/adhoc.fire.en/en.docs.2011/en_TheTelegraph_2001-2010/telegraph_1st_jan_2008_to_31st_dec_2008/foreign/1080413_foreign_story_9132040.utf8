The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Ian Fleming got help from his own Moneypenny
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Ian Fleming got help from his own Moneypenny
                              Fleming: Trusted aide                            
	London, April 12 (AP): It turns out that macho James Bond creator Ian Fleming got a little help from an unexpected source  a real life Miss Moneypenny whom he turned to for advice on plot points and character development.        
	A series of letters between Fleming and Jean Frampton  a typist-turned-adviser  was sold to an anonymous private collector yesterday for more than 14,000.        
	The novelist and the typist never met, but over time she became a trusted aide to Fleming, who was working in London as a newspaper editor in the 1950s when he dreamed up the Bond character.        
	At first, Frampton limited her advice to spelling mistakes and minor inconsistencies, but over time she took a more assertive role and gave Fleming substantial guidance on plot and character development, said Amy Brenan, as assistant auctioneer at Dukes of Dorchester, which sold the packet of letters.        
	 I think its fair to say that Ian Fleming and 007 come across sometimes as misogynistic, but there was none of that in his relationship with Frampton, Brenan said. They had an intellectual relationship on a very literary level and she provided some inspiration and he put her into the character of Miss Moneypenny        
	The letters show Fleming to be insecure and uneasy about the early drafts of his novels as he sought Framptons help. Asking for advice on Thunderball, for example, he apologises for giving her such a weak effort. I am afraid this is not a good transcript and I would be deeply obliged if you would apply your usual keen mind to any points that might help the book get into shape.

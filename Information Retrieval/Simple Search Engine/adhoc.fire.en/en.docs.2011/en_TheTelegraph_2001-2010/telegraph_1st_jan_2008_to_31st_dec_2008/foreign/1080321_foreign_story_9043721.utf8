The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Japan names cartoon envoy
                                                                                                               Japan names cartoon envoy
                            
	Tokyo, March 20 (AP): Japan has created an unusual government post to promote animation, and named a perfect figure to the position: Doraemon.        
	Foreign minister Masahiko Komura appointed the popular cartoon robot cat as anime ambassador yesterday, handing a human-sized Doraemon doll an official certificate at an inauguration ceremony. Komura told the doll, with an unidentified person inside, that he hoped he would widely promote Japanese animated cartoons, or anime.        
	 Doraemon, I hope you will travel around the world as an anime ambassador to deepen peoples understanding of Japan so they will become friends with Japan, Komura told the blue-and-white cat.

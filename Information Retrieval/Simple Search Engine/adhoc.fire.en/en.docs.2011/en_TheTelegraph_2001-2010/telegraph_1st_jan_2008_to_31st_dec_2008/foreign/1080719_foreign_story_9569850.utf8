	Thimphu, July 18 (Reuters): Bhutans parliament endorsed the countrys first Constitution today, formally turning the former absolute monarchy into a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarchy.        
	The 27-year-old king, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, signed the first copy of the Constitution, using a wooden pen dipped in golden ink inside a 17th century fortress after parliament had ratified it.        
	His father, Bhutans fourth King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, not only surrendered power without a struggle, but actually imposed democracy against the will of many of his subjects before abdicating in favour of his Oxford-educated son in 2006.        
	The Himalayan nation held its first general election in March, and the result shocked Bhutan after the Druk Phuensum Tshogpa won 45 seats, leaving the Peoples Democratic Party, run by the kings relatives by marriage, with only two seats. On this day of destiny, in the blessed land of Pelden Drukpa (glorious Bhutan) we, a fortunate people and king, hereby resolve to bring into effect the root and foundation  the very source  of all law in our nation, the fifth king said.         
	This is the peoples Constitution.        
	The kings father, ministers and lawmakers looked on as he endorsed the new document. Colourfully dressed monks chanted prayers in a ceremony shown live on national television.        
	The historic day is not a celebration but a solemn occasion to invoke and offer prayers for peace and prosperity of Bhutan, chairman of the Constitution drafting committee Sonam Tobgye said, adding: It is an achievement of the wishes of our monarchs and aspiration of the Bhutanese people.        
	The Constitution was open for public viewing after the signing.

                              Madoff: Violation of trust                            
	London, Dec. 24: A French investment manager who entrusted $2.1 billion with Bernard Madoff was found dead in New York yesterday.         
	Thierry de la Villehuchet is thought to have committed suicide. He was found early yesterday morning in his office on Madison Avenue by a security guard.         
	He was found at his desk with both wrists slashed, with a box cutter (similar to an utility knife) and a bottle of sleeping pills on the floor, according to the Associated Press, citing NYPD spokesman Paul Browne.         
	Villehuchet, 65, was the co-founder and chief executive of Access International Advisors, a fund management company. A friend of Villehuchet told the news agency AFP that he had been managing about $2 billion or European clients, of which three quarters had been invested with Madoff.         
	He was devastated as news of the $50 billion Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Madoff  the biggest corporate fraud in history  emerged, and he feared clients would turn against him in the courts.         
	He had been trying for a week to recover at least $1.5 billion in European funds that Access International had invested through Madoffs business, The Wall Street Journal reported.         
	Earlier in his career, Villehuchet worked for the capital markets division of Credit Lyonnais SA as founder, chairman and chief executive officer of Credit Lyonnais Securities (USA).         
	Villehuchet founded Access in 1994 with Patrick Littaye. One of the firms partners was Philippe Junot, the former husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco, according to marketing documents.         
	Prince Michel of Yugoslavia is an investor relations executive, according to the documents. He was married without children.         
	Access was his whole life, and Madoff was a manager in whom he had complete trust. I lunched with him two weeks ago and he said, how lucky it was that Madoff was the only manager still doing well at the moment, the friend told AFP.         
	Madoffs fraud has claimed victims including some of the worlds biggest banks, wealthy individuals and philanthropists, and families who had trusted him with their life savings.         
	LOreal heiress        
	Liliane Bettencourt, the worlds wealthiest woman and heiress to the LOreal empire, entrusted part of her $22.9 billion fortune to Madoff through Villehuchet. Bettencourt, the daughter of LOreal founder Eugene Schueller, was the first investor in a fund managed by Access International Advisors.

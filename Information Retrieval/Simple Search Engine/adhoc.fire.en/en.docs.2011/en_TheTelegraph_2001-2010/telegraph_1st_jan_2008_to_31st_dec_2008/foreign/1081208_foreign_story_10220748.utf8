  - First glimpse of largest initiative since Eisenhower plan        MICHAEL D. SHEAR                          A laid-off worker protesting outside a soon-to-be-closed factory in Chicago. (AFP)                                        
	Washington, Dec. 7: President-elect Barack Obama yesterday offered the first glimpse of what would be the largest public works programme sin-ce President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the federal interstate system in the 1950s.        
	Obama said the massive government spending programme he proposes to lift the country out of economic recession will include a renewed effort to make public buildings energy-efficient, rebuild the nations highways, renovate aging schools and install computers in classrooms, extend high-speed Internet to underserved areas and modernise hospitals by giving them access to electronic medical records.        
	We need to act with the urgency this moment demands to save or create at least two-and-a half million jobs so that the nearly 2 million Americans whove lost them know that they have a future, Obama said in his weekly address.        
	Obama offered few details and no cost estimate for the investment in public infrastructure. But it is intended to be part of a broader effort to stimulate economic activity that will also include tax cuts for middle-class Americans and direct aid to state governments to forestall layoffs as programmes shrink.        
	House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called for spending between $400 billion and $500 billion on the overall package. Some Senate Democrats and other economists have suggested spending even more  potentially $1 trillion.        
	On Friday, the government reported that 533,000 jobs were eliminated in November, the largest one-month drop since 1974, raising unemployment to 6.7 per cent. And last week, the National Bureau of Economic Research officially declared that the country has been in a recession since last December.        
	Governors praised Obamas proposals, saying their states stand ready with billions of dollars worth of road and school projects that could be started quickly with an infusion of federal cash. At a meeting with Obama in Philadelphia last week, governors estimated that there are $136 billion worth of projects that are ready to go once money rolls in.        
	Here in Virginia, we have more than a billion dollars in ready-to-go bridge, highway, rail, transit, port and airport projects that have been through appropriate local, regional and state planning processes and that can be under contract within 180 days, governor Timothy M. Kaine said in a statement.        
	Maryland governor Martin Malley said the plan would help keep people employed and create new jobs, (and) it would allow us to deliver infrastructure improvements that will last beyond the immediate economic crisis and benefit generations to come.        
	In keeping with the secrecy that surrounds the development of his recovery plan, Obama has given the governors no commitment about how much money they would receive for such projects. But Pennsylvania governor Edward G. Rendell, chairman of the National Governors Association, said yesterday he was not worried.        
	Is it going to be big or little? Its going to be big, Rendell said. I have no doubt that its going to be substantial. (Obama) didnt blink an eye when we talked about $136 billion.

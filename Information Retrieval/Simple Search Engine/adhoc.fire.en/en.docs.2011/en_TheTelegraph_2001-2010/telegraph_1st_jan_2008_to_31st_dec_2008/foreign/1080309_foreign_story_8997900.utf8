	Kuala Lumpur, March 8 (AP): The leader of Malaysias ethnic Indian party in the ruling coalition is likely to lose his parliamentary seat in todays general elections, an aide to the minister said.        
	Works minister Samy Vellu, the only Indian in the cabinet, was heading for a defeat in Sungai Siput constituency in northern Malaysia against a candidate from the Opposition Peoples Justice Party, said the aide speaking on condition of anonymity because the officials results were not out yet.        
	Samy, who heads the Malaysian Indian Congress party, has faced heavy criticism in recent months from minority ethnic Indians who accuse him of failing to protect their religious rights or lift them from chronic poverty.

               Benazir Bhutto
              
	London, Feb. 3 (PTI): Benazir Bhutto had named in an autobiography the 16-year-old son of Osama bin Laden as the leader of one of the four gangs of designated assassins who wanted to kill her in suicide attacks.
    
	I was told by both the Musharraf regime and a foreign Muslim government that four suicide bomber squads would attempt to kill me, she said in the autobiography, excerpts of which were carried by The Sunday Times, London.
    
	These were squads sent by the Taliban warlord Baitullah Mehsuid; Hamza bin Laden, a son of Osama bin Laden; Red Mosque militants; and a Karachi-based militant group, she was quoted as saying.
    
	The book, Reconciliation: Islam, Democracy and the West, will be published in the second week of this month, the report said.
    
	Bhutto, who was killed on December 27 last year after addressing a rally in Rawalpindi, said President Pervez Musharrafs regime knew of the specific threats against me, including the names and numbers of those who planned to kill me, and the names of others  including those in his own inner circle and in his party  whom we believed were conspiring.
    
	Despite our request, we received no reports on what actions were taken before my arrival in Pakistan from self-imposed exile) as a follow-up to these warnings.
    
	The naming of bin Ladens teenage son appears to bolster intelligence claims that Hamza is being groomed as a future leader of al Qaida. 
    
	Bhuttos book also describes how a suicide bomb attack on her motorcade in Karachi when she returned home last October may have been carried out by a would-be assassin who lined the clothes of a toddler with plastic explosive to turn the child into a bomb.
    
	India also figures in the book. The country rose as a regional and international power because its middle class exploded into a huge economic and political force, Bhutto wrote.
    
	Democracy cannot be sustained in the absence of a stable and growing middle class. The growth of India into a regional and international economic power occurred  not coincidentally  as its middle class exploded into a huge economic and political force, Bhutto said.

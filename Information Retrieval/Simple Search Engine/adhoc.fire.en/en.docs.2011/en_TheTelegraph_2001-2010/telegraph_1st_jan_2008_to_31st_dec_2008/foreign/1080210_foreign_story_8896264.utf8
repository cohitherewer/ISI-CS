The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Google-powered phones unveiled
                                                                                                               Google-powered phones unveiled
  - Search engine plants stake in wireless World to rival iPhone
                              A prototype of the Google Android mobile phone developed by British firm ARM in Barcelona. (Reuters)                            
	Dallas, Feb. 12 (AP): A handful of chip makers showed yesterday how a mobile device running Google Incs Android operating system might look.        
	Consumers will not get a chance to buy such a phone for several more months at least  the demonstrations were strictly using prototype phones. But the unveilings at an industry conference in Spain marked a big step in Googles campaign to plant a stake in the wireless world. While it has not yet announced a phone to rival Apple Incs iPhone, it is hoping to sell search advertising to people using cellphones, augmenting its revenue from ads delivered to their computers.        
	Android is based on open-source code, unlike competing operating systems from Microsoft Corp, Research In Motion Ltd, Palm Inc and Symbian, owned by Nokia Corp, the worlds largest mobile phone maker, and other major phone makers.        
	Google has lined up about 30 phone, chip and software companies to help develop momentum behind Android.        
	Among the companies that demonstrated use of Android yesterday at the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona was Texas Instruments Inc, the largest maker of chips for cellphones.         
	Its prototype offers one-button access to Web browsing, email, messaging and video.        
	Greg Delagi, general manager of Texas Instruments wireless business, said increased audio, video and global-positioning functions and a better Web-surfing experience will drive handset sales, which would help Dallas-based TI sell more chips.        
	People are doing crazy new things with mobile communications, Delagi said. I want you to buy a new cellphone because youve absolutely got to have some new capability. PLC, and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. also are demonstrating systems using Android at the Barcelona show.        
	Nokias Symbian has a large chunk of the worldwide operating system market for upscale smart phones, but the consumer smart phone market has picked up in the past year with the popularity of the iPhone and some less-expensive devices.        
	Google has a significant opportunity because of the lack of a dominating player in the market for consumer operating systems for smart phones, said Hughes de la Vergne, an analyst with technology research firm Gartner Inc. He estimated Symbians share of the US market at 2 to 3 per cent.        
	The critical aspect will be getting prices of devices down, said de la Vergne, adding that as an open-source system, Android might have cost advantages. He said Google would also benefit by having major North American phone companies such as Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile in its alliance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Vitamin D link to back pain
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Vitamin D link to back pain
                            
	New York, May 27 (Reuters): Older women who arent getting enough vitamin D appear to be at risk for suffering from back pain, a new research shows.        
	Given that low vitamin D status is fairly prevalent in older adults and that there are significant functional consequences to untreated chronic pain, these findings argue strongly for querying adults about their pain and potentially screening older women with significant back pain for vitamin D deficiency, Gregory E. Hicks of the University of Delaware in Newark and his colleagues write.        
	Among older people, vitamin D deficiency has been tied to a number of health problems, including an increased risk of bone fracture, Hicks and his colleagues note in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. Lack of the vitamin could also, theoretically, contribute to musculoskeletal pain, they add, although research on vitamin D deficiency and pain syndromes has yielded mixed results.        
	To investigate the relationship, Hicks and his colleagues looked at blood levels of vitamin D in 958 people 65 and older. Fifty-eight per cent of the women in the study, and 27 per cent of the men, had at least some moderate pain in at least one region of the body.        
	For men, there was no relationship between vitamin D levels and pain. Women with vitamin D deficiency, on the other hand, were nearly twice as likely to have back pain that was moderate or worse, but vitamin D status wasnt related to pain in other body parts.        
	The gender and back-specific effects of vitamin D found in the study could be because lack of the vitamin can cause osteomalacia, or bone softening, which is more common in women and often manifests itself as low back pain, the researchers say.

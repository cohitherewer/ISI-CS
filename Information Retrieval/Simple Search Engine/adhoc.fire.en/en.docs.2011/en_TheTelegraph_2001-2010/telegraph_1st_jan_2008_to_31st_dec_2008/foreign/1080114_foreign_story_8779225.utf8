	Paris, Jan. 13: Nicolas Sarkozy is paying a heavy political price for his very public wooing of the former supermodel Carla Bruni, a poll has revealed.
    
	A poll published in Le Figaro yesterday showed public confidence in the French President had dipped to 49 per cent after hitting 64 per cent six months ago.
    
	Although the romance appears to be a turn-off for the French public, that has done nothing to dampen the fevered speculation. Sarkozy could become the first French leader to marry in office since Napoleon wed Josephine. 
    
	Rumours that Bruni was pregnant circulated widely after she was allegedly seen leaving the exclusive American Hospital in Sarkozys former fiefdom of Neuilly, though the news organisation behind the reports dropped the claim, which appeared to have been generated by an Internet blogger.
    
	There were reports that the couple had already married, possibly as a result of Sarkozys claim that the first people would know about the wedding was after it had taken place.
    
	But Christophe Barbier, a friend of Bruni, said: The President wont be able to resist the temptation to get a political and media advantage from staging a public wedding, especially if he is in difficulty politically with the upcoming municipal elections in March. The wedding represents a cartridge he wont want to waste. 
    
	Barbier suggested on May 16, the first anniversary of the day Sarkozy became President, as a possible wedding date. 
    
	Diplomatic complications are also increasing the pressure on Sarkozy to marry. 
    
	Saudi Arabia, where he starts a three-nation tour of Gulf Arab states today, sent a private diplomatic note to the French foreign ministry stating that it would be unacceptable for Bruni to accompany the President if they were not married.
    
	India is also in a fix over how to accommodate them on an official trip later this month, after their much-publicised trip to Luxor drew criticism from Egyptian MPs when it emerged they shared a room.

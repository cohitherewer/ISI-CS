	Dubai, July 15 (AP): Authorities in the Persian Gulf tourist haven of Dubai are cracking down on topless sunbathing, nudity and other forms of indecent behaviour on beaches and have detained 79 people in recent days.        
	Along with beach patrols by undercover and uniformed police, the Dubai municipality has embarked on a public awareness campaign to remind western tourists and foreign residents that this Arab city-state with a western outlook is a Muslim country in the traditionally conservative Gulf.        
	Police have detained 79 people over two weeks for disturbing families enjoying the beach with their behaviour, Zuhair Haroun, a spokesman for Dubais Criminal Investigation Department, said yesterday.        
	Haroun did not elaborate on the nature of the acts in question, but the crackdown started days after police detained two British nationals  a man and a woman  allegedly discovered having sex on the beach.        
	Thousands of European and Asian expatriates live and work in Dubai, one of seven semi-independent states that form the United Arab Emirates, a conservative Muslim country.        
	Foreigners vastly outnumber native Arab citizens in Dubai, the regions business hub and an increasingly popular destination for western tourists. The police campaign will also target those bothering sunbathers and other beachgoers with acts deemed offensive, immoral or disrespectful, said Dubais acting police chief, Major General Khamis Mattar al-Mazeina. That includes loitering and voyeurism, he said.        
	Public beaches will soon have signs warning tourists in Arabic, English and several other languages against topless sunbathing, as well as changing clothes and other indecent behaviour, an official with the Dubai Municipality said yesterday.        
	Authorities are taking action in response to numerous complaints filed by people who visit the citys beaches, said Abdullah Mohammed Rafia, the assistant director general for the environment and public health at the Dubai Municipality.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Beijing posts wanted list
                                                                                                               Beijing posts wanted list
                            
	Beijing, March 22 (Agencies): China has issued a Most Wanted list of 21 rioters who were shown in grainy photos waving knives and fighting in Lhasa earlier this month.         
	Yesterday, Chinese authorities intensified a manhunt for the wanted suspects, posting their photos taken from video cameras and security footage on major Internet portals.        
	Shown under the heading of Lhasa Public Security Bureaus Wanted List of Criminal Suspects, the 21 people are accused of endangering national security, and cited for beating, smashing, looting and arson.         
	One suspect is shown wielding a long sword and another is a moustached man who had been shown on news programmes slashing another with a foot-long blade.        
	The official Xinhua News Agency said two of the 21 suspects had already been arrested and a third turned himself in. Authorities called on the public for assistance, offering rewards for information and guaranteeing the anonymity of tipsters.        
	So far, police have arrested 24 and another 170 turned themselves in, Xinhua said. The protests in Lhasa, a stunning show of defiance against 57 years of Chinese rule, had sparked sympathy demonstrations in neighbouring provinces, prompting Beijing to deploy thousands of troops across a wide swath of western China where more than half of Chinas 5.4 million Tibetans live.        
	Moving from town to town, police set up blockades and checkpoints to keep Tibetans in and journalists out.

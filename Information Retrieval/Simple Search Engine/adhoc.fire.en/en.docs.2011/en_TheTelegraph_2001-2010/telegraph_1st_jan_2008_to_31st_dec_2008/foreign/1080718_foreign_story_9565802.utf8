	London, July 17 (PTI): Prof. Stephen Hawking has no plans to leave Cambridge University and move to Canada, a senior professor has said.        
	Hawking did not have any plans to leave Cambridge, said Peter Haynes, head of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.        
	There was speculation that Hawking was considering leaving Cambridge and move to Canada.         
	Stephen has made an enormously important contribution to Cambridge over the last 40 years, both as a scientific leader in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and, more generally, as an inspirational communicator of science and mathematics to the wider public.        
	We expect this contribution to continue for several years to come. The department and the university are working together with Hawking to establish activities that continue his important contributions in the long term, Haynes said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Israel: Attacks can last weeks

	Gaza, Dec. 30 (Reuters): Israel hit the Gaza Strip with more air strikes today and said its military action could last weeks, while rockets fired by Hamas militants struck deep inside the Jewish state.        
	Both sides rejected any notion of a ceasefire soon, three days after Israeli leaders launched bombing raids with the declared aim of halting rocket salvoes from the Hamas-controlled coastal enclave. None of us can say how long it will take, Israeli President Shimon Peres said after being briefed at the defence ministry.        
	Defence minister Ehud Barak said Israel, which is blockading Gaza, was gathering ground forces at the frontier and would expand its operation as much as is necessary to stop the rocket fire and deal a heavy blow to Hamas.        
	Despite winter rain  weather that could impede any ground incursions  Israeli warplanes pressed on for the fourth day with attacks on Hamas targets, killing 12 Palestinians. They included sisters aged four and 11.        
	Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbass Fatah faction in fighting in June 2007. It has rejected international demands to recognise Israel, renounce violence and accept existing interim peace deals.        
	Mushir al-Masri, a Hamas official, said: We are not begging for calm and there is no room to talk about calm amid the continued aggression and siege. Rockets fired from the Gaza Strip struck outside the Israeli towns of Kiryat Malachi and Rahat, a bedouin community near the southern city of Beersheba.

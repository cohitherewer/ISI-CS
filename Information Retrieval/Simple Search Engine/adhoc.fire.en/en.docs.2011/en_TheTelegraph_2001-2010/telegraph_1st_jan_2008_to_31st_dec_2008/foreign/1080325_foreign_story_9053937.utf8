The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Royalist Bhutan party sweeps polls
                                                                                                               Royalist Bhutan party sweeps polls

	Thimpu, March 24 (Agencies): The Druk Phuensum Tshogpa (DPT) party, led by former Prime Minister Jigmi Thinley, today swept the first parliamentary elections ever in this secluded Himalayan kingdom, taking nearly every seat in the new legislature, the election commissioner said today.        
	The DPT took 44 of the 47 seats in the new parliament, said election commissioner Kunzang Wangdi. Their opponents, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), won just 3 seats. Turnout was slightly more than 79 per cent of the 320,000 registered voters, he said.        
	Several DPT candidates have been ministers under King Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck.        
	The results, which will not be official until tomorrow morning, came just hours after the polls closed. There were no reports of violence.         
	The PDP is headed by Sangay Ngedup who has been a Prime Minister in former king Jigme Singye Wangchuks regime. Indian electronic voting machines were used in the elections.        
	But like much else in the mountainous land  long known as a quirky holdout from modernity, allowing television and the Internet only in 1999  todays vote came with a twist: It was the king, not the people, who pressed for democracy.        
	His Majesty is like our father. We all prefer our father, said Karma Tsheweng, a 35-year-old mechanic.        
	But Tsheweng and hundreds of thousands of others nonetheless lined up at polling stations across the Land of the Thunder Dragon to vote today, excited at getting to try something new, but nervous about what may happen after they traded their Precious Ruler for politicians.        
	Even in remote corners of the largely rural country  in tiny hamlets where voting machines were delivered by yak  elections were going smoothly, officials said earlier today. The Bhutanese have reason to be ambivalent. The tiny country of about 600,000 people has prospered under royal rule  its fast-growing economy is slowly lifting many people out of poverty and nearly everyone has access to schools and hospitals.        
	The success contrasts with other South Asian countries such as Nepal or Bangladesh, which can seem like case studies in democracy gone wrong.         
	The process was started by Jigme Wangchuck, who abdicated in favour of his son Jigme Khesar Wangchuck in December 2006. The Bhutanese people regularly refer to both as His Majesty.        
	There was much resistance when His Majesty told us that we must decide our future if Bhutan was to prosper, said Karma Dorji, a 55-year-old civil servant who was waiting to vote.        
	That was in late 2006, and since then, we have come to see that this is an opportunity he has given us because he is farsighted and wise. Still, he said: We prefer our king.        
	Apart from trepidation about the future, the campaign for the 47-seat National Assembly has also been baffling for many in a society that frowns on self promotion and open criticism. Why do we need these people and their arguments? asked 48-year-old Kinzang Tshering after listening to one candidate make his spiel days before the vote. They tell us they are better than the other ones. How should I know which one is better?        
	It is hard to tell. The two political parties both hew closely to the kings vision. Both feature leaders who served twice as Prime Minister under royal rule. Both say they will follow the governments latest five-year plan.

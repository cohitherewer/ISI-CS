          RICHARD ALLEYNE                                             
	London, May 16: Jodie Foster has reportedly ended her long-term relationship with movie producer Cydney Bernard  just months after coming out as her girlfriend. The Oscar-winning actress called off the relationship with her partner of 14 years after a series of rows, it is believed.         
	Their alleged split comes just five months after Foster publicly acknowledged for the first time that they were an item by paying tribute to Bernard at an awards ceremony.         
	The couple met on the set of the 1993 movie Sommersby in which 45-year-old Foster starred with Richard Gere and their relationship has been an open secret ever since.         
	But it was during an acceptance speech at a Los Angeles film gala in December that Foster first spoke about Bernard, calling her: My beautiful Cydney, who sticks with me through the rotten and the bliss.

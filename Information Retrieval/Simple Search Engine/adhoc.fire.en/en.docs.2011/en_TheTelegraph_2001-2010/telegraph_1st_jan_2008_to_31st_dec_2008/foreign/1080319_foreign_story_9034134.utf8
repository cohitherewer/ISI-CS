          GARY CLELAND                              
	London, March 18: A penthouse flat has been bought for a reported 115 million (Rs 920 crore), breaking the world record for the most expensive home ever sold.        
	The flat, at 8 St Jamess Square, London, has not been built yet and the development was only given planning permission by Westminster city council last week. The development will consist of the penthouse and five other flats, each occupying an entire floor of the building.         
	The building, a 1930s office block, and the house next door, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, were bought for 125 million in November 2007 by Achilleas Kallakis, the Greek shipping tycoon.        
	The cost of the flat beats the previous record of 100 million (Rs 800 crore), set a few weeks ago by another unbuilt penthouse, at the development known as One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, London.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

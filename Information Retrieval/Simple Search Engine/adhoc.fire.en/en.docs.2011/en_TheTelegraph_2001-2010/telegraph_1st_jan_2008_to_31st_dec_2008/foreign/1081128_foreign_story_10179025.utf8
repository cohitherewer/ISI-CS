	Islamabad, Nov 28 (PTI): Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani today accepted a request from his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh to send the ISI chief to India for sharing of information related to the terrorist attack in Mumbai.        
	The Prime Minsters spokesman Zahid Bashir said Singh had made a request to Gilani, asking him to send the ISI chief to India to quot;co-operate in the investigation of the Mumbai attacks and for sharing certain information quot;.              
	Bashir told PTI: quot;The Pakistani Prime Minister accepted this offer. The two sides will work out modalities for the visit of the Inter Services Intelligence chief which is expected to take place soon. quot; Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha was recently appointed chief of the ISI by Pakistan Army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.              
	This would be the first instance of a chief of Pakistans spy agency visiting India in connection with the investigation of a terror attack.              
	Gilani had earlier said he was quot;really hurt quot; over the loss of innocent lives in Mumbai. quot;And from the people of Pakistan, and from the government of Pakistan, I really want to share the sorrows with the people of India and the government of India, quot; he told CNN.              
	Singh had yesterday blamed elements outside the country for the terror strikes in Mumbai, warning that India will not tolerate the use of territories of its neighbours for attacks here.              
	India will take up quot;strongly with our neighbours that the use of their territory for launching attacks on us will not be tolerated, and that there would be a cost if suitable measures are not taken by them, quot; Singh had said in an address to the nation.

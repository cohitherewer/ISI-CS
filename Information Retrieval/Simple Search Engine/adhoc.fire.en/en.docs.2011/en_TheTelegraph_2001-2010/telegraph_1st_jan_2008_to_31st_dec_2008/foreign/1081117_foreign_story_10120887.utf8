	Washington, Nov. 16: In a town abuzz about all things Barack Obama, the policy wonks and government insiders have been whispering and wondering about who will be who in his incoming cabinet. But among power parents in Americas capital, there is yet another burning question.        
	Where will the Obama girls go to school? Michelle Obama toured at least two of Washingtons most prestigious private schools last week  Sidwell Friends School and Georgetown Day School  and touched off a frenzy of dreaming, gossiping and well-mannered jockeying among the Washington elite. Maret School, another exclusive academy, is also believed to be on the shortlist for the future First Children, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7.        
	With annual tuitions that can exceed $28,000, these liberal-leaning schools have long brimmed with the scions of senators, representatives, financiers, diplomats, scholars, lawyers, journalists and even a few American Presidents.         
	Notable parents currently include several Obama advisers. Eric H. Holder Jr., a top contender for attorney general, has children at Georgetown Day. Susan E. Rice, a foreign policy adviser, has a child at Maret. And Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Vice President-elect, has grandchildren at Sidwell.        
	The school competition has transfixed a city where high-profile personalities and institutions often place a premium on access to political power. But the Obamas decision is also being closely watched for what it might reveal about the parental sensibilities of the President-elect and his wife.        
	Will the Obamas choose the Quaker-run Sidwell, established in 1883 and described by some as the Harvard of the three schools? (Sidwell has already educated children of two sitting Presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and Bill Clinton.)         
	Will they pick Georgetown Day, which became Washingtons first integrated school in 1945 and is known for its informality (students call teachers by their first names) and its emphasis on diversity and social justice? Or will they select Maret, a smaller, more intimate academy founded in 1911 that would allow the first family to keep both children on one enclosed campus?        
	The Obamas and their aides declined to discuss the familys inclinations, and no one knows how their choice may ultimately affect Washingtons social landscape.         
	City officials say the Obamas have not visited any public schools here, and their daughters, who attend private school in Chicago, are not expected to switch course.         
	But those are only details. All across town, parents are already dreamily envisioning casual chats with the President and the First Lady at soccer practices and PTA meetings, while little girls are swooning over the prospect of White House sleepovers with the daughters of Americas first black President.         
	With this particular President, theres so much excitement, said Natalie Wexler, a novelist whose daughter caught a glimpse of Michelle at Sidwell last Monday. Anything or anyone connected to him is going to be exciting.        
	History, of course, is not the only consideration. Michael Kazin, a historian of American politics at Georgetown University, said some parents and administrators are focused on the prestige the Obamas would bring to any school and the students and families affiliated with it.        
	No matter what the ideology of the President who is elected or what his party is, the privileged people in Washington always want to get a little more privileged, said Kazin, who has a daughter at Maret. Its clear that many parents who send their kids to these schools would want the Obamas to go there, he said. They want their particular niche of the community to be enhanced.

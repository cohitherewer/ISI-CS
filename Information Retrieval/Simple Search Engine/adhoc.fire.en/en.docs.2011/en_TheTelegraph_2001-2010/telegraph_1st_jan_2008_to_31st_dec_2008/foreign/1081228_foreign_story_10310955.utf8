	Lennon on TV    
	 London, Dec. 27: John Lennon has made a television commercial for charity 28 years after his death, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The Imagine singer was brought back to life using digital technology. He is seen urging people across the US to support a campaign by charity One Laptop per Child to deliver solar-powered laptops to the worlds poorest children.       
	Lennons voice and video image tells viewers: Imagine every child no matter where in the world they were could access a universe of knowledge. They would have a chance to learn, to dream, to achieve anything they want.

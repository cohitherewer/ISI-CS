	Britney X Factor dud    
	 London, Dec. 1: Britney Spears has been panned for her appearance on ITVs X Factor after she mimed along to her latest hit Womanizer. The troubled star spent just 24 hours in the UK but her comeback visit was criticised by fans as half-hearted, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Spears, who will turn 27 tomorrow, was also jeered for a lacklustre appearance at a gay night in London where she neither sang nor spoke. Thirteen million people were tuned into the X Factor on Saturday night to watch her perform in skimpy hot pants surrounded by top-hatted dancers. But despite receiving a standing ovation from judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh, Cheryl Cole and Dannii Minogue, she failed to impress many viewers who flooded ITV chat forums with criticism afterwards.      
	One wrote: Britneys performance was a disgrace. I dont know how she had the nerve to stand on that stage and mime when amateur singers gave such good performances. Simon Cowell should be ashamed to serve up such rubbish.

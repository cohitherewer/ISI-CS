	Sydney, Dec. 6 (Reuters): Australias official human rights watchdog wants a third gender called intersex to be created for use on official documents like passports and driving licences, a newspaper report said today.        
	The new gender would be another legally recognised option alongside male and female, The Daily Telegraph paper reported. The proposal from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission was contained in a discussion paper issued to transgender and transsexual advocates, the paper said.        
	The commission is a statutory body that advises the Australian government.         
	Under the commissions proposals, the intersex designation might be available even to some people who have not undergone surgery to change their sex, the newspaper said.        
	 The paper, Sex Files - The legal recognition of sex: Proposed reform, states that the introduction of the third gender was a key feature of the reform proposal being developed by the commission, the Daily Telegraph reported.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gritty Bond on a quest for realism

	Cerro Paranal (Chile), April 5 (Reuters): Wincing on a windswept mountainside in arid, northern Chile, James Bonds new incarnation Daniel Craig is on a quest for realism  and he has the bruises to prove it.        
	Breaking after a gruelling 10-hour day of filming Bonds latest adventure, Quantum of Solace, in remote Paranal in Chiles copper mining heartland, a metaphor for the isolation of the worlds most famous fictional super-spy, Craig says he is after grit.        
	Im bruised up from the fight scenes, but thats part of the deal, Craig told Reuters in an interview in the worlds driest desert, the Atacama, grimacing as he sat down.I wouldnt have done the movie without going all the way. He does as many of his own stunts as insurance allows.        
	Craig, who shot to fame with the 2006 Bond movie Casino Royale, pumps iron every evening, eats well and says his secret is to completely immerse himself in the role of 007.        
	Were making a Bond film, but we need some reality. We need to do more, he said, sitting in the navy polo shirt and black jeans he wore on set.         
	His skin is wind-burnt. Veins protrude on buff biceps.        
	But the reality of the situations and ... peoples emotions is kind of important because we want an audience to kind of care and just to get involved and stay interested.        
	Ukrainian actress Olga Kurylenko, who plays Bonds new love interest Camille, is also suffering. She says she is so bruised she no longer needs make-up to make her look tough.

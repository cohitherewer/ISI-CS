The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Palestine suspends Israel talks
                                                                                                               Palestine suspends Israel talks

	Gaza, March 2 (Reuters): Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas suspended peace negotiations with Israel today, demanding it end a Gaza offensive that has killed more than 100 Palestinians, many of them civilians.        
	Israel said it was acting in self-defence in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip to curb constant cross-border rocket attacks by militants and threatened to intensify its ground and air campaign despite allegations it was using excessive force.        
	Abbas had ordered the suspension of negotiations ... until (Israeli) aggression is stopped, a senior aide to the Palestinian leader said in the West Bank city of Ramallah.        
	But he stopped short of declaring dead the US-brokered statehood talks opposed by Hamas Islamists who seized control of the Gaza Strip from his Fatah movement in June.        
	Arye Mekel, spokesperson for Israels chief negotiator, foreign minister Tzipi Livni, said Abbass decision was a mistake and expressed hope the talks would resume in the very near future.        
	A 21-month-old Palestinian girl and three militants died in the latest fighting in the Gaza Strip, raising the Palestinian death toll in five days of bloodshed to more than 100, medical officials said.        
	Anti-Israeli demonstrations erupted in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces confronting stone-throwers near the town of Hebron shot dead a 14-year-old boy wearing a Hamas headband, witnesses said.        
	Nine rockets slammed into southern Israel, wounding four people, Israeli ambulance workers said.        
	Israel has no intention of stopping the fight against the terrorist organisations even for a minute, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told his cabinet, facing the new challenge of long-range rockets hitting the major southern Israeli city of Ashkelon.        
	Earlier, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon accused Israel of using excessive force. He demanded a halt to air and ground attacks that killed 61 people on Saturday, the bloodiest day for Palestinians since the 1980s, and militants rocket salvoes.        
	With all due respect ... no one has the right to preach morality to Israel for employing its elementary right of self-defence, Olmert said.

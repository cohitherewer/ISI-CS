                                                                                                            Nicole confirms she is pregnant
          NICK SQUIRES                      Baby bump watch                                 
	Sydney, Jan. 8: The Oscar-winning Australian actress Nicole Kidman is expecting a baby with her husband Keith Urban, a country music singer.         
	The announcement of the impending birth of Kidmans first child ended weeks of frenzied tabloid speculation and dogged efforts by paparazzi to snap pictures of her rumoured baby bump.         
	Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban confirmed today that they are expecting a baby, Kidmans publicist Wendy Day said. The couple are thrilled. Kidman, 40, is currently at home in Sydney, after months of filming the romantic epic Australia, directed by Baz Luhrmann. She plays a British aristocrat who inherits a giant outback cattle station on the eve of World War II.         
	Kidman was due to start filming a post-World War II drama, The Reader, later this month with Ralph Fiennes.         
	But Day said she understood the actress would pull out of the project because of concerns for the health of her unborn child.         
	Kidman had an ectopic pregnancy at the beginning of her decade-long marriage to Tom Cruise and, later, a miscarriage. The couple adopted two children  Isabella, now 14, and Connor, 12  who live with Cruise and his new wife, actress Katie Holmes. Reporters and camera crews staking out Kidman and Urban, also 40, congratulated the couple.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

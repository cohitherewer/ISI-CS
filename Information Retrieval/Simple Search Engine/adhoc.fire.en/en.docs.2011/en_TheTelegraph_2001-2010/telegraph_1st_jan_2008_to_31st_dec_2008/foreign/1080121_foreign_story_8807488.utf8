              Sarkozy and Bruni 
                
	Paris, Jan. 20: President Nicolas Sarkozy spent 26,200 on make-up to woo the French electorate in last years presidential elections, auditors have discovered.
    
	A commission looking into the expenses of last years presidential candidates was reportedly shocked to discover that Sarkozy, recently blasted as narcissistic by the Socialist Opposition, had spent in some cases, 450 euros an hour on face and hair make-overs.
    
	His defeated rival, Sgolne Royal, spent even more, however, reaching 52,000 euros for make-up and hairdressing. 
    
	The commission spent six months looking at all the candidates expenses to decide how much they should be reimbursed by the state. Judging that the sums were manifestly excessive for an activity that was normally of a personal nature, it only paid back 12,000 euros to Sarkozy and 17,000 euros to Royal.
    
	The figures are likely to shock the French public at a time when the country is obsessed with falling purchasing power. The Socialist was also refused reimbursement for the 53,500 euros she spent on electronic bugging detectors for her headquarters. 
    
	Bruni barb
    
	Sarkozys girlfriend Carla Bruni finds French people miserable and Paris unbearably polluted but when it comes to her true love, she thinks that the President is like Napoleon Bonaparte.
    
	I like to be Italian. I like the Italian temperament and I like Italian food. French people are in a bad mood for some reason, and the Italian people are in a good mood. French people are always negative, The Daily Mail quoted Bruni, an Italian, as saying.

	Darwin hair    
	 London, Nov. 14: Wisps of hair from Charles Darwins beard are to go on public display in an exhibition 200 years after he was born.      
	They were collected by his family and kept for generations in a box. Randal Keynes, the great-great-great grandson of the naturalist, found them when looking through the box, which had belonged to Darwins daughter Etty. They were placed in an envelope on which Etty had written Found after his death in my fathers papers.

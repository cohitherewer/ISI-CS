	Beirut, Jan. 15 (Reuters): A car bomb damaged a US diplomatic vehicle in Beirut today, killing at least three people and wounding 16, but the US state department said no Americans were hurt by the blast.
    
	The bomb sent a column of smoke into the sky, tore masonry from buildings and destroyed at least six cars in a Christian suburb north of Beirut, as well as damaging the armoured four-by-four embassy car.
    
	The blast coincided with President George W. Bushs visit to Saudi Arabia as part of a week-long tour of US West Asia allies.
    
	Bush is not visiting Lebanon, though Washington has been a strong backer of the Beirut government in its power struggle with the Hezbollah-led Opposition backed by Syria.
    
	Lebanese security sources said the bomb had killed three people, but the US state department said four Beirut residents had been killed. None worked for the embassy. There were no American diplomats or American citizens in the car at the time, state department spokesman Sean McCormack said. He said a Lebanese national working for the embassy and a driver were in the vehicle.

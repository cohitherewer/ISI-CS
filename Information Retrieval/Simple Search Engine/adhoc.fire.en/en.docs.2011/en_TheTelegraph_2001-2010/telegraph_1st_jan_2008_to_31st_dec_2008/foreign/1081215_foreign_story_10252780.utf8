          BEN LEACH                        McCartney, (below) Lennon				                                       
	London, Dec. 14: Paul McCartney has claimed it was he, and not John Lennon, who introduced the Beatles to politics.         
	In an interview with intellectual journal Prospect, McCartney said he persuaded Lennon to oppose the war in Vietnam.        
	He claimed the groups politicisation began after he met philosopher Bertrand Russell in London in the mid-1960s.        
	But McCartneys critics see his comments as a further attempt to revise the history of the Beatles, casting himself in a better light.         
	We sort of stumbled into things, McCartney told Prospect magazine. For instance, Vietnam. Just when we were getting to be well known, someone said to me: Bertrand Russell is living not far from here in Chelsea, why dont you go and see him? and so I just took a taxi down there and knocked on the door.         
	He added: He was fabulous. He told me about the Vietnam war  most of us didnt know about it, it wasnt yet in the papers  and also that it was a very bad war.         
	I remember going back to the studio either that evening or the next day and telling the guys, particularly John (Lennon), about this meeting and saying what a bad war this was.        
	But Tariq Ali, who was one of the leaders of the anti-war movement in Britain, disputed McCartneys version of events.        
	He said: It is not my recollection at all. It is possible McCartney met Bertrand Russell, but certainly I had no contact with Paul.

	Riyadh, Jan. 21: Saudi Arabia is to lift its ban on women drivers in an attempt to stem a rising suffragette-style movement in the deeply conservative state.
    
	Government officials have confirmed the landmark decision and plan to issue a decree by the end of the year.
    
	The move is designed to forestall campaigns for greater freedom by women, which have recently included protesters driving cars through the Islamic state in defiance of a threat of detention and loss of livelihoods.
    
	The royal family has previously balked at granting women driving permits, claiming the step did not have full public support. The driving ban dates back to the establishment of the state in 1932, although recently the government line has weakened.
    
	There has been a decision to move on this by the Royal Court because it is recognised that if girls have been in schools since the 1960s, they have a capability to function behind the wheel when they grow up, a government official told The Daily Telegraph. We will make an announcement soon.
    
	Abdulaziz bin Salamah, the deputy information minister, said the official reform programme had been dogged by debate over the issue. In terms of women driving, we dont have it now because of the reticence of some segments of society, he said.

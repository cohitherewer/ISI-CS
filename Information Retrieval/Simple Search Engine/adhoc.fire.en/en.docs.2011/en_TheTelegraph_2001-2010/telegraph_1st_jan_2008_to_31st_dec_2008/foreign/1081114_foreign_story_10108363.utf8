	Vancouver (British Columbia), Nov. 13 (Reuters): As central bankers try to prop up an ailing global economy with financial bailouts, a tiny western Canadian brewery has stepped into the battle with what it bills as a recession-fighting ale.        
	Howe Sound Brewery began selling Bailout Bitter at its pub in Squamish, British Columbia, yesterday. It is awaiting permission to begin selling bottles of the brew in stores in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.        
	Howe Sound co-owner Leslie Fenn said the ale was an attempt to inject humour into tough economic times.

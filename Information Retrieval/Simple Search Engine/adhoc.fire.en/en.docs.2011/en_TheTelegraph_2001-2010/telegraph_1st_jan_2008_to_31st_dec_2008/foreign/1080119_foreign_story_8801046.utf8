	Islamabad, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Pakistani forces killed up to 90 militants in two battles today in the South Waziristan region on the Afghan border, the military said.
    
	The clashes came two days after hundreds of militants overran a paramilitary fort in another part of South Waziristan, dealing the military a setback in its efforts to defeat al Qaida-linked militants.
    
	Government forces attacked a large number of militants who had apparently gathered to attack another fort in the region, killing 50 to 60 of them. The rest dispersed, said military spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas.
    
	The miscreants, these terrorists, wanted to probably attack another fort and they were gathering there. Therefore, the security forces took action in retaliation, Abbas said.
    
	Security forces used artillery and mortars to attack the militants and suffered no casualties, he said.
    
	In the second incident, militants ambushed a convoy and 20 to 30 of them were killed when security forces fought back, he said.
    
	We had a convoy passing through Chaghmalai and these miscreants started firing on the convoy. The security forces retaliated and there was a firefight for an hour or two and then the security forces cleared the area, he said.
    
	Four members of the security forces were wounded in the second clash, he said.
    
	Both clashes were in areas of South Waziristan where an al Qaida-linked militant leader, Baitullah Mehsud, operates.
    
	The government said Mehsud was behind the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in Rawalpindi on December 27.
    
	Mehsud has been blamed for a string of other attacks on security forces in recent months, compounding a sense of crisis in the nuclear-armed country as President Pervez Musharraf has struggled to hold power in the face of protests from opponents.
    
	The government says the militants are intent on destabilising the country in the run-up to a February 18 general election that is meant to complete a transition to civilian rule.
    
	A spokesman for Mehsud was not immediately available for comment. Residents of South Waziristan said they heard the sound of explosions today.
    
	CIA director Michael Hayden, in an interview with the Washington Post published today, also blamed Mehsud for Bhuttos murder.
    
	This was done by that network around Baitullah Mehsud. We have no reason to question that, Hayden said.
    
	His comments were the most definitive public assessment by a US intelligence official of who was responsible for the assassination of the former Prime Minister. He declined to discuss the intelligence behind the CIAs assessment.
    
	Security forces have been battling al Qaida-linked militants in South Waziristan for several years.
    
	 The mountainous region, occupied by conservative, independent-minded Pashtun tribesmen, has never come under the full authority of any government.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | A dress that changes itself
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A dress that changes itself
                            
	London, Aug. 8: A dress which can transform its wearer from smart office worker to demure party girl and back again is set to solve wardrobe dilemmas for young professionals.         
	The Work to Flirt dress could become a must-have outfit for every girl-about-town, according to DatingDirect.com which unveiled the design. Clever tailoring and design features transform the dress to expose a little more cleavage, a shorter, sexier skirt and split and a flash of back cleavage.         
	Designer Tansy Hamley, who created the prototype which has yet to go on sale in shops, said: The dress has been really well received, with women saying that it absolutely takes the hassle out of planning their date outfits. Many have joked that it helps them transform in a Superman style make-over.         
	Due to the hectic lifestyles that we are all leading these days, I believe that in the future more fashion will be focused on two-in-one versatile outfits that can be altered to suit different occasions.        
	DatingDirect.com surveyed 1,000 singles from across the UK and the research found that 42 per cent would prefer not to wear their office clothes while on an after work date. Of the women questioned, 68 per cent said that taking an outfit to work for a date was a hassle.                             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

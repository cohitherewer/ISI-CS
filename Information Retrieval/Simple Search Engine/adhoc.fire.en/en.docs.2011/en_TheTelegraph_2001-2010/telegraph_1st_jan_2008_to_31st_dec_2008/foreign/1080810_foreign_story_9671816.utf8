	Care in a thong    
	London, Aug. 9: A care home has apologised after a member of staff granted a 90-year-old womans lifelong wish  to be served fish and chips by a man wearing a thong, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The elderly woman was given the treat after telling staff it was her fantasy to be served her favourite meal by a man naked apart from the skimpy underwear.       
	She made the request as part of the care homes Make a Wish initiative which sees staff trying to make guests dreams come true. Managers first asked one member of staff to act as the waiter but he refused and a second employee stepped forward and stripped off.       
	According to sources at the home, he donned a black ladies thong under a see-through plastic apron and served the resident fish and chips in the dining room. The incident happened at the Woodland Houses Residential Cornwall Care Home, in St Austell.

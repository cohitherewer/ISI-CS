	London, June 5: The new James Bond book, written by Sebastian Faulks, has gone straight to the top of this weeks book charts.         
	Devil May Care sold 44,093 copies in just four days, making it the fastest-selling fiction book after the Harry Potter titles.         
	Waterstones recorded the highest sales, with more than 19,000 copies of the book flying off the shelves within days of its release last Wednesday.         
	Faulks, best known for his books Birdsong and Charlotte Gray, was chosen by the trustees of Flemings estate to write the 15th Bond adventure.         
	It was a surprise choice, with many assuming that the job would have gone to one of the more established thriller writers like Frederick Forsyth or John Le Carre.

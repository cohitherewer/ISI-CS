	Shakira moves    
	 San Salvador, Oct. 30 (Reuters): Latin pop star Shakira, showing she can move more than her hips, will lobby Latin American Presidents this week to start a regional project to pump money into childrens health and education.      
	The singer will address a summit in El Salvador of Ibero-American leaders, including the Presidents of Brazil and her native Colombia, over the need to feed and educate poor children, especially amid a global economic slowdown.      
	There are difficult times coming in Latin America. Thousands and thousands of children will die if governments do not organise ways to distribute food during this crisis, Shakira told Reuters.    
	Rock sign    
	 Cincinnati (AP): Rocker Peter Frampton is wishing someone would show him the way to keep his Barack Obama yard signs from getting swiped. The Grammy winner is complaining that signs showing his preference for the Democratic candidate have been stolen repeatedly at his home in Cincinnati suburb of Indian Hill.

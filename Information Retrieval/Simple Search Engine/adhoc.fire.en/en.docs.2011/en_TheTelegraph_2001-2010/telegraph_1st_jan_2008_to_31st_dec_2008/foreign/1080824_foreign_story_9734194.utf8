	London, Aug. 23: A new pillow has been designed to clear your face of wrinkles.         
	Researchers have developed a copper oxide pillow case, with tests showing those who used it for four weeks had fewer lines and wrinkles than those using conventional bedding. They believe moisture from the skin releases copper ions from the pillow cases which stimulate the production of collagen below the surface of the skin.

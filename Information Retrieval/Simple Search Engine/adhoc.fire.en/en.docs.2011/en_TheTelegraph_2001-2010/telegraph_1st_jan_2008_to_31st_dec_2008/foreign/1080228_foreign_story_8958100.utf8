	London, Feb. 27: Microsoft was this morning struggling to find out why tens of millions of Hotmail users were left without access to their email accounts yesterday.         
	Access to all of Microsofts Web-based communication tools  including Hotmail and instant messaging accounts  was blocked across the globe for several hours in the early afternoon yesterday. The problems, which affected the 80 million people who use Hotmail worldwide, were fixed within a couple of hours, Microsoft said. This morning it said that Hotmail users were able to log in again, although the company would not elaborate on the cause of the outage.

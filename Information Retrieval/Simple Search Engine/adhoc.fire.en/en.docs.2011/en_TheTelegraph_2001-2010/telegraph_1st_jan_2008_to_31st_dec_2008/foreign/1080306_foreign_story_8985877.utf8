	Islamabad, March 5: Disgraced Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, who is suffering from cancer, was taken to hospital yesterday with fever and low blood pressure, his wife said.         
	Khan has been held under house arrest in Islamabad since an investigation was launched against him in 2003. Shortly after that he confessed to smuggling nuclear technology to North Korea and Iran. His wife, Henny, said her husband was apparently suffering from an infection but his condition was not serious. He had a fever. Hes been unwell since Friday evening and his blood pressure is very erratic so we thought it would be much safer to take him to hospital, she said.

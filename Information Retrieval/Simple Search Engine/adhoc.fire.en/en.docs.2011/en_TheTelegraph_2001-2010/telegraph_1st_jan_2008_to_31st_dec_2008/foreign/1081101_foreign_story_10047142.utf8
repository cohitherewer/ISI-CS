          FIONA GOVAN                          Cruz: No marriage yet                                  
	Madrid, Oct. 31: Spanish actress Penelope Cruz is the latest celebrity to consider adopting a baby from the developing world.         
	Her brother Eduardo Cruz revealed the 34 year-old has no plans to have children of her own yet but has expressed an interest in adopting a baby from India when the time is right.         
	The Spanish star began dating her boyfriend, the Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem, on the set of Woody Allens latest blockbuster Vicky Christina Barcelona.         
	The pair, who met when they co-starred in the Spanish art house film JamJam in 1992 but didnt become romantically involved until a year ago, have a strong relationship but do not intend to marry yet, according to Eduardo Cruz.         
	She seems happy and very together (with Bardem), Cruz said in an interview with Spanish magazine Lecturas to promote his debut album. But he said his sister was wary of getting married after witnessing their parents messy divorce. I overcame it but it still affects Penelope strongly, he said.

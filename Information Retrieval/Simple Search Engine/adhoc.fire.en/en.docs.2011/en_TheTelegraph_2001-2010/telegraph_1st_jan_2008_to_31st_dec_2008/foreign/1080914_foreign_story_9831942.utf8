                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       17 killed in LA train collision
                            
	Los Angeles, Sept. 13 (Reuters): At least 17 were killed and more than 100 injured today after a freight train and a commuter train collided head-on outside Los Angeles.        
	Some four hours after the trains, which were headed in opposite directions on the same track, slammed together west of Los Angeles at about 4:30pm (local time), officials feared that more bodies could still be trapped under the twisted wreckage.        
	There are at least 17 confirmed fatalities. Confirmed by the coroners office. That number will likely grow because as you know we are still in the rescue phase, Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa told reporters.         
	The mayor said officials were having a difficult time tallying the number of people injured in the worst commuter train crash in Los Angeles history.

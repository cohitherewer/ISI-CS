                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Drone attack kills 5 in Pak
                              Mullen: Assurance                            
	Islamabad, Sept. 17 (Reuters): A US missile strike killed five militants in northwest Pakistan today, a Pakistani official said.        
	Another official said the attack on a container loaded with ammunition and explosives was the result of better US-Pakistani intelligence sharing and both countries had worked together on the attack. The US, frustrated by a growing Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, has stepped up attacks on militants in Pakistan with six missile strikes and a helicopter-borne ground assault this month.        
	The latest US missile strike by a pilotless drone came at dusk over Baghar village in the South Wazirstan region. The drone fired four missiles at a tented camp. Three of the dead were Arabs, according to a Pakistani intelligence officer who declined to be identified.        
	A new government in nuclear-armed Pakistan has promised support for the US-led campaign against Islamist militancy even though the campaign is deeply unpopular with many Pakistanis.         
	Hours before the missile strike, Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, assured army commander General Ashfaq Kayani and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani of US support. Admiral Mullen reiterated the US commitment to respect Pakistans sovereignty and to develop further US-Pakistani cooperation and coordination, the US embassy said.

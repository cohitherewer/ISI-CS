	Caring for Cate
  
	 Canberra, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Australian actress Cate Blanchett may have missed out on a second Oscar, but she has been picked to head a think-tank on the future of arts in her home country as a consolation prize, the government said today.
   
	Blanchett, who lost to Tilda Swinton and Marion Cotillard in two female acting categories at the Oscars, has been picked by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to head an arts panel at an April summit that will also deal with other challenges facing the country such as climate change.

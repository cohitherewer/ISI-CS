The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pervez to back new bloc
                                                                                                               Pervez to back new bloc
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                              
	Islamabad, March 7: Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said today he would support an incoming coalition government that could potentially seek his resignation as long as peace was maintained.        
	Speaking at the inauguration of a new power project at Jacobabad, southern Sindh, Musharraf said the inaugural sessions of national and provincial Assemblies will be convened in seven to ten days.         
	I will fully support the new coalition government if peace is maintained, he said. However, the Pakistan President did not explain what he actually meant by maintenance of peace.         
	Musharraf said the new governments at the centre and in the provinces should complete their five-year tenure. He added that the parties must show wisdom and focus on governance. This is possible only if we demonstrate peace and tolerance, he said.         
	Musharrafs remarks came as the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Awami National Party were in the process of putting a coalition together.         
	Although there seems to be a general consensus on the name of PPP vice-chairman Makhdoom Amin Fahim for the Prime Ministers post, some partymen are still insisting that the Premier should be from Punjab. They have put forward some names like industrialist Ahmad Mukhar politicians Makhdoom Shah Mehmud Qureshi and Yousaf Raza Gilani.         
	Musharraf, who came to power as a general in a 1999 coup, will face a hostile parliament after the crushing defeat of his allies in a parliamentary election on February 18.        
	The incoming government could try to drive Musharraf out of power, though the leader of the party that will lead the next coalition has not made his intentions clear.        
	Pakistans election commission paved the way for Musharraf to convene a new parliament by completing the results of polls with the allocation of reserved seats for women and non-Muslim minorities.         
	But television news channels reported that Musharraf said in Sindh that it would be a week or two more before the new national and provincial Assemblies were convened.        
	Aides have denied speculative media reports that Musharraf intends to resign, and yesterday General Ashfaq Kayani, the army chief Musharraf promoted in November after relinquishing his dual role as president and chief of army staff, called on all sides to work together.        
	In a statement issued by the military, Kayani said the army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half the 60 years since the country was founded, would stay out of the political process and hoped that it would not be dragged into unnecessary controversy.

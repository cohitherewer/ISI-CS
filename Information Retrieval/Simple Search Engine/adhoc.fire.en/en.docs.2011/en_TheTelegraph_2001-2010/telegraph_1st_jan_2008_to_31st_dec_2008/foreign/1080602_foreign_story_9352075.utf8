                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       One-child families in China rush to adopt quake orphans

	Beijing, June 1: With bewilderment in their eyes and identity tags dangling from their necks, these are the faces of orphans who lost their families in the Sichuan earthquake.         
	While in one sense totally alone, they huddle together in thousands in refugee camps across the Chinese province.         
	The plight of the children has prompted huge numbers of couples to offer to care for them. Phone lines to the Sichuan civil affairs department in the provinces capital, Chengdu, which handles adoptions in the region, have been jammed since soon after the quake on May 12, with tens of thousands of couples offering their services as prospective parents.         
	There has been a widespread outpouring of grief and sympathy for the 5,500 children whose parents are dead or missing, fuelled by images of orphans wearing refugee tags. With 18,618 people still unaccounted for, the number of children left alone is expected to rise.         
	Many couples seeking to adopt earthquake orphans are also motivated by the chance to get around Chinas one-child policy.         
	I think if two kids grow up together then they can help each other and they will be more rounded people. My neighbour has two children and I can see that her children are more considerate and nicer to their parents, unlike my only son who is really spoiled, said Li, an accountant from Huaian in Jiangsu province.         
	Like many of the couples, Li and her civil servant husband would like to adopt a girl to be a sister to her nine-year-old son.         
	But Li faces stiff competition. The Chaoyang district branch of the Beijing civil affairs department, just one of 16 such offices in the Chinese capital, said that more than a thousand couples hoping to adopt a Sichuan orphan had already registered with them.         
	Traditionally, the Chinese have been reluctant to adopt children not related to them, believing they should stay with family members, an attitude that has begun to change.

	Sanaa (Yemen), May 2 (Reuters): Around 15 people were killed and over 60 wounded when a bomb hidden in a motorcycle exploded outside a mosque in Yemens volatile northern city of Saada today, a security source said.        
	The blast happened as worshippers, including army officers, were leaving the Salman Mosque after Friday prayers, officials and security sources said. It is a large mosque, the governor of Saada, Motahhar Rashad, told Al Jazeera. He earlier gave the Arab network an initial count of six dead and 35 wounded.        
	But a Yemeni security source, who declined to be identified, put the death toll higher at around 15 and said between 60 and 70 people were wounded.

          TAGHREED EL-KHODARY AND ETHAN BRONNER                                          
	Gaza, Dec. 28: Israeli airstrikes against Hamas facilities in Gaza continued for a second day today and the death toll rose to nearly 290 as Israel retaliated for rocket fire from the area with its most severe campaign against Palestinian militants in decades.         
	The Palestinian groups again launched barrages of rockets and mortars into Israel today, extending their reach further than ever before, and the Israeli government approved the emergency call up of at least 6,500 army reservists in preparation for a possible ground operation.        
	Speaking before the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Israeli defence minister Ehud Barak said the army will deepen and broaden its actions as needed and will continue to act in Gaza.        
	Among the 30 or more targets hit yesterday night and early today was the main security compound and prison in Gaza City known as the Saraya; metal workshops throughout Gaza; Hamas military posts; and the house of a chemistry professor from Gazas Islamic University. The Hamas-owned Al-Aqsa television station was also struck, as was a mosque that the Israeli military said was housing armed men and was being used as a terrorist operation centre.        
	Palestinian officials said most of the dead in Gaza were security officers for Hamas, including two senior commanders, and at least 600 people had been wounded in the attacks.        
	The Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, said today that the patience, determination and stamina of the residents of Israelis would, in the end, determine the success of the military and diplomatic campaign against Hamas.         
	Two rockets fell in the vicinity of the major Israeli port city of Ashdod, a military spokesperson said. Others landed in the coastal city of Ashkelon. Several Israelis were lightly wounded by shrapnel.         
	The hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens now within rocket range have been instructed by the authorities to stay close to protected spaces and an emergency has been declared.         
	Israeli military officials said the airstrikes, which began yesterday morning, were the start of what could be days or even months of an effort to force Hamas to end its rocket barrages into southern Israel.        
	After the initial airstrikes, dozens of rockets were fired into southern Israel sending thousands of Israelis into bomb shelters.         
	A number of governments and international officials, including leaders of Russia, Egypt, the European Union and the UN, condemned Israels use of force and also called on Hamas to end the rocket fire. But in strong terms, the Bush administration blamed Hamas for the violence and demanded that it stop firing rockets.         
	Early today in New York, the UN Security Council issued a statement expressing concern about the escalation of the conflict and calling on both parties for an immediate end to all violence. The statement came after envoys of the 15-member council met for over four hours in a closed session, Reuters reported.

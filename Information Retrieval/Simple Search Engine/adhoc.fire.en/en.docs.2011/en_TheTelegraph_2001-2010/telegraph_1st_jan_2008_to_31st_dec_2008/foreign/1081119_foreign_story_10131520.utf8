	Canberra, Nov. 18 (Reuters): Australias kangaroos are genetically similar to humans and may have first evolved in China, Australian researchers said today.      
	Scientists said they had for the first time mapped the genetic code of the Australian marsupials and found much of it was similar to the genome for humans, the government-backed Centre of Excellence for Kangaroo Genomics said.      
	There are a few differences, we have a few more of this, a few less of that, but they are the same genes and a lot of them are in the same order, centre director Jenny Graves told reporters in Melbourne.    
	Tipsy task    
	Tokyo (Reuters): A senior Tokyo police official tasked with keeping the citys roads clear of drunk drivers has been arrested for driving under the influence, police said on Tuesday. The deputy inspector, on his way home from a camping site, was caught late on Monday after bumping into another car and veering off the road, said a police official in Ibaraki. He smelled of alcohol and he couldnt walk straight, the official said. Local media said the arrested official had been in charge of a campaign to stop drunk driving. It is inexcusable for a member of the police to have caused this case and we plan to deal with it strictly.

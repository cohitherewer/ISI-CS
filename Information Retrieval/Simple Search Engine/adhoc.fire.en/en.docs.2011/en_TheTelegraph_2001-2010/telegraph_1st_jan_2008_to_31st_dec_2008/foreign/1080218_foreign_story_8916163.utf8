	Kabul, Feb. 17: Eighty people were killed and dozens hurt when a suicide bomber struck an open-air dogfighting match in southern Afghanistan, the provincial governor said.         
	The bombing, just outside Kandahar, is thought to have been the deadliest single suicide attack since the Taliban movement was driven from power over six years ago.         
	Authorities said the apparent target of the blast was Abdul Hakim Jan, an anti-Taliban militia leader, who was missing in the wake of the blast and believed to have been killed. Some of the casualties might have been caused when Jans bodyguards opened fire after the blast although there were no assailants in sight, witnesses said. Jan, a onetime provincial police chief, had defied the Taliban as the austere Islamist movement rose to prominence in the 1990s.        
	A tightly packed crowd of hundreds of men and boys had gathered at a dirt field on the citys edge to watch the dogfight when the bomber struck, witnesses said.         
	Suddenly a big explosion went off, said Mohammad Qasim, 23, a witness. Qasim said he saw corpses scattered everywhere, and the wounded screamed for help.         
	Kandahars governor, Asadullah Khalid, said that 80 people had been killed. A spokesman for the health ministry said at least 90 others were hurt, some seriously.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Russia, Georgia on the brink of war
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Russia, Georgia on the brink of war

	Dzhava (Georgia), Aug. 8 (AP): Russia sent columns of tanks and reportedly bombed Georgian air bases today after Georgia launched a major military offensive to retake the breakaway province of South Ossetia.        
	In an interview with CNN, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said: Russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory. He also said Georgian forces had downed two Russian jets. There was no immediate confirmation Russia had sent bombers.        
	Hundreds of civilians were reported dead in the worst outbreak of hostilities since the province won defacto independence in a war against Georgia that ended in 1992. Witnesses said the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali was devastated.        
	I saw bodies lying on the streets, around ruined buildings, in cars, said Lyudmila Ostayeva, 50, who had fled with her family to Dzhava, a village near the border with Russia. Its impossible to count them now. There is hardly a single building left undamaged.        
	The fighting broke out as much of the worlds attention was focused on the start of the Olympic Games and many leaders, including Russias Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Bush, were in Beijing.        
	The timing suggests Saakashvili may have been counting on surprise to fulfill his longtime pledge to wrest back control of South Ossetia  a key to his hold on power.        
	Saakashvili agreed the timing was not coincidental, but accused Russia of being the aggressor. Most decision makers have gone for the holidays, he said in an interview with CNN. Brilliant moment to attack a small country.        
	Diplomats called for another emergency session of the UN Security Council, its second since early this morning seeking to prevent an all-out war. The US was sending an envoy to the region to meet the parties involved. We support Georgias territorial integrity, state department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos told reporters. We are working on mediation efforts to secure a ceasefire.         
	Ten Russian peacekeepers were killed and 30 wounded when their barracks were hit in Georgian shelling, said Russian Ground Forces spokesman Colonel Igor Konashenkov. Russia has soldiers in South Ossetia as peacekeeping forces but Georgia alleges they back the separatists.

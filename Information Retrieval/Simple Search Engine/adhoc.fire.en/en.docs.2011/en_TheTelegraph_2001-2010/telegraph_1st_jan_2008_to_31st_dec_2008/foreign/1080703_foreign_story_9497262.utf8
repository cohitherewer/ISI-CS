                              Richard Boucher in Islamabad. (Reuters)                            
	Islamabad, July 2 (Reuters): Pakistani politicians should stop squabbling over the fate of President Pervez Musharraf and focus on pressing problems like rising Islamist militancy, soaring prices and energy shortages, a US official said today.        
	US ally Musharraf has become increasingly isolated since his political supporters suffered a humiliating defeat in February elections, but critics say differences in the new coalition over how to deal with him have virtually paralysed government.        
	Frankly, President Musharraf is not the issue right now. This is not the problem that Pakistan faces right now, US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher told a news conference after talks with Musharraf and other leaders.        
	The problem Pakistani people face is the danger of bombings, suicide bombers, rising food prices. There are energy difficulties, he said.        
	The coalition led by the party of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto wants to get rid of Musharraf, who seized power as a military strongman in 1999.        
	However, there is disagreement between the coalition partners over how to do it and also over how to resolve the issue of dozens of judges Musharraf sacked in November.        
	The US and other western allies are concerned about instability in the nuclear-armed state which faces a growing threat from al Qaida and Taliban militants.

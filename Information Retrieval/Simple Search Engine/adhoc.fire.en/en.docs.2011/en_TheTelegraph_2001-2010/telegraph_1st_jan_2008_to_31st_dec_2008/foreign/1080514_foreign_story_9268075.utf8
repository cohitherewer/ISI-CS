	Living record    
	 New York, May 13 (AP): A painting by British artist Lucian Freud could set a record for a living artist when it goes on sale in Manhattan for an estimated $25 million to $35 million.      
	Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, a life-size portrait of a large naked woman, is going on the auction block at Christies New York galleries. It could top the current record, set in November by Jeff Koonss Hanging Heart sculpture, which sold for $23.6 million .      
	The 1995 painting depicts Freuds subject, Sue Tilley, sleeping on a worn-out sofa. The 85-year-old artist is the grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud.    
	Drew drive    
	Los Angeles (AP): Actress Drew Barrymores vehicle was smashed on Monday in a hit-and-run car accident. However, she managed to follow the other vehicle to get its licence plate numbers, authorities said. The 33-year-old actress was not injured in the accident on Monday in west Hollywood, police said. They did not know the extent of damage to Barrymores car.    
	Shark poke    
	 Sydney (Reuters): An Australian swimmer survived a great white shark attack by poking the creature in the eyes as it dragged him through the water after badly savaging his left leg. Jason Cull was swimming off a beach on Australias southwest coast on Sunday when the 4-metre shark attacked. Initially I thought it was a dolphin, Cull told The Australian newspaper on Monday. I just remember being dragged along backwards. I was trying to feel its gills but I found its eye and I stuck my finger in and thats when it let go. The shark tore two chunks from Culls left leg, ripping off half his calf and leaving him with deep lacerations to his knee and thigh.

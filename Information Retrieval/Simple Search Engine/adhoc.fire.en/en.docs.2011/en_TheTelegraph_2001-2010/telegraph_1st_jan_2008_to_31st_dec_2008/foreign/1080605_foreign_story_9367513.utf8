The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obamas asset can be liability
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obamas asset can be liability
          TIM SHIPMAN                           Barack and Michelle Obama in St Paul, Minnesota. (AP)                                  
	Washington, June 4: She is hailed as the black Jackie Kennedy, a striking and graceful figure whose intelligence and grit have put gloss and backbone into her husbands bid for the White House.         
	As Barack Obama went on stage to make history in St Paul Minnesota last night, his wife Michelle was at his side in a striking violet dress.         
	Before he began to speak, they hugged and then performed a subtle fist bump. It was typical of the would-be First Lady: quirky and proud and just a little bit combative, a private gesture that said: You go boy. Knock em dead.         
	But it is that subtle aggression and sense that they have both suffered more than the usual slings and arrows of a political campaign that has a growing number of commentators asking whether Michelle Obama is as big a liability as she is an asset. Michelle Obama first appeared as a genial advocate for her husband, as likely to joke about his failure to put his socks in the dirty clothes basket as she was to talk politics.         
	But she established a reputation on the campaign trail, rather as Bill Clinton did for his wife, as an aggressive combatant who can say things that would be beyond the pale for the candidate to utter.         
	But it has got her into trouble. In February a tape surfaced of Michelle Obama telling supporters that her husbands presidential success means that for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country.         
	The choice of words, embarrassing when it first emerged, became positively toxic for her husband when his own associations with the Reverend Jeremiah Wright emerged to cast a shadow over his judgment.

	Washington, Dec. 19: President Bush announced $13.4 billion in emergency loans today to prevent the collapse of General Motors and Chrysler.        
	Another $4 billion will be available for the hobbled automakers in February. The entire bailout has been provided to the companies, who are undergoing sweeping restructuring, to show that they can return to profitability.        
	The loans, as GM and Chrysler teeter on the brink of insolvency, essentially throw the companies a lifeline from the taxpayers that will keep them afloat until March 31. At that point, the Obama administration will determine if the automakers are meeting the conditions of the loans and will continue to receive government aid or must repay the loans and face bankruptcy.         
	The money to aid the automakers will come from the treasurys $700 billion financial stabilisation fund and shortly after Bushs announcement, the treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who will oversee the aid to the auto industry, said Congress would need to release the second $350 billion for that programme in short order.        
	Ford Motor Co, the other firm in Detroits storied Big Three, said its liquidity is adequate for now and it did not need a loan at this point.        
	Democratic President-elect Barack Obama, who takes over from Bush on January 20, supported the move, calling it a necessary step.        
	By law, once Paulson makes a formal request, Congress has 15 days to reject it and deny the additional money. It was unclear when that request would be sent or if lawmakers who have left Washington for the holidays, would return to debate it.        
	The administrations handling of the programme has come under sharp criticism and several lawmakers in both parties have suggested they would oppose the release of more money.         
	Bush made his announcement a week after Senate Republicans blocked legislation to aid the automakers that had been negotiated by the White House and Congressional Democrats, and the loan package announced by the President includes roughly identical requirements in that bill, which had been approved by the House.        
	Bush, in a televised speech before the opening of the markets, said that under other circumstances he would have let the companies fail, a consequence of their bad business decisions. But given the recession, he said the government had no choice but to step in.

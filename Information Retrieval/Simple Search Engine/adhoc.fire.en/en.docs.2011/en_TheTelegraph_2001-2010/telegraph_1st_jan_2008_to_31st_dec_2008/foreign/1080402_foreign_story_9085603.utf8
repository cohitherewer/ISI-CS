The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Talks on Mugabe stepdown
                                                                                                               Talks on Mugabe stepdown
                            
	Harare, April 1 (Reuters): Zimbabwes ruling Zanu-PF party and the Opposition MDC are believed to be discussing whether President Robert Mugabe should resign after last Saturdays election, a US official said today.         
	A state department official said the talks followed projections showing Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Morgan Tsvangirai would beat Mugabe in the election but fall short of the 51 per cent voted needed to avoid a runoff.        
	I know that there are supposedly at various levels ... discussions between representatives of the Opposition and representatives of the government, the state department official said. I know there were discussions that were going on but we will see what happens and when it happens, he added.        
	But MDC secretary-general Tendai Biti strongly denied persistent media reports, some citing MDC sources, saying the Opposition was in talks on a Mugabe exit.        
	I have answered that question a hundred times. I am sick and tired of answering that question. Its rubbish, absolute rubbish, he said.         
	Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980 but faced an unprecedented challenge in the elections because of a two-pronged Opposition attack and the economic collapse of his once prosperous country.         
	A senior western diplomat in Harare said the international community was discussing ideas to try to persuade Mugabe to step down.

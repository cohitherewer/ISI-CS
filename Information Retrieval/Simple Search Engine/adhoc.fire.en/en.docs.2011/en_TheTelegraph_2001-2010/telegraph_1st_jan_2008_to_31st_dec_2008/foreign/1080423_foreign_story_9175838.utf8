	Beijing, April 22 (Reuters): Dozens of villagers in southwest China attacked police with knives and clubs in a clash over illegal mining that left at least one villager dead and 16 injured, the official Xinhua news agency said today.        
	Police defended with riot guns, batons and shields, leaving 11 villagers injured, among whom one died on the way to hospital, Xinhua said, quoting officials. It said more than 70 villagers attacked five police.        
	Hong Kongs Ming Pao newspaper cited unidentified sources as saying riot police in Malipo county were sent in on Sunday after almost 100 villagers clashed with Zijin Mining workers. It said police shot two people dead.        
	Zijins board secretary, Zheng Yuqiang, denied its workers were involved, saying a subsidiary, doing preparation work for a tungsten project, had not reported any operational problems.        
	The confrontation had nothing to do with the company, Zheng said at the firms headquarters in Fujian province.        
	Beijing, terrified of social unrest ahead of the Olympics in August, has cracked down on recent protests triggered often by arbitrary use of land by powerful local interests.         
	Carrefour praise

	Tome task    
	 London, Oct. 3: The Oxford English Dictionary is not everyones idea of a page turner, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	But a man has just completed the mammoth, if not bizarre, task of reading the 22,000-page tome cover to cover. Ammon Shea, 37, who has been dissecting dictionaries since the age of 10, spent a year absorbing 59 million words, from A to Zyxt  the equivalent of reading a John Grisham novel every day.       
	Cooped up in the basement of his local library, the removal man from New York would devote up to 10 hours a day painstakingly making his way through all 20 volumes of the OED - helped by cup after cup of very strong coffee.       
	Every time he came across an interesting word, he jotted it down, fearful that he would not remember its meaning.

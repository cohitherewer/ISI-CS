The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gaza clashes
                                                                                                               Gaza clashes
                            
	Gaza, March 1 (Reuters): Israel killed 46 Palestinians today in its deadliest and deepest incursion into the Gaza Strip since pulling out in 2005, stoking fears of a broader conflict that could derail renewed US-backed peace talks.        
	Two Israeli soldiers were also killed and seven wounded, the army said  its first casualties in four days of fighting.         
	At least 81 Palestinians have been killed since Wednesday in intense Israeli air strikes and ground raids in the tiny Hamas-controlled territory, home to 1.5 million people, bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean.        
	Israel said it was responding to cross-border rockets, which killed an Israeli man in the border town of Sderot on Wednesday and wounded others in the southern city of Ashkelon. More than 48 rockets and mortars landed in southern Israel today, including several Soviet-designed Grad missiles, which are more powerful and accurate than improvised Qassams.

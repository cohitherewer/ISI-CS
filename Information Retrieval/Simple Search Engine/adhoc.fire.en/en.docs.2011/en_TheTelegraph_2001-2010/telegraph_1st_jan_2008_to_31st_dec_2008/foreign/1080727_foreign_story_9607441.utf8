	London, July 26: Concerns were raised several months ago about the safety of a plane which made an emergency landing yesterday during a flight from London to Melbourne after a nine-foot hole opened in its fuselage.         
	The fuselage tore off the plane Australian investigators who were examining the plane in Manila were working on a theory that the aircraft may have been damaged by a pressurised container exploding in the luggage hold, or from a broken panel coming loose on the fuselage.         
	But in February there were postings on an online aviation forum referring to corrosion being found during a maintenance check on the aircraft, a 17-year-old Qantas Boeing 747, at Avalon airport in Melbourne.         
	An Australian newspaper reported that a large amount of corrosion had been found during a refurbishment earlier this year under the headline Rust bucket.         
	Speculation that rust contributed to the accident was dismissed by a spokesman for Australias Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Militant halts raids after Pak begins talks
                            
	Peshawar, April 24 (Reuters): An al Qaida-linked militant commander has ordered his followers to stop attacks in Pakistan after the new government began peace talks, a government official said today.        
	Pakistans new government that emerged from a February general election has promised to pursue negotiations in a bid to end a tide of militant violence in which hundreds of people have been killed since the middle of last year.        
	But the prospect of peace pacts with militants based in lawless tribal areas along the Afghan border has raised concern as critics say deals only give militants the opportunity to re-group and intensify their attacks in Afghanistan.        
	With talks under way, Baitullah Mehsud, a militant leader accused of organising the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December, has put out word to his followers to cease attacks in Pakistan.        
	All members of Tehrik-e-Taliban are ordered by Baitullah Mehsud that a ban is imposed on provocative activities for the sake of peace, the Tehrik-e-Taliban said in a leaflet distributed in the South Waziristan region.

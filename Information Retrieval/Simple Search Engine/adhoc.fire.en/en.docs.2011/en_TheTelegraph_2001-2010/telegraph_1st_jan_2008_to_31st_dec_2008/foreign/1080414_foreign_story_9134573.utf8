	Beijing, April 13 (AP): China has arrested nine Tibetan Buddhist monks accused of involvement in a bomb attack on a government building in Tibet, an official said today as Beijing kept up its attack on overseas critics of its crackdown on riots in the Himalayan region.        
	The monks from the Tongxia monastery in eastern Tibet fled after the home-made bomb exploded at the building in Gyanbe township in Tibet on March 23, and they later confessed to planting the explosive, the official Xinhua News Agency reported late yesterday. A local official confirmed the monks had been detained.        
	Xinhua did not explain why the alleged incident was not reported earlier, nor did it mention any casualties or damage in the explosion.        
	The bombing report builds on Beijings claims that the recent Tibetan protests were part of a violent campaign by exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and his supporters to throw off Chinese rule in Tibet and sabotage the Beijing Olympics in August.        
	The bombing is the first to be reported in Tibet since the anti-China protests began on March 10 in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, turning violent four days later.        
	The bombing came nearly two weeks after the initial protests and was the first report of violence within Tibet after China imposed tight security in the region and claimed life had returned to normal.        
	The Dalai Lama has denied involvement in violent acts and says he only wants greater autonomy for the remote mountain region. He has expressed opposition to a boycott of the Olympic Games.        
	An official with the local county public security bureau at Gongjue, around 1,374km east of Lhasa near the border with Sichuan province, confirmed that six monks had been detained for allegedly planting the bomb and three for shielding the suspects and covering up their crime. The official refused to give his name because he was not authorised to talk to the media.        
	A woman at the Tibetan regional public security department said she was not sure about the case because it was still under investigation.

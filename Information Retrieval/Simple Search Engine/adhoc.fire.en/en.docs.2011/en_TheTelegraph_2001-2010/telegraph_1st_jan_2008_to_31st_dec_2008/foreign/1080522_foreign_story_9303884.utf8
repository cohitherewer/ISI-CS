                              Pearlman                            
	Orlando, May 21 (Reuters): Boy band mogul Lou Pearlman, who launched Backstreet Boys and N Sync, was sentenced to 25 years in prison today for swindling investors and major US banks out of more than $300 million.        
	But US district judge G. Kendall Sharp gave Pearlman the chance to cut his prison time by offering a one-month reprieve for every $1 million in cash he helps a bankruptcy trustee recover for his victims.        
	Theoretically, Pearlman could cancel his entire 300-month sentence by repaying the $300 million debt.        
	His lawyer, Fletcher Peacock, said in a written plea that 25 years amounted to a sentence to death in prison for the 53-year-old impresario who lived a jet-set life of mansions and luxury cars before the fraud scheme collapsed.        
	In an audacious two-decade scam, Pearlman admitted in his plea agreement to enticing individuals and banks to invest millions of dollars in two companies which existed only on paper.

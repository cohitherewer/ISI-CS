The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran President in landmark Iraq visit 
                                                                                                               Iran President in landmark Iraq visit

	 Baghdad, March 2 (Reuters): Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hailed a new chapter in ties with Iraq today, saying he was truly happy to make a landmark trip to Baghdad now that Irans arch-foe Saddam Hussein had been deposed.        
	Ahmadinejad is the first Iranian Pesident to go to Iraq since Saddam launched a ruinous eight-year war on Iran in 1980 in which a million people died. He is also the first leader from the region to visit since the US-led invasion in 2003.        
	His trip to a country where its long-time enemy the US has more than 1,50,000 troops is therefore as much about symbolism as about cementing economic and cultural ties between the neighbours, both run by Shia majorities.         
	This visit will open a new chapter in the two countries bilateral relations and it will help the atmosphere of cooperation in the region, Ahmadinejad told a joint news conference with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani.        
	A visit to Iraq without the dictator is a truly happy one, he said, referring to Saddam, who was executed by the Iraqi government in 2006.        
	Ironically, his trip was only made possible by the US-led invasion. Ahmadinejad has repeatedly called for US forces to leave Iraq, blaming them for sectarian violence that has killed tens of thousands of Iraqis since 2003.        
	Washington says Tehran supplies weapons and training to Shia militias to attack US troops, a charge Tehran denies. Analysts say Iran seeks a stable Iraq but at the same time wants to make life difficult for occupying American forces.        
	A developed, powerful and united Iraq is to the advantage of everyone, said Ahmadinejad, the first Iranian President to visit since Irans 1979 Islamic Revolution.        
	Many of Iraqs Shia leaders were in exile in Iran during Saddams long rule and analysts say Ahmadinejad will use his visit to show Washington that Tehran is an influential player in Iraq that cannot be ignored.        
	The Iranian President has sought to counter US efforts to isolate Tehran internationally over its nuclear programme by trying to improve ties with Arab states in the region.        
	His visit comes a day before an expected UN Security Council vote tomorrow on a third round of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme, which Iran says is for peaceful purposes but the US says is for nuclear arms.        
	US officials in Baghdad have said they will play no role in Ahmadinejads visit and that the US military will not be involved in protecting him as he travels around.        
	After arriving at Baghdads airport, Ahmadinejads motorcade drove to Talabanis presidential palace. Visiting foreign dignitaries normally fly by helicopter to avoid the dangerous airport road.        
	And unlike the strict secrecy that surrounds the unannounced visits by President George W. Bush to reduce the risk of an attack, Ahmadinejads trip has been well-publicised.        
	Also, unlike Bush, he will be spending the night.        
	Ahmadinejad received a red carpet welcome at the presidential palace, with a military band greeting him on his arrival. After talks with Talabani, he met Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and Vice President Adel Abdul-Mahdi.        
	A noticeable absence from the welcoming party was Vice President Tareq al-Hashemi, a member of Iraqs minority Sunni Arab community that was dominant under Saddam. No other Sunni Arab politicians were present.        
	Scattered protests were held in Baghdad and towns with sizeable Sunni Arab populations to protest Ahmadinejads visit, witnesses said.        
	At the joint news conference with Ahmadinejad, Talabani said Iraq would seek to oust Iranian rebels based in Iraq, a long-time Iranian demand that was expected to be raised during Ahmadinejads two-day state visit.        
	The presence of those terrorists is forbidden by the constitution and we are working to get rid of them, he said.        
	Provincial officials in the southern cities of Kerbala and Najaf, home to several of Shiite Islams holiest sites that draw millions of pilgrims, said they were expecting a visit by Ahmadinejad on Monday.         
	That leg of his trip has not been officially confirmed. It is not clear whether he would drive or fly by helicopter. Driving would mean passing through thetriangle of death, a notorious hotbed of Sunni Islamist al Qaeda militants.

	Gaza City, Dec. 29 (AP): Israels air force obliterated symbols of Hamas power on the third day of its overwhelming Gaza assault today, striking a house next to the Hamas Premiers home, devastating a security compound and flattening a five-storey building at a university closely linked to the Islamic group.        
	Israels defence minister said his military is fighting a war to the bitter end against Hamas.        
	The three-day death toll rose to at least 315 by this morning, including eight children under the age of 17 who were killed in two separate strikes overnight, medics said. Israel launched its campaign, the deadliest against Palestinians in decades, on Saturday in retaliation for rocket fire aimed at civilians in southern Israeli towns.        
	The strikes have driven Hamas leaders into hiding and appear to have gravely damaged the organisations ability to launch rockets, but barrages continued.         
	Sirens warning of incoming rockets sent Israelis scrambling for cover throughout the day. One medium-range rocket fired at the Israeli city of Ashkelon killed an Arab construction worker there today and wounded several others. He was the second Israeli killed since the beginning of the offensive, and the first person ever to be killed by a rocket in Ashkelon, a city of 120,000.        
	Yesterday, Hamas missiles struck for the first time near the city of Ashdod, twice as far from Gaza as Ashkelon and only 40km from Israels heart in Tel Aviv.         
	At first light today, strong winds blew black smoke from the bombed sites in Gaza City over deserted streets.         
	The air hummed with the buzz of pilotless drones and the roar of jets, punctuated by the explosions of new airstrikes. Palestinian health officials said one strike killed four Islamic Jihad militants and a child.        
	Most of those killed since Saturday were members of Hamas security forces, though the precise numbers remain unclear. A Hamas police spokesman, Ehab Ghussen, said 180 members of the Hamas security forces were among the dead, and the UN agency in charge of Palestinian refugees said at least 51 of the dead were civilians.         
	A rise in civilian casualties could intensify international pressure on Israel to abort the offensive. Israels intense bombings reduced dozens of buildings to rubble.        
	One strike destroyed a five-storey building in the womens wing at Islamic University, one of the most prominent Hamas symbols in Gaza. Other attacks ravaged a compound controlled by Preventive Security, one of the groups chief security arms, and destroyed a house next to the residence of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas Prime Minister.

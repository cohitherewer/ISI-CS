	Reykjavik, Oct. 29 (AFP): Britain and Iceland should kiss and make up after a row over British assets frozen in stricken Icelandic banks, James Bond actor Daniel Craig said in an interview published here today.        
	I hope this will be sorted out, because this is all about money, and the last thing we should be fighting about is money, Craig, who is currently promoting the new James Bond movie Quantum of Solace, told the Frettabladid daily in a telephone interview.        
	We seem to be in a quarrel every few years, and I dont know why, he said, referring to previous tiffs.        
	Asked whether James Bond should be sent in to resolve the diplomatic hostilities between the two countries, Craig said: I dont know if his accounting skills are good enough.

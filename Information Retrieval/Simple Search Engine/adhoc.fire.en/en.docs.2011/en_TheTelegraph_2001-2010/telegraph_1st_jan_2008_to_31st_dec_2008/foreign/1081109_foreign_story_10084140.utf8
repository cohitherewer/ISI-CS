          JACKIE CALMES AND BEN WHITE                          Summers: Difficult past                                  
	Chicago, Nov. 8: Former treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers, a member of the new economic advisory board that met President-elect Barack Obama here yesterday, is also a leading candidate to be the next treasury chief.         
	That prospect has critics of Summers, particularly on the Democratic Partys left, reviving old controversies in hopes of destroying his chances. In the days since Obama was elected, liberal bloggers have sought to ignite an online opposition by recalling the rocky five years Summers spent as president of Harvard University, where he angered many women and blacks before resigning in 2006.         
	Reaching back farther, other websites have resurrected a 1991 memorandum that Summers signed as an economist at the World Bank that suggested parts of Africa could be repositories for toxic waste.        
	Summers, 53, left the meeting yesterday with Obama without answering a question about the controversies, and Obama advisers declined to discuss them.        
	The main rival to Summers for the treasury job, according to Obama advisers, is Timothy F. Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and a treasury staff member under Summers when he led the agency in the final two years of the Clinton administration.        
	But Geithner presents a different problem for Obama, who staked his campaign on a call for change in Washington, especially in areas of economic policy.        
	Though a non-partisan Federal Reserve official, Geithner is tightly linked with the policies of the current treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the Bush White House. Among the public, there remains scepticism over the wisdom and fairness of the bank bailouts.

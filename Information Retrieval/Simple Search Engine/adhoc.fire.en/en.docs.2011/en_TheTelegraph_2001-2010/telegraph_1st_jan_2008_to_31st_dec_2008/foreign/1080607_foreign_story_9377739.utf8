	Colombo, June 6 (AP): Bombs ripped through two buses in Sri Lanka today, including one packed with morning commuters near the countrys heavily fortified capital, officials said. At least 23 people were killed and 67 wounded.        
	The attacks came two days after another bombing that targeted civilians in Colombo, and authorities promptly blamed the Tamil Tiger rebels who have made such attacks a hallmark of their 25-year fight against Sri Lankas government.                    
	If carried out by the rebels  who offered no immediate comment and routinely deny any role in such bombings  the attacks, especially the one near Colombo, would show their ability to strike deep inside government territory despite a maze of security checkpoints around the capital.        
	The first bomb was detonated along a roadside at about 0535 GMT in the Colombo suburb of Moratuwa as a passenger bus went by, military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said. It killed 21 people and wounded 47 others.        
	He said that a curfew has been imposed in the area to give soldiers and police a chance to search for suspected rebels. The explosion shattered the vehicles windows and peppered it with shrapnel. A 45-year old man, who identified himself only as Nalaka, said he was thrown from his motorcycle by the explosion.        
	When I got up I saw the bus and quickly got into it. Some people lay dead. Some others were bleeding, he told AP Television News. I heard somebody screaming: Help, help, and I rushed to him, but I could not move him because he was heavy.        
	Hours later, another blast took place inside a bus in Polgolla in the central Kandy district, killing two passengers and wounding 20 other people, said police spokesman Ranjith Gunasekara.        
	President Mahinda Rajapaksa called on Sri Lankans to remain vigilant against the forces of terror, after todays first attack.        
	With much of the fighting taken place hundreds of kilometres to the north, the recent attacks have shaken the south, home to Sri Lanka Sinhalese majority, and left residents fearful of more to come. I dont know how this war is being fought in the north. I see that only on the television. But, it now seems the war has come to the capital, said Roshan Dhammika.

          J HEMANTH                           Secretive                                  
	Kathmandu, April 30: The Maoists today claimed to have sent a formal letter to King Gyanendra asking him to vacate the Narayanhitti Palace, the seat of the 239-year-old Shah dynasty.         
	Senior Maoist leader C.P. Gajural told reporters here today that the letter written by party chief Prachanda was sent to the palace seven days ago.         
	We sent the formal notice to the king through his immediate relatives to vacate the palace in deference to the wishes of the people, he said. However, he did not explain his partys stand on the issue.         
	The former rebels, who emerged as the single largest party in the April 10 Constituent Assembly elections, have said that the monarchy should be abolished and Gyanendra and his family be evicted from the palace.         
	They have also announced their plans to convert the Naryanhitti Palace into a national museum.         
	Gajurel said the Maoists were holding talks on the monarchy issue with other parties. We are keen on pursuing proper course of action in this regard. Otherwise it will a protracted process, he said, adding that the former rebels will head the new multi -party coalition government.         
	Gajurel refused to confirm whether Prachanda had sought a formal appointment with Gyanendra.         
	The UN Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) chief Ian Martin called on Prachanda today and discussed the political situation and the integration of the Peoples Liberation Army fighters into the Nepal Army.         
	Maoist sources said the two also discussed the rehabilitation of the PLA cadres staying at UN-monitored camps, disposal of mines and other explosives planted during the armed conflict.         
	They said Martin briefed Prachanda about the international communitys concerns over the integration of the PLA combatants into the army.         
	70 protesters held        
	Police in Nepal said they have detained 70 Tibetan exiles protesting in front of the Chinese embassy visa office in Kathmandu.        
	A police official at the scene today said that authorities have detained 70 exiles who were protesting in Katmandu, defying a ban on such demonstrations. Tibetan exiles have been protesting almost daily in Nepal since March 10.

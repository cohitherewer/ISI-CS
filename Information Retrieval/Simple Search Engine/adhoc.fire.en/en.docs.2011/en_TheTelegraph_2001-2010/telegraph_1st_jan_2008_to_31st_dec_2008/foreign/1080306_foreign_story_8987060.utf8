	Washington, March 5: Republicans last night chose John McCain as their nominee in the November election to succeed George W. Bush in the White House.         
	The Arizona Senator, an unabashed supporter of the war in Iraq, impressively won all the four states in which Republican primaries were held yesterday: Vermont, Ohio, Texas and Rhode Island.         
	Those wins enabled McCain to cross the magic figure of 1,191 delegates needed at the partys national convention in September to formally anoint him as the presidential candidate.         
	His only rival left in the Republican Party, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee who campaigned to amend the US Constitution to reflect Gods standards, conceded the race to McCain and pledged him full support.         
	On Wednesday, Bush will receive McCain in the White House, host him to lunch and then endorse him as the presumptive successor in the Rose Garden.         
	In the Republican camp, speculation now turns to McCains choice of his running mate. McCain is 71 and has been treated for melanoma: a relatively young, but experienced vice-presidential choice will assure voters that the presidency will not be endangered if McCain were to die in office as the oldest President to enter the White House in a first term poll.         
	While the certainty of McCains nomination cements one side of the general electoral contest, the excitement last night in politically-oriented drawing rooms across America was over the battle for the Democratic nomination.         
	Former First Lady Hillary Clintons endangered candidacy was back in the reckoning after she won three of the four states.         
	Clinton won both Texas and Ohio, the two states her husband has been calling must-win contests for the survival of her presidential ambition.                   Hillary Clinton in Columbus, Ohio. (AP)      
	She also won the small state of Rhode Island, where activisit white women had campaigned vigorously for the cause of electing Americas first female commander-in-chief. Clinton defeated Illinois Senator Barack Obama in the state by 58 to 40 per cent.         
	Obama narrowly remains the front-runner for the Democratic nomination despite Clintons three-state victories last night.         
	According to Real Clear Politics, a vote tracking site, after last nights results Obama still has more delegates to his partys national convention in August with a figure of 1542 against Clintons 1447.         
	The Democratic nominee needs 2,025 delegates before the convention in Denver, Colorado. Obama trounced Clinton by capturing 60 per cent of votes in the liberal state of Vermont against Clintons 38 per cent with 80 per cent of the votes counted.         
	The last minute leak of a Canadian diplomatic communication suggesting that Obama was saying one thing to voters and another to foreign governments over trade deals cost him dearly in Ohio where Clinton won 56 per cent of the votes against Obamas 42 per cent with three fourths of ballots counted.         
	In Texas, there was confusion over the extent of Clintons victory because under the states complicated system in the Democratic party, voters had to cast their ballots first and then attend a caucus.         
	Clinton won narrowly in the primary voting 51 to 47 against Obama, but final results from the caucuses are still not in.

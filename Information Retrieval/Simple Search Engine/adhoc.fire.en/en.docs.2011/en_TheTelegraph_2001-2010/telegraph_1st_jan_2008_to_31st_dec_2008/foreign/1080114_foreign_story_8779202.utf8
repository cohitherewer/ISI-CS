	New York, Jan. 13 (Agencies): President Pervez Musharraf has favoured the exhumation of Benazir Bhutto if her family consented, his statement coinciding with a poll that found nearly half of Pakistanis believed government agencies or politicians were involved in her assassination.
    
	Yes, exhume it (the body). A hundred per cent. I would like it to be exhumed. Because I know for sure there is no bullet wound other than on the right side. Whether it was a bullet or a strike, I dont want to comment, I dont know, Musharraf told Newsweek.
    
	Asked whether he could order a post-mortem, Musharraf said: Everything is not black and white here. If I just ordered the body exhumed, that would be careless, unless (Bhuttos) people agreed. But they will not.
    
	The President said the man in charge of the security of Bhutto -- who was killed December 27 in Rawalpindi after addressing an election rally -- was her own hand-picked superintendent of police.
    
	On the allegation that in some way the government was complicit in the killing, he said: I refuse to listen to such accusations.... I am the government, OK? I am not feudal, and I am not tribal. 
    
	Asked if he had seen the X-rays of Bhutto, he said: Yes, adding I am a soldier, Ive seen a lot of bullet wounds. A bullet wound is a small hole, and if the bullet goes through, it makes a big hole on the other side. Now that is what I understand to be a bullet wound. This was not that, although Im not an expert. But how does it absolve the government if it was a bullet or not? 
    
	Why would we be hiding (the cause of Bhuttos death)? Its ridiculous, and when I read these comments, I laugh at them, Musharraf said.
    
	But many Pakistanis dont believe militants killed her.
    
	According to a poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan, and seen by Reuters on Sunday, only 17 per cent of 1,300 people from across the country surveyed thought the Taliban or al Qaida killed the two-time prime minister.
    
	Twenty-three per cent suspected government agencies were involved while 25 per cent suspected politicians allied with the government.
    
	Twelve per cent felt that the US was responsible for her death and 4 per cent suspected India was behind it, the poll found.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Loot ladies caught on video
                                                                                                               Loot ladies caught on video

	Belgrade, Feb. 22 (Reuters): A video of two young women looting with gay abandon during rioting in the Serbian capital Belgrade is becoming a Balkan smash hit on the video-sharing website YouTube today.        
	Police arrested some looters but public humiliation by YouTube may prove a far more painful punishment for the pair, whose spree last night was also aired on local television stations and was being discussed across the Internet.        
	A persistent amateur cameraman followed the women as they loaded up with chocolates at a corner shop, came out giggling, then went after designer bags, shoes and clothes at Belgrades swankiest stores in its vandalised main shopping street.        
	Get lost, stop filming, one of them shouted, so laden down with booty that clothes and bags dripped to the ground amid the broken glass below emptied storefronts.         
	But you are the heroines of this protest for me, the cameraman replied sarcastically above the din of burglar alarms.        
	Looters seized their chance as rioters attacked western embassies during a mass rally to protest at US and European support for Kosovos independence.        
	The second woman covered her face with a pair of looted shoes when she saw she was being filmed. Have you found your size yet? asked the cameraman.

	Paris, Sept. 4 (Reuters): French justice minister Rachida Dati, one of the stars of President Nicolas Sarkozys cabinet, announced yesterday that she was pregnant but declined to say who the father was.        
	The divorced daughter of North African immigrants, Dati has become the public face of Sarkozys drive to add some much-needed diversity to French politics. Yesterday, she confirmed rumours that she was pregnant after the VSD magazine said she was expecting a child.

	Cat lost amp; found    
	 Santa Rosa (California), Nov. 12 (AP): A California couple recently had an unexpected reunion with an old housemate: their pet cat who went missing more than 13 years ago.      
	The cat, named George, was last seen by Melinda Merman and Frank Walburg in 1995. He recently resurfaced when the manager of a mobile home park trapped the sickly feline and gave him to an animal hospital.      
	A microchip implanted in George allowed him to be traced back to his owners. Merman says after George went missing she visited animal shelters and wrote to veterinarians in search of the grey, yellow-eyed cat.

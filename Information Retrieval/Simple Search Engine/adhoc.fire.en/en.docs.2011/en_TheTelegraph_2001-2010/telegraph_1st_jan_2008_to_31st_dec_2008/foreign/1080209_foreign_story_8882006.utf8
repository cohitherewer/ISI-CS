The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tough Putin warns of arms race

	Moscow, Feb. 8 (Reuters): President Vladimir Putin said today a new global arms race was starting and Russia was forced to retaliate with new, high-tech weapons.        
	In a tough speech outlining his vision for Russia to 2020, Putin accused the West of ignoring Moscows concerns on security by expanding the Nato military alliance to its borders and deploying a missile defence system in central Europe.        
	It is already clear that a new arms race is unfolding in the world. Its not our fault, we didnt start it, Putin told government, business and military leaders at the Kremlin, three months before his presidency is due to end. In effect, we are forced to retaliate... Russia has and always will have a response to these new challenges, he added.        
	Apparently referring to plans for new nuclear-capable missiles, Putin said: Over the next few years Russia will start production of new types of weapons which... are in no way inferior to what other states have and in some cases are superior.        
	Putin also said there was a fierce fight for natural resources around the globe and many conflicts and foreign policy actions smell of oil and gas.         
	Moscow needed to be on its guard against attempts to get access to its resources, he added.        
	Under the disguise of turgid declarations about freedom and open society, sometimes the sovereignty of certain states and whole regions is being destroyed, Putin said, in an apparent reference to US policy in West Asia and in particular the war in Iraq.        
	Speaking ahead of presidential elections next month which are widely expected to be won by his chosen successor Dmitry Medvedev, Putin attacked foreign countries for immoral and illegal attempts to interfere in Russias domestic affairs.        
	The Wests main election watchdog, the ODIHR, said yesterday it was scrapping plans to monitor Russias presidential election because of restrictions by Moscow on the number of observers and the amount of time they could work. Western countries have criticised democracy in Russia, saying the Kremlins dominance over the airwaves and its liberal use of government resources to help official candidates make it impossible for the opposition to compete fairly. Putin said democracy was acornerstone of Russian society.        
	Although Putins speech was billed in Russian media as a blueprint for Medvedev to follow, the president did not mention his successor by name in his 50 minutes of remarks or refer to the next government.         
	There were few specific policy details.

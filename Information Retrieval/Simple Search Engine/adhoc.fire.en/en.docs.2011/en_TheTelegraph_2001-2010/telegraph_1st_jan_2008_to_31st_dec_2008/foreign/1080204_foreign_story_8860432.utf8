	Colombo, Feb. 3 (Reuters): A suspected Tamil Tiger suicide bomber blew herself up in a packed railway station in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo today, killing 11 people and wounding around 100, the military said.
    
	The blast, on the eve of ceremonies to mark the troubled island nations 60th anniversary, came hours after a crude bomb went off in a zoo in the capital, wounding four visitors.

	London, July 10 (Reuters): Prince William has taken part in a hurricane disaster exercise in the Caribbean.        
	The prince flew ashore by helicopter from the frigate HMS Iron Duke to Montserrat yesterday as the volcanic island tested the readiness of its emergency services should it be struck by a category five storm. Sub-Lieutenant Wales has been involved in the planning from the outset, and thats primarily in developing a plan and understanding of the nature of the infrastructure on Montserrat, said HMS Iron Duke captain.

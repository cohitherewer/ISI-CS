                              Musharraf                            
	Islamabad, Aug. 10 (PTI): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf today faced mounting pressure from friends and foes to quit.        
	The calls came as the ruling coalition prepared a comprehensive and solid chargesheet to nail him in an impeachment motion to be brought in the special National Assembly session starting tomorrow.        
	We will prepare a comprehensive and solid chargesheet that Musharraf will not be able to fight it.... It is very necessary that he resigns himself, otherwise the impeachment will start, law minister Farooq Naek said after the ruling coalition met to draw up a plan to end Musharrafs nine-year reign.        
	The document to be tabled in the parliament will charge Musharraf with violation of the Constitution and misconduct.        
	The 342-member lower house will meet at 5pm tomorrow for the session that is expected to decide the fate of the 64-year-old Musharraf who has vowed not to quit and also ruled out dissolving the house to overcome the crisis facing him.        
	While there have been questions whether the coalition had the numbers in both the houses of the parliament, Pakistan Peoples Party chief Asif Ali Zardari said he was 110 per cent sure of the success of the impeachment process.        
	We had already completed the numbers game before launching such a vital move, Zardari said in an interview to a Pakistani private channel last night. The assembly has a strength of 442, and the motion will have to be passed by a two-thirds majority or 295 members.        
	Cracks have already appeared in Musharrafs main ally PML(Q) with MP Sardar Bahadur Khan Sihar advising the President to gracefully quit and claiming to have support of a dozen MPs and a couple of senators.        
	Four independent senators from federally administered tribal areas have also asked Musharraf to quit and pledged to support the impeachment motion.         
	Zardari, who had refrained from openly confronting Musharraf till now despite pressure from ally Nawas Sharifs PML(N), said he had advised the President through a common friend to resign two months ago but he did not pay heed.        
	Through a common friend, General Durrani, I had advised President Musharraf to resign two months back. But the President gave no reply, Zardari said.        
	Anti-Musharraf parties, including the Jamaat-e-Islami and some Balochistan-based nationalist parties currently sitting in Opposition benches in the Senate, have a total of 274 members, 235 in the National Assembly and 39 in the Senate, which is short of the magic number of 295.        
	Observers believe the 27 independent members, particularly those from the tribal areas, will play a crucial role.

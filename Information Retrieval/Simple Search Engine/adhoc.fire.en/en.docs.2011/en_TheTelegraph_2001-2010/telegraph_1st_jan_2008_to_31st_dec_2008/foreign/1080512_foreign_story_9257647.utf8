	Batticaloa, Sri Lanka, May 11 (Reuters): Sri Lankas ruling alliance won crucial elections in the islands war-ravaged east and hailed the result today as an endorsement of its war to defeat the Tamil Tiger rebels.        
	But election monitors and the Opposition said the poll was marred by cheating, with armed former rebels now backed by the government accused of intimidating voters.        
	The council elections, the first in the ethnically-mixed region for two decades, took place against a backdrop of violence blamed on the LTTE, who are fighting for an independent state in the north and east.        
	A Black Tiger suicide squad sank a naval ship in the eastern port of Trincomalee hours before the polls opened yesterday. A day earlier a bomb in a crowded cafe in eastern Sri Lanka had killed 12 people and injured 29.        
	It is a clear mandate against terrorism, Keheliya Rambukwella, a government minister and defence spokesperson, said soon after the election results were released.        
	We have liberated the east from the clutches of the LTTE, then we have given them economic liberation and now political liberation, now the power is in the hands of the people.        
	President Mahinda Rajapaksas ruling United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), allied with the Tamil Eela Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP), a grouping of Tiger defectors accused by rights groups of abductions and extrajudicial killings, won 20 seats in a 37-member provincial council.        
	Rajapaksa says the poll was crucial to restore democracy to the eastern coastal region, held by the Tigers until last year, and allow development after 25 years of war.        
	The elections were also part of the governments blueprint for devolution in minority Tamil areas, which it hopes will go hand-in-hand with its push to win the war, still raging in the north, in which tens of thousands of people have died.        
	We will be liberating the north and will also give them the chance of political liberation soon, Rambukwella said.        
	The TMVP, made up of fighters who defected from the mainstream Tigers in 2004 and helped the government evict their former comrades from the east of the island, were accused of election violence by monitors.

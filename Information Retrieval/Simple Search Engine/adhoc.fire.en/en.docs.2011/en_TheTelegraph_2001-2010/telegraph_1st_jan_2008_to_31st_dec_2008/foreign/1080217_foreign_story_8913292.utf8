The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mars too salty for life

          RICHARD GRAY                              
	London, Feb. 16: The surface of Mars is too salty to sustain life and has probably been inhospitable for much of the planets history, scientists have revealed.         
	Nasa researchers claim that while water existed on Mars in the past, it would have been extremely salty and highly acidic, dashing hopes of finding evidence of life on the planet.         
	They claim that even the toughest micro-organisms would have been unable to survive in the harsh environment.         
	Using data gathered by one of Nasas Mars rovers, Opportunity, which has spent months examining rocks on the Martian surface, they found the surface contained high levels of minerals that would have made any water acidic and briny.         
	Dr Andrew Knoll, a member of the rover science team, and a biologist at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, said the finding tightens the noose on the possibility of life.         
	Speaking at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston, he said conditions on Mars in the past four billion years would have been very challenging.         
	It was really salty, he said. In fact, it was salty enough that only a handful of known terrestrial organisms would have a ghost of a chance of surviving there when conditions were at their best.         
	Nasas Mars rovers  Opportunity and its twin, Spirit  have now spent more than 1,400 days on the Martian surface. They are due to be replaced by the Phoenix lander, expected to reach Mars on May 25. It will land near the planets north pole.

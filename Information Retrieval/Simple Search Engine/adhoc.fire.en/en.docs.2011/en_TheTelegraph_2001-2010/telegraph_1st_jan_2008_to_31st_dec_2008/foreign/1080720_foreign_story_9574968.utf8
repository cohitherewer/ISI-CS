	London, July 19: Enough Semtex to make 56 bombs the size of the one used in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing has been stolen from a French castle.         
	Twenty eight kilogrammes of the explosive were discovered missing yesterday with an unknown quantity of detonators, but the interior ministry said they could have been taken more than a week ago.         
	The Lyon depot is situated in a disused 19th century castle at Corbas near Lyon and is used by a civil defence unit to store explosives needed for bomb disposal workers.         
	A theft of explosives used by bomb-disposal experts to destroy munitions retrieved from former battlefields has taken place, said a statement from the interior minister Michele Alliot-Marie.         
	The statement said there had been security failings which gave the thieves their chance. The Semtex is now being searched for by French anti-terrorist police who fear it could be used to attack civilian targets. Semtex is favoured by terrorists because it is powerful, has no smell and is almost impossible to detect.         
	The investigation has to find out how they could have been stolen, a police source said, adding that the authorities were taking the theft very seriously.         
	The incident comes just weeks after a French special forces soldier fired live bullets into a crowd of families attending a demonstration at a base open day in the countrys southwest.         
	Two French aid workers were abducted in Afghanistan after gunmen tied up guards and broke into the guest house where they were sleeping, humanitarian organisation Action Against Hunger said yesterday.

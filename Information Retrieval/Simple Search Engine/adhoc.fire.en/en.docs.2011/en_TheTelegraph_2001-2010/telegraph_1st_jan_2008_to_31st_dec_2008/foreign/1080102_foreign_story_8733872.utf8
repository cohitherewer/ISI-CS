	Duel of shows    
	 New York, Jan. 1 (AP): Robin Williams will be David Lettermans first guest upon the return of his Late Show on CBS tomorrow, while NBCs writer-less Tonight show welcomes Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee.      
	The appearance of a Hollywood A-lister who can talk a mile a minute may be Lettermans way of quickly trying to draw a distinction between his show and his late-night rivals, who are working without striking writers and may also have trouble booking major entertainers.      
	Lettermans production company, Worldwide Pants, reached an agreement on Friday to have his show return with writers despite the ongoing writers strike, which began on November 5.     
	Jen honour    
	 Charleston, West Virginia (AP): Actress Jennifer Garner has been honoured as the 2007 West Virginian of the Year by her hometown newspaper. The Sunday Gazette-Mail says it chose Garner for her dedication, hard work and service as an ambassador and role model for the state of West Virginia. Garner is balancing the raising of her two-year-old daughter Violet, her marriage with fellow actor Ben Affleck and a career that includes a starring role in Cyrano de Bergerac on Broadway.    
	Spears suit    
	 New York (AP): The attorney for Kevin Federline says he wants to depose Britney Spears soon, the latest step in the former couples ongoing child-custody battle. Britney Spears will have her deposition early (next) year, Mark Vincent Kaplan told People.com late Saturday.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Forget caviar: holiday parties feel the pinch

	New York, Nov. 1: One financial services company swapped Taittinger Champagne and Chassagne-Montrachet for house wines, saving $40 a person on its forthcoming gala at Restaurant X and Bully Boy Bar in Congers, New York.        
	The restaurateur Danny Meyer said his catering company has lost three grand-scale holiday parties by three different investment banks that we had done last year.         
	And the Grinch came to ABC News last week in the form of a cost-cutting memo announcing that there would be no company-sponsored Christmas celebrations this season.        
	Against a backdrop of gyrating markets, widespread layoffs and bank failures, the autumn social season and holiday fetes are being downsized. Caterers and party planners said they were seeing cancellations  and, even more, the entertaining equivalent of a buzz cut, with simpler menus, fewer guests, shorter hours and less glamorous glassware.        
	The new austerity is partly about saving pennies in a time of uncertainty. But corporate executives, hosts and the professionals they hire say it is also about that essential element of party planning: setting the mood.        
	Everyone is very conscious of the fact that while Rome is burning, we shouldnt be having a great time, said Sean Driscoll, a partner in Glorious Food caterers. Nobodys ordering caviar as a first course.        
	Still, some companies see holiday gatherings, whatever the style and scale, as an important hedge against sagging morale  particularly at a time when raises and bonuses will likely be scarce. Its important to get people together for a little social event at that time of year, especially when its been as tough a year as this, said Peter Horowitz, a spokesman for the Wall Street law firm Shearman amp; Sterling, which is planning holiday lunches and dinners at less expensive restaurants this year.         
	But at the same time, you have to make sure that you dont go overboard.        
	Home entertainers are also paring preparations. Eileen Cohen, whose husband is a senior vice-president at Lehman Brothers, usually gives elegant dinners featuring baby lamp chops and cut flowers, but on Friday, she planned to serve turkey chili and appetizers from Costco for a Halloween party at her home in Ardsley, New York.        
	My friends and I have all been talking about doing a lot more potluck, said Cohen, whose husband, Jonathan, is still employed, helping the Wall Street firm with its bankruptcy. We still all want to get together, but one person doesnt need to absorb the whole cost.        
	Adam and Olivia Flatto, who entertain frequently at their Upper East Side apartment, said they would likely have low-key parties, and told of a recent event they helped plan at which the centerpieces were changed from fresh flowers to fresh apples  not just less expensive, but more utilitarian.         
	Debbie Bancroft, who writes a society column for Avenue magazine and plays host at her homes in Manhattan, Southampton and the Berkshires, said she expected less vintage Champagne to be poured this season.

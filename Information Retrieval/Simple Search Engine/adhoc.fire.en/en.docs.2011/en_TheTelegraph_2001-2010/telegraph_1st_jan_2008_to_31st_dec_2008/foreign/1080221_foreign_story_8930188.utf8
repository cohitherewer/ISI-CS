The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tough rule for British migrants
                                                                                                               Tough rule for British migrants
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Feb. 20: Foreigners, including Indians, who come to Britain with the intention of settling permanently in the UK should have to wait five years before they become eligible to apply for full British citizenship, it was proposed today by Jacqui Smith, the British home secretary.        
	Smith, who released a green paper containing her plans for a radical overhaul of Britains immigration laws, said that after an immigrant had submitted an application for citizenship, he or she should have to serve a probationary 12-month period before British nationality was granted.        
	During the probationary period, the applicants suitability to be welcomed as a British national, with all its privileges, would be judged. British citizenship, the home secretary emphasised more than once, was a privilege, not a right.        
	From start to finish, the process of getting British nationality would take, at least, six years but it could be longer if there was some misdemeanour on the part of the applicant during this period. Nationality would be denied if the applicant had gone to prison after committing an offence.        
	But the waiting period could be shortened to as little as a year if an immigrant showed willingness by doing good deeds, such as charity work. Immigrants will have to earn British citizenship, said Smith, who is, incidentally, the first woman to hold the post of home secretary.        
	Our new deal for citizenship is clear and fair, she told the Commons. The rights and benefits of citizenship will be available to those who can demonstrate a commitment to our shared values and a willingness to contribute to our community.         
	There was a hint of steel behind her soft words: This is a country of liberty and tolerance, opportunity and diversity. These values are reinforced by the expectation that all who live here should learn our language, play by the rules, obey the law and contribute to the economy. There are two reasons why Gordon Browns government wants to be seen to be taking a tough line on immigration. One is a popular perception that under Labour, immigration has got so out of control to the extent there are an estimated half a million illegal migrants in the country.        
	 Of equal concern is the extremism espoused by some Muslim immigrants, including refugees, who have been given shelter by Britain.         
	Among the vast majority of law-abiding immigrants, especially Hindus, there is the feeling that they are being penalised because of the actions of a Muslim extremist fringe.        
	The government is also moving to meet a common criticism that immigrants abuse the countrys welfare system. Foreigners will not be entitled to the full range of benefits until they have become citizens under Smiths proposals. Another hurdle for immigrants is that they will have to show they can handle the English language. Importing illiterate brides from the villages of Bangladesh or Punjab may become a thing of the past.

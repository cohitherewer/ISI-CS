	London, March 3: Prince Harry is to be told that he will see no more war-fighting, at least for the next 18 months, and that his complaint about food on the front line is unjustified.
    
	The only good news for the returning soldier-prince is that he is guaranteed promotion next month, after completing two years in the army, and will receive a 5,000 rise in salary. As for his dislike of the boil-in-the-bag food he had to put up with while serving in the field in southern Afghanistan, there was no official enthusiasm for his call to bring in Jamie Oliver to do for army food what he tried to do with school menus.
    
	The ministry of defence said that field rations had to be practical. The rations had been developed, an official said, to provide nutritional balance, with the required amount of calories. Sausage and beans is as close as he is going to get to his much-quoted desire to have bangers and mash in gravy. The MoD pointed out that back at base camp in Afghanistan, the food provided was fresh and there was more choice.

          BONNIE MALKIN                                    Alluring stars                                  
	London, April 18: She is two parts Kelly Brook, one part Jennifer Lopez and one part Angelina Jolie.         
	Meet Angelle L. Brook, a computer-generated composite representing British womens idea of the most seductive woman of all time.         
	Angelle combines Brooks hair and body, Lopezs nose and Jolies lips, wrapped up in the most seductive dress of all time: Marilyn Monroes white halter dress from The Seven Year Itch.         
	She was created from a survey of British womens views about seduction, commissioned by fabric conditioner firm Lenor.        
	The women voted Monroe the most seductive woman from the past, and Jolie the most seductive living woman.        
	But while British women thought that Hollywood stars were brimming with alluring attributes, they felt less confident about their own power to bewitch, the survey found.         
	Lenor pronounced the art of seduction in danger of being lost in Britain, because almost half of the respondents (49 per cent) said they did not feel seductive.         
	Blaming their hectic lifestyles, 51 per cent said they couldnt remember the last time they felt in the mood for seduction, something they believed mostly happens in the movies.         
	A new dress, compliments from a boyfriend or husband and some beautiful lingerie were listed as the things that could help British women get in the mood.         
	Almost half felt most seductive while wearing black and 69 per cent said their favourite fragrance made their thoughts turn to love.        
	The findings follow research that found men were blind to the subtle seduction techniques of the opposite sex. A womans non-verbal signals of sexual interest often prove sadly lost on the young male brain.         
	Researchers at Indiana University used nearly 300 undergraduates of both sexes to test students abilities to spot a come-on.

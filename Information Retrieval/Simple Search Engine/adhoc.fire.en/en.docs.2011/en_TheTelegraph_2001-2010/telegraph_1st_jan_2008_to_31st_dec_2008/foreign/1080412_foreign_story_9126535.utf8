                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fat generals told to shape up

	London, April 11: The Russian army has launched a fitness regime to help its fat generals lose weight and squeeze into a new designer uniform.        
	A third of the armys elite officers are overweight and 25 per cent failed a fitness test, defence ministry spokesman Vyacheslav Sedov said.        
	The army will now launch a fitness drive as it prepares to move over to a stylish uniform designed by Valentin Yudashkin.        
	The uniforms  previewed earlier this year  move away from the functional styles of the former Red Army for a more svelte, fitted look.        
	The new military uniform should match what is inside it, said Sedov.        
	The army will build gyms, swimming pools and sports halls to get the podgy and under exercised officers back in form, he added.        
	A campaign will also be launched to cultivate the culture of sport in the armed forces, said Sedov.        
	The fitness tests were organised by Lieutennat-General Vladimir Shamanov, who was decorated as a Hero of the Russian Federation for his service in Chechnya.        
	Shamanov said that the unfit officers need more physical exercises, particularly aerobic exercises. Officers are to be tested on their running, swimming and shooting skills.        
	Space boost        
	President Vladimir Putin today told officials to beef up Russias space programme and speed financing of a new cosmodrome in the Far East to keep the nations leading role in space, Russian media reported. Now we have the real chance to move from exploiting and supporting previous, often Soviet, space capital to carrying out new, ambitious projects in space, Putin said.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

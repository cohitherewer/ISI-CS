          PETER ALLEN                              
	Paris, Feb. 25: As his popularity dwindles, has French President Nicolas Sarkozy lost his cool?        
	Greeted by both boos and cheers from different sections of the crowd at an agricultural fair in Paris on Saturday, Sarkozy got into a verbal duel with a member of the crowd who refused to shake his hand.        
	The passion was high and the language was bad, but the resulting footage  filmed by an amateur cameraman  has become an Internet hit. As he moved through the crowd, Sarkozy drew near the man, who told him: Oh no, dont touch me. The President, who kept smiling, responded: Get lost, then.        
	You disgust me, the man said.        
	Get lost, you stupid bastard, Sarkozy responded.        
	The footage became an online sensation, with more than 330,000 people watching it by midday yesterday.        
	Sarkozys office refused to comment on the incident, but the leader of the Opposition Socialists, Franois Hollande, said Sarkozys verbal exchange with the visitor showed he was failing in his presidential ability to show exemplary behaviour.

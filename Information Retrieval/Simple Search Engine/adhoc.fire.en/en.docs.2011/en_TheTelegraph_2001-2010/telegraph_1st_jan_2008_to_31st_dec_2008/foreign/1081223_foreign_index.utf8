The UN and the US today criticised a weekend attack by activists on a Nepali publishing house in which witnesses said journalists were beaten and the office ransacked.                   Maybe one day they will include it on the safety instruction card: in the event of a crash, please do not start Twittering until you have left the aircraft.

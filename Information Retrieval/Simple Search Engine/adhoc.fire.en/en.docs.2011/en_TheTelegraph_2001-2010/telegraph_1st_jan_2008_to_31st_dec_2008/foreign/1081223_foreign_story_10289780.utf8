The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | I am not scared of threats: Hasina
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I am not scared of threats: Hasina
                              Hasina: Not cowed down                            
	Dhaka, Dec. 22 (PTI): Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed has refused to be cowed down by reports of assassination threats, saying: I am not afraid of death.         
	Bangladesh has beefed up security for the Awami League chief after the CNN-IBN news channel said Indian intelligence agencies had warned that an outlawed militant groups suicide squad, trained by an ISI operative, planned to assassinate Hasina before the December 29 polls.         
	I survived the (August 21, 2007) grenade attack earlier but I will never bow down to anybody other than Allah, she said at an election rally.        
	I am not afraid of death, Hasina said, adding: I am the daughter of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and I am not scared of any threats.        
	Earlier, CNN-IBN said Hasina was warned by Indian agencies that a six-member Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (Huji) suicide squad planned to kill her. We are yet to get any information officially from India, but steps have been taken to further intensify her personal security, inspector general of police Noor Mohammad said.        
	Additional Director General of the Rapid Action Battalion Colonel Gulzaruddin Ahmed said the elite anti-crime agency took the report on the assassination plan seriously. We have already ordered an intensified vigil of the militants.        
	The report said the Huji team had been trained under the watchful eye of a former Pakistani special forces officer named Ehetesham in a training camp at Kaliganj, southwestern frontier district of Satkhira, for the last two months.         
	The report came as Bangladesh last month beefed up Hasinas security as there are fears that she may be exposed to critical security risks after the former Prime Minister survived an abortive assassination.        
	Hasina and her sisters were the only ones to survive the murder of her family, including their father, former Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, in a military-backed coup in August 1975.        
	Hasina narrowly survived a grenade attack on August 21, 2004, by suspected Huji militants. Twenty four people, including Awami leader Ivy Rahman, were killed and 400 were injured.        
	Barred from rallies        
	Today, Hasina was barred from addressing election rallies. Sheikh Hasina has no schedule for election campaign today, amidst the threat of assassination from an Islamist militant organisation, the online version of the Daily Star newspaper said.

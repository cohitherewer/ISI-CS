  - 2 held, grenades seized                            Zia: Target                                  
	Dhaka, Dec. 23 (PTI): Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Khaleda Zia today abruptly abandoned an election rally in the central Comilla district as elite security forces arrested two suspected militants and seized six unexploded grenades.        
	Officials said Zia left Chandina in Comilla district as Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) troops arrested the suspects and launched a manhunt for more militants.        
	Soon after Zias departure from the area, RAB troops raided a nearby village from where one of the militants was arrested.        
	The RAB men chased the suspects as they tried to flee and arrested two of them, one with bullet wounds, from a village in neighbouring Debiddar sub-district, RAB Lieutenant Colonel Mohammad Sajjad Hossain said.        
	He added that the militants hurled six home-made grenades at the RAB forces.        
	Army explosives experts defused the grenades. However, the identities of the suspects was not known.        
	They are now in the RABs custody. We have launched a manhunt for other members of the group in the neighbourhood, an RAB official said.        
	The incident comes after the Bangladesh government said it had beefed up security for Zia and former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.        
	Huji chief        
	The chief of the Bangladesh-based militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (Huji), Mufti Abdul Hannan, and two of his associates were today sentenced to death for a 2004 grenade attack on the then British envoy to Dhaka.

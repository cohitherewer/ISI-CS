	Leap of bravery    
	 Canberra, April 3 (Reuters): An Australian man who leapt onto a crocodile after it seized his wife in its jaws, wrestling and poking it in the eyes until it let go, was praised today as a hero by startled onlookers.      
	The 2.5 metre croc charged late yesterday from shallow water at Litchfield National Park, a popular outback waterhole south of Darwin, locking jaws around the thighs of 36-year-old visitor Wendy Pethrick.      
	These crocs are vicious machines, said local man Steve Landreth, who watched amazed as Pethricks husband Norm leapt onto the reptiles back and jabbed at its eyes to free his wife.    
	Tool split    
	 Belgrade (Reuters): A Serb farmer used a grinding machine to cut in half his farm tools and machines to comply with a court ruling that he must share all his property with his ex-wife, local media reported on Thursday. Branko Zivkov, 76, told Belgrade daily Kurir he had been ready to give his wife Vukadinka her equal share of everything earned during their 45-year marriage, but was furious at being asked to give away half his farming equipment. Instead, he bought a grinder and cut in two all his tools.

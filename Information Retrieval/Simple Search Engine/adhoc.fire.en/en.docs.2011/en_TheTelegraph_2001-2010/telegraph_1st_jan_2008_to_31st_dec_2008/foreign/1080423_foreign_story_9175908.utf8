The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak coalition vows to reinstate judges
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pak coalition vows to reinstate judges
                            
	Islamabad, April 22 (Reuters): Leaders of Pakistans ruling coalition vowed today to honour a commitment to reinstate judges dismissed by President Pervez Musharraf and said any differences over the issue would not break their alliance.        
	The desire of those who think this coalition should break up will go unfulfilled, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said as he stood alongside Pakistan Peoples Party leader Asif Ali Zardari at a joint news conference in Islamabad.        
	Neither Sharif or Zardari, the widower of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, hold any government office, but they lead the two largest parties in a coalition that took power in March.        
	They formed a post-election alliance after defeating Musharrafs political allies in a February 18 vote.         
	Zardari, whose PPP leads the government, signed an accord with Sharif last month committing to the reinstatement of around 60 judges dismissed by Musharraf. Restored judges could revive challenges to Musharrafs re-election by the last parliament while still army chief. Having removed Musharrafs parliamentary support they now aim to amend the Constitution to strip him of presidential powers.

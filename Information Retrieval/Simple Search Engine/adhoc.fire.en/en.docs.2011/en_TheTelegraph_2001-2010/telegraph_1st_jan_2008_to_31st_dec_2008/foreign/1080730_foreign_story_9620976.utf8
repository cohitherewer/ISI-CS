          J. HEMANTH                               
	Kathmandu, July 29: Nepal Vice-President Parmananda Jha today clarified that he meant no ill when he took the oath of office in Hindi.        
	In a statement today, Jha explained that he chose Hindi as it is the language that links all the Madhesis living in the southern Terai plains of Nepal. Hindi is universally understood by the Madhesis who speak different languages, Jha said.        
	The Vice-President played down the controversy generated from his decision. Jha said he didnt mean to hurt the sentiments of Nepalis. I reiterate my commitment to respect all languages spoken in Nepal equally, he said, adding that he had signed all the documents in Nepali.         
	The Vice-President also feared that the protests against his choice of language could lead to communal violence. Demonstrations continued all over Nepal today despite the students calling off their agitation.

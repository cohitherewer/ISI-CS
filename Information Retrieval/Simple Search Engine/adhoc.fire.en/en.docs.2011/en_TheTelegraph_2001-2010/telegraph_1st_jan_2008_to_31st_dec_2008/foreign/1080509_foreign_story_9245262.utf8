                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       As regime ignores survivors, situation worsens
          GRAEME JENKINS                          Myanmar sailors unload Indian relief supplies in Yangon on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Yangon, May 8: With her husband in prison, a young woman sat in the ruins of her bamboo home with a toddler on her knee, cooking her last meal on an open fire.         
	I bought some dried fish before the storm, but there is enough only for today, she said. I dont know what I will do tomorrow.         
	She is one of the million people estimated to have been left homeless by Cyclone Nargis which swept over southern Myanmar on Saturday, bringing a 12 foot tidal surge and devastation in its wake.         
	The Myanmar government said today that 22,980 people are dead and another 42, 119 missing in the country of 48 million. But the charge daffaires at the US embassy in Yangon, Shari Villarosa, said more than 100,000 have died. It is the worst natural disaster in Asia since the 2004 tsunami.         
	The woman, who asked not to be named, said she had received no assistance from the military regime, but Myanmarese people know better than to look for help from that quarter.         
	I have not had anything from the government nor do I expect anything from the government, she said. All I need is my hut. I want a place to stay.         
	Nevertheless, the rumour doing the rounds in her village that the regime has rejected offers of international aid has angered local people.         
	Fifteen people were killed by Nargis in this settlement of several thousand people. Now the fields are flooded and sewage is seeping into the water used for washing and cooking.         
	The survivors are camped out in the shredded remains of their homes, each one an island in the filthy water. Yet this was not a remote village in the delta, where the crisis is worst.         
	The tower blocks of Yangon stand in clear view on the horizon only a few miles away.         
	Satellite imagery showed the Irrawaddy delta region, which took the brunt of the storm, radically altered, with whole islands submerged and one town in particular  Bogalay  almost entirely swept away. The people in this village mostly worked across the river in Yangon  a decrepit city of 4 million people that was, until recently, the capital.         
	The village men worked in construction, the women sold vegetables and the children worked in tea shops. But even in Yangon itself conditions are difficult.         
	No supplies have reached the city since Friday and the price of fuel and rice has trebled in the four days since the cyclone struck.         
	The cost of the rice needed to feed a family now exceeds a typical city persons salary of just over a dollar a day.         
	Few Yangon people are working. Shops and factories are closed. Queues for petrol pumps snake for miles along city streets still partially obstructed by fallen trees and electricity poles.         
	Only part of the city is receiving clean drinking water and what passes in Myanmar for a middle class is beginning to fret about a cholera outbreak. Asked about the possibility of fresh protests, similar to the monk-led demonstrations last year which were provoked by fuel prices rises, one man said: If it keeps going like this, it will happen.         
	Despite the scale of the disaster, the junta is determined to press ahead with a controversial referendum on Saturday to approve a constitution designed to entrench military rule.

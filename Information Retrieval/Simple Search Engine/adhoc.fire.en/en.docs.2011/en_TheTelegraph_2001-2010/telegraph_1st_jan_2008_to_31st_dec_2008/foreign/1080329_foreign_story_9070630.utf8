The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Shah Jahan sale
                                                                                                               Shah Jahan sale
          
	London, March 28 (Reuters): A gold-encrusted dagger once owned by Indian Emperor Shah Jahan could fetch $1 million when it goes on sale next month, experts said today.        
	The dagger, once part of Shah Jahans collection, is dated in the years just after the Mughal emperor came to power in the 17th century. Inscriptions on the back of the blade include Jahans official titles, date and place of birth, and an honorific parasol  an ancient pan-Asian symbol of divinity of royalty, according to Bonhams auction house.        
	Jahan, who ruled from 1628 to 1658  and is said to have had a love for beautiful objects  built the majestic Taj Mahal as a memorial to his wife Mumtaz Mahal whose death during the birth of their 14th child devastated the ruler.         
	His dagger is one of several items that are being auctioned from the private collection of a late wealthy French-textile businessman, Jacques Desenfans. The fabulous sardonyx-hilted dagger... is typical of Shah Jahans taste and character in a number of ways, the internationally acclaimed Scottish historian, William Dalrymple, wrote earlier this year.

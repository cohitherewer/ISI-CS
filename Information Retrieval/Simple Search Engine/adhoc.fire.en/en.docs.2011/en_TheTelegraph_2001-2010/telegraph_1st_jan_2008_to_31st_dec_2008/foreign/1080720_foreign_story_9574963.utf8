	Canine care    
	 London, July 19: A family pet saved an elderly Australian woman from a rogue kangaroo that attacked her on a farm in New South Wales, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Rosemary Neal, 65, was walking through a mob of kangaroos to look after some horses in a paddock at the farm near Mudgee, 160 miles northwest of Sydney.       
	Her son Darren said the area was overrun with the large marsupials, which rarely attack people, and she had felt entirely safe in their company. But then, a large male kangaroo inches taller than the 5 feet 6 inch Neal, suddenly lunged at her.       
	The kangaroo just jumped up and launched straight at her, he told local newspapers. He hit her once and she just dropped and rolled. My dog heard her screaming and bolted down and chased him off. If it wasnt for the dog shed probably be dead.     
	Rude car    
	 London: A family had a remarkable escape when a car smashed through the wall of their bedroom as they slept with their five-month-old son, reports The Daily Telegraph. Joe Poulter, 40, and his partner Angela Foss, 38, were in bed when the Mercedes ploughed through the front of their cottage in Millfield, Sunderland, just after 2.30am. Poulter, who has lived in the house for eight years, said: At first I didnt have a clue what it was when it happened. I just wanted to make sure the rest of the family were OK. Fortunately, Liam [their son] was at the other side of the room next to the window. Everybody was fine, we were left with a few bumps and bruises.     
	Piano man    
	 New York (AP): Billy Joel bade a stirring farewell to Shea Stadium on Friday during an electrifying, sold-out final show at the same ballpark where the Beatles famously ushered in a new era in rock roll four decades ago. He was joined by an all-star lineup of friends including Paul McCartney, who told Joel: Came here a long time ago. We had a blast that night and were having another one tonight. Good evening, Shea Stadium. Is this cool or what? Joel told the crowd at the New York Mets home field, which is to be razed after the baseball season to make way for a new stadium across       
	the street.    
	Euro flush    
	 Amsterdam (Reuters): A Dutch woman who accidentally flushed 900 euros down the toilet got her money back after workers fished the bank notes from the drain. The woman from the eastern town of Oldenzaal had just withdrawn 1,000 euros in 100-euro bills to spend on her coming holiday. Nine of the notes slipped out of her back pocket and into the toilet bowl while she was relieving herself. Realising what she had done, she called the local council. Using a mini-camera designed to detect blockages in drains and sewers, workers were able to find the nine bank notes, one of which had floated from the house.

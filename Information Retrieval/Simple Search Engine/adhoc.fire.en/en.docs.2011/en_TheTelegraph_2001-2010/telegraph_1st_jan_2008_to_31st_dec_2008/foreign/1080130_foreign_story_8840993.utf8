	Guangzhou (China), Jan. 29 (AP): At least 25 people were killed and 13 injured when a bus plunged off an icy road in southern China early today, as the worst winter storms in five decades threw the nations annual travel season into chaos.
    
	Numerous cities also have suffered blackouts as heavy snowfalls caused power lines to snap and hampered the delivery of coal, used to generate most of Chinas electricity.
    
	Shanghai was blanketed in white after sleet changed to snow overnight.
    
	The number of migrant workers stuck at the main train station in Guangzhou dropped to 200,000, as many simply gave up trying to make the annual trip home and cashed in their tickets. About 500,000 had camped out in the stations plaza over the last several days as heavy snowfall in provinces to the north cut off parts of the busy railway line.

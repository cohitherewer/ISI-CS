	The Irish group is the latest in a long list of ageing pop acts to launch a comeback.         
	Boyzone, reunited for a tour after splitting eight years ago, will perform at the four-day festival near Caernarfon, North Wales, on August 22.         
	Opera singer Bryn Terfel said the groups appearance was a real coup for the festival. Im very excited to be announcing that Boyzone will be opening this years Faenol Festival, he said.         
	I know that fans will turn out in droves to welcome them and enjoy their music, and as it will undoubtedly be the hottest summer festival ticket in Wales.         
	Boyzones reunion follows the successful comeback of Take That, the most popular boyband of the 1990s, and the Spice Girls, who recently completed a world tour almost a decade after they split up.        
	Boyzone, whose members include Ronan Keating, Stephen Gately, Shane Lynch, Mikey Graham and Keith Duff, rose to fame in the 1990s with a string of hits such as Father and Son, Love Me for a Reason and No Matter What.

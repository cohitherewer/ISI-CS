	New York, June 15: (AP): A street-sweeping truck roaring down a Bronx street sucked up a dog and killed her as her owner held the leash.        
	Robert Machin said he had just finished walking his two Boston terriers and was about to put them into his car when the truck appeared on Thursday morning. The retired transit worker said he was suddenly whipped around and saw one of the dogs, Ginger, being swallowed by the sweepers round bristles.        
	I went berserk at that moment because I couldnt believe what had occurred, he said yesterday.        
	Machin said he yelled at the driver to stop, but the truck kept going. He and his friends chased the truck for two-and-a -half blocks before catching up with it. Gingers slight body was later pulled from the sweeper.        
	The city department of sanitation called the death a rare and unfortunate accident.        
	A heartbroken Machin questioned whether the driver was observing proper procedures, saying the truck seemed to be barreling through the street at an unsafe speed.        
	Machin, 57, choked up as he described losing Ginger. With his children grown, he said, these two dogs, theyre my life.

          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, March 25: Pakistan Peoples Party senior leader Yousuf Raza Gilani was today sworn in as the countrys 24th Prime Minister hours after two top US diplomats airdashed to Islamabad for talks with senior officials.         
	President Pervez Musharraf, who faces a very tough time since he took over in October 1999, administered the oath to Gilani. The government that Gilani will form will mainly comprise Musharrafs foes.         
	 This was perhaps for the first time in the countrys history that the main hall in the presidency, where the swearing in ceremony took place, echoed with slogans of Long Live Bhutto after Gilani signed a copy of his oath.         
	A visibly tense Musharraf shook hands with Gilani.Yesterday Gilani ordered the immediate release of all deposed judges of the supreme courts.         
	This was the first order that Gilani passed amid thumping of desks by members and slogans of Go Musharraf Go shouted by hundreds of people in visitors gallery.         
	 The local administered removed barricades from official residences of judges, who were detained since November 3 when they had refused to take fresh oath after imposition of a state of emergency by Musharraf.         
	 The judges were released in line with an agreement reached between the PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz earlier this month.         
	Declaring to form their coalition government, the two parties agreed to restore deposed judges through parliamentary resolution.         
	 It was not clear as to when the cabinet of ministers, which usually takes oath after swearing in of the Prime Minister, will be inducted.         
	Gilani had yesterday told a group of reporters that the cabinet of ministers would be formed in consultations with all the allied parties.         
	Meanwhile, there was no official word available on purpose or agenda of unannounced visit by US deputy secretary of state John Negroponte and assistant secretary Richard Boucher. However, it was learnt that the two officials will hold meetings with Pakistani politicians and President Pervez Musharraf.         
	 The two diplomats met PML(N) chief Nawaz Sharif in Islamabad and discussed post-election situation.         
	 A PML leader said on condition of anonymity that relationship of the new government with the US ally Pervez Musharraf and repurcussions of the coalitions decision to restore judges came under discussion.

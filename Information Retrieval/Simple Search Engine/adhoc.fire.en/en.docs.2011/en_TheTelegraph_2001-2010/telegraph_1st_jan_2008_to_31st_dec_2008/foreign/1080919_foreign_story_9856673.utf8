          ROGER HIGHFIELD                              
	London, Sept. 18: Forget about the yawn-inducing Large Hadron Collider.        
	The name Halo sounds much catchier and should adorn the 4.4 billion experiment, according to a poll organised by the Royal Society of Chemistry in London.        
	The Collider does what it says on the tin, since hadron refers to the subatomic particles that the giant machine smashes together at a shade below the speed of light.         
	But this fails to reflect the drama of its mission, or the inspiration it should be conveying to the wider public, says Richard Pike, chief executive of the society.         
	It launched a competition to suggest an inspiring name for the 17-mile circumference machine.         
	After sifting more than 2,500 responses, ranging from The Big Banger to Infinite Devil Machine and The Matter Splatterer, it has now selected a winner to rechristen the vast enterprise.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

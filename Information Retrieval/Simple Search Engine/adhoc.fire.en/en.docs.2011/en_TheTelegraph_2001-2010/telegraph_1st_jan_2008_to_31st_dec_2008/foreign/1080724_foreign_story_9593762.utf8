	Tokyo, July 23 (Reuters): A strong earthquake jolted northern Japan today, injuring dozens of people, trapping hundreds in halted trains and cutting off electric power to thousands of homes.        
	The Japan Meteorological Agency said there was no threat of a tsunami from the quake, which struck at 1526 GMT and had a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 and could be felt as far away as Tokyo.        
	Chief cabinet secretary Nobutaka Machimura told reporters that at least 26 people had been injured and 6,000 homes were without electricity. A National Police Agency official said the 26 had suffered minor injuries.        
	Once its light, well have a better grasp of the situation and helicopters will be able see things like landslides, Machimura said after the government set up an emergency task force at the Prime Ministers official residence. National broadcaster NHK put the injured toll at 56.        
	East Japan Railway Co said more than 600 people were stuck on five trains that were halted due to the quake.         
	There was a fire in one building in Hachinohe, a city with a population of about 240,000.

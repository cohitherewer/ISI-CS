          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                              
	Islamabad, June 25: Pakistans supreme court today postponed a byelection in a constituency where former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had hoped to stand, pending a ruling on a decision by a lower court to bar him from the poll.        
	A Lahore high court this week barred Sharif from standing in tomorrows by-election, mainly on the basis of a criminal conviction Sharif says was politically motivated.        
	From day one, weve been convinced that Sharif is qualified to contest but conspiracies have been hatched against him since 1999 and those conspiracies continue, said Sharifs party spokesman, Siddiqul Farooq.        
	Sharifs party had refused to appeal against the disqualification.

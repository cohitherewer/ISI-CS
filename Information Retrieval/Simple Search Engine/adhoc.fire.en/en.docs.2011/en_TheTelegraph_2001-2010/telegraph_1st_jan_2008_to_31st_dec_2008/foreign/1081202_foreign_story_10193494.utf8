The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bangkok protesters focus on airports
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bangkok protesters focus on airports

	Bangkok, Dec. 2: Protesters blockading Bangkoks two airports increased their numbers today as Thailands government, paralysed by the demonstrations, braced for a court decision that could force the Prime Minister to step down and dissolve his party.         
	Arguments before Thailands constitutional court are to conclude tomorrow. The case involves allegations of voter fraud by the governing People Power Party and two of its coalition partners. A decision against the party would bar Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat and many of his ministers from politics. Political analysts expect the court to rule within a week.        
	The courts decision will precede another much anticipated event this week, the annual speech on Thursday of the ailing but highly revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who has not spoken publicly about the countrys national crisis.         
	Protesters occupying the two airports claim to be defending the interests of the king in their demonstrations, which have plunged Thailand into its worst national crisis in at least a decade and may severely damage the countrys economic growth.        
	The protesters have also occupied the Prime Ministers office in Bangkok since August but today most of them shifted to the airports, which have been shut for almost a week.         
	Chamlong Srimuang, one of the leaders of the protest group known as the Peoples Alliance for Democracy, said he was worried about further attacks at the Prime Ministers office where explosions have killed at least one protester and injured more than 100, some severely.         
	Today, airlines were flying dozens of empty planes out of the besieged Suvarnabhumi International Airport, Thailands main tourist gateway. Protesters allowed the aircraft to be flown out amid fears they would be vandalised. About 30 planes had been flown out as of early today, with another 50 to be moved later.

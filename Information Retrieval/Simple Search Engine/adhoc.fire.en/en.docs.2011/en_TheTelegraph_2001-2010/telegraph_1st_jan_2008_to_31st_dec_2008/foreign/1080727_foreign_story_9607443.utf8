          IAN EVANS                          bowing to beijing                                  
	Cape Town, July 26: A demand by China that the Zimbabwean government behave in the run-up to the Olympics lies behind Robert Mugabes surprise decision to open negotiations with the Opposition.         
	Beijing put pressure on Mugabe to begin talks because of fears that the continuing crisis in Zimbabwe risked overshadowing the Olympics, according to government and diplomatic sources.         
	Chinas leaders, who have have long enjoyed a close relationship with Zimbabwes President, feared growing protests in the run-up to the Games and so leaned on Mugabe to agree to the historic talks which began on Thursday. Their move came after Russia and China together infuriated the West by blocking a Security Council attempt to impose sanctions on members of the Zimbabwean regime.         
	Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Opposition Movement for Democratic Change, met for the first time in 10 years last week after signing a memorandum of understanding to form a government of national unity.         
	The Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe is understood to have told foreign affairs officials in Harare that his government expects Mugabes administration to behave.

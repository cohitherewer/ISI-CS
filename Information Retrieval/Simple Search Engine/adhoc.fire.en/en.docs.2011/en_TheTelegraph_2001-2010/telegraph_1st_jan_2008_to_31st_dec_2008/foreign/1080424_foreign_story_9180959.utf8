The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Blair out of ticket cash 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Blair out of ticket cash 
                            
	London, April 23 (PTI): Tony Blair may have earned millions since leaving office last year but when it came to paying his own train fare, the former British Prime Minister was found short of cash.        
	Blair, 54, recently jumped on to the Heathrow Express which allows passengers to buy a ticket on board.         
	But when the ticket collector came round to first class, a red-faced Blair could not cough up the 24.50 fare as he did not have enough cash in his wallet, the Daily Star said today.        
	However, he was bailed out by a co-passenger who paid the fare to save the blushes.        
	We do not know if he had any money on him or not but one of the people with him paid for his fare, a spokesman for Heathrow Express said.        
	In 2001, Blairs wife Cherie was forced to pay a 10 fine plus a 7.90 fare when she was caught travelling to Luton from London Blackfriars without a ticket.

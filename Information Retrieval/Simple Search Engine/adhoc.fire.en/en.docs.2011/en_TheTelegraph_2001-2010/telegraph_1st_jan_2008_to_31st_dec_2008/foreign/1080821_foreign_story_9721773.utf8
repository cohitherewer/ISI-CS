	Bare on bikes    
	 Wellington, Aug. 20 (AP): Tens of thousands of people crowded the downtown area of New Zealands biggest city today to watch about 30 topless young women riding motorcycles and open-topped cars along the main street.       
	The annual boobs on bikes parade  described as pornography by opponents and freedom of expression by the organisers  attracts a mainly male audience to Aucklands Queen Street.       
	The lunch-hour parade is to promote a weekend erotica show in the city. Thousands took pictures with digital cameras and mobile phones while some sought out vantage points on top of phone booths, bus shelters and on balconies overlooking the route.     
	Exam calls     
	 Sydney (AFP): Australian high school students will be able to telephone a friend, surf the Internet and listen to podcasts during exams under a plan revealed by a girls college on Wednesday. Sydneys Presbyterian Ladies College said it was updating the open book exam concept, in which students are able to bring in reference books, to take into account new technology. The school is experimenting the use of new media with 14 and 15-year-old English students.    
	Tall record    
	 New York (Reuters): Guinness World Records has returned the title of worlds tallest man to Chinas Bao Xishun after Ukrainian Leonid Stadnyk refused to be measured under new guidelines. Bao, who stands at 2.36 metres, held the title for a year before losing it in 2006 to Stadnyk, who is 2.57 metres tall, Craig Glenday, editor-in-chief of Guinness World Records, said.

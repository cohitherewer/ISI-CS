	Washington, April 16 (AP): Revising his position on global warming, President George W. Bush proposed today a new target for stopping the growth of US greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.        
	The President also said electric power plants should put the brakes on greenhouse gas emissions within 15 years.        
	The new White House climate initiative comes as Bush appears, in the view of congressional Democrats and environmentalists, to be increasingly irrelevant in the climate debate both on the domestic and international stage.        
	The US and other countries agreed at a meeting in December in Bali, Indonesia, to work to set firm targets for reducing greenhouse emissions by the end of 2009, as a follow-up to the Kyoto reduction targets that expire in 2012. The US rejected the Kyoto agreement.        
	To reach our 2025 goal, we will need to more rapidly slow the growth of power sector greenhouse gas emissions so that they peak within 10 to 15 years, and decline thereafter, Bush said in excerpts of the speech released early by the White House.

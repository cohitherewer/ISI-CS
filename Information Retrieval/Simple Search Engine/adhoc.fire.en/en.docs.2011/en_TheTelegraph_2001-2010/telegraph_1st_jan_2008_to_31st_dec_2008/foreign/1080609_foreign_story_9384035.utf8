	Dhaka, June 8 (Reuters): Detained former Bangladesh Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia today ruled out the possibility of going abroad for medical treatment, as was suggested by specialist doctors.        
	Another detained former Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, who like Khaleda faces corruption charges, told a court separately today that she would accept what doctors suggested on overseas treatment.

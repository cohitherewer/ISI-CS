The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | In tense first interview, Palin stumbles
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In tense first interview, Palin stumbles

	New York, Sept. 12: For the last two weeks, Democrats and even some Republicans have asked: Does Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska have enough experience to hold the second-highest office in the nation, or the presidency if the need arises?        
	Im ready, Palin answered without any hesitation in an interview with ABC News yesterday, saying she had felt no doubt about accepting Senator John McCains offer to run as his vice-presidential nominee.        
	I answered him yes, because I have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you cant blink, Palin told her interviewer, Charles Gibson. You have to be wired in a way of being so committed to the mission, the mission that were on, reform of this country and victory in the war.         
	It was perhaps the most confident answer she supplied in a sometimes tense and generally probing interview with Gibson. It was her first session with a major news organisation since she joined McCains Republican ticket two weeks ago and was immediately transformed from an obscure, first-term governor to a national political star.         
	At times visibly nervous, at others appearing to hew so closely to prepared answers that she used the exact same phrases repeatedly, Palin most visibly stumbled when she was asked by Gibson if she agreed with the Bush doctrine. Palin did not seem to know what he was talking about. Gibson, sounding like an impatient teacher, informed her that it meant the right of anticipatory self-defence.         
	At a separate event yesterday, a deployment ceremony for her son Track and thousands of other soldiers heading to Iraq from Fort Wainwright, Alaska, Palin told them they would be fighting the enemies who planned and carried out and rejoiced in the death of thousands of Americans.        
	The comments sounded reminiscent of the disputed connections the Bush administration once made, but no longer does, between Iraq and the September 11 attacks. But a senior McCain campaign aide said Palin did not believe Saddam Hussein played a role in the attacks.        
	The interview took place on the seventh anniversary of the attacks. There were no obvious gaffes during the grilling by Gibson, who was facing pressure of his own to move Palin beyond her stump speech to reveal more about her readiness for high office.        
	Palin used the interview to reinforce the muscular foreign policy of McCain, saying she would not second-guess any military action Israel deems necessary to protect itself, warning Russia away from aggression against its neighbours and generally supporting President Bushs approach to combating terrorism.

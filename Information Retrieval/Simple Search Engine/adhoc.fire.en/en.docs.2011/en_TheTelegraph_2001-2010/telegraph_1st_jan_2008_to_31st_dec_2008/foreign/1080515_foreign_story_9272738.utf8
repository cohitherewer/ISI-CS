	Dujiangyan (China), May 14 (Reuters): Exhausted rescuers and earthquake victims celebrated today when they pulled a woman eight-months pregnant and her mother alive from the rubble of their home, a rare moment of joy in this shattered city.        
	But relatives were soon throwing themselves at the feet of the rescue chief as she pulled her team out with three family members still trapped in the wreckage.        
	The toll from Chinas most deadly earthquake in three decades climbed to nearly 15,000 today as troops, firemen and civilians battled against time to save more than 25,000 people buried under rubble and mud.        
	In Dujiangyan, a city close to the quakes epicentre in Wenchuan county, Sichuan province, stricken relatives watched as firemen plucked Zhang Xiaoyan and her mother from the flattened remains of their six-storey apartment block. Zhang and her mother were taken by stretcher to an ambulance and rushed to hospital.        
	We are very happy. We have been standing here shouting for two days, said Pan Jianjun, a relative. We are so grateful to the government and Wen Jiabao for their help. But most of the firefighters left with Zhang.        
	A skeleton crew with a simple ladder promised to return with sniffer dogs, but the families predicament reflected the fate of many in this city where rescuers are still in short supply despite a massive government mobilisation. Please dont go. Save them, save them, shouted the weeping daughter of one of the three people the family said were still trapped alive.        
	Pan listed them as the Zhangs parents-in-law and her husbands grandmother.        
	In a damaged city where chaos still reigns, they have no idea which hospital their relatives have been taken to, and some of Zhangs family are not happy with authorities.        
	Sun Guoli, the fire chief from the provincial capital Chengdu who oversaw the dramatic rescue, said Dujiangyan still badly needed aid, but said more firemen would return to the damaged building. We have promised and we will do our best to get absolutely everyone out.        
	These people are all our brothers and sisters, she said.        
	Pan and several other relatives were left alone at the building. They had nowhere else to go. We have no food or tents, Pan said, as people clambered over ruins to pull stock from shops.         
	In Mianzhu, where thousands have already been confirmed dead, about 500 people were pulled out alive from crushed buildings.        
	Rescuers in Hanwang, a village in Mianzhu, sustained a girl with food and water as they struggled to free her from the ruins of a school. But television showed whole villages wiped out across the poor, mountainous region suggesting searchers would find many more bodies than survivors.        
	Strain on dams        
	Officials have also warned of dangers from increased strain on local dams as well as mudslides on brittle hillsides where rain has been forecast over the next few days.        
	Two hydropower stations in Maoxian county, where 7,000 residents and tourists remain stranded near the epicentre, were seriously damaged. Authorities warned that dams could burst.        
	Landslides had blocked the flow of two rivers in northern Qingchuan county, forming a huge lake in a region where 1,000 have already died and 700 are buried, Xinhua said.        
	The rising water could cause the mountains to collapse. We desperately need geological experts to carry out tests and fix a rescue plan, Xinhua quoted Li Hao, the countys Communist Party chief, as saying.        
	The quake had also stopped a river in the stricken Mianzhu region, prompting officials to evacuate residents and drain dams, downstream, the agency said.        
	Underscoring the urgency of relief efforts, the Communist Partys top discipline watchdog vowed to punish officials for any dereliction of duty.        
	Pictures from Beichuan, which rescuers have struggled to reach, showed near total devastation. Survivors lay alongside the dead in the open air, surrounded by rubble as state TV showed dramatic footage of soldiers parachuting in to help. The quake, the worst to hit China since 1976 when up to 300,000 died, has drowned out upbeat government propaganda.

	Paltrow outdone    
	 London, Oct. 21: Hollywood veteran Gwyneth Paltrow was outdone in the fashion stakes by younger actress Anne Hathaway when the pair attended premieres of their new films.       
	Hathaway, 25, stunned onlookers when she appeared in a strapless blue and purple dress at the premiere of her latest film Rachel Getting Married at the BFI London Film Festival.       
	Paltrow, 36, was attending the screening of her new film Two Lovers on another red carpet on the opposite side of Leicester Square in central London but failed to capture attention in a sombre black gown.       
	She opted for a gothic-style dress by Salvatore Ferragamo and a black fur shrug by Felder amp; Felder. She was also forced to wear flat shoes because of a knee injury.       
	Nearby, The Devil Wears Prada star braved the wet in the dazzling gown, signing autographs and greeting fans.

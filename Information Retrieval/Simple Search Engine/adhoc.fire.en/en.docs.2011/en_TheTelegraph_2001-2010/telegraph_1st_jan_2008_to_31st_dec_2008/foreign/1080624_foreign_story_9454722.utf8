	Milan, June 23 (AP): The latest first for Barack Obama comes off the Milan runway.        
	 Calling the US presidential hopeful the man of the moment, Donatella Versace dedicated her Spring-Summer 2009 collection presented on Saturday evening to Obama, creating a style she said was designed for a relaxed man who doesnt need to flex muscles to show he has power.        
	Chatting with reporters in the cool of the garden of her private palazzo in downtown Milan at an after-show dinner party, the designer also had some fashion tips for the campaign trail.        
	 I would get rid of the tie and jazz up the shirt, she said.        
	 In fact, there were no ties in Donatellas latest show, and shirts under jackets were either super easy with rolled up sleeves or replaced by a silk T-shirt.        
	The new Versace suit has a structured jacket softened by a double lapel or no lapel at all and slim trousers with slick tecno-fabric sheen.         
	Crazy zigzags break up the monotony of pinstripes and checks, while the pastel palette gives the collection a warm summer feel.

	Kathmandu, April 7 (AP): Bomb explosions in two key cities in Nepal wounded at least 13 people today while Nepali politicians held last-minute rallies on the last day of campaigning before the elections on Thursday.        
	A bomb exploded at a busy market in southern Nepal, wounding 12 people, police said. The blast in Birgunj city, a key transportation hub near the Indian border about 160 km south of Kathmandu, was hidden behind carts used by street vendors to sell fruits and vegetables, police chief Yogeswor Romkhani said by telephone.        
	He added that there were no suspects and no one had claimed responsibility.        
	Separately, an attacker on a motorcycle threw a bomb near the site of an election rally in Nepals capital earlier today. The bomb was thrown near a convention centre in Kathmandu, hurting at least one person but not causing any major damage, said home ministry spokesman Ekmani Nepal.        
	The attack came minutes after a rally was held in the area by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, a small group that is contesting Thursdays election for a Constituent Assembly that will decide the Himalayan nations political future.        
	Police official Mahendra Bhattachand said police were searching for the attacker and no one had claimed responsibility for the attack. It was the third bombing in the capital in four days.        
	Some 17.6 million people are eligible to vote in Thursdays election to choose the Assembly, which will rewrite the Constitution and decide key issues for Nepals future political system.        
	The election is also the first since communist rebels quit their armed struggled against Nepals government and joined the political mainstream in a process that began in 2006.         
	Nepals election law requires all campaigning to stop two days before an election, though it has been common in the past for parties to defy the law.

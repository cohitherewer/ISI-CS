          SARAH BREALEY                           A 1963 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spyder                                  
	London, Oct. 28: A Ferrari which appeared in the film Charlies Angels is up for sale alongside a Picasso-inspired Citroen and the worlds flattest car.         
	 The 1963 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spyder was driven by Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu in the film Charlies Angels: Full Throttle and is estimated to fetch up to 3.5 million. It will be auctioned tomorrow alongside the work of Dorset mechanic Andy Saunders, who has spent his life creating bizarre cars.        
	The most unusual is a 1983 Citroen 2CV which Saunders spent six months turning into an asymettrical Cubist work of art inspired by Picassos Portrait of Dora Maar. He hopes it will be bought by the Tate Gallery or the Pompidou Centre in Paris when it goes under the hammer with an estimate up to 14,000.        
	The 45-year-old from Poole is also selling the Flat Out, the worlds flattest car that was fashioned out of a Fiat 126 and stands just 21 inches high. There is also a baby version of the Hummer, made from a 1998 Suzuki Wagon, which has been dubbed the credit crunch Hummer.         
	He said: I started to make the cars just for fun, but over the years some of them have become very well known in the car world. Im delighted that they are being sold as art because I put thousands of hours into them and I aim to make their appearance striking.         
	I had never really intended to sell the cars, some have been on show in places and others are constantly appearing in car magazines. But when the opportunity came up to sell them at such a prestigious auction I decided to see what they would make.        
	Also among the 100 lots is a 1955 Ford Thunderbird which once belonged to Hollywood star John Travolta.

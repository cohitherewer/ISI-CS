The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Thai prices fall
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Thai prices fall
                            
	Bangkok, May 6 (Reuters): Thai rice prices fell around 10 per cent today as importers taking their cue from Manilas decision to scrap a large tender held back on purchases, offering respite to nations desperate for the staple.        
	Spiralling food costs  dubbed by the World Food Programme as a silent tsunami  have ignited fury and a rash of protests from Haiti to Somalia to Bangladesh after exporters curbed supplies to tame domestic inflation.         
	Prices have peaked and forced buyers to hold back on orders. Now is the time for a correction, said a trader with an international trading house said. Five Thai exporters quoted prices for 100 per cent B trade white rice , the worlds benchmark, at between $900 and $920 a tonne, free on board. Thats down from last weeks $990-$998 a tonne.        
	The price of 5 per cent broken grade white rice, which is usually purchased by the Philippines, also dropped to around $870-$890 a tonnes from last weeks $950.

	London, Jan. 31: If you are employed as a henchgoon, it may be that your colleagues consider you something of an anti-Fonzie. 
    
	Or to put it another way, working as an administrative assistant is just not cool. 
    
	A new breed of online dictionaries is recording the rapid changes that languages continually undergo, and speeding up the process of words being accepted as mainstream, experts say. 
    
	While words such as obesogen, a chemical that causes weight gain, and bullshot, an artificial screenshot used to promote a computer game, do not appear in the Oxford English Dictionary, the rise of the Internet means they are becoming increasingly familiar to many people. Printed dictionaries have strict entry criteria and even those that include slang may require a word to have been in use for a decade before it is included. 
    
	The availability of online newspapers, blogs and digitised books, has transformed the job of dictionary compilation. 
    
	This in turn has led to a clutch of websites, such as Double-Tongued Dictionary and Urban Dictionary, as well as blogs that record the emergence of new words and trends in language in greater detail than traditional dictionaries. These sites are also making it easier for professional lexicographers to keep track of language changes. 
    
	Grant Barrett, a freelance lexicographer based in New York and vice-president of the American Dialect Society, told New Scientist magazine: There is an explosion in this kind of work. No savvy lexicographer ignores Urban Dictionary. Examples include celebufreak (a freak with fame), nanoblahblah (nanotechnology-related nonsense) and non-bugnuttery (refreshing sanity).

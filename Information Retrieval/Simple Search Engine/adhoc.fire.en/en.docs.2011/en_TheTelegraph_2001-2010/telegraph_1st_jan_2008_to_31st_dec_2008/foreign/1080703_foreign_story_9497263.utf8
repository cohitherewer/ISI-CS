The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US forcing Pak to give up N-plans: Khan
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             US forcing Pak to give up N-plans: Khan
          NASIR JAFFRY                           Sinister agenda                                  
	Islamabad, July 2: Detained nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan accused the US and western countries of trying to force Pakistan to abandon its nuclear programme.         
	These countries are hatching conspiracies as they feel that Pakistan being a nuclear power poses a great threat to their interests, said Khan, who is under house arrest at his sprawling Islamabad residence since he confessed to transferring nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea in February 2004.         
	The new coalition government of Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) relaxed restrictions imposed on Khan, allowing him to talk to local and international media.         
	There are traitors and opportunists in our country and these people could play a role in accomplishing the sinister agenda of the West, Khan said in a late evening conversation with a private Pakistani TV channel.         
	The scientist, who recently denied having played any role in providing warhead technology to Swiss smugglers, asked the government to take every possible step to defend its nuclear programme.         
	President Pervez Musharraf has repeatedly said the countrys nuclear and missile assets are in the safe hands of the National Command Authority which he created in 2000 amid increasing fears in the US and Japan about possible misuse of the technology by fundamentalists.         
	Pakistan is the only Muslim nuclear power and it is not acceptable to its enemies, Khan added.         
	He said as per the western agenda, Pakistan could easily be convinced to abandon its nuclear programme after dividing it.         
	Only those nations which render sacrifices in their greater national interests, can survive.         
	Another top nuclear scientist, Sammar Mubarakmand, denied smuggling allegations against Khan.         
	Mubarakmand, who supervised the development of Shaheen missiles, said the charges against Khan that he smuggled or stole nuclear technology were unsubstantiated. Neither A.Q. Khan stole nuclear technology nor did he provide it to any other country, Mubarakmand said.         
	Khan recently denied that he was the source of sophisticated warhead designs found on the computers of Swiss smugglers.         
	Its pure lies and nonsense. Its part of Americas campaign to pressure Pakistan, Khan said while denying the allegations.         
	Pakistans foreign office had also strongly rebutted the report saying that this conjecture is surprising as no foreigner has any access to Pakistans nuclear designs.

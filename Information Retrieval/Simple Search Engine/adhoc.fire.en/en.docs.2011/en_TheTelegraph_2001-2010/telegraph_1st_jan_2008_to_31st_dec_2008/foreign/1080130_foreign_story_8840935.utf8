	Colombo, Jan. 29 (PTI): Tamil Tiger rebels today accused the Sri Lankan army of attacking a school bus and killing 17 persons, including 11 school children, in the countrys restive north.
    
	However, the military denied the charge.
    
	At least 11 school children, principal of the displaced Chinna Pandivirichchaan school and two teachers were among those killed when a deep penetration unit of the Sri Lankan army triggered a Claymore mine near the bus, the LTTE said.
    
	It said the blast, in which 17 persons were wounded, took place in south Vavuniya district, 1km from the famous Madu Church. The bus had picked up the children at Thadchanaamaruthamadu and was on its way to Paalampiddi from Madu.

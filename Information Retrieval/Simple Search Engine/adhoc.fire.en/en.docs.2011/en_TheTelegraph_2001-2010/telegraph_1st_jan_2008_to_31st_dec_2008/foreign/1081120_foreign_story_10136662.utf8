	Bruni advice    
	 New York, Nov. 19 (AP): Carla Bruni-Sarkozy thinks she could learn a thing or two from Michelle Obama, the soon-to-be US First Lady.      
	 In an interview on NBCs Today show, Frances First Lady said shed rather take Michelle Obamas advice than the other way around.      
	Bruni-Sarkozy, who has never met the wife of President-elect Barack Obama, said today: She looks like shes a great, strong, intelligent woman. The model-turned-songstress has not scrapped her musical career since marrying Nicolas Sarkozy in February. She performed music from her latest folk-pop album.

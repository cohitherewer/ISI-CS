The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gustav forces evacuation of New Orleans
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gustav forces evacuation of New Orleans

	New Orleans, Aug. 31 (Reuters): Thousands of people in New Orleans and across the US Gulf Coast fled their homes today as Hurricane Gustav barreled through the Gulf of Mexico packing a punch potentially as powerful as Hurricane Katrina.        
	New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin ordered mandatory evacuation of the city of 239,000 and told residents, this is still a big, ugly storm, still strong and I encourage everyone to leave.        
	The storm evoked memories of Katrina which struck almost exactly three years ago, flooding 80 per cent of the city, killing 1,500 people in five states and costing $80 billion.        
	Nagin warned anyone who defied evacuation orders they would face extreme danger. Travel trailers that had housed some of those displaced by Katrina might become projectiles in the hurricane-force winds. He laid down a dusk-to-dawn curfew.        
	By most accounts, evacuations from New Orleans and other coastal cities were proceeding smoothly although traffic was moving slowly on clogged highways. More than 11.5 million residents in five states could feel the impact of the storm.        
	Republican presidential nominee John McCain headed to the Gulf to survey preparations. Republicans were trying to figure out how to adjust their schedule for this weeks Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota, to take account of events on the Gulf coast.        
	The oil industry from Texas to New Orleans was shutting down offshore platforms and flood-prone refineries on shore as the storm moved toward the region that pumps around a quarter of the nations oil supply.        
	If, as currently predicted, Gustav lands west of New Orleans tomorrow as a Category 4 hurricane with wind speeds up to 249kph, its 16-ft storm surge could break through the same levees that failed three year ago. Federal officials say the levees protecting New Orleans are stronger now but still have gaps.        
	Vanessa Jones, 50, said she had planned to stay but changed her mind after watching the news all night.        
	I cant take a chance because so many people died in Katrina, Jones said as she prepared to board a bus headed to an unknown destination.        
	Katrina was a Category 3 when its 28-ft storm surge burst levees on August 29, 2005. New Orleans degenerated into chaos as stranded storm victims waited days for government rescue and law and order collapsed.        
	Thousands of people, still carrying emotional scars from Katrina, jammed highways out of New Orleans. The government lined up hundreds of buses and trains to evacuate 30,000 people who could not leave on their own and Nagin said 15,000 had been removed from the city, including hundreds in wheelchairs.        
	Residents boarded up the windows of their shops and homes before leaving town.         
	Gustav weakened to a still- dangerous Category 3 storm after it passed over Cuba after killing at least 86 people in the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Jamaica.

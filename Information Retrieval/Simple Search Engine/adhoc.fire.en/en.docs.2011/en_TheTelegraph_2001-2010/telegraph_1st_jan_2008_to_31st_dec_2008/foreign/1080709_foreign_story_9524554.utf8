	Vatican City, July 8 (Reuters): The Vatican today strongly criticised the Church of Englands plan to ordain women bishops, describing it as a historic break from Christian doctrine that will drive Anglicans and Catholics further apart.        
	The governing body of the Church of England, the mother church of world Anglicanism, confirmed yesterday it will ordain women to the powerful rank of bishop  albeit with compromise measures to appease traditionalists in its own ranks. As in the Roman Catholic Church, Anglican bishops have the ability to ordain priests.        
	The decision widens the divide between Catholic and Anglican Churches, which had been making efforts to advance dialogue in recent years despite thorny issues such as gay Anglican clergy.        
	For the future, this decision will have consequences for dialogue, which until now had borne much fruit, the Vatican office for promoting Christian unity said.        
	Such a decision is a break with apostolic tradition maintained in all of the churches in the first millennium, and is therefore a further obstacle for reconciliation between the Catholic Church and the Church of England.        
	The Roman Catholic Church says women cannot enter the priesthood because Christ chose only men as his apostles  a point it drove home in May with a decree punishing attempts to ordain women priests.

										      MICHAEL COOPER AND ELISABETH BUMILLER                        Republican candidate John McCain with Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in Dayton, Ohio, on Friday. (AP)				                                 
	Dayton (Ohio), Aug. 29: In a surprise move, Senator John McCain announced here today that he had chosen Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate, shaking up the political world at a time when his campaign has been trying to attract women.         
	Ive looked for the best to help me shake up Washington, McCain said in announcing that he had chosen Palin, a mother of five, to be his running mate.        
	In choosing Palin  a 44-year-old conservative and self-described hockey mom who has been governor for less than two years  the McCain campaign reached far outside the Washington Beltway in an election in which the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, is running on a platform of change.         
	Palin, a former mayor of the small town of Wasilla, an Anchorage suburb, and one-time beauty pageant queen, first rose to prominence as a whistle-blower uncovering ethical misconduct in state government.         
	The selection amounted to a gamble that an infusion of new leadership  and the novelty of the Republican Partys first female candidate for Vice -President  would more than compensate for the risk that Palin could undercut one of the McCain campaigns central arguments, its claim that Obama is too inexperienced to be President. The choice of Palin stands in sharp contrast to the selection of the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, a veteran lawmaker.         
	But Palin ran as a change agent when she was elected as governor of Alaska in 2006, and in a move that might have appealed to McCain, she took intense criticism from members of her own party for turning the spotlight on the failures of Alaska Republicans, some of whom had been beset by corruption scandals.         
	She was elected Alaskas chief executive after fighting off a comeback bid by a former Democratic governor. Her victory came after she had helped uncover misconduct in the administration of Governor Frank Murkowski, whom she later beat in a primary.        
	Palin opposes abortion rights, which could help pacify social conservatives in a party whose members were wary as rumours swirled that McCain might pick a running mate who did not.         
	But she differs with McCain on a controversial environmental issue that centres on her home state: she has been pushing for a new pipeline that would pump trillions of cubic feet of natural gas to the lower 48 states in the hope of delivering Alaska another economic boom.

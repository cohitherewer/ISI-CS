	Sanaa (Yemen), Sept. 18 (Reuters): Yemeni authorities have arrested 30 people suspected of belonging to al Qaida after an attack on the heavily fortified US embassy in Sanaa, a security source said today.        
	Two suicide car bombs set off a series of explosions outside the embassy compound yesterday, killing 16 people including six attackers. The dead were all Yemeni apart from an Indian woman who was walking past.        
	The security authorities want to investigate whether the suspects are linked to yesterdays attack, the security source said. A Yemeni security source said Washington would send investigators to Yemen to help the authorities.        
	Yemeni security sources said the attackers were disguised in military uniforms and had made their cars look like those driven by Yemens security forces. The gunmen in the car opened fire on embassy guards after they refused to open the metal outer gates of the compound.

	Los Angeles, June 7 (Reuters): R amp;B singer Alicia Keys is enjoying a successful worldwide tour, a chart-topping album and will act in an upcoming movie, but it might not have happened, she said, were it not for a near breakdown two years ago.        
	Keys, whose current hits include No One, is in the middle of her As I Am tour. The new As I Am album debuted on record charts at No. 1 and has sold over 3 million copies.        
	In October, she makes her film debut in The Secret Life of Bees, starring Queen Latifah and Jennifer Hudson. Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, the movie is co-produced by Will Smith and backed by independent powerhouse Fox Searchlight.        
	While Keys seems to lead a charmed life and has the sort of career that most other 26-year-olds could barely imagine, it hasnt always been so rosy.        
	Two years ago, the singer went through a troubled period that nearly derailed her life and career. A workaholic lifestyle and the death of a close relative from cancer pushed her very close to the breaking point, she admits.        
	Instead of having a public meltdown, Keys faced her demons in private. I knew I needed time away, so I went to Egypt for a month  on my own, which gave it a whole different perspective, she told Reuters in a recent interview.        
	It allowed me to see things Id never seen before  all the temples on the Nile, the Pyramids, the history. It was so rich and beautiful and strong, and it inspired me so much, and renewed me.        
	Keys said she felt like it was important to be alone so she could reflect on her thoughts and examine her life, away from the media spotlight. She also cut back her work schedule.

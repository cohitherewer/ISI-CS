The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mushy union in London
                                                                                                            Mushy union in London
          AMIT ROY                          Imran Khan and his former wife Jemima at a demonstration outside 10, Downing Street on Monday. (AFP)                                  
	London, Jan. 28: Imran and Jemima Khan came together outside 10, Downing Street today to protest against Pervez Musharraf while the Pakistani President and his wife, Sehba, were inside meeting British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah.        
	 To say Musharraf was warmly welcomed by Brown might be going too far but the Pakistani leader was received cordially and during his visit to the UK, appears to have convinced the British government that despite Benazir Bhuttos assassination, the declaration of emergency and the removal of 60 per cent of the judiciary, now is not the time to withdraw support to him.        
	At about the same time, after having joined his former wife in a demonstration, Imran told a news conference held not far away at the Foreign Press Association headquarters in Carlton House Terrace that free and fair elections would only be possible if the former chief justice of Pakistan and other judges sacked by Musharraf were reinstated. Significantly, this is not a demand that has been made either by the British or the US governments.        
	 The image of Brown and Musharraf standing shoulder to shoulder, as Imran called it, sent out a powerful message to the large Pakistani origin population in the UK. Brown hailed Pakistan, with whom Britain shared a long-standing friendship and shared history, as a key ally in combating terrorism.         
	 He stressed: A stable Pakistan is essential for security in the South Asian region. I urged President Musharraf to work with all political parties in Pakistan for a peaceful, democratic future for the country and I called on him to continue to promote reconciliation  as I know he wants to do  between moderate forces to unite against the growing threat of violent extremism.         
	He went on: For Pakistan, credible elections on February 18 are essential. President Musharraf has assured me that all electoral processes are in place to ensure transparent, credible polling.         
	The priority now for the international community and the government of Pakistan must be to ensure that the democratic process remains on track.        
	 Musharraf responded: quot;I informed the Prime Minister of our strong desire to go forward with elections and to ensure that the elections will be free, fair and transparent. Thats what our resolve is and we will have the elections on February 18. I also informed the Prime Minister of how I see the scenario developing beyond February 18... We will have peaceful transition and we will have a strong democratic government following the February 18 elections.        
	 He said he looked forward to quot;stronger relations between Pakistan and the United Kingdom quot;, and thanked Brown for Britains financial support for his country. He added that he would welcome UK assistance in improving the forensic and technical capabilities of Pakistans security forces to tackle the problem of terrorism.        
	Talking about the terror threat which has seen a rash of car bombs in Pakistan, he said: quot;We have a challenge but we are trying to cope with it. quot;At the press association, Imran, with Jemima sitting quietly nearby, was studying the TV. Have you seen Musharrafs news conference? he asked The Telegraph, as though he could scarcely believe it was taking place. With Asma Jehangir, the Pakistani human rights activist, flanking him, Imran rejected suggestions that Musharraf should be supported by the West as a bulwark against extremism and terrorism in Pakistan as the problems had worsened under his regime.         
	What is quite apparent is that the British and American governments have swallowed this line by Musharraf that he is this bastion against fundamentalism, extremism and terrorism and if something were to happen to him, the country would be swamped by extremists and terrorists, observed Imran.         
	 quot;This assumption that General Musharraf is the only person to fight terrorism is deeply flawed. He is now himself attracting terrorism. quot;

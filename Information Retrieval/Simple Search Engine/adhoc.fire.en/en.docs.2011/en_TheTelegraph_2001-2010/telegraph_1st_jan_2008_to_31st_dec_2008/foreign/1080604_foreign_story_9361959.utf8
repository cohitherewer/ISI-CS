The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Andean war of words over potato
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Andean war of words over potato
                            
	Lima, June 3 (AFP): The Irish hungered after it, Dan Quayle could not spell it, Russian cooks swear by it and China is its biggest producer.        
	Now the potato is at the root of an Andean war of words over where exactly it originated.        
	Peru and Chile, longtime rivals, are each laying claim to the vegetable, which experts agree is indigenous to South America and was spread to Europe by Spanish colonists in the 16th century.        
	At stake is the reflected glory of being the home of the patata (or papa in the Quechua language of the Andes), celebrated this year in the UN Year of the Potato.        
	Chile brought the dispute to a boil by disputing the bulk of scientific evidence  and the UN potato website  suggesting the spud was first cultivated near Lake Titicaca in southern Peru around seven millennia ago.        
	Agriculture minister Marigen Hornkhol asserted the popular tuber in fact first sprouted on Chiles southern Chiloe Island, citing DNA tests showing that almost all the 7,000 potato varieties in the Netherlands have Chilean origins.

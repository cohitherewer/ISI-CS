                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jackman to host Oscars
                            
	Los Angeles, Dec. 13: Organisers of Februarys Oscar ceremony have broken with tradition and selected Hugh Jackman, an Australian actor, rather than an American comedian or television personality to host Hollywoods biggest night.         
	The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences is no doubt hoping its surprise pick will help to turn around ratings for the star-studded broadcast.         
	The 40-year-old star of films including X-Men, Australia and next years Wolverine has never been nominated for an Oscar. But he did win an Emmy for hosting theatres Tony Awards in 2004 and was also nominated as host of the 2005 Tony Awards ceremony.                             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

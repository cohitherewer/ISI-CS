The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Voters with heavy heart in Bhutto stronghold
                                                                                                               Voters with heavy heart in Bhutto stronghold

	Naudero (Pakistan), Feb. 18 (Reuters): With a heavy heart and sorrowful eyes, 82-year-old Hajran Mirani had longed to vote her neighbour Benazir Bhutto back into power today.        
	Instead, she made her way to the same polling booth Bhutto would have voted at had it not been for her December 27 assassination, to show solidarity for the two-time former Prime Minister and her Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).        
	Voting for the National Assembly seat for Naudero, the town in southern Sindh province where Bhutto was standing, has been postponed because of Bhuttos murder in a gun and bomb suicide attack, but provincial Assembly seats are still up for grabs.        
	The sorrow will remain with us forever. We will never forget Benazir Bhutto, Mirani said, her thumb stained purple with ink after voting. Above her, the ceiling and walls are charred black, the scars of a fire that gutted the municipal building-turned-polling station in rioting that followed Bhuttos murder.         
	Two months have passed, yet we are still in mourning. Due to constant weeping, I have lost my vision, she added, as her grand-daughter led her by the hand. God is most powerful. The PPP will succeed. Farmer Pervez Bhutto, no relation but from the regions wider Bhutto clan, bows his head as he recalls his slain employer.         
	The 27-year-old works on farmland owned by the Bhutto family, which holds a feudal grip over the surrounding rural Larkana district and owns thousands of acres planted with mangoes, guava, wheat, paddy and sugar cane. Ive voted PPP my whole life, so have my family. She gave us prosperity, employment, earnings. We are her servants, he said.         
	In a separate room where men vote, an argument breaks out between a PPP official and a supporter from the party of Benazir Bhuttos second cousin and rival, veteran politician Mumtaz Ali Bhutto.         
	Voting is briefly halted while they argue over whether voters should be allowed to vote if their national identity card number is not on the electoral register.

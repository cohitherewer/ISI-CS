	Miami, Jan. 30 (Reuters): John McCain scored a hard-fought win in Floridas presidential primary yesterday, seizing the front-runners role in a heated Republican race and apparently ending one-time favourite Rudy Giulianis White House bid.
    
	McCain, an Arizona senator, defeated former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in a tight Florida battle that gives him critical momentum heading into critical February 5 Super Tuesday voting in 21 states with Republican contests.
    
	With about three-quarters of the vote counted, McCain led Romney by 36 per cent to 31 per cent. Our victory might not have reached landslide proportions, but it is sweet nonetheless, McCain told supporters chanting Mac is back in Miami.
    
	In one week we will have as close to a national primary as we have ever had in this country. I intend to win it, and be the nominee of our party, McCain said. We have a ways to go, but were getting close.
    
	Giuliani, a former New York mayor who staked his campaign on a strong showing in Florida, was leading former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee for a distant third-place finish after being ahead in national polls for much of the past year.
    
	 Giuliani planned to drop out and endorse McCain, a friend and political ally before the presidential race began, according to media reports.
    
	McCain thanked Giuliani for all you have added to this race, and Giuliani talked about his campaign in the past tense during a speech to supporters in Orlando, Florida.
    
	We ran a campaign that was uplifting, Giuliani said. You dont always win, but you can always try to do it right.
    
	McCains win puts him at the front of the pack in a seesawing Republican race to pick the partys candidate.

                                                                                                               PPP seeks Baluch ceasefire
                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 24 (AP): Benazir Bhuttos party today called for an end to military operations against insurgents in Baluchistan and the release of all political prisoners in the southwestern province where the Afghan government believes the Taliban leadership may be hiding.        
	The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which will lead the new government after winning last weeks elections, issued the call following a meeting between its top leaders and party officials from Baluchistan, where militants have been fighting for self-rule and a greater share of royalties from the areas natural gas fields.        
	In a statement, the party apologised to the people of Baluchistan for the atrocities and injustices committed against them by government forces and called for the release of all political prisoners including Akhtar Mengal, a former provincial chief minister who was arrested in a government crackdown in September 2006.        
	The statement also called for maximum provincial autonomy for Baluchistan and Pakistans three other provinces.        
	The two biggest opposition parties, including Bhuttos group, together captured at least 154 of the 268 contested seats in the National Assembly and have begun talks on forming a new coalition government.        
	 President Pervez Musharrafs ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Q, won only 40 seats. The Election Commission has yet to declare winners of six seats.         
	US officials have been concerned that the overwhelming rejection by the Pakistani voters of Musharrafs political allies could undermine the US-led war against terrorism, especially against al Qaida and Taliban fighters who have sought refuge in Baluchistan.        
	The US-backed Afghan government believes the Taliban leadership, including Mullah Omar, is hiding in Baluchistan  a charge Pakistani officials deny.

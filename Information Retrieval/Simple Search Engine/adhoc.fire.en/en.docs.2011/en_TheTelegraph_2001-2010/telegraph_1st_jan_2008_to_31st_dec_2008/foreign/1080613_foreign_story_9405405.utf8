	Dhaka, June 12 (Reuters): Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka today for foreign medical treatment.        
	Before leaving, Hasina briefly met senior leaders of the Awami League at the airport. We assured her of the partys unity, Syed Ashraful Islam, general secretary of Awami League, told reporters. He said Hasina also asked them to prepare for the December election.        
	Political analysts said Hasinas freedom, temporary though it may be, had moved the Awami League and government towards a win-win situation that would push the political process forward.

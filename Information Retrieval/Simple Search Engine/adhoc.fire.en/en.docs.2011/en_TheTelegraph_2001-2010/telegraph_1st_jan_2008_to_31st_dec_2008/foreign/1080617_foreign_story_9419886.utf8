	New York, June 16 (AP): A month after the death of Yves Saint Laurent, Christies is auctioning seven pieces of the legendary French fashion designers clothing and jewellery representing nearly every decade of his career.        
	The items at the July 2 auction include a 1958 cocktail dress for Dior and a 1970s Rive Gauche camel cable-knit sweater trimmed in fox fur similar to one Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis wore.        
	Whats exciting about the collection is that you see the progression of his career. He was a real style-setter, said Christies couture specialist Laura Leyfer.        
	Saint Laurent died on June 1 at age 71. Considered one of the most influential designers of the 20th century, his creations  from pop-art print mini-dresses to peasant skirts and elegant pantsuits  endure to this day. All items are in excellent condition and are relatively inexpensive because they arent new designs.

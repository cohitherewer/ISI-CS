	London, July 8: Hollywood blockbuster Kung Fu Panda has defied opponents who want it banned to break the box office record for animated films in China.         
	The film is the first cartoon feature in China to surpass 100 million yuan in box office receipts, the Beijing News said.         
	The comedy portrays a bumbling panda who goes on to become a martial arts star.         
	Although Chinese critics have praised the film for its story-line and animation, its producer DreamWorks has been criticised for seeking to cash in on Chinas national treasure, the panda bear.         
	Further controversy resulted from DreamWorks founder Steven Speilbergs refusal to work with Chinese authorities in planning the Olympics. After its release last month, a short-lived and nationalistic attempt to boycott the film was quickly overwhelmed by positive reviews.         
	The release of the film was also postponed in southwest China  devastated by an 8.0-magnitude earthquake  to appease survivors of the disaster in Sichuan province where many of the worlds pandas live, state press said.         
	The film has also resulted in soul-searching in Chinas film industry over why domestic movie-makers cannot produce equally entertaining works.

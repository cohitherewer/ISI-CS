The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama defends tour
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obama defends tour
                            
	London, July 26 (Reuters): US presidential candidate Barack Obama, wrapping up an overseas tour where he got a rock star reception, defended his decision to take the trip despite mixed signals about its impact on his popularity at home.        
	I am convinced that many of the issues we face at home are not going to be solved as effectively unless we have strong partners abroad, he told reporters in London today after meeting British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.        
	This was important for me not only to try to highlight or amplify how the international situation affects our economy back home but also hopefully to give people at home, but also leaders abroad, some sense of where an Obama administration might take our foreign policy.        
	Obama said he spoke with Brown on topics ranging from West Asia to climate change, terrorism and financial markets. The two men spent more than two hours together, first chatting on the patio of 10 Downing Street and during a brief stroll together in a tourist area nearby.        
	Obama, a Democrat who is running against Republican John McCain in the November 4 US election, has been on a seven-nation overseas tour that began in Iraq and Afghanistan and included Israel, Jordan and Kuwait as well as Europe. He aims to burnish his foreign policy credentials and counter McCains criticism that he lacks experience.        
	A daily tracking poll from Gallup published yesterday showed Obama with a six-point lead over McCain, close to the lead he has held over his Republican rival for the past several weeks.

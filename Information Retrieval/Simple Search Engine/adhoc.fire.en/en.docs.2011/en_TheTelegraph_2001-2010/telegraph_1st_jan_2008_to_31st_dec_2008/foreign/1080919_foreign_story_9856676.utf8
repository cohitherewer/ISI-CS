	London, Sept. 18: Texting behind the wheel is more dangerous than drink-driving.        
	The reaction times of motorists who sent texts on their mobile phone while on the road deteriorated by 35 per cent, tests carried out for the RAC Foundation showed.         
	In comparison, drivers who were at the legal alcohol limit saw just a 12 per cent drop in their reaction time, while those under the influence of cannabis were 21 per cent slower.         
	Using a simulator, motorists aged 17 to 24 carried out driving skills while writing, reading and ignoring text messages.         
	Overall driving performances, such as steering, position on the road and keeping a safe distance from the car ahead were also made far worse by using a mobile, drinking and taking drugs.         
	RAC Foundation director Stephen Glaister said: No responsible motorist would drink and drive.

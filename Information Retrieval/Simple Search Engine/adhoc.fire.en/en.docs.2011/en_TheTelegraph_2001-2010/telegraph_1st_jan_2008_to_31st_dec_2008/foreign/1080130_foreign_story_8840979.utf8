	London, Jan. 29: Three hours of exercise a week can slow the ageing process and give you a body 10 years younger than a couch potato of the same age, say researchers.
    
	Scientists at Kings College London measured the length of telomeres, which cap the chromosomes in cells and protect them from damage. These shorten with age, meaning more damage occurs. The team found that people who were active had longer telomeres than those of the same age who were sedentary.
    
	The effect was such that people who did 199 minutes or more a week of moderate to vigorous exercise, such as running, tennis or aerobics, were effectively found to be 10 years younger than those who did on an average less than 15 minutes of moderate exercise, even after considering other influences including weight and smoking.
    
	Their findings could explain why fitness fans, such as Elle MacPherson, 44, known as The Body, age so well.

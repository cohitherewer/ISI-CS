	Rocks of rage    
	 Seoul, Aug. 3 (Reuters): A furious dispute with Japan over who owns a desolate cluster of rocks has turned into a marketing opportunity for South Korean business tapping into patriotic fervour.      
	One bank has set up a popular cyber branch in the tiny Dokdo islands  called Takeshima in Japanese  which lie about halfway across the sea to Japan. Mobile phone companies have joined in. Some have ringtones based on a song eulogising South Korean rule over the islands. And one is offering a Dokdo is our territory call plan that lets subscribers donate to a campaign to promote the islands internationally as South Korean territory.    
	Gracious    
	 New York (AP): A 12-year-old girl just wanted to show her cousin the view from her familys rooftop. Instead, she fell into a chimney and plummeted down the flue for 14 stories, emerging nearly unscathed after landing on a pile of furnace soot. Grace Bergere was recovering at a New York hospital on Saturday with an injured hip. A 2-ft deep pile of ash and dust probably saved Graces life by cushioning her fall when she crashed into a basement furnace.    
	Old jokes     
	 London (Reuters): The worlds oldest recorded joke has been traced back to 1900 BC and suggests toilet humour was as popular with the ancients as it is today. It is a saying of the Sumerians, who lived in what is now southern Iraq and goes: Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husbands lap. It heads the worlds oldest top 10 joke list published by the University of Wolverhampton recently. A 1600 BC gag about a pharaoh, said to be King Snofru, comes second  How do you entertain a bored pharaoh? You sail a boatload of young women dressed only in fishing nets down the Nile and urge the pharaoh to go catch a fish.     
	UN warm-up    
	 United Nations (Reuters): The UN is encouraging its New York staff to trade wool business suits for cooler attire this summer so the organisation can slash air-conditioning costs and help the environment. There is going to be a relaxing of the dress protocols and people are being encouraged to wear lighter clothing, said US architect Michael Adlerstein, who is overseeing a $1.8 billion renovation of the UN skyscraper. Adlerstein said about $100,000 would be saved by turning the thermostats up 5 degrees to 25 degrees Celsius in the UN secretariat building and to 24 degrees Celsius in conference rooms.

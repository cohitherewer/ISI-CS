                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US envoys detained in Zimbabwe
                            
	Harare, June 5 (Reuters): Zimbabwean police detained US and British diplomats for several hours today, slashing the tyres of their cars after they visited victims of political violence ahead of a presidential vote.        
	The US blamed the incident on President Robert Mugabes government, which Washington accuses of trying to intimidate opposition MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirais supporters ahead of the June 27 run-off election.        
	Its an effort to intimidate us so that we wont go out to the rural areas and then the government can continue to beat the citizens and the supporters of the MDC, Jendayi Frazer, the top US diplomat for Africa, said in Cape Town.        
	The diplomats were released after several hours.        
	Zimbabwes deputy information minister Bright Matonga accused the diplomats of distributing campaign material for Tsvangirais Movement for Democratic Change and said they refused to disembark at a roadblock.

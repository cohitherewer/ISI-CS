	Windsor mix-up    
	 London, Sept. 12: A lorry carrying 2,000 pints of lager destined for a pub called the Windsor Castle was delivered to the Queens residence by mistake, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The 12 barrels of lager were delivered to the real Windsor Castle after they were ordered for Englands football match with Croatia.       
	Royal staff had no record of the order and turned the delivery away. They eventually made it it to the pub of the same name, which is five miles away in Maidenhead, Berkshire.       
	Pub manager Misko Coric said: The delivery was late and we were getting worried. At first we thought the driver may have had an accident or something, but then the officer informed us that he was calling from the real Windsor Castle and had a rather confused delivery driver with him.       
	I couldnt believe it. I thought it was a hoax but the officer insisted he was genuine and wanted confirmation.

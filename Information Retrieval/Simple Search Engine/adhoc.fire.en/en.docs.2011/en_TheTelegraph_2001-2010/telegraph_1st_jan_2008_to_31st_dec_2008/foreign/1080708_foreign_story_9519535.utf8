	New York, July 7 (Reuters): Pop star Madonna denied having an affair with Yankee slugger Alex Rodriguez and said in a statement to People magazine yesterday she is not planning to get divorced from her British husband Guy Ritchie.        
	Rumours that the London-based couple planned to split have been circulating for months, fuelled most recently by reports that she had hired a lawyer to divorce film maker Ritchie.        
	:My husband and I are not planning on getting a divorce, the singer said in a statement to People.        
	I brought my kids to a Yankee game. I am not romantically involved in any way with Alex Rodriguez. I have nothing to do with the state of his marriage or what spiritual path he may choose to study, she said.

	Berlin, July 2 (Reuters): A passion for soccer has helped German Chancellor Angela Merkel enhance her image and remain popular with voters the year before a federal election.        
	Merkel was widely seen punching the air during Germanys matches at the Euro 2008 soccer tournament that ended on Sunday, gave several post-match comments and consoled German players after their defeat in the final.        
	Political analysts say her ratings are unusually high for a chancellor 15 months before an election, despite criticism by business leaders that her coalition government has failed to deliver much-needed reforms in Europes biggest economy.        
	The accomplished physicist is growing in her zest for her role as leader of the people. Shes in the right place at the right time and hits the right note. Germans see her as a winner, media and political consultant Richard Schuetze said.        
	A Forsa opinion poll showed today that 60 per cent of those asked wanted Merkel as chancellor compared to just 10 per cent who favoured Kurt Beck, leader of the Social Democrats with whom Merkel shares power.        
	In contrast to Merkel, Beck has faced an onslaught from the media deriding him as an unsophisticated, rural politician. He was seen this week wearing a Roman legionnaires helmet which barely fitted him. Such images could damage his chances of standing against Merkel next year, political analysts say.        
	They say Merkel, who was a spokeswoman for the last East German government, has adopted a more subtle approach to the media than French President Nicolas Sarkozy or former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who often played up to the cameras.

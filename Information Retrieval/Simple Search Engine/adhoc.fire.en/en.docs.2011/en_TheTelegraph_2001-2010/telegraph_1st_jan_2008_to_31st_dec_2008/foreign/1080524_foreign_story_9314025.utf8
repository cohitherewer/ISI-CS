	Beichuan, May 23: The crumpled ruins of Beichuan, the most seriously damaged major town in the Sichuan earthquake zone, are to be preserved and turned into a museum and memorial.        
	The local government wants it to become not just a place to remember the 8,600 dead of the town, almost half its population, but somewhere the Chinese people can learn to prevent similar disasters.         
	After securing the towns collapsed and leaning homes, schools and office blocks, it wants to leave them as they are rather than demolishing them.         
	It is early days but a final decision needs to be made by the state council, said Zhang Jie, a spokesperson for Mianyang city government, which overseas the town.         
	Beichuan sits in a cleft in the mountains which rise up from the rice growing plains of Sichuan to the Tibetan plateau to the north. It was built in 1951  the towns original site was ironically considered too much of an earthquake risk.         
	The valley also sits on the well-known Longmen or Dragon Gate seismic fault, which triggered the quake. In the aftermath of the quake, landslides from both sides of the Sheer valley engulfed the two halves of the town.         
	The question of what to do with the survivors of this and other shattered towns and villages is one of many huge logistical challenges for the government. It issued an international appeal for 3.3 million more tents for the homeless.         
	It also increased the official death toll to 55,000 with 29,328 still missing. Of the survivors, it said 4,000 were orphans, though no decisions will be made about their future until the situation with the missing becomes clearer.         
	The authorities are also faced with a more immediate challenge with regards to Beichuan than its long-term future.         
	Above the town, more landslides have formed a natural but unstable dam with a reservoir now grown to a quarter of a mile long, on the river about 3 miles away to the north. It is one of 34 similar barrier lakes formed across the region.

	Disaster dress    
	 Rome, July 7: A bride is suing a designer after her 2,000 wedding dress came apart on her big day, leaving her semi naked at the altar, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The 30-year-old woman, who cannot be named due to Italian privacy laws, claims her big day was ruined by the poor stitching, which left her bottom on display. The bride was left in tears and the priest was left not knowing where to look.       
	The woman is claiming damages of 20,000 from the designer, who was not named but is based at Rapallo, twenty miles from Chiavari.     
	Bird bother    
	 London: Shoppers in a seaside town are being terrorised by a flock of greedy seagulls, who swoop on the unwary to steal their food, The Daily Telegraph reports. Descending from the skies in a flurry of feathers, one bird seized its chance and made off with a womans sandwich in King Street, South Shields. The 27-year-old, from Northumberland, said: I jumped out of my skin. All I was doing was trying to eat my sandwich and I get attacked by a giant seagull. It was quite scary  I had no idea they were so ruthless. It was like that Alfred Hitchcock film, The Birds.

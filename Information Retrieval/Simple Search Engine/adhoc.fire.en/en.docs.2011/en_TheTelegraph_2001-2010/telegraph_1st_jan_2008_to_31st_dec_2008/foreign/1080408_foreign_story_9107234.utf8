	New York, April 7 (PTI): Cheers men! Sexist humour is more than a chaff.         
	Exposure to such harmless jokes can lead to toleration of hostile feelings and discrimination against women, a new study has found.         
	According to the studys lead author Thomas E. Ford of Western Carolina University, Sexist humour is not simply benign amusement. It acts as a releaser of prejudice.         
	Our research demonstrates that exposure to sexist humour can create conditions that allow men  especially those who have antagonistic attitudes towards women  to express those attitudes in their behaviour.         
	The researchers came to the conclusion after analysing two experiments. In the first one, they asked a group of male participants to imagine that they were members of a work group in an organisation.         
	In that context, they either read sexist jokes, comparable non-humorous sexist statements, or neutral jokes. They were then asked to report how much money they would be willing to donate to help a womens organisation.         
	We found that men with a high level of sexism were less likely to donate to the womens organisation after reading sexist jokes, but not after reading either sexist statements or neutral jokes, Ford said.

	Washington, Nov. 25: President-elect Barack Obama is assembling a deeply experienced team of top economic advisers whose key members firmly believe that limited government spending combined with free markets can create lasting prosperity.        
	But those advisers will take over at a moment that Obama says requires just the opposite: New financial regulations and generally unthinkable levels of deficit spending are in the offing as the new administration prepares to battle the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression.        
	Right now, our economy is trapped in a vicious cycle. The turmoil on Wall Street means a new round of belt-tightening for families and businesses on Main Street, and as folks produce less and consume less, that just deepens the problems in our financial markets,Obama said in introducing his economic team at a news conference yesterday. These extraordinary stresses on our financial system require extraordinary policy responses.        
	To fashion the governments response, Obama has turned to people who have been associated with more market-oriented approaches. Timothy F. Geithner, 47, Obamas choice for treasury secretary, is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and has been a key player in negotiations aimed at saving some of the nations largest financial institutions.        
	Lawrence H. Summers, whom Obama tapped to direct his National Economic Council, served eight years in the Clinton administration, including a year and a half as treasury secretary.         
	He has argued that the economic boom enjoyed during much of Clintons presidency was largely a consequence of shrinking federal deficits. Both Summers and Geithner are proteges of Robert E. Rubin, Summerss predecessor as treasury secretary and current Citigroup director and counsellor, whose views in favour of free trade, deregulation and reduced deficits have come to define the economic approach of the Clinton years.        
	Christina D. Romer, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley who is an expert on tax policy and the nations recovery from the Depression, has been selected to lead Obamas Council of Economic Advisers. She has the principal required characteristic of a CEA chair: the ability to clearly explain unpleasant and somewhat complex truths about the world to powerful people without making them mad, said Bradford DeLong, another Berkeley economist.        
	Obama also named Melody C. Barnes, his campaigns senior domestic policy adviser, to be director of the White House Domestic Policy Council. Barnes is currently a top official in the Obama transition team. Previously, she was an executive vice-president at the liberal Centre for American Progress and, before that, a counsel to Senator Edward M. Kennedy         
	These are great choices, said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for ChannelCapitalResearch.com, an investment research firm. Right now, economics is the key thing. He is looking for experienced technocrats, despite the fact that some come from the Right or the Left.        
	Obama plans to ask his team to implement a huge stimulus plan  estimates run as high as $700 billion over the next two years  that would include money to rebuild crumbling bridges, roads and mass transit systems and jump-start a green economy by investing in alternative energy. Obama has said those initiatives are intended not just to carry the nation through the economic downturn but also to lay the foundation for a period of growth.

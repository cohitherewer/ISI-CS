	Ram in room    
	London, July 15: A ram has moved in with a family in Wales because he doesnt get on with other sheep, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The animal, named Nick Boing, has a purpose-built bungalow in the back garden, but prefers to spend his evenings watching television in the family home.      
	Nick, who was rescued by David Palmer as a newborn lamb three years ago, has become a hit with the neighbours and even accompanies him on trips in the car.      
	The 53-year-old, from Rhiwbina, Cardiff, said Nick even slept in his bed before he grew too big. He found the lamb alone in the grass on a trip to a nature reserve with his partner Caroline and 13-year-old son Nathan.       
	The family tried to leave the lamb with farmers but it refused to go near other sheep and ended up going home with them.       
	Despite having his own bungalow in the back garden, complete with carpet and windows, the sheep still likes to spend time in the living room.       
	Hes more intelligent than your average sheep thats stuck in a field. Hes in the house and in the car and meeting people over the park and around the village.    
	Lucy lines    
	Tokyo (AP): Lucy Liu had some trouble learning her lines for the hit summer animated film Kung Fu Panda. But that wasnt her fault  a lot of the time, she said, there werent any lines to learn. Working without knowing what you are doing from start to finish is very difficult, Liu said in an interview with The Associated Press. It was really improvisation. It was exciting. It keeps you on your toes. Liu, also known for her roles in Charlies Angels and Kill Bill, plays Master Viper in the movie, which is about an overweight panda who aspires to be a kung fu master. Along with Black, who plays the panda, Po, the film features the voices of Jackie Chan, Dustin Hoffman and Angelina Jolie.    
	Lucky bear    
	Canberra (Reuters): A koala that cheated death after being hit by a car at 100kmph and dragged with his head jammed through the vehicle grill for 12km is being dubbed Australias luckiest marsupial. The eight-year-old male koala, named Ely Lucky Grills by rescuers, was struck by an unwitting motorist north of Brisbane and found only when the car stopped after being flagged down by another vehicle. To have him survive and virtually unscathed is quite miraculous, Australian Wildlife Hospital spokewoman Carolyn Beaton said. Lucky hung on during his ordeal with one arm.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Jolie amp; Pitt seek Mary Poppins-style English nanny
          GRAHAM TIBBETTS                           Actress Julie Andrews in a scene from Mary Poppins                                  
	London, July 15: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are said to be recruiting a Mary Poppins-style English nanny to help them raise their new-born twins.         
	The successful candidate would live with the couple and their family at their 35 million French chateau.        
	Jolie, 33, gave birth to Knox Leon and Vivienne Marcheline at the weekend. The new arrivals bring their brood to six. The actors already have a biological daughter, Shiloh, 2, and Jolie has adopted Maddox, 6, Pax, 4 and three-year-old Zahara. She recently admitted that she and Pitt, 44, were finding it difficult juggling parenthood and film careers.        
	With two little babies to look after, I guess you reach a point where it becomes a practical question and well need full-time help, Jolie said.        
	A source close to the couple said they were looking to solve the problem by hiring a live-in nanny for Chateau Miraval in the south of France. The new residence boasts 35 bedrooms as well as a lake, forest, and a vineyard, which the couple bought after noticing the property while flying over it in a helicopter.        
	They have an established and reputable agency in London going through the process of finding them the ideal person  with the main stipulation that they choose a nanny who is English, said the source.         
	Twin scoop        
	The worlds entertainment press tripped over themselves, making embarrassing errors along the way, as they fought to be first to report the biggest celebrity story of the year: the birth of the twins.        
	In the end, the scoop went to a provincial French newspaper. It was Brad Pitt who chose to give the scoop to Nice-Matin, said assistant editor-in-chief Olivier Biscaye. He said to the doctor that the local media should be the first informed about the birth.        
	Nice-Matin put one of its most experienced reporters on the story, Jean-Francois Roubaud, who was given access that the rest of the media pack camped outside the Lenval hospital could only dream about. While security kept out other reporters, Roubaud was allowed inside the hospital and given easy access to Jolies obstetrician, Dr Michel Sussmann. So while the celebrity website In Touch Weekly almost got it right when it reported that twin girls had been born on Saturday, Nice-Matin knew better. The newspaper also spared itself the frenzied run-around of other news outlets following a false report by the US-based television programme Entertainment Tonight at the end of May that the twins had been born.        
	French gossip magazine Closer also claimed a world exclusive when it mistakenly anticipated the twins births by nearly two weeks, and several gossip websites got their names wrong.        
	We knew we would be the first in the world, said Christophe Caietti, editor of the Nice-Matin magazine section, which spotlighted the twins birth with a special insert yesterday.        
	 Roubaud was given a heads up that the Caesarean section was going to be performed 30 minutes before Jolie went in for the delivery on Saturday evening. The birth certificates show that Knox Leon was born at 6:27pm and his sister Vivienne Marcheline a minute later.        
	Roubaud spoke to the doctor around 10pm. We had all the details: the names, weight, one boy, one girl, said Caietti.        
	Nice-Matin broke the celebrity story of the year when it published news of the births on its website at 2am on Sunday, four hours before the print version hit the newsstands.         
	The access also gave the paper other little exclusive nuggets, like Pitts first words after the twins birth, as reported by Sussmann: Marvelous, wonderful!.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

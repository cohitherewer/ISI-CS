          JACKIE CALMES                          Obama: No controversies                                  
	Washington, Nov. 13: Want a top job in the Obama administration? Only pack rats need apply, preferably those not packing controversy.         
	A seven-page questionnaire being sent by the office of President-elect Barack Obama to those seeking cabinet and other high-ranking posts may be the most extensive  some say invasive  application ever.         
	The questionnaire includes 63 requests for personal and professional records, some covering applicants spouses and grown children as well, that are forcing job-seekers to rummage from basements to attics, in shoe boxes, diaries and computer archives to document both their achievements and missteps.         
	Only the smallest details are excluded; traffic tickets carrying fines of less than $50 need not be reported, the application says. Applicants are asked whether they or anyone in their family owns a gun. They must include any email that might embarrass the President-elect, along with any blog posts and links to their Facebook pages.        
	The questionnaire also asks applicants to please list all aliases or handles you have used to communicate on the Internet.         
	The vetting process for executive branch jobs has been onerous for decades, with each incoming administration erecting new barriers in an effort to avoid the mistakes of the past, or the controversies of the present. It is typically updated to reflect technological change (there was no Facebook the last time a new President came to town).         
	But Obama has elevated the vetting even beyond what might have been expected, especially when it comes to applicants family members, in a reflection of his campaign rhetoric against lobbying and the back-scratching, self-serving ways of Washington.         
	President-elect Obama made a commitment to change the way Washington does business, and the vetting process exemplifies that, said Stephanie Cutter, chief spokeswoman for the Obama transition office.

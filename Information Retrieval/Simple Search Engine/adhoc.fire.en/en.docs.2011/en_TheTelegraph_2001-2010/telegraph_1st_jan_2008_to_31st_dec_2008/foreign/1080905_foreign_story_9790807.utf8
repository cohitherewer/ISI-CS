	New York, Sept. 4 (Reuters): Japans Sony Corp has launched a voluntary recall of 438,000 Vaio portable computers, citing a potential hazard that could cause the machines to overheat or possibly burn a user.        
	It is one of the biggest computer recalls since 2006 when Dell Inc recalled 4.1 million notebook computer batteries because they could overheat and catch fire. Sonys recall affects 72,800 computers in the US, a Sony spokesman said today.        
	Sony received 15 reports of overheating, including one of a consumer who suffered a minor burn, the US Consumer Products Safety Commission said. The flaw, in Sonys VGN-TZ100, VGN-TZ200, VGN-TZ300 and VGN-TZ2000 series computers, is related to irregularly positioned wires near the computers hinge and/or dislodged screw inside the hinge that can cause a short circuit and overheat.         
	This poses a burn hazard to consumers, the agency added.

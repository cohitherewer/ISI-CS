The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | After leak, Harry to be pulled from Afghanistan
                                                                                                               After leak, Harry to be pulled from Afghanistan
          ANDREW PIERCE AND NATALIE PARIS                          Prince Harry with a .50 calibre machine gun in Helmand province, Afghanistan. (Reuters)                                  
	London, Feb. 29: Prince Harry is being pulled back from the front line in Afghanistan with immediate effect as senior generals fear he is a prime target for the Taliban.        
	The ministry of defence (MoD) has announced that he will be withdrawn amid concern that media coverage would affect the safety of troops as well as the prince himself. A spokesman described the exposure given by Australian, German and American websites to the princes secret role as regrettable but said that contingency plans had always been in place.         
	Whilst it had been intended that Prince Harry should return in a matter of weeks with the remainder of the Household Cavalry Regiment Battlegroup, the situation has now clearly changed, he said.         
	This decision has been taken primarily on the basis that the worldwide media coverage of Prince Harry in Afghanistan could impact on the security of those who are deployed there, as well as the risks to him as an individual soldier.        
	Chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, took the decision after discussions with the head of the army, chief of the general staff, General Sir Richard Dannatt.         
	The move will disappoint the prince who had been fulfiling a life-long ambition to see action as a soldier until details of his deployment were leaked. It was disclosed yesterday that the prince has spent the past 10 weeks with British troops as a battlefield air controller. The 23-year-old is the first member of the Royal Family in 25 years to serve on the front line.         
	During his time in action, the third in line to the throne has been operating only 500 yards from enemy positions, calling in air strikes and carrying out surveillance of Taliban fighters in Helmand province.         
	His military base has come under mortar and machine gun attack five times every day. In the heat of battle it has been Prince Harry, an officer in the Household Cavalry, who would give final clearance for air strikes on Taliban targets. Three British troops have been killed since he arrived in the war zone.         
	Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister, and Sir Richard last night led the tributes to the Prince, who they described as an exemplary soldier.         
	The British media, in conjunction with the MoD, had agreed not to report anything, for the princes protection, until he had safely returned. Even when he is back in Britain, the Princes personal protection will have to be reviewed, as he concedes al Qaida terrorists will now be looking to assassinate him.        
	Sir Richard said: I am very disappointed that foreign websites have decided to run this story without consulting us. This is in stark contrast to the highly responsible attitude of the whole of the UK print and broadcast media.

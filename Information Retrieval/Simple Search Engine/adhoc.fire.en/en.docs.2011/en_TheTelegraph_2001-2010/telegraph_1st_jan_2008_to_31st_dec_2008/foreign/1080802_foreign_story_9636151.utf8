                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The tortured life of Bagrams Grey Lady
          NASIR JAFFRY                           The US air base at Bagram, Afghanistan                                  
	Islamabad, Aug 1: Islamabad is abuzz with rumours about the presence of a Pakistani doctor, Afia Siddiqui, in one of Afghanistans most notoriousprisons in Bagram.         
	Known as Prisoner No. 650 and the Grey Lady, Siddiqui was allegedly handed over to the US six years ago for her links with the al Qaida.         
	While home secretary Syed Kamal Shah and other senior home ministry officials have denied the presence of such a lady in Bagram, media reports continue to suggest that she was extradited to the Afghan jail from Karachi with her children. She continues to stay in the prison in humiliating conditions.         
	She is subjected to physical and sexual torture by American troops in the jail, Urdu-language newspaper Jang reported.         
	It said Siddiqui has no separate toilet facilities and has to have a bath in full view of the other prisoners. Even leading domestic and international rights groups are raising their voices for Siddiqui.         
	On July 25, the Asian Human Rights Commission appealed for everyones support for the release of Dr Siddiqui and her 3 children who are believed to be held at Bagram jail.         
	Britains Lord Nazeer Ahmed asked questions in the House of Lords about the condition of Prisoner 650. He said she is physically tortured and continuously raped by the officers at the prison. On July 6, a British journalist, Yvonne Ridley, called for help for a Pakistani woman she believes has been held in isolation by the Americans in their Bagram detention centre for over four years.         
	I call her the Grey Lady because she is almost a ghost, a spectre whose cries and screams continues to haunt those who hear her, said Ridley. She recently visited Pakistan to spread the message about Siddiquis condition.

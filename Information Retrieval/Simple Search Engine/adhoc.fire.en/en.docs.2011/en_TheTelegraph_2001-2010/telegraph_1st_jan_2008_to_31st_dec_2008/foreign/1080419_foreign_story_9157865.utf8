                              Close relationship                            
	London, April 18: Aides close to Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes have dismissed rumours that the couple are to separate, describing the reports as absolutely false.         
	The new issue of In Touch magazine reports that Holmes plans to leave Los Angeles for Manhattan with the couples daughter Suri. The headline of the front page story is Katie wants her life back. The showbiz couple have been married for three years but sources claim the actress is tired of dressing up as Mrs Cruise and playing the perfect wife in public.         
	The story also follows reports in the Daily Mail that Cruise wanted Holmes to stay away from one of her few friends in Hollywood  Victoria Beckham, because of the negative effect their friendship was having on his wifes attitude to her own body.         
	An insider tells the magazine of course Katie still loves him (Tom), but she does often feel like the little wife that has to sit there quietly and smile serenely at everything he says.         
	The article suggests that Holmes plans to move to Manhattan with her daughter to pursue her Broadway acting ambitions. A source says: Shed love to go to Broadway to show the world she can act. Holmess representative, however, refutes the claims, saying: She and her husband enjoy a loving relationship.

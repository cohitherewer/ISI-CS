	 Paris, June 4: Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the French First Lady, taunted one of the countrys most senior women politicians about her failure to seduce President Nicolas Sarkozy, a new book claims.         
	The 40-year-old model and singer pointed at a double bed in the Elyse Palace and  turning to justice minister Rachida Dati, who is 42 and single  said: Youd have loved to occupy it, wouldnt you?        
	The scene is reounted in Carla and Nicolas  The True Story, which charts the couples 80-day romance which culminated in marriage in February.         
	What makes the book, by respected journalists Yves Azroual and Valrie Benam, so remarkable is that Carla Bruni-Sarkozy is quoted throughout.         
	It is the first time that a French First Lady has discussed her life with the President in intimate detail  something likely to shock many in France. Twice-divorced Sarkozy, 53, met his latest wife at a Paris dinner party last November.         
	It was frequently rumoured that he enjoyed a close relationship with Dati. Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, whose past lovers include Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton, resented Datis friendship with the President, the book claims.         
	Following a New Years Eve dinner at the Elyse, Bruni-Sarkozy and Dati were walking in the palaces private apartments when the then Bruni is said to have pointed at Sarkozys bed and said: Youd have loved to occupy it, wouldnt you?

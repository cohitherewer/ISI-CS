	Washington, June 2: Senior advisers to Senator Hillary Clinton have prepared the ground for her to abandon her 2008 presidential ambitions within days and not dispute the Democratic nomination all the way to the party convention in August.         
	Although she won by a wide margin over Barack Obama in yesterdays Puerto Rico primary  with 85 per cent of the vote in, she was leading by 36 percentage points  the former First Lady made no mention in her victory speech of taking her fight beyond this week.         
	Instead, she made a final appeal to some 178 uncommitted super-delegatesthat she would be the stronger general election candidate against John McCain.         
	The decision will fall on those leaders in our party empowered by the rules to vote in the Democratic convention, she said in San Juan. I do not envy you the decision you must make. She needs some 90 per cent of the 178 to back her, which is almost certainly a vain hope.

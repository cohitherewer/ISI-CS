Its Moss now
                              On top                            
	London, April 7: Kate Moss has been voted Britains best-dressed woman, winning back the top spot in Glamour magazines annual list.        
	The supermodel, 34, was ousted by Kylie Minogue in 2007 after three years at number one. But singer Minogue fell to 19 this year  apparently due to the lace black catsuit she wore on the X Factor.        
	Magazine editor Jo Elvin says of Moss: Kates back with a vengeance. Her maverick approach to fashion is an inspiration.        
	The top five best-dressed list is completed by Sienna Miller, Scarlett Johansson, The OC star Rachel Bilson and Jennifer Aniston. Alexa Chung is a new arrival at number six, as are Cat Deeley, Rihanna, Pixie Geldof, Katie Holmes and Beth Ditto.        
	Nicole Kidman, Lily Allen and Coleen McLoughlin have dropped out of the top 50, while supermodel Agyness Deyn is also absent.         
	Naomi Campbell, Amy Winehouse and Joss Stone are in the worst-dressed list, topped by Britney Spears.         
	Jessica Alba is the fastest climber, shooting up 23 places from last year to number eight, while Kate Hudson has experienced the biggest drop, falling 30 places to 39.         
	Keira Knightley is at number nine, with designer Vera Wang saying: What makes her so attractive and appealing is the tomboyish aspect to her. To be so beautiful and yet so unaware of it I find incredibly modern.        
	The list - voted for by readers  appears with the May issue of Glamour magazine on sale from February 10.         
	Former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham was voted ninth worst-dressed of 2008, but also came 10th in the best-dressed list.        
	Kate is known for her waifish figure and many advertising campaigns and is also notorious for her high-profile relationships and party lifestyle. She has appeared on over 300 magazine covers.

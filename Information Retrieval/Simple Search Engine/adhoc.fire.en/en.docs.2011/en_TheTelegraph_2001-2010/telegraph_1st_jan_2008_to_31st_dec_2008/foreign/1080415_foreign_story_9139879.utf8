The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hillary red over Bills China ties 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hillary red over Bills China ties

	Washington, April 14: Hillary Clintons denunciations of China have been undermined by disclosures that her husbands charitable foundation received a donation from a Chinese Internet company accused of aiding the crackdown in Tibet.        
	The Los Angeles Times reported that Bill Clinton, the former President, had been involved with Alibaba Inc, which manages Yahoo China. Last month the company posted a government-issued most wanted warning on the websites homepage, urging customers to provide information on Tibetan activists suspected of causing riots in the disputed Himalayan territory.        
	In 2005, Alibaba arranged for Bill Clinton to speak at a conference of Internet executives in Hangzhou, but instead of receiving a fee  which can range from $100,000 to $400,000  he accepted an undisclosed donation to the William J Clinton Foundation. A spokesman for the foundation confirmed that a donation had been received from Alibaba.        
	However, in her White House campaign, Hillary Clinton has called on President George W Bush to skip the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics in August. The violent clashes in Tibet and the failure of the Chinese government to use its full leverage with Sudan to stop the genocide in Darfur are opportunities for presidential leadership, she said recently.        
	Critics and even associates of the Clintons fear that there would be huge conflicts of interest if the couple returned to the White House and Bill Clinton acted as an international ambassador for the US, as his wife has suggested. Earlier this year it emerged that he had helped a major donor to his foundation, which combats global poverty and AIDS, gain a business deal in Kazakhstan. Against official US policy, he praised the ex-Soviet dictatorship for trying to improve its human rights.

	London, Dec. 20: Victoria Beckham has made it clear she will not allow husband David, who is joining Serie A side AC Milan on a short-term loan deal, to be interviewed by Ilaria DAmico, Italys sexiest sports presenter.         
	Reports in the Italian media claim that Victoria has ruled against Sky Sports presenter DAmico having any part in her husbands introduction to his new public. Organisers had initially intended to have DAmico interview David as part of a special feature on the couple but, at Victorias insistence, will instead undertake a more formal news conference.         
	The reports claim that the changes were made at the request of the Beckham camp after Victoria had researched Ilaria on the Internet. (A simple Google search suggests why ). DAmico first made a name for herself in sports media when she appeared on La Giostra Dei Gol and since then she has covered the 1998 World Cup in France and hosted a Uefa Cup special.         
	Before jetting out to the Italian fashion capital the couple took time to make a short visit to England where they were able to spend time with their three children  Brooklyn, nine; Romeo, six; and Cruz, three. The clamour from fashion designers, hotels and schools for an association with the Beckhams has been intense and dubbed by the Italian media Il fenomeno Beckham.

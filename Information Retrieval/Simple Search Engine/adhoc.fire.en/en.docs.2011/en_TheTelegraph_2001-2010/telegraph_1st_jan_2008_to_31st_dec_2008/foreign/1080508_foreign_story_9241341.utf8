	Washington, May 7: A decisive victory in North Carolina and a narrow loss in Indiana last night seem to have brought the Democratic Partys presidential nomination within the grasp of Barack Obama.        
	The Illinois senator, the first black-American with a reasonable chance of capturing the White House, now requires just over 180 to reach the magic figure of 2,025 delegates needed at the Democratic National Convention to get the partys nomination.        
	Even if the 400-plus delegates to be elected in the remaining party primaries and the 270-odd superdelegates, mainly party officials who are yet uncommitted, were to split evenly between Obama and his only rival, Senator Hillary Clinton, that would land the presidential nomination in Obamas lap. But a 50-50 split of the remaining delegates is unrealistic.        
	Clinton is expected to win some of the remaining six states where the party primaries are yet to be held, but not decisively enough to knock out Obama from the race.         
	But in states where Obama is likely to win, he will win decisively as he did in North Carolina last night. That means he will considerably improve on his existing lead of nearly 170 elected delegates over Clinton, bringing him closer to the finishing line ahead of his rival from New York.        
	Since nothing succeeds like success in politics, Clintons once-substantial lead among superdelegates, members of the Democratic Party establishment who were once loyal to the Clintons, is shrinking.         
	Recognising that continued bickering within their party is only damaging a real chance for Democrats to take back the White House in November, several superdelegates have switched from Clinton to Obama in recent days.        
	Clinton now fears that this trickle of superdelegates away from her could turn into a flood. Unlike delegates elected in primaries, superdelegates are free to vote for whoever they want at the partys nominating convention.        
	Last night was crucial for Obama, who had been pulverised by Clinton and the Republicans over his controversial ties with a radical Christian preacher in what appeared to be a joint effort to dirty the Illinois senators squeaky clean image.                    
	Last week, Obama comprehensively repudiated his pastor and appears to have survived this and other attempts to slander him along the primary trail.         
	He won in North Carolina by 14 points with only 1 per cent of votes yet to be counted and lost Indiana  contrary to expectations of a landslide loss  by merely two points with 99 per cent of votes counted.         
	Clinton had asserted before voting in North Carolina that the states result would change the game in the Democratic race for nomination.

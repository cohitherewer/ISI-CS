	Moscow, Aug. 12: President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia announced today that he agreed to a European peace proposal and had ordered a halt to his countrys military operation in Georgia.         
	However, Medvedev did not say that troops were pulling out and he insisted that Russian forces were still authorised to fire on enemies in South Ossetia.         
	The President said Russia had achieved its military goals in five days of fighting, during which Russian troops advanced into Georgian territory despite strong denunciations from President Bush and other western leaders.         
	But fighting appeared to continue in Georgia today  with reports of sporadic bombing and some Russian troops digging in around Georgian cities  and it was uncertain whether Medvedevs statement would lead to an end to hostilities.         
	Despite the uncertainties, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who was in Moscow to try to mediate the crisis, hailed Medvedevs decision. Other senior western officials said they thought a ceasefire proper was imminent. Later, Sarkozy and Medvedev held a news conference on the peace proposal, which calls for Russian forces to withdraw from Georgia. It was unclear whether it called for a full withdrawal from South Ossetia and Abkhazia, nor what kind of timetable might be involved.         
	The proposal calls for international talks on the future of the two disputed enclaves.         
	Sarkozy was due to fly to Georgia later to put the proposal to the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakashvili. It seems to leave open the question of the sovereignty of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, but Sarkozy said the most pressing issue was first to bring together the two sides in talks. He said: The Russians have no intention of moving into Georgia, of annexing Georgia.         
	However, in comments that are unlikely to ease relations with Georgia, Medvedev described Saakashvili as a lunatic and said that his claim that Georgian forces had observed a ceasefire was a lie.         
	The US and its European allies postponed an emergency meeting that was to be convened with the Russian ambassador to Nato, saying they needed more time to prepare for the meeting.         
	Medvedev took the lead role today, in contrast to previous days when the Russian Prime Minister, Vladimir V. Putin, was the dominant public figure in the crisis.         
	In a meeting with defence minister Anatoly Serdyukov, Medvedev said: The goal of the operation has been achieved. The security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been ensured. But he also told Serdyukov to eliminate any enemy remaining in South Ossetia. Whenever hotbeds of resistance and other aggressive plans emerge, make the decision and eliminate them, he said.        
	On the ground in Georgia fighting continued. In Poti, a port city in western Georgia, bombs could be heard falling about an hour after Medvedevs statement.         
	Residents and officials were tense as Russian troops drove through the city. They appeared to be digging into positions on the citys outskirts. There were reports that Russian troops were engaged in similar activities in the western Georgian towns of Zugdidi and Kareli, an American official said.

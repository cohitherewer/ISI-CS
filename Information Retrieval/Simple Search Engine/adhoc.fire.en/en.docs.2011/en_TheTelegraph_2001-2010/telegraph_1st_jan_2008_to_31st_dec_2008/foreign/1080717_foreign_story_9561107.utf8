	Lebanon/Israel Border, July 16 (Reuters): Israel handed over five Lebanese prisoners to Hezbollah via the Red Cross today after the Shia guerrilla group returned the bodies of two Israeli soldiers seized in a cross-border raid in 2006.        
	Among the men who arrived at the border in a Red Cross convoy was Samir Qantar, Israels longest-serving Lebanese prisoner. Wearing jeans and a grey sweater, he was mobbed by reporters and well-wishers on arrival.        
	Hezbollah has prepared a triumphant welcome for the five men freed under a deal seen by many Israelis as a painful necessity, two years after the two soldiers capture sparked a 34-day war.        
	Israel retrieved the corpses of Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev only after agreeing to release Qantar.

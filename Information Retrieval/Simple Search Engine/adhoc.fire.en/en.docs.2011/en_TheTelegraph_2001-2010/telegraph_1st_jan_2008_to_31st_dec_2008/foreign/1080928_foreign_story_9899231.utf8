	Plane push    
	 London, Sept. 27: Passengers travelling on a Chinese Shandong airlines flight were asked to get out and push when their plane broke down after landing, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The CRJ7 plane with 69 passengers and seven aircrew flying from Guilin in the south of China to Zhengzhou broke down before it could taxi to the arrivals terminal. It had travelled 500 miles before the engine failed on the runway. Airport staff were called out to push, but needed the passengers help because it would not budge. It took nearly two hours to push the jet the half mile to a side lane.    
	Birds in bag    
	 Brasilia (Reuters): Brazilian authorities recently detained a Portuguese man at Sao Paulos international airport with 200 birds in his bag. Customs officials found 65 of the 200 Canary birds dead, the agriculture ministry said in a statement. Police will charge the man, who arrived from Peru and resides in Brazil, with animal trafficking, a federal police officer at the airport said. The remaining live birds will be sent back to Peru by plane, in more humane conditions.    
	Sister act    
	 Rome (Reuters): An Italian woman who worked as a part-time judge as well as a lawyer was substituted by her identical twin sister in court so she would not lose out on legal fees when she had two simultaneous engagements. The 54-year-old twins from northern Italy have now been charged with fraud and will go on trial in January, Italys leading newspaper, Corriere della Sera, reported yesterday. When Gabriella was called to be a substitute judge she sent her sister twin Patrizia to stand in for her at an existing engagement as a defence lawyer elsewhere in the Milan area. The problem was that sister Patrizia was not a lawyer like her but charged the clients anyway. The clients discovered the sister act and are now suing both for damages.

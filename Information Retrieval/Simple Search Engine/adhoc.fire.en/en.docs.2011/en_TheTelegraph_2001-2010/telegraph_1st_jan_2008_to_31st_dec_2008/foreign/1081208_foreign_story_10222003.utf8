	Couple crisis    
	 London, Dec. 7 (Reuters): Couples are struggling to stay together as they face money worries and the threat of redundancy in the economic downturn, said Britains counselling service Relate.      
	Relate has reported a rise of almost 60 per cent in the number of couples seeking help with their relationships in October and November this year as compared with last year. The problems are to do with the recession, with job insecurity and also the escalating costs of running the family, Christine Northam, a spokesperson for Relate said. If youre dealing with these anxieties all on your own it can be very isolating, and can lead to depression and anxiety. It can impact on the relationship and that will impact on your children.    
	Paris heist    
	 Paris (Reuters): Armed robbers stole gems worth $108 million from luxury jewellers in the heart of Paris, during a raid described by French media as the most lucrative heist in Frances history. The Harry Winston chain is a long a favourite among the worlds rich and famous. A spokesperson at the Paris prosecutors office said: These are experienced bandits. They got through the main door without drawing attention to themselves. In less than 20 minutes they got up to the first floor, emptied the safes and the display cases and left through the door.    
	Veg rules    
	 London: A man who sells leftover vegetables from his garden to passers-by has been ordered to comply with European rules on weights and measures, reports The Daily Telegraph. James Cookson, a Northumberland landowner, who leaves baskets of surplus vegetables at the end of his driveway, was amazed to receive a warning from trading standards officials after they spotted an honesty box next to his stall. They ordered Cookson, who says he takes between 5 and 10 a week selling vegetables that would otherwise have gone to waste, to meet European Union requirements governing the sale of fresh foods.

	Kathmandu, April 25 (Reuters): Nepals Maoists won 220 seats in the 601-member Constituent Assembly, making them the single largest party, the election commission said today.        
	The election crowns a 2006 peace deal ending a 10-year-long Maoist insurgency that killed some 13,000 people.         
	The new Assembly will write a new Constitution and abolish Nepals 240-year-old monarchy.        
	The Maoists have secured 220 seats and they are the largest party now, said Laxman Bhattarai, the election commission spokesman.        
	The election was conducted under a complex mix of direct and proportional representation systems.         
	The Maoists took 120 of 240 seats contested in a first-past-the-post constituency system, while winning another 100 of the 335 seats under proportional representation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China vows to fight inflation
                                                                                                               China vows to fight inflation

	Beijing, March 5 (Reuters): Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao warned today that overheating remains his nations top economic foe even as global growth softens, vowing a tough fight against price rises and feverish investment.        
	In his annual state of the nation report to parliament, Wen targeted pollution, misgovernment and the gulf between the urban rich and farming poor as China prepares to go on show at the Olympic Games.        
	But he mostly dwelt on the risks that heady inflation poses to Chinas social fabric and double-digit growth, which has transformed the country into the worlds fourth-biggest economy.        
	The current price hikes and increasing inflationary pressures are the biggest concern of the people, Wen told nearly 3,000 deputies of the National Peoples Congress, gathered in the heavily-guarded Great Hall of the People.        
	As Wen and President Hu Jintao head into a second five-year term running the country of more than 1.3 billion people, they have vowed to build a harmonious society freed of strains over inequality and noxious air and water.        
	Yet Wens speech underscored how deeply Beijing remains preoccupied with generating jobs and lifting incomes, especially for hundreds of millions of poor farmers, while also taming hectic industrial expansion that has bucked cooling measures.        
	The primary task for macroeconomic regulation this year is to prevent fast economic growth from becoming overheated growth and keep structural price increases from turning into significant inflation, he said. Consumer inflation averaged 4.8 per cent last year.

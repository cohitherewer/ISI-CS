	Beijing, June 13 (PTI): Maoist chief Prachanda said today that Nepal would like to maintain a policy of equidistance in relations with India and China.         
	The top Maoist leader also expressed his eagerness to visit the village of Chinese leader Mao Zedong for greater inspiration.         
	Equidistance means not siding with one country against another. My exact meaning of equidistance is to have good relations with both neighbours, Prachanda said during an interview to the state-run China Daily.        
	The Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist party, which was the single largest party in the April 10 elections to the Constituent Assembly, is expected to lead a coalition government to rebuild Nepal after a bloody civil war.         
	Prachanda said the Maoist-led government would take strong measures against anti-China activities in Nepal where Tibetan activists have been staging protests regularly against Chinese rule in Tibet.        
	The newspaper quoted him as saying that the new government would discuss the open border between India and Nepal which enables Tibetan demonstrators to come to Kathmandu from Dharamsala.We will not tolerate anti-China activities on our soil and we will take strong administrative measures to control these activities, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pervez running out of time: PPP
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pervez running out of time: PPP

	Islamabad, Aug. 16 (Agencies): Pakistans ruling coalition today set a 24-hour deadline for President Pervez Musharraf to resign or face impeachment in parliament next week as his chances of getting legal immunity faded.        
	Musharraf is running out of time and if he does not quit by tomorrow, the impeachment proceedings will start, senior Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader and foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, told reporters in Multan.        
	Qureshis comments added to the mounting pressure on the former army chief. However, a Musharraf ally insisted that the President was not stepping down and was prepared to fight impeachment charges he considers absurd.        
	The back-and-forth injected more uncertainty into the already volatile situation in Pakistan, a country whose stability the US considers critical to success in the war on terror.        
	Allies and rivals of the President have said back channel talks are under way to avoid an impeachment process that could damage public morale.        
	The ruling coalition has pushed Musharraf to quit. But his supporters want protections for him if he does, while suggesting they could use the courts to subvert impeachment.        
	Musharraf is reportedly not ready to accept anything short of an honourable stay in Pakistan with full presidential protocol and benefits and legal cover for his actions if he resigns.        
	But a key ally of the ruling coalition, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, ruled out legal cover for Musharraf. Legal guarantees are out of question, party spokesman Siddique-ul-Farooq said.        
	Local media reports that said Saudi Arabian officials were trying to mediate could not be confirmed today, though officials say diplomats from western and Muslim countries have met in recent days with various actors involved.        
	The impeachment charges against Musharraf are expected to accuse him of Constitutional violations and gross misconduct.        
	Coalition officials would not reveal specifics, though they have said his removal of judges and imposition of emergency rule last year could form the basis of those charges. They said a draft of the chargesheet needs final approval but could reach the National Assembly early next week. Qureshi said. If he fails to decide to quit within the next two days, the impeachment process will take its course.        
	Tariq Azim, a senior member of the main pro-Musharraf party, said the President would not quit.         
	President Musharraf is confident about defending himself in the Assembly and defeating the chargesheet easily because whatever he did, he did in the interest of the country and for the nation, Azim said today.        
	Yesterday, Mushahid Hussain, another Musharraf ally, said the President may turn to the courts to forestall an impeachment. But Raza Rabbani, a PPP member, warned Musharraf against being misled on his chances in the courts.        
	The venue cannot be changed, Rabbani said. This should be clear to everyone as impeachment is a Constitutional affair, and that could only be done through parliament. Whether Musharraf decides to quit could depend on what his rivals are willing to offer  in particular if they will give him legal immunity from future prosecution and let him stay in the country.

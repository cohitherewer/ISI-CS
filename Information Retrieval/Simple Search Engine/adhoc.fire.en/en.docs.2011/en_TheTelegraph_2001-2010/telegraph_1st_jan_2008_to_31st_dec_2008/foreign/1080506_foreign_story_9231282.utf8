                              Oprah Winfrey with Tom Cruise in Telluride, Colorado. (AP)                            
	Chicago, May 5 (AP): Tom Cruise went back to where his run of negative publicity began: On a couch, next to Oprah Winfrey.         
	But unlike his couch-jumping appearance on Winfreys show three years ago, this time Cruise was serious, thoughtful and tried to defend his personal beliefs without seeming overbearing during an hourlong interview broadcast on Friday.        
	Several entertainment-focused public relations experts said thats a smart approach.        
	I think Tom learned his lesson. The lesson was that sometimes your personal beliefs can get in the way of the projects, said Howard Bragman, founder of Los Angeles PR firm Fifteen Minutes.         
	And you dont want people to be turned off to you so that theyre turned off to your projects.        
	Winfreys interview with Cruise, 45, was taped at his Telluride, Colorado, home. Another show, billed as a celebration of Cruises 25-year career in movies, was taped before an audience at Winfreys Chicago studio. The back-to-back interviews appear to be part of an effort to put the bad patch of PR behind him and get people talking about his career again, instead of his personal life.        
	Answering a question about whether he feels he comes under attack unnecessarily because of his belief in the Church of Scientology, Cruise said he understood the interest in a minority religion.        
	But from now on, he said, when Im dealing with my humanitarian issues, Ill talk about my humanitarian issues, and when Im promoting a film, Im just going to promote the film. And thats just the way its going to be.

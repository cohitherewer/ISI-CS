	Beijing, May 6 (Reuters): Fears of a virus that has killed at least 26 children in China gripped parents in Beijing today amid a spreading outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease.        
	The health scare prompted the foreign ministry to seek to assure the country it was doing its best to contain the outbreak.        
	The Chinese government is paying great attention to the virus and related departments are taking effective measures to stop it from spreading, ministry spokesman Qin Gang told a news conference.        
	Hand, foot and mouth is a common illness in children and infants caused by a family of viruses called enteroviruses and outbreaks regularly occur in China.         
	Parents in Beijing, host city of the 2008 Olympics that has not reported any deaths from EV71, were also on the alert. Of course were worried. If a child got sick, wed be very frightened, said one woman, bouncing a toddler on her hip. We know about this virus, but we dont know clearly how to protect ourselves. The information hasnt been thorough enough.        
	Beijing has had 1,482 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease this year, mostly in children under five, the Beijing News reported.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hopefuls hone their messages
                                                                                                            Hopefuls hone their messages
                            
	Perry (Iowa), Jan. 1 (Reuters): White House hopefuls honed their closing messages and traded jabs over their records in Iowa on Monday, three days before the state opens the presidential nominating battle in a too-close-to-call race.        
	The leading contenders in both parties traded shots as a tight Iowa campaign ticked down to the end. Republican Mike Huckabee said he would not air an advertisement he prepared attacking rival Mitt Romney  then showed it to reporters.        
	Democrat Hillary Clinton said she was better suited to tackle special interests in Washington than rival John Edwards, a former North Carolina senator who has made that issue the centrepiece of his campaign.        
	Its easy to talk about taking on special interests, the New York senator and former First Lady said in Keokuk, Iowa. Ive taken on the oil companies and I intend to keep doing it. Its something you dont have to do by yelling and screaming. Save your energy. Get the job done.        
	Polls show tight races in both parties in Iowa, which kicks off the state-by-state battle to choose candidates in the November presidential election.        
	A Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll gave Clinton, seeking to be the first woman US President, a four-point lead among Democrats over Edwards and Illinois Senator Barack Obama, who were tied for second.        
	A separate Des Moines Register poll found Obama was the choice of 32 per cent of likely Democratic caucusgoers, up from 28 per cent in late November, while Clinton held steady at 25 per cent and Edwards was virtually unchanged at 24 per cent.        
	The newspaper found 32 per cent support for Mike Huckabee among Republicans, followed by Romney with 26 per cent.

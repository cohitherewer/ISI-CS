	Strong hanky    
	 London, Oct. 22: An Icelandic designer has created the worlds first bullet-proof handkerchief  aimed at well-dressed gentlemen with dangerous lifestyles, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The life-saving accessory, aimed at James Bond wannabes, sits in the breast pocket in order to protect the heart of men and is made from Kevlar, which is five times stronger than steel.       
	The material, which is used to make protective vests and Formula 1 cars, can withstand a bullet as well as temperatures of 400 degrees Celsius. Only ten of the stylish handkerchiefs are currently available, all in a tasteful yellow and bordered with raw golden silk.       
	The handkerchiefs are priced at 120 euros, but the designer, Sluli Recht, emphasises that he takes NO responsibility for schmucks and wooden-heads who feel compelled to test the endurance or resistance of the textile in any way.

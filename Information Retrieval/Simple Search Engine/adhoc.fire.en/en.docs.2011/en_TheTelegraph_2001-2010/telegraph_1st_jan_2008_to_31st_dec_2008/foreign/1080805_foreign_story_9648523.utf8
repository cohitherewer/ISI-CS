	London, Aug. 4: Gwyneth Paltrow has urged fellow Americans living abroad to vote for Barack Obama in a new advertisement.         
	The American actress, who lives in London with her husband, Chris Martin, the singer in the rock group Coldplay, leads a video encouraging expats to register to vote from overseas in the presidential election in November.         
	Speaking alongside several other Americans living abroad, Paltrow says: Start now  right now. Ill be voting from London, but you can vote from anywhere.        
	If you live abroad, youve got to do it. Every single vote will count.         
	She asks American ex-pats: Where on earth will you vote? The video concludes: Vote Democrat. Vote Obama. Vote From Abroad.         
	The video, which will be distributed on the Internet, was produced by Democrats Abroad, a division of the party devoted to persuading the millions of Americans living outside the country and eligible to vote to keep participating in domestic politics.

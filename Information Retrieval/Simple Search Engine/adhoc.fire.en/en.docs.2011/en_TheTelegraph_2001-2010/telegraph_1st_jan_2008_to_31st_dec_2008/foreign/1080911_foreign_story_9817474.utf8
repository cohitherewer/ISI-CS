The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kosi treaty lopsided, says party
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Kosi treaty lopsided, says party

	Kathmandu, Sept. 10: The Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist (CPN-UML), the second largest bloc in the ruling coalition, today described the Kosi River Treaty signed between Nepal and India as lopsided.        
	It demanded that Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is better known as Prachanda, renegotiate the treaty with India during his official visit to New Delhi next week.         
	In a statement, the CPN-UML said the treaty signed in 1950 was loaded heavily in Indias favour. It said Prachanda should pay special attention to the sentiments of the people while negotiating treaties with India, including the Kosi agreement.         
	The CPN-UML also held India responsible for the Kosi floods, saying that the southern neighbour had failed to fulfil its obligations and repair the rivers embankments in time. The Prime Minister should seek compensation for the flood victims from India, the party said.

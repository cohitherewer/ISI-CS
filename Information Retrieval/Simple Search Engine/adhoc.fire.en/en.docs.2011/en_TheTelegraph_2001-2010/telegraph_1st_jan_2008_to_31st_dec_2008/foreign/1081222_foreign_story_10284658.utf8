	Vatican City, Dec. 21 (AP): Pope Benedict XVI is marking the 400th anniversary of Galileos use of a telescope.        
	Benedict said today he wanted to salute all those marking the 2009 anniversary and Unescos World Year of Astronomy.        
	Benedict said understanding the laws of nature could stimulate understanding and appreciation of the Lords works.        
	The Catholic Church condemned Galileo in the 17th century for supporting Nicholas Copernicus discovery that the earth revolved around the sun.         
	Church teaching at the time placed the earth at the centre of the universe.

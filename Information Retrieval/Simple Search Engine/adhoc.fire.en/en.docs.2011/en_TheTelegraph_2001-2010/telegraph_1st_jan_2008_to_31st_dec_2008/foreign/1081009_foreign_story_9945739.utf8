	Blonde bother    
	 Bridgeport (Connecticut), Oct. 8 (AP): A Connecticut judge has given the brush-off to a blonde womans lawsuit claiming LOreal Inc. ruined her social life when she accidentally dyed her hair brunette with one of its products.      
	Charlotte Feeney says she can never return to her natural blonde hue. A judge dismissed the lawsuit, saying she never proved her allegation that LOreal put brown hair dye in a box labelled as blonde.

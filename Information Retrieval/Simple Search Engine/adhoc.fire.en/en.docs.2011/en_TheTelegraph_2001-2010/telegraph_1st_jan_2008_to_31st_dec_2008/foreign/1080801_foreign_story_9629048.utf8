	Baghdad, July 31: The al Qaida leader in Iraq and several of his top lieutenants have recently left Iraq for Afghanistan, according to group leaders and Iraqi intelligence officials, a possible further sign of what US officials call growing disarray and weakness in the organisation.        
	US officials say there are indications that al Qaida is diverting new recruits from going to Iraq, where its fighters have suffered dramatic setbacks, to going to Afghanistan and Pakistan, where they appear to be making gains.        
	We do believe al Qaida is doing some measure of re-assessment regarding the continued viability of its fight in Iraq and whether Iraq should remain the focus of its efforts, Brigadier General Brian Keller, senior intelligence officer for General David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, wrote in an email.         
	But Keller said that the reliability of indications that recruits have been diverted has not yet been determined and that US officials have no evidence that top al Qaida in Iraq leaders have gone to Afghanistan.        
	A largely homegrown insurgent group that American officials believe is led by foreigners, al Qaida in Iraq has long been one of the most ruthless and dangerous organisations in the country. But even some of its leaders acknowledge that it has been seriously weakened over the past year. The number of foreign fighters entering Iraq has dropped to 20 a month, down from about 110 a month last summer and as many as 50 a month earlier this year, according to a senior US intelligence analyst.        
	Some al Qaida in Iraq members blamed the groups troubles on failed leadership by its head since 2006, an Egyptian who has used the pseudonyms Abu Hamza al-Muhajer and Abu Ayyub al-Masri. Some of the fighters said they have become so frustrated by Masri that they recently split off to form their own Sunni insurgent group.

	2009, a bit late    
	 Washington, Dec. 28 (Reuters): Those eager to put 2008 behind them will have to hold their good-byes for just a moment this New Years Eve.      
	The worlds official timekeepers have added a leap second to the last day of the year on Wednesday, to help match clocks to the earths slowing spin on its axis, taking place at ever-changing rates affected by tides and other factors.      
	The US Naval Observatory, the keeper of the Pentagons master clock, said it would add the extra second on Wednesday in co-ordination with the worlds atomic clocks at 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds Co-ordinated Universal Time, or UTC. That corresponds to 23:59:59 GMT (5.29.59 Indian time on Thursday). UTC is the time scale kept by highly precise atomic clocks, accurate to about a billionth of a second a day.

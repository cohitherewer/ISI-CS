	Beijing, Nov. 25 (Reuters): China gave short shrift to US rockers Guns N Roses controversial new album Chinese Democracy today, saying the music was bad and that they were not that popular anyway.        
	The bands first album in 17 years was released on Sunday. As far as I know, many people dont like this kind of music, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang told a news briefing. Its too noisy and clamorous.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak army HQ plans shelved
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pak army HQ plans shelved
          NASIR JAFFRY                          The site of the new army headquarters in Islamabad. (AFP)                                  
	Islamabad, Oct. 28: The Pakistan army today halted the construction of an expensive new headquarters in Islamabad because of the economic woes facing the country.        
	The construction of the 2,438-acre new General Headquarters (GHQ) complex and township, which will house new defence services, the central military command and operation centres of the army, had started three years ago after assassination attempts on former President Pervez Musharraf in December 2003.         
	Being aware of the financial crunch facing Pakistan, the Chief of Army Staff has decided to suspend the building of the new GHQ at Islamabad which is currently located in the garrison town of Rawalpindi, a brief army statement said.         
	Officials said the project was shelved as the country needed to save billions of dollars to cope with the economic meltdown.         
	Pakistan needs $10 to $15 billion in international assistance to stabilise its economy and avoid a balance of payments crisis. The financial adviser to Prime Minister on finance, Shaukat Tareen, said he would have to approach the IMF if the country did not get at least $3- $4 billion within thirty days from friendly countries or multi-donor agencies, including the World Bank.         
	The army shares the nations quest for economic stability through a spirit of sacrifice, the statement added.         
	The decision comes months after army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kiyani, who succeeded Musharraf in November 2007, withdrew army officials who had been appointed to key posts in civilian institutions during the past eight years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Euros do nicely for New York store owners
                                                                                                            Euros do nicely for New York store owners
          TOM LEONARD                              
	New York, Feb. 8: European shoppers are now so common  and important  in New York that some stores are accepting cash in pounds or euros.        
	The trend  so new that US television crews were mobbing the first stores to admit doing it  is an ironic reversal of the long-standing tradition that dollars would be accepted anywhere in the world.        
	While shops along the Canadian border have long accepted Canadian currency and some stores on the Texas-Mexico border take pesos, the supremacy of the greenback has been total.        
	But the weak state of the US currency, currently worth 1.96 or 1.46 euros, has prompted a flood of foreign shoppers into America, buying up everything from cheap jeans to multi-million dollar apartments. Billy LeRoy, owner of Billys Antiques amp; Props, a well-known antique store in the East Village, said he would get laughed at now if he tried to pay in dollars on his buying trip to Paris.        
	He told The Daily Telegraph: I recently put up a sign saying euros only. It started as a tongue-in-cheek thing but theres a European for every five people here. He added: And I really need to collect euros and pounds now. Five years ago, this would have been unheard of, but if you offer dollars in France now, they treat you like youre from a Third World country.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

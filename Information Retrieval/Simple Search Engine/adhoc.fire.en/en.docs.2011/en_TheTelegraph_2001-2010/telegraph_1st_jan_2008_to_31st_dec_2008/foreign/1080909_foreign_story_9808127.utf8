	Beijing, Sept. 8: Local governments in a Muslim desert region in western China have imposed strict limits on religious practices during the Ramazan month which began last week, according to the websites of four of those governments.        
	The rules include prohibiting women from wearing veils and men from growing beards, as well as barring government officials from observing Ramazan. One town, Yingmaili, requires that local officials check on mosques at least twice a week during the holy month.        
	The local governments administer areas in the western part of Xinjiang, a vast autonomous region that is home to the Uighurs, a Muslim Turkic people who often chafe under rule by the ethnic Han Chinese. In August, a wave of attacks swept through Xinjiang, the largest surge of violence in the region in years. Some local officials blamed the instability on separatist groups. The limits on religious practices put in place by local governments appear to be part of the broader security crackdown. The areas affected by the new rules are near Kuqa, a town struck by multiple bombings on August 10. It was unclear whether the rules would be relaxed after Ramazan, a holiday that some Islamic extremists have used elsewhere as a symbolic backdrop for attacks on their perceived enemies.

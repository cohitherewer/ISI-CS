The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China torch guards thugs, says Coe
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       China torch guards thugs, says Coe
          LAURA CLOUT                          Coe: Unhappy                                  
	London, April 8: Sebastian Coe, the chairman of the London Olympic Committee, has described the Chinese officials guarding the Olympic torch as thugs, piling more embarrassment onto the Gamess organisers.         
	Lord Coe was overheard talking about the attendants, who formed part of a huge security presence around the flame, during a private telephone conversation with a member of his press team.         
	The Chinese guards, more than a dozen of whom surrounded Olympic flame during its chaotic journey through London on Sunday, are officially employed to ensure the safe handover of the torch between runners and to ensure it remains lit throughout the relay.        
	But the attendants, thought to have been recruited from the security services, have been criticised for allegedly using aggressive tactics against protesters.         
	Coe made the comments as a member of Channel 4 News staff was attempting to contact him over the telephone and they were accidentally connected via the switchboard to a private conversation. They tried to push me out of the way three times. They are horrible... I think they were thugs, he said.

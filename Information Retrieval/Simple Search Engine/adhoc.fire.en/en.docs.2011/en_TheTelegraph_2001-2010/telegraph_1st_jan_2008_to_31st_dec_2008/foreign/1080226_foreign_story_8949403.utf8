The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pervez splits Pak partners
                                                                                                               Pervez splits Pak partners
                                  
	Islamabad, Feb. 25 (PTI): The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) today appeared to be at odds with its coalition partner Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on President Musharrafs future.        
	PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari says the coalition will not be able to impeach Musharraf. However, PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif continues to gun for the Presidents head.        
	As Musharraf faced pressure from Sharif and deadlines from influential US senator Joe Biden, Zardari said: The ground reality is that we do not have two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to impeach Musharraf.        
	Speaking during an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Zardari said while they would seek a working relationship with Musharraf, we have to establish democracy and for that we need unity and not confrontation.        
	Meanwhile, after meeting hardline Jamaat-e-Islami chief Qazi Hussain Ahmed here, Sharif said that if Musharraf stays on, then judges sacked by him during emergency in November last year should be reinstated so that they can decide the legality of the Presidents re-election in October.        
	Before parliament impeaches him (Musharraf) we want this issue revolved by the judiciary, said Sharif.        
	The PML-N chief, who said that the sooner Musharraf quits it will be better for him, also met US ambassador Anne Patterson in Islamabad for the first time after the poll results.         
	Biden, who is also the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, told an American TV channel. I firmly believe if they do not focus on old grudges and give him a graceful way to move then Musharraf will leave office.         
	YouTube ban        
	Pakistan ordered local Internet service providers to block access to the Youtube site because of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad that have outraged many Muslims.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cambridge for TV plugs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cambridge for TV plugs
                            
	London, Sept. 2 (Reuters): Cambridge University is asking script-writers of popular soaps like EastEnders to give it a plug to help break down its elitist image.        
	It wants to feature amid the usual TV soap tales of rivalry, sex and revenge in an attempt to attract more state-educated students.        
	It is an opportunity to show we are contemporary and modern ... and interested in the best students, said a Cambridge University spokesman.

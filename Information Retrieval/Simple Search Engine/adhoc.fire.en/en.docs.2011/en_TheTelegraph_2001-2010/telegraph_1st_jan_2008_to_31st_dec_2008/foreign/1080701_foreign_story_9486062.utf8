	Peshawar, June 30 (AP): A powerful explosion destroyed a militant compound and killed up to eight people today in a volatile tribal region where Pakistani security forces are waging an offensive against pro-Taliban militants, residents said.        
	An explosives expert who examined the scene said the blast was caused by the detonation of explosives kept inside the compound. But militants insisted it could have been a missile strike launched from neighbouring Afghanistan, where US and Nato forces are based.        
	The political administration of the Khyber tribal area said at least five people were killed and three were injured, but that its security forces had not fired on the damaged site.        
	Residents said the blast occurred at a compound in Bar Qambarkhel village owned by a supporter of Haji Namdar, a local militant leaderwhose Vice and Virtue Movement is suspected of cross-border assaults.        
	Villager Nawaz Khan Afridi said he saw eight bodies.        
	Namdar said he was praying in a mosque when he heard the blast.        
	We do not know if our country Pakistan is involved, but our claim is on America, Namdar told Geo TV after a funeral for some of the dead. We do not know from where it was carried out, but we claim that Jews and Christians did it.        
	A spokesman for Namdars group, Munsif Khan, claimed the explosion was a missile strike and had killed six people.        
	Our friends saw a flash of light coming from the direction of Afghanistan before the blast, Khan said. The village, in the Bara area, lies at least 40m from the Afghan border.        
	Afridi, the resident who witnessed the aftermath, said he was awakened by a loud explosion before dawn. He joined dozens of other residents in helping to rescue survivors from the rubble. Two rooms at the compound had been shattered by the explosion, he said.        
	Fazal Hussain, an explosives expert from the Frontier Corps sent to examine the damage, told reporters that a missile would have left a hole in the roof and floor of the destroyed building but that no such evidence was found. He said explosives stored in the building must have detonated.        
	In Washington, a Pentagon official said he was unaware of any missile launches into Pakistan from Afghanistan.        
	Pakistani paramilitary forces launched an offensive in the region three days ago against militants threatening the main northwestern city of Peshawar and a key supply line for the US military effort in Afghanistan. Namdars movement is believed to be a target of the offensive.        
	The Pakistani show of force comes amid US concern that the newly elected governments efforts to negotiate peace deals with militants have given Taliban and al-Qaida-linked extremists more space to operate along the lawless border and launch attacks inside Afghanistan.        
	Senior US state department official Richard Boucher began a three-day visit to Islamabad today and met government leaders. A congressional delegation also is visiting the country.        
	Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani defended Pakistans use of peace negotiations in talks with Boucher, insisting the government was only talking to those willing to lay down weapons, a statement from Gilanis office said.        
	The Prime Minister also said the government had received much public support for the military offensive.        
	The operation was launched on Saturday to secure Peshawar from threats by law breakers and militant groups, the ministry of interior said in a statement late yesterday. It would continue until all the objectives are achieved, it said.        
	The Pentagon official said the US military would assess the outcome of the offensive to determine how significant and effective the effort has been.

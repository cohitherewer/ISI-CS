	Colombo, Oct. 6 (Reuters): A Sri Lankan suicide bomber killed 23 people at a historic tourist town today, including a retired army general who was an Opposition party provincial leader.        
	The blast, immediately blamed on the rebel Tamil Tigers, also injured at least 80 people, the military said.        
	The bomber struck during the opening of a new office for the Opposition United National Party (UNP) in the north central town of Anuradhapura, 200km north of the capital Colombo, attended by retired Major-General Janaka Perera.        
	A suicide bomber went inside and exploded. My senior officer there said 22 people were killed, and among the dead were Janaka Perera and his wife, Deputy Inspector General K.P.P. Pathirana told Reuters. The toll was later raised to 23. Last month Perera unsuccessfully ran to be North Central Provinces chief minister, a powerful local position.        
	The military said the blast was the latest carried out by the LTTE, who are credited with perfecting suicide bombing during a 25-year war to establish a separate homeland for the countrys Tamil minority.

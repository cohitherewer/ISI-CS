The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lhasa sealed after protest
                                                                                                               Lhasa sealed after protest
                            
	Beijing, March 29 (Reuters): Chinese security forces sealed off parts of Lhasa today and Tibets government-in-exile said it was investigating reports of fresh protests, weeks after the city was shaken by an anti-government riot.        
	The reports coincided with a visit by a group of diplomats, who were led on a closely guarded tour of the city that has been at the heart of unrest throughout Chinas ethnic Tibetan regions just months before the opening of the Beijing Olympics.        
	We dont know how many people, but it seems its quite a lot of people, Tenzin Taklha, a spokesman for the Dalai Lama said of the events in Lhasa. I think its timed with the visit of the diplomats.        
	The London-based International Campaign for Tibet said it had heard from three sources that security forces had surrounded Lhasas main temples, Jokhang and Ramoche. The whole area has been shut down, said the groups spokeswoman, Kate Saunders. I dont know what form the protest took. I think people in Lhasa may have been aware of the diplomats visit, just as they were aware of the journalists visit, she said.        
	Earlier this week, the government took select foreign media to Lhasa to highlight the wreckage and give the impression that the city was returning to normal, but the plan backfired when about 30 monks at Jokhang stormed an official news briefing. The monks complained about a lack of religious freedom and voiced support for the Dalai Lama.        
	The trouble in the remote, mountain region that Chinas communist troops entered in 1950 began with a series of peaceful, monk-led protests that culminated in a riot in Lhasa on March 14.         
	Today, China offered to pay compensation to the families of the 18 civilians it says died in the Lhasa violence. The Dalai Lamas representatives, which deny he is orchestrating the demonstrations, say the death toll is closer to 140.        
	The government does not permit free access to the areas, making the reports difficult to check. Chinese media has portrayed the violence on March 14 as a riot by a Tibetan mob beating up innocent people, many of them ethnic Chinese.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | On camera: Burning Kafeel punches cops
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       On camera: Burning Kafeel punches cops
          DUNCAN GARDHAM                              
	London, Oct. 14: Footage of the moment two alleged terrorists, including one from India, drove a burning car bomb into Glasgow airport has been released for the first time.         
	The images, taken from CCTV cameras at the airport, show one of the men trying to fight off police and members of the public who are trying to tackle him, although he has been doused in burning petrol.        
	In other pictures, members of the public can be seen running from the airport departure lounge in panic on what was one of the busiest days of the year.        
	The Jeep, described as a mobile fire bomb, was packed with 10 petrol containers, four oil containers and a number of glass bottles, some with wicks attached as petrol bombs.        
	Kafeel Ahmed, a PhD student from India, drove the vehicle into the airport on the afternoon of June 30 last year.        
	His younger brother Sabeel, a doctor who was also convicted in the case, has been deported to hometown Bangalore.         
	Sabeel, who had spent 10 months behind bars in the UK, was accused of withholding crucial information about Kafeel. A London court sentenced him to 18 months in jail in April. But it ordered that the 26-year-old be released and deported as he had already been on remand for half the length of his sentence and had expressed a wish to be sent back to his country.         
	A month after the attack, Kafeel died from the burns he had suffered but the footage was released as part of the trial of his passenger, Bilal Abdulla, and an associate, Mohammed Asha, who are accused of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions.        
	The jury was told on Friday how Kafeel reversed out after smashing into the airport and with the engine revving and the tyres screeching, made a series of attempts to crash through the airport doors.        
	Queens Counsel Jonathan Laidlaw told Woolwich Crown Court that both Ahmed and Abdulla threw petrol bombs and there were shouts of Allahu Akbar (God is great).        
	Realising what was happening, the police and members of the public gathered in an attempt to extinguish the fire and Kafeel, though himself alight, tried to obstruct them by punching and kicking out, he added.        
	CS gas was sprayed at him and he was kicked to the ground before the fire on him was eventually extinguished and he was subdued, then handcuffed and arrested.        
	Abdulla also tried to stop the fire in the Jeep being put out before running off pursued by police officers and members of the public.        
	In the struggle to subdue him, one member of the public lost a tooth and had his leg broken, the court heard. The jury was told that queues at the departure desks were nearly up to the terminal doors.        
	For those present it must have been the most terrifying of experiences, Laidlaw said.        
	Passengers panicked and rushed for the exits, knocking others down and trampling one woman in the crush.        
	The film from the CCTV system at the airport gives a fairly graphic indication of the seriousness of what occurred and how fortunate it was that nobody lost their life, Laidlaw said        
	Abdulla, 29, and Asha, 28, deny the charges and the trial continues.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

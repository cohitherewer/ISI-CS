	Washington, June 10 (Reuters): Republican White House candidate John McCain has vowed to lower corporate tax rates if he wins the US presidency and ease the tax burden on middle-class workers to help revive the faltering economy.        
	The Arizona senator, who has wrapped up his partys presidential nomination, also would propose a simpler, alternative tax system and insist that chief executives pay and severance packages have shareholder approval.        
	No matter which of us wins in November, there will be change in Washington. The question is what kind of change? McCain will tell a conference for small businesses, referring to his Democratic opponent, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.        
	Will we enact the single largest tax increase since the Second World War as my opponent proposes, or will we keep taxes low for families and employers? he said.        
	McCain pledged to act quickly to lower corporate taxes from the second highest in the world to one on par with our trading partners to keep businesses and jobs in this country.        
	He supported keeping capital gains taxes low, doubling a tax exemption for children and phasing out the alternative minimum tax which he said would save some 25 million middle-class families up to $2,000 in a year.        
	On Monday, Obama drew a sharp contrast with McCain, his opponent in the November election, accusing him of wanting to widen President George W. Bushs tax cuts and plunge the US deeper into debt.        
	He charged that McCains support for extending Bushs tax cuts would allow $2 trillion in corporate tax breaks.        
	US taxes were too complicated to overhaul, McCain said in his speech. As President, I will propose an alternative tax system. When this reform is enacted, all who wish to file under the current system could still do so, he said. Everyone else could choose a vastly less complicated system with two tax rates and a generous standard deduction.        
	McCain criticised Obama for wanting to increase dividend and capital gains taxes and aiming to raise the minimum wage and link it to an index. But he also took aim at top corporate executives with big salaries.        
	Americans are right to be offended when the extravagant salaries and severance deals of CEOs... bear no relation to the success of the company or the wishes of shareholders, he said.

	Prozac pets    
	 London, Feb. 25: Increasing numbers of British pets are being given Prozac to help them battle against depression, a leading veterinary expert has revealed, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Tropical birds such as parrots are the worst affected by depression, according to television vet Romain Pizzi. Depressed parrots can often pluck out their feathers      
	Pizzi, who is a specialist in zoo and wildlife medicine for the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said pets are affected when owners leave them alone for hours on end. He said: Contrary to some peoples expectations, parrots are very intelligent and sensitive animals.      
	Typically if people go out to work all day their parrot will get very bored and frustrated and eventually develop depression.    
	Bun bother    
	 Beijing (Reuters): A Chinese maker of famed stuffed buns whose Chinese name means A dog would ignore it has cleaned up its English-language to avoid confusion, but may be risking more puzzled looks. The steamed Goubuli buns filled with a mince of meat and vegetables are the pride of Tianjin, a gritty port city near Beijing. Their Chinese name literally means Dog would ignore it and is said to come from the nickname of the man who began selling them some 150 years ago. But hungry for more success and apparently worried that foreign tourists may fear their name reflects the buns quality or contents, the Tianjin Goubuli Group Corporation has opted for a tamer English name that may bring its own confusion Go Believe.    
	Safe paws    
	 Berlin (Reuters): Police dogs in the German city of Dusseldorf are being fitted out with blue rubber shoes to protect their paws while walking the beat. The dogs arent too keen yet, but with a few weeks training they should be used to them, Andre Hartwich, a police spokesman, said on Monday. He said shards of glass and sharp objects get stuck between the cobbles of Dusseldorfs old town and are dangerous for the canine squad. The shoes will protect their paws on patrol, he said. The blue synthetic rubber shoes, modelled on a design made for sled-pulling Canadian huskies, will cost about $22.22 each, he said.

	Karachi, July 17 (Reuters): Hundreds of angry investors, upset by plunging Pakistani share prices, smashed windows of Karachi Stock Exchange and scuffles broke out during a protest today to demand a temporary closure of the market.        
	We are looking at the situation and there is no question of suspending the market, said Razi-ur-Rahman, chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), as staff cleared broken glass from the trading hall floor.        
	A slump in investor confidence accelerated today, as stocks fell 2.7 per cent and the rupee dropped by 1.3 per cent due to fears of political uncertainty and an economic meltdown during Pakistans transition to civilian-led democracy.        
	Pakistans current account and fiscal deficits are unsustainable, inflation over 21 per cent is at a three-decade high and foreign currency reserves have fallen below $11 billion, more than $5.5 billion below last Octobers record high.        
	The three-and-a-half month-old civilian, coalition government is split over whether to work with President Pervez Musharraf, the former army chief who took power in a coup in 1999, or seek his ouster.        
	Analysts said investors were also wary due to the rising tension on the Afghan-Pakistani border following Afghan accusations of Pakistani involvement in attacks in Afghanistan.        
	The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) benchmark 100-share index ended down 2.7 per cent, or 279 points, at 10,212.92, its lowest close in more than 18 months.        
	Dealers said buying, possibly from state-run institutions, helped the index recover from an intra-day low that had marked a drop of more than 4 per cent.        
	The KSE-index has shed 12.7 per cent so far this week and is down 35 per cent from a life high on April 21. Total market capitalisation has fallen to about $44 billion from a peak near $75 billion.        
	The steep fall since Monday followed a relaxation of curbs on daily stock movements that had been tightened in late June.        
	Close to 1,000 mostly small investors gathered in the gardens of the bourse to demand that the KSE close for two days. Two persons were injured.

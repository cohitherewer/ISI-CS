          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, Sept. 5: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari, who is expected to win the presidential polls tomorrow, will visit China within 72 hours of the election.         
	The visit will underscore the importance that Pakistan attaches to its relations with China. It comes after interior ministry chief Rehman Malik confessed to the presence of Chinese Islamic militants in troubled Pakistan tribal regions near the Afghan border.         
	Officials believe the planned visit will send a strong signal to Beijing and the world of how much Pakistan values its relations with China. According to The News daily, Zardari will visit China as the 12th President of the country in the second week of September if he wins the polls tomorrow.

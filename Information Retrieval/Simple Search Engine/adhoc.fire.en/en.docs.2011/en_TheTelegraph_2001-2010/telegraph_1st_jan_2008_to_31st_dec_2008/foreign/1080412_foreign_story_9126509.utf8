The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Scientists unveil new racetrack memory

          ROGER HIGHFIELD                              
	London, April 11: The prospect of iPods that can hold millions of songs and PCs being able to turn on instantly, rather than taking minutes to boot up, comes much closer today.        
	A Californian team has developed a new generation of memory that combines the high performance and reliability of solid state flash memory, stored in microchips, with the high capacity of the PCs hard disk drive, which is cheap but contains moving parts and is slow.        
	In two papers in the journal Science, Stuart Parkin and colleagues at the IBM Almaden Research Centre in San Jose describe a revolutionary technology dubbed racetrack memory, or RM memory.        
	The team believes that it marks a milestone that could lead to electronic devices capable of storing far more data in the same amount of space than is possible today, with lightning-fast boot times, far lower cost and unprecedented stability and durability.        
	Within the next decade, racetrack memory, so named because the data races around microscopic magnetic tracks, could lead to solid state electronic devices with no moving parts, and therefore more durable  capable of holding far more data.        
	IBM says this technology could enable a handheld device such as an mp3 player to store around 500,000 songs or around 3,500 movies  100 times more than is possible today.        
	The devices would not only store vastly more information in the same space, but also require much less power and generate much less heat, and be practically unbreakable; the result: massive amounts of personal storage that could run on a single battery for weeks at a time and last for decades.        
	The secret is a new way to store information. Conventional electronic devices such as transistors operate by huffling small packets of electronic charge around, with the ultimate unit of charge being a single electron.        
	But quantum theory that rules the subatomic world shows that electrons can spin and it is this property which endows materials such as iron with the property of magnetism: the electrons within them all spin the same way so all their electronic bar magnets line up.        
	In spintronic devices, up and down spins correspond to the 1s and 0s that are the raw units of information in a conventional PC. In this case, the patterns of magnetism  spins  run along a microscopic magnetic racetrack - the information is stored and read using nanowires. The nanowires are about 100nm wide, that is,1000 times narrower than a human hair, explains Parkin.        
	A fully-fledged racetrack memory would stand billions of nanowires around the edge of a chip, and potentially allow for hundreds of times the amount of storage in the same space as todays memory. It has been an exciting adventure to have been involved with research into metal spintronics since its inception almost 20 years ago, says Parkin.        
	The promise of racetrack  for example, the ability to carry massive amounts of information in your pocket  could unleash creativity leading to devices and applications that nobody has imagined yet. Currently, there are two main ways to store digital information: solid state random access flash memory, commonly used in mobile phones, music players and digital cameras, and the magnetic hard disk drive, commonly used in desktop and laptop computers and some handheld devices.        
	While both classes of storage devices are evolving rapidly, the cost of storing a single data bit in a hard disk drive remains approximately 100 times cheaper than in flash memory. While the low cost of the hard disk drive is attractive, these devices are intrinsically slower and, with many moving parts, have mechanical reliability issues not present in flash technologies.        
	Flash memory, however, has its own drawbacks  while it is fast to read data, it is slow to write data, and it, too, has a finite lifespan. Flash, can be reused only a few thousands of times because it eventually breaks because it is slightly damaged by each use or rewrite.        
	Racetrack has no moving parts, has no wear-out mechanism and so can be rewritten endlessly without any wear and tear. And it could become even more powerful.         
	The current memory is only two dimensional and the Almaden team is already working on an even higher capacity three dimensional version.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | America bans army sites on Google

          SOPHIE BORLAND                          security threat                                  
	London, March 7: The US defence department has banned Google from taking pictures of its military sites as it poses a potential threat to security.         
	It follows the discovery of detailed images of the Fort Sam Houston army base in Texas, on the Google Maps Web service. It clearly showed the location of barriers, headquarters and control points.         
	The search engine, which provides street maps, satellite pictures and three-dimensional images of hundreds of countries around the world, has agreed to remove the offending photographs.         
	The particular complaint came from images on Street View, a Google service only available in the US which allows Web users to drive along virtual US landscapes and see ground-level views of parts of the country.         
	Google have admitted that their decision to enter the Texas base and undertake a detailed survey, had been a mistake and that such a study of sensitive sites was not a normal policy.         
	The search engine has now been barred from filming and conducting detailed mapping of all US military bases and, in particular, showing views of Fort Sam Houston. Officials are probing as to what other imagery is available on Street View and Google Earth.

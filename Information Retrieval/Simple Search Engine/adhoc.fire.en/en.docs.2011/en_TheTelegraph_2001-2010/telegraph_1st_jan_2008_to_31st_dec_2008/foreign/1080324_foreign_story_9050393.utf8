The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Rowling reveals she planned suicide
                                                                                                               Rowling reveals she planned suicide
          SIMON JOHNSON                               
	London, March 23: Writer J.K. Rowling has revealed that she contemplated suicide while suffering from depression as a struggling single mother.         
	The Harry Potter author said she thought of killing herself after separating from her first husband Jorge Arantes, a Portuguese journalist.         
	She finally sought professional help and was prescribed cognitive behavioural therapy, which uses counselling to help patients control negative thoughts.         
	Rowling, 42, is one of the worlds richest women, but in the early 1990s she suffered depression while living in a small Edinburgh flat with her baby daughter, Jessica.        
	It was there she began writing the first Harry Potter book but she was only able to afford the rent after a friend paid the 600 deposit. She said: Mid-twenties life circumstances were poor and I really plummeted.         
	The thing that made me go for help was probably my daughter. She was something that earthed me, grounded me, and I thought, this isnt right, this cant be right, she cannot grow up with me in this state.

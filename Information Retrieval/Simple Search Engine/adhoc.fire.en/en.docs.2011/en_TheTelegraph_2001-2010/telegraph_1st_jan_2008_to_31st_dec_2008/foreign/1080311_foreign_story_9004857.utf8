	Baghdad, March 10 (Reuters): Five US soldiers were killed and three others wounded in a bomb blast in central Baghdad today, the US military said, in the worst single attack on US forces in Baghdad in months.        
	An Iraqi interpreter was also wounded in the explosion, which hit the soldiers while they were on foot patrol, the military said. Iraqi police said the soldiers had been walking in the street in Mansour district when a suicide bomber wearing an explosives vest walked up to them and blew himself up. The US military said four soldiers were killed in the blast and one died later of wounds.

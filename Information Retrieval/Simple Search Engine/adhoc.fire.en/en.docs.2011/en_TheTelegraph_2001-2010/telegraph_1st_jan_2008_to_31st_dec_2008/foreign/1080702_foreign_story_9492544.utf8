          LAURA CLOUT                              
	London, July 1: Flying cars will become a reality, claims the inventor Sir Clive Sinclair.         
	Sir Clive, best known for the ill-fated electrical vehicle the C5, said personal flying machines would be economically and technically possible.         
	Speaking on BBC Radio 4s PM programme, he said: Im sure it will happen and I am sure it will change the world dramatically. The celebrated inventor said any flying machine would have to be powered by electricity. Petrol engines are not reliable enough.         
	It would need to be automatically controlled because we cant all learn to fly, he said. The vehicle would take off from your home and fly to wherever you want to go. Sir Clive said he had no plans to develop flying car technology but said he would love to be involved with any effort.

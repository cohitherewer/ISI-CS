	Ka-boom    
	 San Diego (Reuters): All over sunny San Diego, tough economic times have forced people to cut back on their $4 lattes and sushi dinners. But one new business is booming  and ka-booming  precisely because of frustration from the worst financial crisis to hit the US in decades. Welcome to Sarahs Smash Shack, where pent-up patrons can relieve stress by hurling dinnerware and bric-a-brac against a wall, as hard as they can, day and night, seven days a week. San Diego entrepreneur Sarah Lavely charges her clients $10 and up to pulverize plates and glasses during 15-minute intervals.     
	Nobel leak     
	 Stockholm (Reuters): The Swedish Academy is concerned its decision to award Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio the Nobel Prize for literature may have leaked ahead of the announcement, a member of the academy was quoted as saying recently. The academys permanent secretary, Horace Engdahl, told Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter he intended to look into the matter.

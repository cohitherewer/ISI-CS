The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US hot pursuit spectre haunts Pakistan
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US hot pursuit spectre haunts Pakistan

	Peshawar, July 20 (Reuters): Former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld may not have been shy about projecting US military power, but even he didnt dare send American troops into Pakistans tribal lands to snatch or kill al Qaida leaders.        
	But now Pakistanis fear the US presidential campaign has heated up the foreign policy debate over how to handle the Taliban and al Qaida threat to a point where American leaders could throw caution to the wind by taking unilateral action.        
	If this was a possibility in the past, its a high possibility now, said a senior security official in the northwestern city of Peshawar, shuddering at the statements coming from the US.        
	In 2005, Rumsfeld reportedly aborted a mission to eliminate Ayman al-Zawahri, al Qaidas second-in-command, because it involved too many troops, chances of success were too uncertain, and the danger of riling the situation in Pakistan was too great.        
	The risks today may be even greater, with Pakistan going through a precarious transition to civilian-led democracy and tribesmen across the northwest reaching for their guns.        
	If Americans hit the Pakistani side, they will make more enemies for themselves, Ayaz Wazir, a former Pakistani ambassador to Kabul, said.        
	Mounting casualties among Western troops across the border in Afghanistan have fuelled alarm, as have intelligence assessments that al Qaida could organise strikes on western soil having regrouped in the tribal areas under Taliban protection.        
	The US is now piling resources into Afghanistan, where the Taliban insurgency is stronger than ever six-and-a-half years after US-backed forces drove the Islamist militia and its al Qaida guests into the mountains on the Pakistan border.        
	With western forces pressing into areas where the militants had ranged, there have been more encounters, more casualties, and more talk of ordering hot pursuit into Pakistani territory.        
	Talat Masood, a former general turned political analyst, said US Congressional hearings, the media and think-tanks were generating the kind of hype that could persuade President George W. Bush to authorise an intensification of air strikes and even limited ground operations in the tribal belt.        
	Pakistan must have to take action on its own. It is left with no other option, Masood told Reuters.        
	An American incursion would be a call to arms for tribesmen who had hitherto shunned the insurgency based in the ethnic Pashtun tribal belt straddling the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and undermine the fledgling civilian, coalition government.        
	Anti-American sentiments will rise exponentially, Masood wrote in the Daily Times. The civilian government would be destabilised and moderate forces would be further marginalised.        
	There is a perception that the Pakistan army reduced pressure on Taliban groups in the border areas as the new government tried to get tribal elders to persuade the militants to end their war.        
	Afghan President Hamid Karzai has also cast accusations that members of Pakistans security apparatus are playing a double-game by helping the Taliban insurgency in order to preserve leverage in southern Afghanistan for the day when Western governments pull their forces out.        
	Bush has said he is troubled by al Qaidas presence in Pakistan and will discuss the matter with Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani when they meet in Washington on July 28.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nepal votes to shake off cursed destiny

	Kathmandu, April 10: This was a we shall overcome poll.         
	Nepal voted determinedly today to shake off its cursed destiny, transcending fears of violence and widespread scepticism  domestic and international  over whether there exists a genuine impetus for change.         
	Well in excess of 60 per cent, voters cast their will for a Constituent Assembly on what was mostly a festive day across the country; at hundreds of polling stations, the queues were still pushing when ballot boxes were closed at five this afternoon. Relieved the doomsdayers had been silenced, a vindicated chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel congratulated the people. This has been a great day for us all, people turned out in resounding numbers and everything was by and large peaceful.        
	 National election observer Gun Bahadur Adhikari said: Today is evidence that the Nepali people are deeply committed to their aspirations and will do their bit no matter what. They deserve a big pat on their backs.         
	It is clear Nepalis are firm on securing the fruits of their revolution of April 2006, which forced King Gyanendra to surrender power. The new Constituent Assembly is meant to formally establish a multi-party democratic republic, ending 238 years of Shah monarchy.         
	I am not sure what the political parties will make of this because they have often let people down, said Narayan Pokharel, a retired diplomat. But the message from the people is loud, they want change and they have done their part.         
	In the northern hill districts, people trudged miles to polling stations. In Madhes, Nepals southern terai, they were in jubilant defiance of boycott and bandh calls by armed separatist groups. Kathmandu was a silent celebration that unwound through the day; most of the votes in the capital were cast early, probably on account of fear, but the lines were long even later afternoon and sensing peace, the citizenry made the best of a traffic-free day, lounging in the mild sun.         
	There were sporadic disturbances but nowhere near the scale most apprehended. Four persons were killed and a dozen injured in countrywide clashes over booth-capturing attempts but they had little impact on voter enthusiasm.         
	An independent candidate was shot dead in Sunsari in Madhes, and two other party workers died in crossfire between unknown groups. Police had to intervene at several places but they werent stretched. Many had argued ahead of the polls that the army should be deployed; the polling was an embarrassment to such advice.         
	Only 33 of the 22,000 polling stations reported a repoll requirement. Meanwhile, the counting of votes has begun in earnest, although the odds are that final results will be slow to come because of the remoteness of most constituencies.         
	Maoist cadres disproved critics with a display of restraint that underlined their commitment to a peaceful election. Apparatchiks of the notorious Young Communist League (YCL), the Maoists striking arm, did resort to intimidation, both verbal and physical, in a few places including Lalitpur near Kathmandu, but they were obviously under rein from their leadership.         
	And to be fair, workers of other parties  the Nepali Congress, the Nepali Communist Party (UML) and the Madhesi Janjagaran Front  were not above unfair resorts.         
	The sight of Prachanda, a jungle warrior till the other day, casting his vote in Chhitwan down south was a mirage turned real for many.         
	When did you last hear of a guerrilla leader put his gun down and stamp his ballot? asked an elderly Nepali watching the event on live television.         
	We have gone through so much in the last decade, but seeing this is very satisfying. I hope it is for real. Not surprisingly, Baburam Bhattarai and Comrade Badal, chief of the Maoist army  both are contesting  also hogged media attention ahead of the likes of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala today.         
	The Maoists behaviour today is a slap in the face of all those who doubted their intentions, in particular the international community, said a senior Election Commission official, visibly elated at the way polling had passed. They were meant to be the disrupters, they were only participants.         
	Two years after they joined the political mainstream, Prachandas Maoists remain on the US terror list. But in what could be tangential appeal for corrections, former US President Jimmy Carter, here as an observer, paid sumptuous tribute to what he saw.         
	This has been a revolutionary election, he said. I have monitored 70 troubled elections but never seen one like this. I am gratified to be here, and I am sure today will change the structure of government in Nepal completely.

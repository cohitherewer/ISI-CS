	Washington, March 3 (Reuters): Hillary Clinton and rival Barack Obama are running neck-and-neck in Ohio and Texas one day before their crucial Democratic presidential showdowns, according to a Reuters/C-SPAN/Houston Chronicle poll released today.
    
	Clinton, fighting to save her presidential bid after 11 straight wins by Obama, desperately needs victories in the big-state battles to keep her candidacy alive and face the Republican candidate in the November election.
    
	Obama, an Illinois senator, has a slim advantage on Clinton in both states, although the leads are within the polls margin of error of just under 4 percentage points.
    
	Obama leads 47 per cent to 44 per cent in Texas, as Clinton gained 1 point overnight in the polling conducted by Zogby International. He leads 47 per cent to 45 per cent in Ohio, a turnaround from Clintons 1-point advantage yesterday.
    
	Obama has wiped out big leads in the last two weeks in both states for Clinton, a New York senator and former first lady.

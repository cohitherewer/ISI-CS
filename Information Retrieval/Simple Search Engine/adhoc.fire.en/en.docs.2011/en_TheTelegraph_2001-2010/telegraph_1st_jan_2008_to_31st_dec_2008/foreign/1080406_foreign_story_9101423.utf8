	London, April 5: The male heel has climbed to the top of the footwear charts because of the Sarkozy effect.        
	The 5foot 5inches tall French President is towered over by his wife, Carla Bruni, who at 5feet 9inches tall must wear flat shoes to try to minimise the height discrepancy.        
	Following the state visit last week, British men are turning to heels to avoid similar embarrassment when out with their partners.        
	The department store chain Selfridges has noted a surge in sales of mens shoes with stack heels of up to 2inches.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

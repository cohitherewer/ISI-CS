	Islamabad, May 25 (AP): Pakistans deposed chief justice said today that officials who bowed to President Pervez Musharrafs declaration of emergency and ouster of judges last year would be punished.        
	Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry made the comments in the city of Faisalabad, where thousands of lawyers and other activists gathered to whip up support for a new round of protests aimed at pressuring the countrys new coalition government to restore the jurists.        
	Musharraf, a retired army chief who seized power in a 1999 military coup, declared emergency in November and ousted several dozen judges to avoid legal challenges to his rule.        
	Anti-Musharraf parties came to power after winning February elections, forming a coalition that promised to restore the judges. But disputes over exactly how to bring the judges back have pushed the coalition to the verge of collapse.        
	Chaudhry told the lawyers in Faisalabad that the supreme court had passed an order aimed at countering the Presidents actions on November 3, the same day the emergency was declared.        
	In an apparent reference to Musharraf and the judges he installed after the purge, Chaudhry promised that anyone who violated the courts order will be punished no matter how big he is and whatever position he is attaining.        
	Chaudhry did not specify what he meant by punishment.        
	The heated rhetoric came hours after the main ruling Pakistan Peoples Party offered some details of a plan to reinstate the judges and change the constitution in order to reduce Musharrafs powers.        
	Party chief Asif Ali Zardari said he wanted to strip Musharraf of the right to dissolve the countrys parliament and to appoint military chiefs. But he also said yesterday that he would engage the presidency to try smoothing the passage of the provisions.        
	We have never accepted Musharraf as a constitutional President but always said that we will keep a working relationship, Zardari said, adding: We intend to walk him away rather than impeach him away.        
	Today, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani  a Zardari party member  said the proposed package was not aimed at setting up a clash with Musharraf but rather at restoring a balance of power by giving the parliament more authority.        
	Its objective is to balance the discrepancies.... Confrontation with anyone is not our job, Gilani told journalists in Lahore, noting that previous amendments to the constitution had strengthened the presidency.        
	Musharrafs spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment today.        
	Sadiqul Farooq, a spokesman for the second-largest party in the government, that of ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said it would reserve comment on the package until it sees details.        
	Zardari urged lawyers and his government allies to be patient in their support for the reforms, which would eventually require a two-thirds majority in the parliament.        
	One area where the package could flounder is that of what to do with Chaudhry  particular the matter of whether to reduce the length of time a chief justice can serve.        
	Chaudhry, considered an unusually independent-minded chief justice, does not have unqualified support from those who disdain Musharraf.        
	Zardari, for one, has been critical of Chaudhry for agreeing to work under Musharraf after the coup. He argues that a restored Supreme Court should not meddle in politics.

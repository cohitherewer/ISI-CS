	Islamabad, Nov. 3 (AP): Pakistan today warned the new US commander of Americas two wars that frequent missile strikes on Taliban and al Qaida targets on Pakistani territory fan anti-American sentiment in an Islamic country vital to the struggle against terrorism.        
	Gen. David Petraeus met Pakistani officials including defence minister Ahmad Mukhtar and army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani today as part of his first international trip since taking over US Central Command three days ago.        
	Complaints from US commanders about Pakistans efforts to counter the insurgents have been accompanied by a surge of missile strikes.        
	A defence ministry statement said Mukhtar told Petraeus and assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher that the missile strikes from drones generate anti-America sentiments as well as create outrage and uproar among the people.

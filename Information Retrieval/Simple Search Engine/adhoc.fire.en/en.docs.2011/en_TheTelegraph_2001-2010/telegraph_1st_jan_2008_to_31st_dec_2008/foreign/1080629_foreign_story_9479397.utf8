	Hatcher love    
	 New York, June 28 (AP): It was not actress Teri Hatcher who made a big impression on schoolchildren in Nairobi, Kenya. It was her 10-year-old daughter, Emerson Rose.      
	Hatcher and Emerson visited a boarding school where the students hit it off with the California girl.      
	They loved my daughter, Hatcher, one of the stars of ABCs Desperate Housewives, said.      
	The 43-year-old actress recalled a moment when a little girl in the back of a classroom raised her hand during a question-and-answer session, but got really shy and ran up to whisper a question in her daughters ear. Hatcher said her daughter brought letters from her classmates to kick off a pen-pal exchange with at least 40 children at the boarding school.

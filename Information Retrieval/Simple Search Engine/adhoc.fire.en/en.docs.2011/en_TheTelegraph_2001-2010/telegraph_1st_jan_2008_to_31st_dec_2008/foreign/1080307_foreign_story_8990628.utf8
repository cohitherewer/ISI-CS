	Bangkok, March 6 (Reuters): Viktor Bout, an international arms dealer dubbed the Merchant of Death, was arrested in Thailand today accused of trying to buy weapons for Colombian rebels, Thai police said. Bout was picked up at a Bangkok hotel after he entered Thailand on February 29.         
	Police were searching for an associate.        
	He was attempting to procure weapons for Colombias FARC rebels, the Thai police said in an arrest report.        
	The leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, is fighting a four-decade old insurgency against the Bogota government.        
	Bout has run a network of air cargo companies in West Asia, Africa, eastern Europe and the US. According to the UN and the US treasury department, Bout has sold or brokered arms that have helped fuel wars in Afghanistan, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Sudan.        
	The US treasury department seized his cargo planes and froze other assets in 2006. Bout  a former Soviet air force officer born in Tajikistan in 1967  has repeatedly denied the allegations.

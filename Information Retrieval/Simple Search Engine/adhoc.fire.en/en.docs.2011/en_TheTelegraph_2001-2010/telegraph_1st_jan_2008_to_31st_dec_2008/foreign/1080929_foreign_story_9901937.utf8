	London, Sept. 28: Men find womens bodies more attractive in the winter, say researchers.         
	A group of men were asked, at different times of the year, to rate photos of women. They gave their highest scores in the winter and autumn, and their lowest in the summer.         
	Researchers from Polands University of Wroclaw who conducted the experiment believe the seasonal variation may have an impact on mate choice and levels of adultery.         
	In the study, reported in the journal Perception, 114 men were shown pictures every three months over five seasons. There were three kinds of photographs: full body portraits of women in black swimsuits, exposed breasts of different sizes, and faces of young women.         
	To account for variation in individual preferences, scores were averaged out to obtain each mans overall score awarded to each of the three kinds of photo in spring, summer, autumn and winter.         
	There was no seasonal variation in ratings for faces.         
	The researchers also tested how attractive the men found their own partner. The results showed the same seasonal pattern. But when the men were asked to rate their own attractiveness, there was no seasonal variation.

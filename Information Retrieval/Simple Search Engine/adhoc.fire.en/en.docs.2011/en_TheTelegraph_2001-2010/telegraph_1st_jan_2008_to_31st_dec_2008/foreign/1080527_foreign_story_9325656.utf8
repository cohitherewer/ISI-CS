   7 minutes of terror spare Phoenix          CATHERINE ELSWORTH                                   (From top) A polygonal pattern on Mars near the Phoenix Mars Lander, similar in appearance to icy ground in the arctic regions of Earth. The polygonal pattern is seen widely in Martian high latitudes and is believed to have resulted from seasonal freezing and thawing of surface ice. Another picture, one of the first captured by the Phoenix Lander, shows the vast plains of the northern polar region of Mars. The flat landscape is strewn with tiny pebbles. The pictures are approximate-colour images taken shortly after landing by the spacecrafts Surface Stereo Imager, inferred from two colour filters, a violet, 450-nanometre filter and an infrared, 750-nanometre filter. The third picture shows an artists rendition of the Phoenix Lander digging a trench through the upper soil layer on Mars. (Nasa pictures sent by AFP and AP)                                       
	Pasadena, California, May 26: Jubilant cheers rang out at Nasas Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena early today as the space agencys Phoenix Mars Lander executed what appeared to be a textbook entry and landing after its hazardous journey to the Red Planet.         
	Ecstatic mission controllers punched the air and hugged one another as word reached Earth that the robotic probe had pulled off its perilous plunge to the Martian surface, the so-called seven minutes of terror in which it slowed from nearly 13,000mph to just 5mph before a gentle touchdown.         
	At 12.53am, exactly on time, radio signals confirmed the lander had safely reached its target on unexplored icy terrain near the planets north pole.         
	The Phoenix has landed, the Phoenix has landed! a flight controller shouted out to the packed control room. Welcome to the northern plains of Mars!         
	To reach its destination, the lander had to execute a hair-raising series of autonomous manoeuvres to transform from a spacecraft to a robotic research station.         
	After jettisoning solar panels that powered it 420 million miles through space, the probe activated a heat shield to burn through the planets atmosphere at 2600 degrees Celsius before deploying a parachute and 12 reverse thrust rockets to bring the craft down.         
	Absolutely beautiful, said Dan McCleese, a chief scientist at Nasas Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It looks like a good place to start digging.        
	With little room for error, there was significant risk the $420-million venture could end the same way five out of 11 of the worlds previous Mars missions have done  in failure.         
	Nasa had not successfully landed a craft on the planet using rockets to slow its decent rather than air bags to cushion its fall since the 1970s.         
	But Phoenix, whose mission is to investigate whether the planets subterranean ice ever supported life, appeared to follow computer simulations of its planned arrival to the letter, executing every stage of its decent on time and never losing radio contact with Earth.         
	Im speechless, said Barry Goldstein, project manager at JPL, moments after the craft landed 170 million miles away. In my dreams it could not have gone as perfectly as it did tonight.         
	Nasa was awaiting further confirmation that the deployment of the Phoenixs equipment after its landing had gone exactly to plan. After touchdown it was due to open the solar arrays that will power its 90-day mission on Mars with pictures expected to reach Earth via Nasas Odyssey Mars orbiter two hours after the landing.         
	But flight controllers were optimistic, saying the most difficult part of the mission was behind them. (The Phoenix) is in a nice flat place, its very safe and happy. I just cant imagine the solar arrays wont open, said Peter Smith, the planetary geologist heading the Phoenix science team. He had two words to describe the landing: Picture perfect.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fresh chaos at Heathrow
                            
	London, April 5 (Reuters): Heathrows showpiece terminal 5, beset by baggage chaos since its opening last month, hit more problems today as a luggage software glitch forced British Airways to cancel seven flights.        
	Airport operator BAA, owned by Spains Ferrovial, issued an apology to BA and its passengers as it tried to fix the problem with the baggage reconciliation system that matches passengers luggage to their flight. BA has been forced to cancel hundreds of flights from the state-of-the-art, 4.3 billion terminal since it opened on March 27.

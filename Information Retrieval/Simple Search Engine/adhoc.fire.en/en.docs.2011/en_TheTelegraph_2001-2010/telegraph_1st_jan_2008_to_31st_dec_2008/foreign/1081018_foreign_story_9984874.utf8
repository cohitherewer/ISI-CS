	Record rush     
	Tehran (Reuters): Iran failed on Friday to register what it said would be the worlds largest sandwich in the Guinness World Records after people rushed forward and began eating it  before it was measured. Organisers had planned to stuff the 1,500-metre-long sandwich with 700 kg of ostrich meat and 700 kg of chicken and display it in a park in Tehran. But as the sandwich was being measured, chaos ensued. The giant snack was gone in minutes, a witness said.

	Islamabad, May 28 (Reuters): Hundreds of Pakistanis rallied today to mark the 10th anniversary of the countrys first nuclear weapons test, with most celebrating the occasion but some questioning the possession of the weapons.        
	Pakistan detonated nuclear devices underground in remote hills in the south-western province of Baluchistan on May 28, 1998, two weeks after India conducted similar tests.        
	The tests sparked widespread celebrations among Pakistanis proud that their nuclear scientists had matched the Indians.        
	The government defied all pressure from the US and carried out the tests to ensure our security, politician Javed Hashmi told a rally of about 200 people in Multan.        
	Hashmi is a senior member of the party of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, whose government carried out the tests.        
	Similar rallies were held in several other cities while in the capital, Islamabad, about 100 religious party activists gathered near the home of disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan to demand he be released from house arrest.        
	Khan, revered by many Pakistanis as the father of the countrys atomic bomb, was put under house arrest by President Pervez Musharraf after an investigation was launched into his proliferation activities in 2003.        
	Shortly after that, Khan made a televised confession to smuggling nuclear technology to Libya, Iran and North Korea. Its a shame that we put our hero, who gave us the atomic bomb, under house arrest, said Mian Mohammad Aslam, a member of parliament.

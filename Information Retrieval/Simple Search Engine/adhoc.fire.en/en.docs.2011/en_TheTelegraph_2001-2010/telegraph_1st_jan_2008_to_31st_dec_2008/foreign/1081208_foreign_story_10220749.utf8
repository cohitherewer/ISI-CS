The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Big-Bang box stares at long, steep repair

	London, Dec. 7: Repairs to the Large Hadron Collider, dubbed the biggest experiment in history, will cost almost 14m and take until at least next summer to be completed.         
	A faulty electrical connection between magnets was likely to blame for a large helium leak which caused the 4.4m LHC to be shut down in September.        
	The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) thought it would only be out of action until last month but the damage was worse than expected. Now it is hoped repairs will be completed by May or early June with the machine restarted at the end of June or later.         
	James Gillies, a CERN spokesperson, said: If we can do it sooner, all well and good. But I think we can do it (in) early summer.         
	We will not be going to our member states asking for more money, we will deal with it within the current CERN budget.        
	The machine took nearly 20 years to complete and cost 4.4billion to build in a 17-mile tunnel complex under the Franco-Swiss border.        
	Designed to smash protons together at huge speeds, recreating conditions moments after the Big Bang, scientists hope it will shed light on fundamental questions in physics.         
	The fault occurred just nine days after it was turned on with Cern blaming the shutdown on the failure of a single, badly soldered electrical connection in one of its super-cooled magnet sections.         
	The collider operates at temperatures colder than outer space for maximum efficiency and experts needed to gradually warm the damaged section to assess it.         
	Now the sector is warm so they are able to go in and physically look at each of the interconnections, Gillies said.        
	Repairing it will require 53 of the 57 magnets in the colliders tunnel, buried under the Swiss-French border near Geneva, to be removed and then re-installed.        
	Some 28 have already come out, and all the magnets should be back in place by the end of March, Gillies said. CERN now expects the machine to be powered up again for tests by June, after which particle beams can be sent around.        
	Lyn Evans, the Welsh-born project director has called the collider a discovery machine, the most sophisticated scientific instrument of our time.

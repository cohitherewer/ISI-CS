          ROSA PRINCE                          Chakrabarti: Aggrieved                                  
	London, June 20: Shami Chakrabarti, the director of civil rights group Liberty, is threatening to sue a cabinet minister who she believes insinuated that her relationship with former shadow home secretary David Davis was inappropriate.         
	Chakrabarti is demanding a public apology from Andy Burnham, the culture secretary, who she accuses of tawdry character assassination and innuendo.         
	The director of the leading human rights group has written a strongly-worded letter to Burnham after he accused her of having late-night, hand-wringing, heart-melting phone calls with Davis.         
	Chakrabarti, 39, who is married with a young son, has failed to see the funny side of the remarks in this weeks Progress magazine.         
	She is demanding a written apology from Burnham to herself and Doreen Davis, the wife of the ex-MP who resigned his seat this week to fight a byelection on the issue of civil liberties in protest over the British governments 42-day detention plans.         
	In the article, Burnham appears to imply that Daviss stance was a result of his close relationship with the civil liberties chief and their curious phone calls.         
	In her letter, copied to Gordon Brown, Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, and Geoff Hoon, the chief whip, Chakrabarti says that she is surprised at Burnhams actions, given that he is himself married with young children.         
	She goes on to warn that she will launch legal proceedings if the allegations are repeated.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Clooney raises funds for Obama
                            
	Geneva, Sept. 3 (Reuters): George Clooney has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for US presidential candidate Barack Obama by headlining an exclusive event for Americans in Geneva, one of the worlds most affluent cities.        
	The Hollywood actor and director, fresh from the world premiere of the Coen brothers comedy Burn After Reading in Venice, slipped without fanfare into the Swiss city yesterday for his first appearance on behalf of the Democratic nominee.        
	Dressed in a black suit and tie, Clooney signed autographs but did not comment as he squeezed his way past fans gathered in the narrow streets of Geneva.

	Washington, Nov. 18 (AP): President-elect Barack Obamas daughters Malia and Sasha are in Washington with their mother checking out new schools.        
	Michelle Obama brought 7-year-old Sasha and 10-year-old Malia to visit the future first familys top choices, her spokeswoman Katie McCormick Lelyveld said today. She would not name the schools.        
	She brought the girls to visit choices for their new schools to make sure they find the right fit, she said. Their move to Washington is her top priority.        
	A small motorcade was parked at the back entrance of Georgetown Day School yesterday afternoon, with a few Secret Service agents standing around. The motorcade left after a group of people emerged, but Michelle Obama was not seen among them. When asked if Michelle Obama had visited the school that day, some parents and students said they did not know.         
	Other students who appeared to be in middle school said that they were not allowed to answer reporters questions. The Obamas were expected to tour Sidwell Friends. The soon-to-be First Lady visited both elite schools last week, without her daughters, when she also toured the White House.

	London, June 12: Intelligent people could live up to 15 years longer than their less bright counterparts, according to scientists who have linked a smart gene to longevity.         
	Researchers in Italy found those with the less smart variant of the gene, which has already been linked to IQ levels by scientists, were unlikely to live beyond 85. But the team at the University of Calabria found that others with a good version of the same gene could expect to live to 100. The gene known as SSADH is already known to detoxify the brain by getting rid of excess acid. That process is believed to protect brain cells from damage which would otherwise accelerate the ageing process.         
	Using a sample of more than 500 Italians aged from 18 to 107 researchers led by Giuseppe Passarino, professor of genetics at Calabria, attempted to establish a further link with long life.         
	They created what they dubbed a survival snapshot by comparing the groups genetic information with their ages. The team asked the 115 people within the sample, who fell into the 65 to 85 age group, to take cognitive tests.         
	Those with the less intelligent variant of the gene performed significantly worse confirming the earlier pattern, the study published in the journal New Scientist shows. But they also noticed that few of those with the bad version lived beyond 85 while those with the good form were likely to live to 100.         
	Prof. Robert Plomin of the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College London, who first identified the cognitive effects of SSADH gene four years ago, said the findings were significant but called for further research using much larger samples.

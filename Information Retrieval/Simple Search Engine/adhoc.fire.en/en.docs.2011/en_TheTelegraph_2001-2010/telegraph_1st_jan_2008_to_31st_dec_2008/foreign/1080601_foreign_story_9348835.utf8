	Colombo, May 31 (AP): Two civilians were killed today and nine others wounded in a grenade blast in Sri Lankas capital, the military said.        
	Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said the attack was against a group of people waiting at a bus stop in the Wellawatte district of Colombo.        
	There have been several bomb attacks recently on buses and trains in different parts of Sri Lanka, killing dozens of civilians. The government has blamed them on Tamil Tiger rebels. Nanayakkara said it was not immediately clear who was behind todays grenade attack.

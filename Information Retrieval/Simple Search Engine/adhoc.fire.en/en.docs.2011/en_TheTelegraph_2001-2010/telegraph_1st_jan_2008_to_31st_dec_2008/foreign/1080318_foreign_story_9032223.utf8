The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Study: Men attracted to fair-skinned women
                                                                                                               Study: Men attracted to fair-skinned women
  - LADIES PREFER CLOONEY OVER CRAIG                                            COLOUR MATTERS (From top) Keira Knightley, Penelope Cruz, George Clooney and Daniel Craig                                 
	Men are more attracted to fair-skinned women as they appear innocent and pure, according to research. Women, however, are drawn to men with a darker complexion as they seem virile and brooding, scientists claim.        
	The findings suggest that, in effect, more men would instinctively prefer Keira Knightley than her Spanish counterpart Penelope Cruz. But more women would be naturally drawn to George Clooney over fellow actor, Daniel Craig. Researchers from the University of Toronto say that lighter-skinned women in all races are seen as the ideal because of a subconscious association with innocence, purity, modesty, virginity, vulnerability and goodness.        
	They say that women are predominantly attracted to men with darker skin because of latent thoughts about sex, mystery and danger.        
	In an analysis of more than 2,000 advertising pictures of men and women, researchers found that the skin of white women was 15.2 per cent lighter than the skin of white men, and the skin of black women to be 11.1 per cent paler than that of black men.        
	Advertising photographs were used as the basis for the study as models were considered the most attractive people of their races and genders. Dr Shyon Baumann, a sociologist at the university, said: Within our cultures we have a set of ideals about how women should look and behave.        
	 Lightness and darkness have particular meanings attached to them and we subconsciously relate those preferences to women and men. The analysis of white women found that those with the darkest complexions were likely to be wearing the least clothes, hinting at the association with sex and danger that the colour subconsciously triggers. In contrast, women with the most pale skin were more likely to be conservatively dressed, living up to the innocent and modest ideal.        
	Knightley has recently appeared in the successful British adaptation of Ian McEwans novel Atonement while Clooney starred in the hit film Michael Clayton.

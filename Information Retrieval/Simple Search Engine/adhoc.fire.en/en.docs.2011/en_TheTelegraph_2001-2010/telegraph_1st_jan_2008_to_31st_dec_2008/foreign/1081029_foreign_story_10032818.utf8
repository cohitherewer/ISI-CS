	Washington, Oct. 28: Bad news for politicians, it is often said, does not come singly.         
	In the case of US presidential candidate John McCain, unwelcome tidings are pouring in a week before America goes to the polls.         
	McCain had hoped to provide a new focus to his flagging campaign in its final days and launch solid attacks on Barack Obama, hoping to turn crucial undecided voters in his favour.         
	Instead, today McCain has been forced to spend his energy on a new scandal that may cost his party a rock solid seat in the US Senate which the Republicans desperately need to prevent Democrats from gaining absolute control over the legislative chamber next year.         
	Absolute control means 60 seats in the 100-member Senate that will prevent Republicans from holding up legislation through a process known as filibuster.         
	It is clear that Senator Stevens has broken his trust with the people and that he should now step down, McCain said in a statement today on a day when he had hoped to draw support for his economic programme in Pennsylvania, a state he is trying hard to win.         
	The statement came a day after a court here found Ted Stevens, the longest-serving member of the Senate, guilty on charges of not declaring a quarter of million dollars that he received in gifts from an oil contractor in his home state of Alaska, where oil is big business.         
	In an embarrassment to Republicans, Stevens is in no mood to listen to McCain. He is refusing to resign his Senate seat and is, in fact, planning to remain as a candidate for re-election next week.         
	Most of yesterday, McCains message for winning on November 4 was drowned out by a plot to assassinate Obama, which federal authorities claim to have broken up.         
	According to documents unsealed in a district court in Jackson, Tennessee, two neo-Nazi white supremacists plotted to kill 88 people, 14 of them by ritual beheading and then shoot down Obama.         
	Their plan was to go into a school with predominantly black children for the rampage before targeting the Democratic presidential hopeful, the court documents said.         
	The numbers 88 and 14 have symbolic importance in neo-Nazi rituals here and hence these numbers of potential victims in the plot.         
	The number 14 is sacred for white supremacists because of the 14-word creed of one of their leaders proclaiming: We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.         
	The importance of number 88 comes from the eighth letter of the alphabet, H. Neo-Nazis use 88 to mean two Hs that stand for Heil Hitler.         
	Two men, Daniel Cowart, 20, of Tennessee and Paul Schlesselman, 18, of Arkansas, have been arrested and charged with possessing an unregistered firearm, conspiring to steal guns and threatening a candidate for President.         
	The latest bad tidings for McCain come close on the heels of another incident last week when a white Republican volunteer falsely claimed that a black man carved a B  for Barack  on her cheek after seeing a McCain sticker on her car.         
	The 20-year-old Pennsylvania woman initially told the police that she was attacked at an automated bank teller machine by a black male, who caught her from behind, put a knife to her throat and forced her to hand over $60.         
	She said the assailant punched her, knocked her to the ground and told her that you are going to be a Barack supporter.         
	But before she recanted her story under police questioning, McCain and his vice-presidential running mate Sarah Palin telephoned the woman expressing their support in an obvious effort to make political capital out of the incident.         
	But it is the conviction of his partys Senator from Alaska that will pose the biggest liability for McCain as his campaign enters its last lap.         
	McCains running mate Palin is governor of Alaska and she has so far refused to toe McCains line that Senator Stevens should step aside.         
	I am confident Senator Stevens will do what is right for the people of Alaska, Palin said in a statement that was non-committal and contrasted with McCains.

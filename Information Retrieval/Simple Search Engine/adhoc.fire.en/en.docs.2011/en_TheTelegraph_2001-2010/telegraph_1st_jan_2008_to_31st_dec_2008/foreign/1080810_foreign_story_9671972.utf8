The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gene hooks smokers at first puff, says study
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Gene hooks smokers at first puff, says study
                            
	Chicago, Aug. 9 (Reuters): For most people, the first experimental drags on a cigarette bring on nausea, coughing and other signals from the brain that say: Turn back. This is a bad idea. But for some, they bring a wave of pleasure.        
	Those in the second group likely bear a gene type that not only increases their addiction risk, but has been implicated in the development of lung cancer, researchers said yesterday.        
	If you have this variant, you are going to like your earliest experiences with smoking, said Ovide Pomerleau of the University of Michigan Medical School, whose research appears in the journal Addiction.        
	Pomerleau said the finding suggests that for some, smoking even one cigarette is a bad idea. Its a trap, he said in a telephone interview. What they dont realise is if they have this kind of genetic make-up, they are on their way to dependency, he said.        
	The research is part of a growing understanding of genetic factors involved in nicotine addiction and lung cancer.        
	Teams of scientists reported earlier this year that smokers who had certain changes in three nicotine receptor genes  which control entry of nicotine into brain cells  were more likely to develop lung cancer than other smokers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kuwait woman MP faces axe
                                                                                                            Kuwait woman MP faces axe
                              Nouriya al-Subaih                             
	Kuwait, Jan. 8 (Reuters): Kuwaits only woman minister will face a no-confidence vote, the Arab states parliament decided today after questioning the liberal politician for 10 hours at the request of an Islamist lawmaker.        
	Education minister Nouriya al-Subaih has been under fire from the start of her tenure after defying Islamists calls for her to wear a head scarf when she was sworn in in April.        
	Islamist legislator Saad al-Sharie accused Subaih of failing educational standards and irregularities at her ministry.        
	We have been trying to find indications of educational reform but we have found only the opposite, Sharie said.        
	Parliament Speaker Jassem al-Kharafi said 10 lawmakers requested a no-confidence vote which could force Subaihs resignation. He did not say when the vote would be held. The House has been locked in a row with the government.        
	Newspapers have said the latest clash could prompt the Opec oil producers ruler, Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, to dissolve the Assembly. Pressure has been mounting on Subaih since her ministry tried to deny an incident in which three boys were sexually assaulted by Asian labourers at a primary school.

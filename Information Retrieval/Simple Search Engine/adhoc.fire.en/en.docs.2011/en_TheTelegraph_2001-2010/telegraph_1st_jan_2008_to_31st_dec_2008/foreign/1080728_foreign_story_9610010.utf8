	Islamabad, July 27 (Reuters): The decision to put Pakistans main spy agency under civilian control was aimed at keeping the army out of the diplomatic line of fire, the head of the ruling party said in remarks published today.        
	Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani yesterday put the Inter Services Intelligence agency (ISI) under the control of the interior ministry before flying off to Washington for talks with President George W. Bush.        
	Critics say the ISI played a major role in the creation of the Islamist Taliban movement, which took control of Afghanistan in the 1990s and harboured al Qaida until it was forced from power by US-led forces in the wake of the September 11 attacks.        
	Neighbouring India and Afghanistan have often blamed the ISI for masterminding acts of terrorism in their countries.        
	The decision by the coalition government, formed after the February elections and led by the party of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, is seen as asserting civilian authority over the intelligence network of a country that has been under military rule for half of its 60 years of independence.        
	Asif Ali Zardari, Bhuttos widower and leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, hoped the historical decision would yield positive results for the country as well as the army.        
	In future, enemies of Pakistan will not be able to defame the ISI; nobody will say that this agency is not under the control of an elected government, the daily News quoted him as saying in a telephone interview from Dubai.        
	The interior ministry will be responsible for responding to allegations against the ISI.        
	In a statement issued today, the government said its decision regarding control of the ISI was being misinterpreted.        
	The ISI will continue to perform its functions under the Prime Minister, a government spokesperson said.        
	He said the governments decision only re-emphasises more coordination between the interior ministry and the ISI in relation to war on terror and internal security.        
	Pakistan officially dropped support for the Taliban and joined the US-led campaign against terrorism after the September 11 attacks organised by Osama bin Laden, a guest of the Taliban.        
	Last month, Pakistan denied accusations by Afghan authorities that the ISI was behind an attempt by Taliban militants to kill Afghan President Hamid Karzai in April.        
	It also denied charges by Afghan and Indian officials that the ISI was involved in this months suicide attack outside the Indian embassy in Kabul that killed 58 people, including two senior Indian diplomats.        
	Zardaris opponents dubbed the decision an attempt to politicise the ISI and hoped it would be reversed soon.        
	The government announcement came hours after Gilani embarked on his first official visit to the US.        
	Gilani is due to meet President Bush for talks that are expected to focus sharply on a growing insurgency along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, where al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding.

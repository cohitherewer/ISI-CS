  -   Millions in Barack kitty
                                                
	Washington, Oct. 19 (Reuters): Republican John McCains presidential campaign suffered a double blow today when Democratic rival Barack Obama won the support of former secretary of state Colin Powell and announced he raised a record $150 million in September.        
	The backing by Powell, who said he plans to vote for Obama in the November 4 election, gives a boost to the foreign policy and national security credentials of the first-term Illinois senator.        
	McCain, despite trailing in opinion polls, said he still expected to win the election and he could sense things are heading our way.        
	Were happy with the way the campaign is going, McCain said on the Fox News Sunday programme. Ive been on enough campaigns, my friend, to sense enthusiasm and momentum, and weve got it.        
	In the midst of economic turmoil and with just over two weeks to go until the election, Obama leads in national polls and in many battleground states but McCain said he saw some movement in his direction.        
	Obamas lead over McCain has dropped to 3 points, according to a Reuters/C SPAN/Zogby poll released today. Obama leads McCain 48 to 45 per cent among likely US voters, down one percentage point from yesterday.        
	McCain is trailing by a much larger margin in campaign funds. Obamas prodigious fundraising has allowed him to blanket the air waves with advertisements, sometime by a margin of 4-to-1 over McCain.        
	By bringing in at least $150 million in September, Obama more than doubled the $66 million he raised in August, which had been a record. McCain has accepted public financing and is limited to spending $84 million for the entire campaign.        
	McCain said he had expected Powell, a former head of the US militarys chiefs of staff, to support his opponent but pointed out that he was endorsed by four other Republican secretaries of state.        
	In an appearance on NBCs Meet the Press, Powell called Obama a transformational figure who could be an exceptional President and praised his depth of knowledge and steadiness.        
	Powell, who served several Republican Presidents including George W. Bush as his first secretary of state, said either candidate would make a good President but he was critical of what he described as McCains uncertainty over how to deal with the economic crisis.         
	Powell said he has no plans to campaign for Obama and was not looking for a job in his administration but he left the door open to the possibility.

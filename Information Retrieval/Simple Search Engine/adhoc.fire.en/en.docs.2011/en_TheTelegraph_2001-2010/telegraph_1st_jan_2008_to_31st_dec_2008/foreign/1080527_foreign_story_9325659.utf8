	Yangon, May 26 (Reuters): Foreign aid workers headed for the cyclone-ravaged Irrawaddy delta today to see whether army-ruled Myanmar will honour a promise made by its top general to give them freedom of movement.         
	Were going to head out today and test the boundaries, one official from a major Western relief agency told Reuters in Yangon shortly before departing for a region that has been off-limits to nearly all foreigners since the May 2 cyclone.        
	Thousands of beggars were lined up along the roads of the delta, where the storm left 134,000 people dead or missing and another 2.4 million clinging to survival.        
	Children shouted just throw something at passing vehicles. But police told drivers and volunteer donors not to give them any thing as they were just begging.        
	Go directly to where you want to go. Dont throw anything from the car. Know your own people, they shouted at the cars at one checkpoint on the way to the devastated town of Bogalay.        
	Three weeks after the disaster, there are still many villages that have received no outside help and waterways of the former Burmas rice bowl remain littered with animal carcasses and corpses, either grotesquely bloated or rotting to the bone.        
	The stench of death is widespread, as are the swarms of flies.Donors pledged nearly $50 million in aid at a landmark conference yesterday but Western countries said much of the cash would be contingent on access to the delta.        
	Many of the donations are destined for the UNs $201 million emergency appeal, which was nearly a third full before the meeting. It is meant to provide help for three months.         
	Washington told the Yangon conference it was ready to raise its offer of $20.5 million in aid if the junta opened up, but added it was dismayed the generals went ahead with a constitutional referendum in the middle of the disaster.

                              Obama in Chicago. (AP)                                  
	Washington, June 10 (AP): Americas stumbling economy remains the focus of the US presidential contest, as Democrat Barack Obama linked Republican John McCain to Bush administration policies and raging energy costs, growing unemployment and mounting home mortgage foreclosures.        
	Obama was in the second day of a two-week tour of regions that have been reliably Republican and swing states that could be key in deciding the November general election. He is promoting his message of change and hammering Republican economic policies as the cause of the economic slump. He will speak in Missouri, which voted Republican in the last two presidential contests.        
	Obama, a first-term senator, is shifting attention to the economy and away from national security and foreign policy, issues where McCain feels stronger given his more than 20 years of experience in the Senate. Polls show that the weak US economy has surpassed the Iraq war as the issue most troubling voters.        
	In his first speech since Democrat rival Hillary Rodham Clinton suspended her run for the White House, Obama targeted her working-class constituency which has taken the brunt of the sharp economic downturn.        
	Obama spoke on Monday in North Carolina, where voters have been badly affected..        
	The centrepiece of McCains economic plan amounts to a full-throated endorsement of George Bushs policies, Obama told about 900 people in Raleigh.        
	He took part of his speech from headlines across the US, where the average price of petrol had just hit $4 a gallon (3.75 litres) for the first time, far below prices in Europe and elsewhere, but a shock to Americans used to relatively inexpensive energy.        
	Repeatedly linking McCain to fellow Republican President George W. Bush, Obama said: Our President sacrificed investments in health care and education, and energy, and infrastructure on the altar of tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy CEOs.        
	Obama criticised McCain for originally opposing Bushs first-term tax cuts but now supporting their continuation. He said he would place a windfall profits tax on oil companies while McCain would reduce their taxes. Obama offered no new policies in his speech. He used the occasion to summarise earlier proposals, including raising income taxes on wealthy Americans, granting a $1,000 tax cut to most others.

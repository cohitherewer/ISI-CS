	Washington, July 12 (Reuters): President George W. Bushs former press secretary Tony Snow has died of cancer, the White House confirmed today.        
	Snow, 53, who had been a conservative radio and television commentator, resigned in August 2007 as Bushs spokesman after taking the job the previous year.        
	Bush in a statement said he and his wife Laura are deeply saddened by the death of our dear friend, and called Snow one of our nations finest writers and commentators.        
	Snow learnt in March last year that the cancer he had fought earlier had returned, and he subsequently underwent chemotherapy.

	Sydney, July 15: Australian lawyers have claimed Heath Ledgers daughter Matilda Rose is entitled to the majority of his $20 million fortune, according to reports.         
	The two-year-old, who lives in New York with her mother, actress Michelle Williams, was not born when Ledger drew up the document and does not appear on his will. The document currently divides the stars wealth between his parents and three sisters.         
	However, the Australian Daily Telegraph has reported that after the wills executors applied for probate in the West Australian supreme court they were advised that under state law, the bulk of the late actors money would be awarded to Matilda.         
	If Williams decided to claim the money on behalf of her daughter, she would have to submit an official affidavit, which could be made public, the newspaper said.         
	Last week, the executors of Ledgers estate, Robert Collins and Mark Dyson, advertised in a Perth newspaper for creditors and other persons with claims on the estate to come forward and lodge them by August 11. This will ensure that any debts are cleared before the estate is divided.         
	Documents filed after Ledgers death show he had $145,000 worth of assets in the US. However his total fortune, mostly held in Australia, has been estimated at $20 million.

	London, June 5: The space race has taken on an entirely different meaning as amorous couples queue up to be the first to join the 100-mile high club.         
	Will Whitehorn, president of Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic, which hopes to send tourists into space next year, said the group had been inundated with enquiries from couples hoping to make history as the first to have sex in outer space.         
	He said: Weve had a variety of people inquire about it. One got in touch about a charter flight so they could be the first to have intercourse in space and get in the Guinness World Records.         
	But scientists have raised doubts over whether it would be possible to enjoy an out of this world experience in Zero gravity. James Logan, a space medicine expert, said the first tourists would be weightless for just five minutes and would be better off waiting for the first missions to Mars later this century.

	Harare, April 14 (Reuters): Zimbabwes high court today rejected an Opposition bid to force authorities to release the result of the countrys presidential election after a two-week delay that has stoked fears of violence.        
	As the court dealt a major blow to its efforts to reveal who won the March 29 vote, the Movement for Democratic Change said one of its supporters had been stabbed to death by members of President Robert Mugabes ZANU-PF party.         
	Police said the killing, by three people, did not appear to be political. In his ruling, high court judge Tendai Uchena found in favour of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, saying it had shown the reason for the results delay was legally valid.

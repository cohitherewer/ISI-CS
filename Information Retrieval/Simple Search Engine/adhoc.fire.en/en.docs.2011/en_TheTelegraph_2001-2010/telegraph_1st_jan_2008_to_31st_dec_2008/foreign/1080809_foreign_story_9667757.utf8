	London, Aug. 8: Random House, the American publisher, has withdrawn a novel about the Prophet Mohammeds child bride, fearing it could incite acts of violence.         
	The Jewel of Medina, a debut novel by journalist Sherry Jones, 46, was due to be published next Tuesday and an eight-city publicity tour had been scheduled. The novel traces the life of Aisha from her engagement to Mohammed, when she was six, until the prophets death.         
	Jones said that she was shocked to learn in May, that publication would be postponed indefinitely. I have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about Islam and Mohammed ... I envisioned that my book would be a bridge-builder, said Jones.        
	Random House deputy publisher Thomas Perry said in a statement the company received cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the Muslim community, but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small, radical segment.        
	He added: In this instance we decided, after much deliberation, to postpone publication for the safety of the author, employees of Random House, booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in sale of the novel.

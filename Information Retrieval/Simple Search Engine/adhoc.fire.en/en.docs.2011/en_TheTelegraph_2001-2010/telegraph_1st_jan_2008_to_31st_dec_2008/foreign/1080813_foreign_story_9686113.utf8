The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cruise to be replaced by Jolie in film
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cruise to be replaced by Jolie in film
          ANITA SINGH                               
	London, Aug. 12: Angelina Jolie is to replace Tom Cruise in new espionage thriller after the movie studio decided to give the title character a sex change.         
	Cruise was originally slated to play the lead in Edwin A Salt as a CIA officer forced to go on the run when wrongly accused of being a Russian spy. When his involvement with the project ended, several male stars expressed an interest in the part.        
	But Jolie took a liking to the script and it will now be re-written for her with a female lead role, according to Variety. The title of the film, to be directed by Philip Noyce, will also have to change.        
	The 33-year-old is the rare female who is viable in an action genre that has been almost the exclusive domain of men, the magazine says. She made her name as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider and her most recent action film, Wanted, has grossed $132 million in the US alone.        
	The spy thriller would mark Jolies return to work following the birth of twins Vivienne Marcheline and Knox Leon last month.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

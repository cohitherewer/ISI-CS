	Rawalpindi, Feb. 4 (Reuters): A suicide bomber attacked a Pakistani military bus taking medical corps staff to work in the garrison city of Rawalpindi today, killing himself and four military personnel, security officials said.
    
	Violence has intensified in Pakistan in recent months, with the army battling militants in the northwest and suicide bomb attacks in towns and cities, raising concern about prospects for the nuclear-armed country in the run-up to February 18 elections.
    
	The bomber was on a motorcycle that rammed into the bus during the morning rush hour outside the armys National Logistics Cell. Several vehicles were badly damaged and army caps were scattered on the floor of the destroyed bus.
    
	It was the seventh suicide bomb blast in Rawalpindi, where the army has its headquarters, in the past six months. The bomb went off about 100metres from the rear of the army headquarters compound.

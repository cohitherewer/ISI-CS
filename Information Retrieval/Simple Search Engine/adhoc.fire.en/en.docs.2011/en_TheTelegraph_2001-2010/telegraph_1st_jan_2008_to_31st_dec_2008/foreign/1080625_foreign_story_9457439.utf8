	London, June 24 (Reuters): What do you do if you are stuck in a field at a pop festival but theres trouble ahead because your mobile phones battery is about to run out?         
	Thanks to a new gizmo, you now just need to face the music and dance.        
	Mobile phone operator Orange said today it had teamed up with GotWind, a firm specialising in renewable energy, to produce a recharger powered by dance energy alone.        
	The portable kinetic energy chargers will be given a test run at this years Glastonbury Festival, the worlds biggest greenfield music and arts celebration that begins on a farm in Somerset on Friday.        
	Orange said the prototype chargers weigh the same as a phone and are about the size of a pack of cards.        
	Attached to the users arm, they employ a system of weights and magnets which provide an electric current to top up charge in a storage battery. This can then later be used to recharge the phone.        
	We wanted to create a fun, engaging and interactive product which would encourage users to have a laugh while charging their mobile phone and at the same time test out a new energy-efficient prototype, said Hattie Magee, head of partnerships at Orange UK.

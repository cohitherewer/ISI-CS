	Beijing, Oct. 24: Hu Jia, a soft-spoken, bespectacled advocate for democracy and human rights in China, was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, Europes most prestigious human rights prize, yesterday.         
	The award was a pointed rebuke of Chinas ruling communist party that came as European leaders were arriving in Beijing for a weekend summit meeting. Hu, 35, was given the prize by the European Parliament despite warnings from Beijing that his selection would harm relations with the EU.         
	Last year, Hu testified via video link before a hearing of the European Parliament about Chinas human rights situation. Weeks later, he was jailed and later sentenced to three and a half years in prison for subversion.

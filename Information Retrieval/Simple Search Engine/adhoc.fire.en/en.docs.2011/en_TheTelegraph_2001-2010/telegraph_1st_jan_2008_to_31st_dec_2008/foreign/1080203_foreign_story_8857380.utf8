	London, Feb. 2: James Bond is getting old. Having battled Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia and al Qaida, Britains secret agents are facing a new foe: age.
    
	In a candid warning, an intelligence chief has said that a generation of ageing spies could undermine Britains international fight against terrorism. Sir John Scarlett, the chief of MI6, has revealed his fears that new government rules increasing the civil service retirement age threatens to hamper his services work around the world.
    
	Sir John, known in Whitehall as C, made the admission in evidence to the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament. To cope with an ageing population, ministers are increasing the age at which civil servants can claim a pension from 60 to 65. 
    
	The change will affect MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service, and MI5, the Security Service. In its latest report, committee members say they asked Sir John in a private evidence session about the possible effect of applying the new retirement age to his service, believed to have more than 2,000 staff.

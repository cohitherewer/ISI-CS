	Washington, April 20 (AFP): A car carrying actress Sandra Bullock (in file picture) and husband Jesse James was hit by a drunk driver, but no one involved in the accident was hurt, People magazine reported on its website yesterday.        
	The magazine said the accident occurred late Friday in Gloucester, Massachusetts, where Bullock is filming The Proposal on Cape Ann.        
	Bullock and her husband were being driven home at around 9:50pm (local time) when a gray subaru station wagon jumped lanes and smashed into the front end of their car.        
	They were shaken up, needless to say, People quoted Gloucester police lieutenant Gerry Cook as saying. But they were fine.        
	The driver of the subaru, identified as Lucille Gatchell, 64, was administered a field sobriety test and showed two and a half times the legal limit of alcohol in her blood, the report said.

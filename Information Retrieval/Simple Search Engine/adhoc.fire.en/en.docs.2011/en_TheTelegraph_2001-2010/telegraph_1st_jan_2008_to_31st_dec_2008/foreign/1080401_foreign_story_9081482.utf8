The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Report slams Sexism in City
                                                                                                               Report slams Sexism in City
          AMIT ROY                                        A poster promoting the Stringfellows strip   club in London      
	London, March 31: A report, Sexism and the City, published today by a womens rights organisation, has hit out at the growing practice among business firms in Britain of routinely taking out clients to lapdancing clubs where nude or semi-nude strippers perform on tabletops.        
	The Fawcett Society, which claims to be the UKs leading campaign for gender Equality, says this culture has become particularly prevalent in the City, which is the shorthand to describe the area of London where financial institutions from Britain and around the world are packed into a relatively small area.         
	 The City today extends beyond the proverbial square mile as London rivals New York as the financial hub of the world. Many Indian institutions, such as the State Bank of India and the Bank of Baroda, are now to be found in the City, with newcomers such as legal firm FoxMandal Little swelling the ranks of senior executives who have come from India. More and more Indian firms are also seeking listing on the London Stock Exchange.        
	Once upon a time it was normal for male executives coming from India to check out the Soho strip club scene but todays arrivals are well-travelled men of the world who appear to lack the old hunger to see what they couldnt back home.        
	 In the evening it is often the done thing for men in the City to pile into lapdancing clubs with their clients and release the stresses of the day over several bottles of champagne ordered on generous expense accounts.         
	 The first UK lapdance club opened in 1995. Industry sources estimate there are now over 300 lapdance club venues operating in Britain, including 65 in London alone.        
	 With names such as Boulevard Striptease, Stringfellows, For Your Eyes Only, Pink Gentlemans (sic) Club, Spearmint Rhino, Sophisticats and Venus Table Dancing Club, they offer a fantastic night out, according to the establishments, which are quite unlike anything available in, say, Park Street in Calcutta.        
	Visiting a lapdance club has become an increasingly normal way of entertaining business clients, says the Fawcett Societys report, Sexism and the City, which is intended to be a play on the American television serial, Sex and the City.         
	The buying and selling of sexual services occurs in some clubs, and women performers face high levels of harassment and poor working conditions, it points out.        
	 The report adds that lapdance clubs normalise the sexual objectification of women and are counter to efforts to promote gender equality.        
	 It quotes the experience of Lucy, a former lapdance club performer: I found it tough, soul destroying, and it had begun to strip me of my humanity. You are forced to behave in a way which is consistently demeaning and submissive. The way you end up behaving to maximise your earnings is to play dumb. You are required to pretend to find men attractive who you do not find attractive. It is entirely false. You are essential totally and utterly objectified.        
	 The society, which is fighting for women to be given equal treatment in the workplace, has listed the disadvantages they suffer: Thirty thousand women lose their jobs each year simply because they are pregnant; only 11 per cent of FTSE (Financial Times Stock Exchange) 100 company directors are women; women earn on average 17 per cent less than their male counterparts.         
	It also says that a lack of flexible working currently means 6.6 million people are not fully using their skills and experience. For Britain to be competitive in global markets we need to be making full use of our countrys talents  and this is simply not happening at present. Sexism has no place in UK business or society in the 21st century. The time for action is now.        
	The Fawcett Societys director, Katherine Rake, commented: Behind the conspicuous wealth of the City lies a hidden story of disadvantage and discrimination affecting women at every level of business  from the bathroom to the boardroom.

                                William, Kate                           
	London, Aug. 10 (PTI): Speculation is rife that Prince William may have proposed to girlfriend Kate Middleton on their honeymoon hideaway in the Caribbean.        
	The couples visit to the island of Mustique comes days after 26-year-old Middleton clearly told the second- in-line to the British throne that she wont wait for ever to tie the knot with him.         
	The pair stayed at Villa Rocina which is advertised as a dream hideaway for honeymooners. The sprawling stone house is owned by Venezuelan millionaire Violera Alvarez and designed by the late British artist Oliver Messel.        
	A homeowner on the island who knows the prince told the Daily Mail: Everyone expects that when William finally proposes to Kate it will be on Mustique (island), because this is their favourite getaway place in the world, and I am sure they chose Rocina because it is so secluded and tasteful and serene.        
	 Its one of Mustiques original gems, surrounded by beautiful gardens, and it can be reached only by a loop road that is served by just two other villas, owned by Mick Jagger and Tommy Hilfiger, the fashion designer.         
	Earlier this month, Middleton had told William that she would like him to announce their engagement date soon as she wont wait forever for him.        
	It may be mentioned that the couple already broke up once as Middleton thought the romance had flatlined. However, the 26-year-old prince had managed to convince and assure her a more publicly recognised role.        
	Since then she has represented the prince at two royal weddings while he has been on military duties and she has also received greater recognition within the royal family, mainly from the queen.

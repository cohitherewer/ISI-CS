	New York, Sept. 8 (Reuters): An unacceptably high number of college students  roughly one in five  continue to smoke cigarettes, according to an American Lung Association report released today.        
	The association says aggressive tobacco industry marketing on college campuses is largely to blame.        
	To gauge the current status of tobacco use and policies on college and university campuses, the American Lung Association analysed published research, surveys and tobacco industry documents. Their findings are compiled in a report: Big Tobacco on Campus: Ending the Addiction.        
	The report says that in 2005, the tobacco industry spent more than $1 million a day sponsoring events and giveaways targeting college students. In a recent survey of 119 colleges, students at 109 schools reported seeing tobacco promotions in on-campus events.

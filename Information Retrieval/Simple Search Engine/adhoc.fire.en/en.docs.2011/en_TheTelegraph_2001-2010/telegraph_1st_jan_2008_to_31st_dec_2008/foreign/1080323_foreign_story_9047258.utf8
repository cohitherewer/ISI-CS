The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pervez allies in row over nominee
                                                                                                               Pervez allies in row over nominee
                            
	Islamabad, March 22 (AP): Allies of President Pervez Musharraf today said they would field another candidate for Pakistans Prime Minister after withdrawing their original nominee a day earlier.        
	The reversal appeared to be due to a disagreement between the countrys two main pro-Musharraf parties.        
	One of the parties, Karachi-based Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM), withdrew its candidate as a goodwill gesture to slain Opposition leader Benazir Bhuttos followers, who won the highest number ofseats in elections last month.        
	The MQM withdrew Farooq Sattars candidacy late yesterday after meetings in London and Karachi, said lawmaker Haider Abbas Rizvi.        
	But Musharrafs own party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Q, today said that it planned to field a candidate.        
	Former Punjab chief minister Pervez Elahi is set to be the likely nominee.        
	Party chairman and president Chaudry Shujaat Hussain said the Sattar withdrawal did not reflect the will of all pro-Musharraf lawmakers.        
	We will contest the election. We have made this decision, Hussain said today in Islamabad. The reversal means that whoever is nominated by Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) will not run uncontested. Makhdoom Amin Fahim, an aristocratic party stalwart, has long been considered the front-runner for Prime Minister. As PPP vice-chairman, he led Bhuttos followers in parliament during her nearly eight-year exile.        
	But the party has stalled on nominating Fahim amid speculation that Asif Ali Zardari, Bhuttos husband and political heir, wants the job. He is currently ineligible because he does not hold a parliamentary seat. However, he could appoint a stand-in and run for a seat in a byelection within months.        
	The battle for Prime Minister has strained party unity  even before it forms a coalition government that faces massive challenges including a wave of Islamic militancy, high inflation and electricity shortages. The new administration will be led by followers of Bhutto and another former Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted in Musharrafs 1999 coup.         
	A confrontation still looms between Musharraf and Sharif, who has been one of the most vocal in calling for the unpopular Presidents resignation or impeachment. Zardari and Bhuttos 19-year-old son Bilawal are expected to announce the candidate.         
	After confirmation by parliament, the new Premier is set to take an oath from Musharraf on Tuesday, said presidential spokesman Rashid Qureshi. Bilawal was appointed party chairman after his mother died in a December suicide attack, but his father is running things while the 19-year-old continues his studies at Oxford University.

	Calling koalas    
	 Sydney, Nov. 25 (Reuters): Australian scientists are using mobile telephones to eavesdrop on koalas to understand what they are saying when they bellow and how this can help conserve the marsupial which is threatened by habitat destruction.      
	The researchers tagged koalas on St Bees Island off northeast Australia with satellite tracking devices to monitor movements. They also placed mobile telephones in the trees which are programmed to turn on every 30 minutes and record for two minutes.      
	The mobiles, charged by solar power and car batteries, record the koala bellows, then download the recordings to a computer at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.      
	Koala bellows can go from really quite short, sharp, and quite agitated sounding bellows to long, slow, deep bellows that can last for over a minute, said researcher Bill Ellis. Interestingly most of the bellowing seems to occur around midnight, not around dawn or dusk.

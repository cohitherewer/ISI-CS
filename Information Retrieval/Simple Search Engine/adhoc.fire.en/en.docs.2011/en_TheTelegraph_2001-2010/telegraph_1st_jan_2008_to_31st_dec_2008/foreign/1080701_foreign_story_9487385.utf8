	Kuala Lumpur, June 30: The Malaysian Opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, who took shelter at the Turkish embassy after saying his life was in danger, is suing over fresh allegations that he committed sodomy.         
	Anwar, who was accused of sodomy on Saturday, fled to the embassy yesterday, claiming senior establishment figures had warned him of a government-backed plot against his life. He claimed the allegation is part of a plot to stop the spectacular rise of the Opposition, which many now see as a government-in-waiting.         
	He left the embassy with his wife and daughter late today after his lawyer said Anwar had accepted guarantees from the Prime Minister and home minister that he would not be harmed.         
	Anwar, 60, led the Opposition to unprecedented gains in a general election in March. He claims he already has enough support from government MPs to oust the semi-authoritarian National Front from power for the first time in 51 years.         
	Today, Anwar filed a defamation suit against Saiful Bukhari Azlan, the 23-year-old former assistant who claims he was sodomised by Anwar last Thursday.

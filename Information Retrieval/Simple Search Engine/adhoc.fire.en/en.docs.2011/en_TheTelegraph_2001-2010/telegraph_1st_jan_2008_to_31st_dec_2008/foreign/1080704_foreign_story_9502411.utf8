	Moscow, July 3 (Reuters): Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich quit as governor of a remote Arctic region, ending what analysts said was a deal with former President Vladimir Putin to give something back to the country that made him rich.        
	Abramovich, owner of Britains Chelsea soccer club and ranked Russias second richest businessman by Forbes magazine, invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the desolate region of Chukotka since his election as governor in 2000.        
	Abramovich had made a promise to Putin to take on some civic responsibility after earning an enormous fortune in the chaotic 1990s, the analysts said. Abramovich tried to step down in 2006 as governor of Chukotka but Putin insisted he stay on. The Kremlin said President Dmitry Medvedev had approved his resignation today after a request from Abramovich.        
	But the decision does not mean Abramovich is cutting his links to Russia, said his spokesman, Jonathan Mann.        
	His main home is here, Mann said.Mr Abramovich is still very much involved not only in Chukotka but in Russia in general, he has major investments here.        
	Abramovich, 41, is ranked by Forbes magazine as Russias second wealthiest businessman with a reputed wealth of $23 billion, mainly held through his private investment vehicle Millhouse Capital.

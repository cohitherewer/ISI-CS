	London, April 7 (Reuters): Princess Diana and her lover Dodi al-Fayed were unlawfully killed by the grossly negligent driving of their chauffeur and paparazzi photographers pursuing them into a Paris road tunnel 10 years ago.        
	The jury, which had spent almost six months listening to more than 250 witnesses, reached their decision today.        
	The jury foreman said in court: The crash was caused, or contributed to, by the speed and manner of the driver of the Mercedes and the speed and manner of the following vehicles. He said contributing factors were: the fact that chauffeur Henri Pauls judgment was impaired by alcohol, Diana was not wearing a seatbelt and that the car hit a pillar.

	Colombo, May 9 (Reuters): A bomb went off inside a cafe in eastern Sri Lanka killing at least 11 people today, the military said, a day before the first local elections in the region in two decades.        
	The military blamed the LTTE for the blast which comes amid intensified fighting between the rebels and soldiers along the northern frontlines.         
	There has been an explosion in Ampara town a little while ago, said military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara. Eleven civilians were killed and 29 injured. It is definitely by the LTTE. Security had been tightened for tomorrows polls in the districts of Trincomalee, Ampara and Batticaloa.

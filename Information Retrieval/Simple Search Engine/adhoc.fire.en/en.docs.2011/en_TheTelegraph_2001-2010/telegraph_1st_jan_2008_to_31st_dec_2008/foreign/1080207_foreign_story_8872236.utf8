	Vulgar picture prank     
	 Berlin, Feb. 6 (Reuters): A 21-year-old German man has been convicted of sending a photograph of his penis to an unknown woman via mobile phone, authorities said today.      
	We all had a bit of a laugh when we saw the thing, said Christian Kropp, presiding judge at the court in the eastern town of Sondershausen. The woman reported the sender to police after receiving the photo attachment of the mans genitals, the court said. Officers found evidence he may have sent similar images to other women. The man did not explain his motive but expressed remorse.

	Kathmandu, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Nepal imposed nine hours of daily power cuts today after declaring a national power emergency, deepening many Nepalis displeasure with the Himalayan nations Maoist-led government.        
	The power cuts, brought on by low river levels, come just as the middle of winter approaches.        
	Nepals many rivers cascading down from the Himalayas have the potential to generate up to 83,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity, officials and experts say.        
	But Sher Singh Bhat, a senior official at the state-run Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), said Nepal generates 336 MW of total capacity despite demand for 770 MW, which rises by 60 MW a year.        
	The supply situation is very vulnerable, Bhat told Reuters.We cant meet even 50 per cent of the demand.        
	Unless the government comes up with rescue plans, the situation would continue for another four to five years.        
	The government, which came to power after an April vote for a Constituent Assembly, declared a national power emergency this week and said it would set up power plants run by diesel to generate 200 MW of electricity to cope with the immediate shortage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Malaysia PM 
                                                                                                               Malaysia PM 
                            
	Kuala Lumpur, March 9 (AP): Malaysias Prime Minister today declared he had no intention of quitting despite unprecedented electoral losses that gave the Opposition control of five states and one-third of parliament.        
	National news agency Bernama quoted Abdullah Ahmad Badawi as saying he did not need to step down because he still had strong support, especially from ruling party leaders.        
	I will not resign because there is no pressure, he said, adding he would be sworn in tomorrow at the national palace for a new five-year term.        
	Abdullah faced an uncertain future after shepherding the National Front to its worst performance in the general elections yesterday, when scores of senior coalition officials lost their seats in the federal and state legislatures.        
	 Earlier, former long-time leader Mahathir Mohamad called for Abdullahs resignation, saying he had apparently made the wrong choice when he handpicked Abdullah to succeed him in 2003.        
	My view is that he has destroyed the National Front coalition, Mahathir told reporters. Its shocking.... We have now a very weak government, and a weak government in a multiracial country will find great difficulty in running the country.        
	Abdullah kept away from the public eye following a brief news conference at which he confirmed the National Front had secured a simple majority in the 222-member parliament.        
	There was no cause for celebration. The National Front won only 140 seats  or 63 per cent of the constituencies  losing its two-thirds majority for the first time since 1969 and slumping from its 2004 landslide victory when it won 91 per cent of the seats.        
	Coalition leaders were huddled in meetings today to contemplate their next step, but they sought to show a united stance.        
	Deputy information minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said there is no doubt or question at all in the top ranks that Abdullah should continue to lead the coalition and the country.        
	The Prime Minister has a full mandate. He will appoint a new Cabinet, Ahmad Zahid said. There is no one person to blame for what happened. We all are taking the collective responsibility.        
	Dozens of National Front officials gathered at Abdullahs official residence in the administrative capital, Putrajaya, to express their support for the boss, said Abdullahs spokeswoman, Wan Esuriyanti Wan Ahmad.        
	Reporters camped outside Abdullahs house amid rumours that he would announce his resignation, but Wan Esuriyanti said he would be sworn in tomorrow as Prime Minister at the national palace.        
	Senior government lawmaker Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah said the National Front faced a period of uncertainty such as we have never experienced before.        
	This is a historic crisis, he said. To begin immediately the process of restoring ourselves, the leadership team must wake up from its slumber, face the truth and accept full responsibility for this debacle.        
	The result reflected a huge protest vote sparked by disillusionment among minority ethnic Chinese and Indians who have long complained about discrimination  particularly an affirmative action system that gives the majority Muslim Malays preference in jobs, business and education.         
	Ordinary Malaysians, including Malays, were upset over rising prices and crime.        
	A three-group Opposition alliance of the Peoples Justice Party, the Democratic Action Party and the Islamic Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party won 82 seats. The Opposition had 19 seats in the outgoing parliament.        
	Simultaneous ballots for 12 state legislatures culminated in the National Front losing control of the Assembly in northern Penang, the only state where ethnic Chinese are a majority. It also lost control of Selangor, Kedah and Perak states for the first time, and failed to wrest Kelantan state back from the Opposition.        
	This is a defining moment, unprecedented in our nations history, said Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. The people have voted decisively for a new era where the government must be truly inclusive and recognise that all Malaysians, regardless of race and colour, culture and religion, are a nation of one.

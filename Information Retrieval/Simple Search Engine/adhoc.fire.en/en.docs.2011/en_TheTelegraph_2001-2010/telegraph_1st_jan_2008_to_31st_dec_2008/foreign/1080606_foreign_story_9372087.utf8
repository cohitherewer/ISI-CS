	London, June 5: The embalmed body of Vladimir Lenin should be removed from the Red Square mausoleum and buried, Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, has said.         
	Gorbachev said the body of the founder of the first Communist state should be removed from the Red Square mausoleum, where it has been on permanent public display since the Bolshevik revolutionary died in 1924, against the wishes of his family.         
	Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the level of reverence for Lenin has fallen considerably and many argue that the ghosts of the Soviet Union should be put to rest and that Lenin, who was known by his patronymic, Ilych, should be given a proper burial.         
	My view is as follows  we should not be occupied right now with grave digging. But we will necessarily come to a time when the mausoleum will have lost its meaning and we will bury Ilych, give him up to the earth as his family had wanted, Gorbachev said. I think the time will come ... it will happen.        
	Boris Yeltsin, Russias first post-Soviet leader, repeatedly called for Lenins body to be moved from Red Square, but strong pro-Communist sentiment delayed the decision.         
	Vladimir Putin evaded the issue, saying the question was emotive, and his successor, Dmitry Medvedev, the current Russian President, has not yet made his position clear.         
	The fate of Lenin is an emotional question in Russia, where the Communists are the second largest political party.         
	The Russian Orthodox Church has called for Lenin to be buried but the Communist Party has blocked attempts to move his body, arguing that the tomb is a part of Russian history and should remain intact.         
	Gorbachev also called for the creation of a national museum and memorial to the millions of Russians killed or sent to prison under Josef Stalin, whose embalmed body lay beside Lenins for eight years, until 1961.

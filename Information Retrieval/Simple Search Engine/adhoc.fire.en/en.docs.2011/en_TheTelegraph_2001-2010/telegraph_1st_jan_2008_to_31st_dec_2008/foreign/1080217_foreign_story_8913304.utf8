The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Suicide raid on Pak poll office, 37 killed
                                                                                                               Suicide raid on Pak poll office, 37 killed
                                  
	Islamabad, Feb. 16 (Reuters): A suicide car bomb outside a Pakistani election candidates office killed 37 people in the violent northwest today, the last day of campaigning for an election meant to complete a transition to civilian rule.        
	Separately, police in the south of the country said they had foiled another attack planned for polling day on Monday.        
	Campaigning for the elections to a new parliament and provincial Assemblies has been overshadowed by security fears, especially since former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed in a gun and suicide bomb attack on December 27.         
	Opposition politicians have also complained of vote rigging.        
	The poll could spell trouble for President Pervez Musharraf, a key US ally who stepped down as army chief in November, if voters elect a parliament hostile to him.        
	Voting was postponed from January 8 after Bhuttos assassination, which raised fears about the nuclear-armed countrys stability.        
	Todays bomb attack took place in the town of Parachinar in the Kurram region on the Afghan border which has seen bloody sectarian clashes between majority Sunni militants and minority Shias in recent months.        
	Supporters of a candidate backed by Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were going into his office after a rally.        
	The car was full of explosives and it was rammed into the crowd as they were entering my office, the candidate, Riaz Hussain Shah, said. He said he was not there at the time.        
	Interior ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema said 37 people were killed and more than 90 wounded in the blast, which was caused by a suicide car bomber.        
	In another attack in the northwest, several people, some of them soldiers, were wounded in a suspected suicide attack in the Swat valley, a district official said.        
	The northwest has been hit by a surge of violence since July and while some have taken place in all major cities there are fears of more.        
	Police in the southern city of Hyderabad said they had arrested three suspected suicide bombers believed to be planning attacks on polling stations and seized 10 kg of explosives and a suicide bomb jacket.        
	The violence, in what has been one of the countrys bloodiest election campaigns, has unnerved politicians and voters, and turnout on Monday could be low despite the deployment of more than 80,000 troops.        
	Pakistanis are also concerned about rising prices and shortages of basic commodities such as flour, and ever more frequent power cuts. Many are disillusioned with politicians.         
	Campaigning ends at midnight. Tomorrow is a cooling-off day.        
	The elections follow months of political turmoil over the increasingly unpopular Musharrafs efforts to stay in power. The PPP is expected to reap a sympathy vote.        
	But with none of the main parties  the PPP, the Pakistan Muslim League that backs Musharraf, and the party of another former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif  expected to secure a majority, a coalition between two of the three is likely.

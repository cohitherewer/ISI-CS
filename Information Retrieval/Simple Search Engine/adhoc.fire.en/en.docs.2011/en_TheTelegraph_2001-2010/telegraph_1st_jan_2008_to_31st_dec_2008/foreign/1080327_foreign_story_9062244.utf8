The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Whats in a name? Ask Ann, George
                                                                                                               Whats in a name? Ask Ann, George
          LAURA CLOUT                                          
	London, March 26: If you are called George or Ann and are having a problem finding love, you could only have your parents to blame.         
	An academic study suggests that we make a host of assumptions about the bearers of some first names, before we have even met the people in question.         
	With the actors George Clooney and Anne Hathaway as notable exceptions perhaps, those called George or Ann are most often assumed to be unattractive.         
	The study found that the snap judgements we make about the lifestyle and character of others based on their names, also extends to how lucky and successful we assume them to be.         
	Those called James and Elizabeth for example, are assumed to be successful, while Jack and Lucy are thought to be lucky.        
	Sophie and Ryan are thought particularly attractive.         
	Richard Wiseman, a psychologist from the University of Hertfordshire, asked 6,500 volunteers to imagine they were about to meet a group of men and women.         
	They were then given a list of 20 male and 20 female names and asked to choose those they anticipated would be the most successful, attractive and lucky.        
	Professor Wiseman said we may subconsciously associate names with the titles of the rich and famous.         
	The models Sophie Dahl and Sophie Anderton and actress Rachel Weisz are both renowned for their looks, while Dragons Den millionaire James Caan is famous for his wealth.         
	Earlier studies have suggested that such associations can become self-fulfilling prophecies, as those with the most attractive names are awarded higher marks in school and promoted more quickly at work.         
	The professor advised parents to play it safe when naming their children.         
	Traditional names with royal associations are viewed as successful and intelligent, and so parents hoping for successful offspring might want to avoid more unusual names, he said.         
	Attractive female names tended to be soft-sounding and end with the ee sound, whereas the sexiest male names are short and much harder sounding.

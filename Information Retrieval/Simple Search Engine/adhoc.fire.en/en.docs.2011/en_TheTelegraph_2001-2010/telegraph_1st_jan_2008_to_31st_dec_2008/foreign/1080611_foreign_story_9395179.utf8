The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gyanendra to vacate palace today
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Gyanendra to vacate palace today
          
	Kathmandu, June 10 (Reuters): Nepals ousted King Gyanendra will leave his official palace and move to one of his former residences tomorrow, an aide said, two weeks after the abolition of the monarchy.        
	The Constituent Assembly elected in April ended the 239-year-old Hindu monarchy last month, turning the Himalayan nation into a republic. The Assembly gave Gyanendra until Thursday to vacate the sprawling Narayanhiti royal palace in Kathmandu which will be turned into a museum.        
	He will move out of the palace tomorrow and most likely hold a news conference before leaving, said Phaniraj Pathak, his press secretary. The exact time for the news conference and when he will leave the palace are yet to be finalised.        
	The Nepali government will allow Gyanendra to live in the state-owned Nagarjun palace, 8km northwest of Kathmandu, until he arranges a private home.         
	It used to be his summer palace before the government took over ownership last year.        
	His son Paras lives in his old private home where Gyanendra used to stay before ascending the throne in 2001.

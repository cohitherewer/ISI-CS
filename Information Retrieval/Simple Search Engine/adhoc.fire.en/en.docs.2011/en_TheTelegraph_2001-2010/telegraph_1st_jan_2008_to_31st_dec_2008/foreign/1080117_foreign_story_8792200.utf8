	London, Jan. 16: An article in the Vaticans official newspaper has condemned J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter books for posing a danger to children by promoting witchcraft and the occult.
    
	In a damning indictment of the bestselling books, among the most successful in publishing history, the Vaticans official newspaper LOsservatore Romano, has called the teenage boy wizard the wrong kind of hero. 
    
	Under the headline The double face of Harry Potter, the lengthy article concludes: Despite the values that we come across in the narration, at the base of this story, witchcraft is proposed as a positive ideal. The violent manipulation of things and people comes thanks to knowledge of the occult. 
    
	The ends justify the means because the knowledgeable, the chosen ones, the intellectuals know how to control the dark powers and turn them into good. 
    
	This a grave and deep lie, the article says.

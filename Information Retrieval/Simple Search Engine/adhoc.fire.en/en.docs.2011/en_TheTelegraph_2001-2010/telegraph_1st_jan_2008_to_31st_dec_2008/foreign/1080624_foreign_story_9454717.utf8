The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Carla admits she has problems with Sarkos politics
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Carla admits she has problems with Sarkos politics
          HENRY SAMUEL                          Carla Bruni and Nicolas Sarkozy in Tel Aviv. (Reuters)                                  
	Paris, June 23: French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has admitted being instinctively Left wing and having a problem with conservatives despite her husbands Right-wing politics, in a frank newspaper interview.         
	The Italian model turned singer expressed relief that Nicolas Sarkozy had toned down his bling-bling love of chunky watches and Ray-Ban sunglasses in favour of her more austere tastes.         
	She also said she organised dinners with artists to cultivate her husband, a television addict whose musical tastes stop at Elvis Presley and his French equivalent, Johnny Hallyday.         
	Perhaps I can help him to enable him to better communicate on the things that he loves, to give more room to culture, she said.         
	The 40-year-old said she was aware that her own record label wanted to put a sticker on her album cover reading: You can like Carla Bruni without liking her husband  apparently to distance the artist from her husband.         
	I can understand why they wanted to cut the grass from under the feet of this confusion, she told Left-wing daily newspaper Liberation in a lengthy interview.         
	My instinctive reflexes are Left wing... I am not joined at the hip with [my husbands] politics, she said. I get the impression that people who are completely one side or another only think with one part of their brain.         
	But despite their political differences, she added: If he ever stood for election again, I would still vote for him.         
	The woman who once famously declared her aversion to monogamy said she had enlisted the help of an adviser to help her avoid shocking conservative people, who came from a world that is completely alien to me.         
	[They] were deeply shocked by the arrival on the scene of a girl who is not French, not married, free to have been what she was, with a child, she said.         
	But my husband doesnt correspond to the idea I had of conservatives. He is not conservative at all. Nor does correspond to a large chunk of those people who make up his party.         
	Carla Bruni-Sarkozy also said that even though she had lived in France for 20 years, she had never wanted to be French, describing her husbands fellow countrymen as rather nostalgic, very literary and rather unmusical.         
	I just never particularly wanted to do adopt the nationality, she said.         
	She expressed relief that Sarkozy had toned down his showy tastes after aides warned him it was putting off voters.         
	I have quite austere taste, and he is more sober now. This is important for someone in his position, she said. She added that she wanted to follow the First Lady tradition of doing charitable work, and ruled out giving pop concerts while her husband is still in power due to security concerns.         
	I cant go on stage because I cant allow myself to drag along a security set-up that, in my opinion, would be shocking, she said.         
	Sarkozy, 53, married his wife in February following a whirlwind romance.         
	The huge media coverage of their relationship is said to be partly responsible for a sharp fall in the opinion polls that lead to Sarkozy becoming the most unpopular French post-war leader a year into his presidency.         
	But he appears to be enjoying a slow recovery.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

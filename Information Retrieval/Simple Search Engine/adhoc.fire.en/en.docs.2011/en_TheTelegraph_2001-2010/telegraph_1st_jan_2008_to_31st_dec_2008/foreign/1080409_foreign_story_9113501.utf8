	Islamabad, April 8 (Reuters): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf will travel to China on Thursday, his first trip abroad since a new government packed with his opponents was sworn in late last month.        
	Musharraf, who came to power as a general following a coup in 1999, is politically isolated since the defeat of his allies in the February 18 polls.        
	Musharraf is due to meet President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and other Chinese state leaders during his visit from April 10 to 15 to discuss bilateral, regional and international issues, foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Sadiq said.        
	The Presidents visit will reinforce the all-weather, time-tested friendship between the two countries. Agreements in economic areas are also likely to be signed, he said today.        
	The longstanding friendship with China is often contrasted with the on-off relationship Pakistani governments have experienced with the US. One of the principal drivers in the relationship between Islamic Pakistan and communist China is mutual desire for a counterweight against India.        
	Yesterday, a Shanghai shipyard launched the first of four F-22P frigates to be delivered to Pakistan. The fourth and last vessel will be completed at a Karachi shipyard in 2013.        
	The Pakistan Air Force has inducted into its fleet the JF-17 Thunder fighter jets produced with Chinas help. China has also helped Pakistan build civil nuclear plants.

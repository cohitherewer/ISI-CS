The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cuba lifts ban on home computers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cuba lifts ban on home computers

	Havana, May 3 (Reuters): The future arrived at Pedro Fresnedos home yesterday, and it gave him goosebumps.        
	He held out his arm to show visitors the bumps rising from his skin after his 13-year-old daughter Amanda turned on the computer they had just purchased on the first day Cubans could buy them.        
	This is the world for the young, the smiling Fresnedo said.         
	Cuba began selling computers to private citizens yesterday as part of reforms by new leader Raul Castro since he was elected President by the National Assembly in February, replacing his ailing elder brother Fidel Castro.        
	Last month, Cubans lined up outside stores to buy cell phones and DVD players that were finally available in the communist nation.        
	At more than $700, the Chinese-made Q-Tech computers put on sale yesterday were out of reach financially for most Cubans. But those who showed up were enthusiastic about being able to get a computer.         
	I think its good that the government has started this process legally. If we want a better country, we have to let people have the resources to develop professionally, said Elizabeth Reyes as she looked over the new merchandise.

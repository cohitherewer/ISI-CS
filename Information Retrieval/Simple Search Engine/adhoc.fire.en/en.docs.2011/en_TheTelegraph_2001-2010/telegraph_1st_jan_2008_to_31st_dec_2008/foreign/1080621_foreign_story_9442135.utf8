                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obama sorry to women barred over scarf
                              Reaching out                            
	Chicago, June 20 (Reuters): US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama apologised yesterday to two Muslim women who were barred from sitting behind the podium where Obama was speaking because they were wearing Islamic headscarves.        
	At a campaign rally in Detroit on Monday, Shimaa Abdelfadeel and Hebba Aref were prevented by volunteers from taking seats behind Obama that would have been in view of television cameras, apparently because of their headscarves.        
	I reached out to Aref and Abdelfadeel this afternoon, Obama said.I spoke with Abdelfadeel, and expressed my deepest apologies for the incident that occurred with volunteers at the event in Detroit.        
	Obama said the volunteers actions were unacceptable and in no way reflect any policy of my campaign.        
	I take deepest offence to teh action and will continue to fight against discrimination against people of any religious group or background, he said. Obama said Abdelfadeel had accepted his apology and he hoped that Aref would as well.        
	The Detroit Free Press reported that Obama had left a phone message for Aref.        
	Obama, who is a Christian, has faced false rumours that he is a Muslim.           
	Hillary to campaign  
	Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will join Obama on the campaign trail next week for the first time since Obama emerged as the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 3.        
	Obama, an Illinois senator, has been intent on trying to unify the party ahead of the November election after a bitter, 16-month struggle between the candidates to become the Democratic standard-bearer.        
	Obama and Clinton will appear together tomorrow, but the Obama campaign gave no details about the event.        
	Earlier this week, Obama included several high-profile supporters of Clinton, such as former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and retired General Wesley Clark in meetings to advise him on national security.        
	Clinton, a New York senator and former First Lady, saw her hopes of becoming the first woman President slip away after she entered the race last year with an aura of inevitability. Obama, who faces presumptive Republican nominee John McCain, would be the first Black US President if elected.

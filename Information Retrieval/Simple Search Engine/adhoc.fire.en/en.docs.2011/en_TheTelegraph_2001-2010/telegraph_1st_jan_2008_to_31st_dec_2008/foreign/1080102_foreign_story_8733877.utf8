The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lockheed bags Pak deal
                                                                                                            Lockheed bags Pak deal
                            
	Washington, Jan. 1 (Reuters): Lockheed Martin Corp was awarded a $498.2 million contract to supply F-16 aircraft to Pakistan, the Pentagon said yesterday.        
	Lockheed will sell 12 F-16C plus 6 F-16D planes to Pakistan under the contract, the Pentagon said in its daily list of defence contract awards. The US defence department, which oversees sales of military weapons to foreign governments, did not say how soon the fighter jets would be delivered.        
	Pakistan has received about $10 billion in US funding since 2001 because Washington views Pakistan as a key ally in President Bushs campaign against terrorism.

                              Dr Michael DeBakey                            
	Houston, July 12 (AP): Dr Michael DeBakey, the world-famous cardiovascular surgeon who pioneered such procedures as bypass surgery and invented a host of devices to help heart patients, has died. He was 99.        
	DeBakey died last night at The Methodist Hospital in Houston from natural causes, according to a statement issued early today by Baylor College of Medicine and The Methodist Hospital.        
	DeBakey counted world leaders among his patients and helped turn Baylor from a provincial school into one of the Americas great medical institutions.        
	Dr DeBakeys reputation brought many people into this institution, and he treated them all: heads of state, entertainers, businessmen and presidents, as well as people with no titles and no means, said Ron Girotto, president of The Methodist Hospital System.         
	While still in medical school in 1932, he invented the roller pump, which became the major component of the heart-lung machine, beginning the era of open-heart surgery. The machine takes over the function of the heart and lungs during surgery. It was only a start of a lifetime of innovation.         
	The surgical procedures that DeBakey developed once were the wonders of the medical world. Today, they are commonplace procedures in most hospitals. He also was a pioneer in the effort to develop artificial hearts and heart pumps to assist patients waiting for transplants, and helped create more than 70 surgical instruments.        
	In early 2006, DeBakey underwent surgery for a damaged aorta  a procedure he had developed.        
	In a rare interview published later that year, DeBakey gave The New York Times details of the operation, performed when he was 97. It is a miracle, DeBakey said. I really should not be here.         
	He said he at first gambled that his aorta would heal on its own and refused to be admitted to a hospital, and was unresponsive and near death when his doctors and his wife decided to proceed, despite his age. He then spent several months in the hospital.         
	As he recovered, DeBakey told his doctors he was glad they had operated, despite his earlier refusals. If they hadnt done it, Id be dead, he said.        
	A tireless worker and a stern taskmaster, DeBakey literally had scores of patients under his care at any one time, helping to establish his name as a leading cardiovascular surgeon. He performed more than 60,000 heart surgeries during his 70 year career, The Methodist Hospital said. Man was born to work hard, he said.        
	His patients ranged from penniless peasants from the Third World to such famous figures as the Duke of Windsor, the Shah of Iran, King Hussein of Jordan, Turkish President Turgut Ozal, Nicaraguan Leader Violetta Chamorro and Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon.        
	But he said celebrities dont get special treatment on the operating table: Once you incise the skin, you find that they are all very similar.

          DAVID BYERS                              
	London, Nov. 19: For some, the credit crisis now has much less of a crunch.         
	Amid soaring debt and house repossessions, US pawn shops have reported a wave of people handing over their gold and diamond dentures. The pair, now at the State Pawners and Jewellers in Chicago, Illinois, were said to have belonged to an owner desperate to pay $1,500 for his daughters college fees.         
	Scott Cohen, the store owner, said that the unnamed man who pawned them had paid $15,000 for the dentures  inlaid with seven carats of diamonds and three rubies  when new.         
	Cohen initially admitted he was kind of grossed out and kind of shocked when the seller pulled them out of his mouth  but he was quickly moved by the story, and agreed to give him the 90-day loan that he desperately needed. It was the most touching thing Id ever seen, he told the Chicago Sun-Times.         
	The tale appears to be far from an isolated incident, as people in the US  which has by far the largest number of pawn shops in the world  find ever more ingenius ways of raising cash to meet their financial obligations with recession biting.         
	Earlier this year, Orlando news website Local6.com reported what it said was a dental gold rush at pawn shops across Florida. People are really cashing in. If a dentist passes away, their kids come in with a big pile of gold teeth, said Scott Taber, owner of Taber Coins, a coin dealer, said.         
	He said a rapidly rising number of people were handing over gold teeth in pawn shops. People are digging up the gold and starting to sell it, he said. Pawn shops outside the US also appear to be experiencing a similar boom. Moscows stores have reported roaring business with Vadim Karashuk, the head of Moscows 16 state-owned pawn shops, estimating that they collectively loan around $200,000 a day.

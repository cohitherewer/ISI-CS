                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nepal cuts fees for climbing mountains
                            
	Kathmandu, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Nepal has cut climbing fees for its mountains, including Mount Everest, to attract climbers during the off-season and revive tourism that was hit by a deadly Maoist civil war and political unrest, officials said today.        
	Hundreds of foreign climbers each paying from $500 to scale a small peak to $25,000 for Mount Everest, the worlds tallest at 8,850 metres, flock to Nepals Himalayas every year during the popular March-to-May spring climbing season.        
	Many of the 326 peaks opened to climbers are deserted during the rest of the year.        
	Tourism ministry official Tilak Ram Pandey said the government had halved climbing fees for all mountain peaks for the autumn season, which runs from September to November.        
	Climbers in the winter season (December-February) and the June-August summer period need to pay only 25 per cent of the normal fees, he said.        
	The new rates, which have already become effective from July 16, are aimed at attracting more climbers to all mountains, including Mount Everest, even during the off-season, Pandey said today.        
	Climbers generally prefer the spring because they get more daylight and warmer weather.        
	No climbing fees will be charged for five years for mountaineers wanting to climb any peak located in the countrys remote and least developed far western region, said another official, Krishna Gnawali.

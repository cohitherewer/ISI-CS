	Jerusalem, July 31 (Reuters): West Asia peacemaking was in turmoil today after Ehud Olmert, dogged by corruption probes, said he would resign as Prime Minister after his party picks a new leader in September.        
	Israeli politicians and analysts said Olmerts surprise announcement could force an early national election which opinion polls show could be won by rightist leader, Benjamin Netanyahu.        
	I have decided I wont run in the Kadima movement primaries, nor do I intend to intervene in the elections, Olmert said, referring to his ruling centrist party, from Jerusalem. Olmert faced weeks of public pressure to resign over suspicions that he took bribes from an American businessman.

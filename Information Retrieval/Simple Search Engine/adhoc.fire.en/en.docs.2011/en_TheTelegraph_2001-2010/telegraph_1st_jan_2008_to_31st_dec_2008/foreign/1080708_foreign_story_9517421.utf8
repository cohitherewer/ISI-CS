                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Quiet birthday for Gyanendra

	Kathmandu, July 7: Hundreds of royalists gathered at the gates of the residence of Gyanendra, Nepals ousted king, today to celebrate his 61st birthday.         
	However, Gyanendra himself decided against greeting his well-wishers and preferred to celebrate his first birthday as a commoner with his grandchildren and close relatives in the confines of his new home on the outskirts of Kathmandu.         
	The former king, who lost his kingdom on May 28th after the 601-member Constituent Assembly declared Nepal a republic, had asked his loyal supporters not to celebrate his birthday with pomp and show. However, despite the instructions nearly 500 people arrived at the Nagarjuna Palace to wish the deposed monarch.         
	The supporters were asked to sign in the guest book kept at the palace gates. Several members of the royalist cabinet headed by Gyanendra, including Kamal Thapa and Durga Shrestha, were among those who arrived at the forest palace to greet Gyanendra.         
	Conspicuous by his absence was Gyanendras only son and former crown prince, Paras, who is currently in Singapore choosing a school for his three children who were present at the palace along with their mother Himani.         
	Sources said Gyanendra spent most of the day with his grandchildren and later had lunch with his family.

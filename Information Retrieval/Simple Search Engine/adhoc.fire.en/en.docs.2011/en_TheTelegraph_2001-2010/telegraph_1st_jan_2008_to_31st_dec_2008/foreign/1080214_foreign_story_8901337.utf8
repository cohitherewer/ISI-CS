The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bruni public apology for Nazi slur
                                                                                                               Bruni public apology for Nazi slur
                            
	Paris, Feb. 13 (AFP): Frances new First Lady Carla Bruni was forced to issue a public apology today after she compared a magazine that attacked President Sarkozy to the wartime pro-Nazi press.        
	In her debut interview published today, Bruni rounded on the Nouvel Observateur for an online article reporting that the President text-messaged his ex-wife offering to call off his wedding to Bruni.        
	 The Nouvel Observateur has joined the ranks of the gossip press. If this kind of site had existed during the war, what would have happened with the denunciation of the Jews? Bruni said in the interview with LExpress magazine.        
	Following a complaint from the Nouvel Observateur  which is being sued by Sarkozy, but insists its stands by its story  LExpress printed an apology from the First Lady on its website.        
	I wrongly compared the methods used by websites to those of the collaborationist press. If I offended anyone, I am extremely sorry, Bruni said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak politics makes a richer, secular fashion statement 
                                                                                                               Pak politics makes a richer, secular fashion statement 
                            
	Islamabad, March 19 (AP): Gold-trimmed SUVs idle outside the parliament. Among new female lawmakers, veils are out and Gucci bags are in.        
	Civilian rule has returned to Pakistan, and its politicians have come back with bling.        
	Last months elections ushered into the parliament a new crop of business leaders and wealthy elite opposed to US-backed President Pervez Musharrafs one-man rule.        
	The new body is headed by followers of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto  secularists who have vowed to fight Islamic extremism.        
	Many are also veterans of a series of civilian governments that nearly bankrupted the country in the 1990s.        
	Eight years after Musharraf took over in a military coup, theyre back in power, accessories and all.        
	Its their cars, their fashion. They have all the latest models, said Sana Asad, a Pakistani journalist covering the parliament. Theyre richer and more secular.        
	Perhaps its because theyre connected to the previous administrations  the wealthy elite, she said, sunning herself outside the parliaments housing complex today.        
	The parliaments parking lot was crowded with new sports utility vehicles festooned with flashy tire rims and hood ornaments. Women in bright colours clogged past in heels and huge sunglasses. Bodyguards fanned out.        
	The February 18 elections saw a hardline coalition of religious groups lose control of the countrys northwest along the Afghan border. Also, many conservative-minded allies of Musharraf lost their seats.        
	In the last parliament, about a dozen female lawmakers from the religious alliance wore body-shrouding black veils that concealed everything except their eyes.        
	But as the parliament elected its first female Speaker today, just a single lawmaker  one of 74 women in the 342-seat house  covered her face with a light beige wrap.

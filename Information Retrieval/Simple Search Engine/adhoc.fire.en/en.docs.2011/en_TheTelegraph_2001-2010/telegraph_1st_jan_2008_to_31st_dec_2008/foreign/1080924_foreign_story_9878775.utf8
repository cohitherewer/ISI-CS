The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Data show big dip in migration to US

	Washington, Sept. 23: The number of immigrants coming to the US slowed substantially in 2007, with the nations foreign-born population growing by only 511,000, compared with about a million a year since 2000, according to Census figures released today.        
	In 14 states, the foreign-born population declined, including in such traditional immigrant gateways as New Jersey and Illinois and such newer destinations as Nebraska, South Dakota and Kansas.        
	The Washington areas immigrant population continued to grow, but much more slowly, increasing by 25,916, compared with average yearly increases of 37,091 since 2000.        
	Demographers said the data, which were part of a diverse release of social, economic and housing characteristics, reflected the economic slowdown.        
	I think this shows that immigrants are keeping an eye on the economy when they make their decision on whether to come or where to live in the US, said William H. Frey, a researcher with the Brookings Institution who analysed the numbers. When the economy appears to be in decline  particularly for the kind of construction, retail and service jobs that immigrants are inclined to take  they are less attracted to us.        
	Although the slowdown coincided with a step-up in federal enforcement actions against illegal immigrants and their employers, Frey cautioned against drawing too close a connection. He noted that the influx of Asian and African immigrants slowed by more than 60 per cent, compared with 36 per cent for Hispanic immigrants, who are statistically more likely to be in the country illegally.        
	Even with the slowdown, the number of foreign-born people in the US reached a high of 38.1 million in 2007, accounting for 12.6 per cent of the population.        
	The Census data also offered some unexpected insight into the driving habits of US residents. Despite rising fuel prices, growing concern about global warming and a proliferation of carpool-only lanes, the percentage of US workers who drove to their jobs on their own remained at 76 per cent from 2000 to 2007.

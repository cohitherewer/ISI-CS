The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mars, Venus similar
                                                                                                               Mars, Venus similar
                            
	London, March 7 (PTI): Planetary scientists claim to have discovered that inner planets Mars and Venus are surprisingly similar, despite their differences in size as well as distance from the Sun.        
	The scientists have found that both the planets possess beams of electrically-charged particles flowing out of their atmospheres which are being accelerated away by interactions with the solar wind.         
	Venuss atmosphere is thick and dense, whereas that of Mars is light and tenuous. Bu, the structure of the magnetic fields of both the planets are similar.         
	This is because the density of the ionosphere at 250 km altitude is surprisingly similar, lead scientist Tielong Zhang said.

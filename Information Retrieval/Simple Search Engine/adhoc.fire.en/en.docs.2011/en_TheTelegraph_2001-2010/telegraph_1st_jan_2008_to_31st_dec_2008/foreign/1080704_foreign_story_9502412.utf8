                              Dangerous designs                            
	London, July 3: Two retired Turkish generals have been arrested as part of an investigation into a plot to murder Orhan Pamuk, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist.         
	Sener Eruygur, the former chief of military police, and Hursit Tolon, once a senior army official, were arrested in the capital Ankara, along with 23 others.         
	Senior former military figures have already been arrested and charged with provoking armed rebellion against the government.         
	Prosecutors allege that a plan existed to assassinate Kurdish politicians, intellectuals and senior military figures. The plan was designed to destabilise Turkey, leading to military intervention to restore order.         
	Orhan Pamuk, a bestselling author in Turkey and abroad, became his countrys first Nobel Prize winner for literature in 2006. But he was charged in 2005 and later cleared of insulting Turkey under nationalist laws which limit freedom of speech. He now spends most of his time in the US.         
	The military wields considerable political power in Turkey and has a long history of attempting to manipulate and shape the countrys internal politics.         
	Eruygur is believed to have been involved in two attempts in 2004 to overthrow the government. The first included plans for military action, the second involved a plan to use the media to turn opinion against the government. Both failed.         
	Eruyger and Tolons arrests came as the ruling party, which has strong religious links, tried to fight court action aimed at shutting it down.         
	The court action, which has been brought by the countrys top prosecutor, claims that Turkeys ruling party is attempting to establish an Islamic state, against Turkeys secular foundations.         
	If the case results in the party of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan being banned, it would lead to an early election and political turmoil in the country.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Moses barrier to save Venice from an untamed sea
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Moses barrier to save Venice from an untamed sea

	Venice, Dec. 7: It sounds like something only a Bond villain could dream up: a fiendishly clever but astronomically expensive project to turn back the tide with giant steel gates bolted to the sea floor.         
	The Moses project, however, is reality, not fantasy, and its purpose is to solve the 1,000-year-old problem of how to safeguard the irreplaceable art and architecture of Venice, which appeared so under threat in last weeks acqua alta.        
	Art and architecture remained intact after Mondays floods, the fourth most severe rise in water levels since records began in 1872.        
	If Moses had been in operation on Monday, Venice would not have flooded, said Elena Zambardi, spokesperson for the Consorzio Venezia Nuova, a consortium of engineering firms which is building the Moses barrier. The project has been dogged by political feuding, environmental concerns and controversy over its exorbitant price tag: the equivalent of 3 billion, with estimated annual maintenance costs of 8 million.        
	Inaugurated by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in 2003, it was due to be completed by 2012 but is now expected to be operational in 2014.        
	It entails the construction of 78 giant steel gates across the three inlets through which water from the Adriatic surges into Venices lagoon. The 300-tonne hinged panels, 92ft wide and 65ft high, will be fixed to massive concrete bases dug into the sea bed. They will be raised whenever a dangerously high tide is predicted. Compressed air will be pumped into the hollow panels, forcing them to rise up on their hinges, forming a barrier to the incoming waves.        
	Navigation locks will allow large vessels, including tankers and cruise ships, to pass in and out of the lagoon unimpeded.        
	Moses  Mose in Italian  is both an allusion to the Old Testament story of how Moses parted the waves of the Red Sea during the Israelite exodus from Egypt and a neat acronym for the projects name, Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico.        
	With this scheme, we will save Venice, said Zambardi, from her frescoed office in a 14th-century palazzo a few steps from the Grand Canal.         
	The underwater gates are part of a grand scheme which includes strengthening the 28-mile long, crescent-shaped sliver of land that protects Venices lagoon from the choppy waters of the Adriatic.        
	Some Venetians are sceptical that Moses will guarantee them a future without gumboots and the constant threat of their homes and businesses being swamped.        
	The intention is good but I dont think it will work. You cant tame the sea. And its far too expensive, said Maria, a manager in a bustling caf at the foot of Venices most famous bridge, the Rialto.        
	It is not just rising sea levels with which Venice has to contend. The city is sinking as a result of subsidence caused by decades of groundwater extraction for agriculture and industry on the mainland, and offshore drilling for methane gas. This combination means that Venice has effectively sunk 23cm in the last century.

                              General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani                            
	CIA analysts believe not only that the bombing of Indias embassy in Kabul in July by militants was aided by ISI operatives, but also that the highest levels of Pakistans security apparatus  including army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani  had knowledge of the plot.        
	Its very difficult to imagine he was not aware, a senior American official said of Kayani. American intelligence agencies have said that senior Pakistani national security officials favour the use of militant groups to preserve Pakistans influence in the region, as a hedge against India and Afghanistan.        
	 In fact, some American analysts believe that ISI operatives did not mind when their role in the July bombing in Kabul became known.

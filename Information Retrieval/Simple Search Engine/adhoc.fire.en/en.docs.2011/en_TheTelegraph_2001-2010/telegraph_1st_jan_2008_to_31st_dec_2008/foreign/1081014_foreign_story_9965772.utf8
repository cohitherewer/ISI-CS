	Wedding faux pas    
	 Beijing (Reuters): Some 170 wedding banquet guests were rushed to hospital in north China when powdered rust remover was added to the pot instead of salt after they all decided it needed added flavour. The brides proud father invited 170 friends and relatives to the wedding banquet at a village in northern Hebei province recently, the night before the nuptials, the Beijing News daily said. All food was stewed in a big pot but after dinner started, all of them felt the taste was too bland, the newspaper said. An hour later, the guests were being rushed to hospital. When I arrived at the hospital, the observation room was packed with people vomiting, with stomach pains and diarrhoea, a doctor was quoted as saying. All the victims were released by the next day.

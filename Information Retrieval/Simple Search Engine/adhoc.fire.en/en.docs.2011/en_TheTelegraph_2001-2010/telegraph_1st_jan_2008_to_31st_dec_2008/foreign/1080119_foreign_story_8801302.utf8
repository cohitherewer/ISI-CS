	Sanaa, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Gunmen opened fire on a group of tourists in Yemen today, killing two Belgian women and their two Yemeni drivers and wounding two people, officials said.
    
	The attack came less than a week after al Qaidas wing in Yemen vowed to carry out unspecified operations to win the release of jailed Islamic militants.
    
	There were apparently four terrorists who ambushed two tourist vehicles, Taha Hajer, governor of the eastern Hadramout province, said. The search for the attackers is intensifying and checkpoints have been set up throughout the province.
    
	Helicopters joined the hunt for the unidentified gunmen, a security official said.
    
	The 15-member tour group were being flown to the capital Sanaa after the attack, in which a Belgian tourist and a Yemeni were also wounded, Hajer said.
    
	In July, a suicide bombing killed seven Spanish tourists and wounded six at the Queen of Sheba Temple, built around the 10th century BC. Two Yemenis were also killed.
    
	The ancestral home of al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, Yemen joined the US-led war on terrorism after al Qaidas September 11, 2001 attacks on US cities.
    
	It has experienced several militant attacks and kidnappings of tourists by disgruntled tribesmen, and is viewed in the West as a haven for Islamic militants.

	Stockholm, May 21 (Reuters): Swedish police today detained two men on suspicion of planning to sabotage a nuclear power station after one of them was discovered entering it with small amounts of a highly explosive material.        
	Two men who were taken in for questioning this morning have now been detained on suspicion of preparing for sabotage, said Kalmar County police spokesperson Sven-Erik Karlsson.        
	The police were alerted shortly before 8 am by the Oskarshamn nuclear power plant on the south-east coast of Sweden.        
	They told us a welder who was going to perform a job there had been stopped in a random security check. He had been carrying small amounts of the highly explosive material TATP, Karlsson said.        
	TATP, or triacetone triperoxide, is a high explosive which is extremely unstable, especially when subjected to heat, friction and shock.        
	The compound can be prepared in a home laboratory from easily available household chemicals. It has been used by suicide bombers in Israel and by Richard Reid, the thwarted British shoebomber who attempted to blow up a Transatlantic airliner in 2001.        
	The police did not initially treat the men as criminal suspects.        
	They were only being questioned in order to gather information, Karlsson said, adding he had no details on the ages or nationalities of the two.        
	The police sealed off a 300-metre area around the substance and called in explosives technicians from Malmo, the nearest large city.        
	Oskarshamn, jointly owned by Germanys E.ON and Finlands Fortum, said in a statement on its website that it believed the reactors safety was never threatened.        
	An E.ON spokesperson said the material had been found on or inside the mans bag. What has happened is that a guy, a contractor, this morning came to the security check with a bag on which, or in which, there were traces of explosives, E.ON spokesperson Johan Aspegren said.        
	An official at the plant said neither of the two detained men was an employee there. They had been at one of the plants three reactors, which had been shut for maintenance.        
	Professor Hans Michels, an explosives expert at Imperial College London, said TATP was mainly used as an initiator or trigger explosive to detonate a larger main charge.

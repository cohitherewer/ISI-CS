	London, Feb. 5: Ten human embryos each containing the DNA from one man and two women have been created in a project that within three years could lead to the first genetically altered babies being born in Britain.        
	The form of gene transplant proposed in Newcastle will be bitterly opposed by pro-life campaigners but offers the first realistic hope of an effective treatment for an entire class of serious genetic diseases.         
	Prof. Doug Turnbulls team at the University of Newcastle hopes to combine IVF with cell surgery to wipe out diseases caused by the equivalent of faulty batteries in cells, called mitochondria, that affect one person in every 6,500 with a constellation of conditions, from fatal liver failure, stroke-like episodes, blindness, mental retardation with intractable epilepsy, muscle weakness, diabetes and deafness.         
	He has actually done the procedure in human cells and found it perfectly feasible, says Lord Walton of Detchant. And in mice the embryos developed perfectly normally after this procedure. The team presented preliminary work to the Medical Research Council Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, London, at the end of last week .        
	In 10 one-celled embryos they have carried out the transplants successfully and allowed them to develop for up to five days. A detailed analysis of one confirmed that the transplant had worked. And experiments with mice have shown that it is indeed possible to have offspring with new mitochondria, curing these serious diseases.        
	The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has only granted permission for these experiments but the team hopes that eventually the authority would license the use of the method in the clinic too.

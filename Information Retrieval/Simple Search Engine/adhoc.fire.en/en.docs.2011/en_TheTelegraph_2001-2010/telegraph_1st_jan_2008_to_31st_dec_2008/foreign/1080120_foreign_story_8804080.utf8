	Washington, Jan. 19: A top World Bank official who sought to make an example of corrupt India as the number one priority in her crusade against graft has resigned, five days after yet another of her reports on India made headlines across the world.
    
	The resignation of Suzanne Rich Folsom, a one-time Republican Party operative sent to the World Bank by the Americans to prepare the ground for the coming of Paul Wolfowitz as president, is a sign that turmoil at the Bank caused by Wolfowitzs excesses is anything but over.
    
	The turbulence at the Bank is continuing at a turning point in its history: this year Britain overtook the US as the biggest donor to the Bank for the first time in its 63-year existence.
    
	The change was only partly on account of the strength of the British pound and the decline of the US dollar. 
    
	It was one of many signs that Americas finances and its influence on the global stage are facing unprecedented challenges. Folsom, early on in her Wolfowitz-appointed position as head of institutional integrity unit, tried to browbeat India into surrendering to World Bank dictates and behave like the banana republics that are dependent of on the Banks largesse. When finance minister P. Chidambaram personally rebuffed her at a meeting in North Block, Wolfowitz suspended World Bank assistance to India until New Delhi agreed to her terms. 
    
	A compromise was later worked out that enabled the Bank to resume aid. Two of Folsoms top aides, Glenn Ware and Allison Brigati, have also resigned in the ongoing turbulence.
    
	Corruption in World Bank-funded projects in India has been well-known for decades and is not in dispute.
    
	What made it impossible for Folsom to continue in her job was the way she implemented her mandate, which would have made it impossible for the Bank to fund any development project anywhere in the Third World.
    
	Her messianic scrutiny, according to officials who have been repeatedly subject to it, made World Bank personnel, who were merely getting projects implemented, feel as if they were party to corruption in countries were projects were located. Sources said she also repeatedly exceeded her mandate. For instance, the World Banks actual participation in many projects in India that were investigated was minimal, with Indian governments contribution making up a bigger share.
    
	 And yet, her anti-corruption unit sought over-arching control and supervision over the way these projects were implemented.
    
	Officials in North Block felt Folsom was trying to make an example of India because exposing corruption in Chad or Papua New-Guinea would not have brought her much credit.
    
	But India, rising and shining makes headlines and it actually did. India took the view that the country was being unfairly targeted, far in excess of the corrective measures that were required.

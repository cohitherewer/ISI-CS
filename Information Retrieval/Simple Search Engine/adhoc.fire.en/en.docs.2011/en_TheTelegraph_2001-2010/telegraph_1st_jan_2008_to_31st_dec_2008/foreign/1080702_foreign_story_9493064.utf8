The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama vows not to question patriotism
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Obama vows not to question patriotism

	Washington, July 1 (AP): Democrat Barack Obama defended his own patriotism and vowed never to use the issue against anyone during the race for the White House, rejecting comments by a retired general and backer about the military record of his opponent, Republican John McCain.        
	Shortly after, the Obama campaign announced he and former President Bill Clinton had a terrific conversation by telephone, breaking an icy silence between two of Americas most gifted Democratic politicians.        
	Obama has been attacked for not wearing an American flag lapel pin and for allegedly failing to place his hand over his heart during the pledge of allegiance to the flag. He challenged his critics in a forceful speech in the aptly named city of Independence, Missouri, as he kicked off a campaign week that includes the July 4 US holiday celebrating independence from Britain.        
	Obama, baptised a Christian two decades ago, also has fought persistent Internet rumours that he is Muslim. I have found, for the first time, my patriotism challenged  at times as a result of my own carelessness, more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears about who I am and what I stand for, he said before a crowd of a few hundred people at the Truman Memorial Building in President Harry Trumans hometown.        
	Obama, who has vowed to change the tenor of American politics by rejecting negative campaigning, also sought to distance himself from remarks retired General Wesley Clark made regarding McCain during a weekend television interview.        
	Clark, who backed Hillary Rodham Clinton until she dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination, said on CBS television on Sunday that McCains military service and five-years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam did not necessarily qualify the four-term Arizona senator to be commander in chief. Clark, who sought the Democratic nomination four years ago, now backs Obama.        
	Clarks remarks set off a familiar pattern from earlier tussles over criticism: the candidates, Obama and McCain, took the high road while the harsh language was left to surrogates. Obama, without mentioning Clark by name, said that patriotism must, if it is to mean anything, involve the willingness to sacrifice.        
	For those like John McCain who have endured physical torment in service to our country  no further proof of such sacrifice is necessary, Obama said. And let me also add that no one should ever devalue that service, especially for the sake of a political campaign, and that goes for supporters on both sides.        
	McCain was asked about Clarks remarks during a news conference in Pennsylvania. I think that that kind of thing is unnecessary, McCain said. Im proud of my record of service, I have plenty of friends, leaders who will attest to that.        
	Separately, in a statement, Obama spokesman Bill Burton said: As hes said many times before, Senator Obama honours and respects Senator McCains service.        
	Obama, meanwhile, asked Bill Clinton to campaign for him when they had their first conversation since the heated Democratic primary contest was lost by the former Presidents wife.

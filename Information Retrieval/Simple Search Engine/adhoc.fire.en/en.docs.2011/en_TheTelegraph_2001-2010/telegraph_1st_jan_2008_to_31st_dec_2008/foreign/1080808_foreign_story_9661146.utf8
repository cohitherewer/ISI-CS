	Canberra, Aug. 7 (Reuters): An advertisement by an Australian brewer urging beer lovers to Forget the monarchy, support the publicans has angered supporters of Britains monarchy who say the ad is beyond the pale, forcing it to be pulled.        
	With the election victory last year of a pro-republican Centre-Left government stirring republican sentiment, monarchists had accused the South Australian beer company Coopers of attacking Australias constitutional monarchy.        
	It crossed a boundary, because it said Forget the Monarchy, and that is a political statement. Why not say forget the republicans? Australian Monarchists League national chairman Philip Benwell told Reuters today. Coopers appeared to have backed Prime Minister Kevin Rudds support for a constitutional shift cutting ties to Britains monarchy, replacing the Queen as the countrys head of state with a presidency, Benwell said.        
	Coopers withdrew billboards featuring the ad after complaints to Australias Electoral Commission and Advertising Standards Board by the League, whose website says it supports Australians protecting the Constitution. The brewer, established in 1862, is Australias last family owned brewery, and produces ales, stouts and lagers sold across the country.

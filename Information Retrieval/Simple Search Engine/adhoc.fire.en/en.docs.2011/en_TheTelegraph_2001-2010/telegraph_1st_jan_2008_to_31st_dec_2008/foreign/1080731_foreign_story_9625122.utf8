	London, July 30 (AP): Its a double- duet.        
	Alicia Keys and Jack White have recorded the theme song for the new James Bond film, Quantum of Solace, producers said today.        
	The R amp;B singer and White Stripes frontman have teamed up for Another Way to Die, the first duet to be chosen as a Bond theme. Producers said White has written and produced the song and also plays drums, as well as singing with 11-time Grammy winner Keys.        
	Previous Bond themes have been performed by the likes of Paul McCartney, Duran Duran and Madonna, and each new films tune always produces intense speculation.

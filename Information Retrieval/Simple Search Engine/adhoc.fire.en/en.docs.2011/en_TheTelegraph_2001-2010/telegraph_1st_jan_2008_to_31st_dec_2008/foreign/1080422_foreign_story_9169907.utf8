	Rome, April 21 (AP): An Aston Martin has been fished out of Italys Lake Garda after it plunged into the water while being driven to the set of the latest James Bond film.        
	Producers of Quantum of Solace say James Bonds iconic car was being delivered to the filming unit in heavy rain on Saturday morning when it went off the road and into the lake in northern Italy.        
	Italian state TV has shown footage of the smashed, black car being hoisted out of the water. Producers say the driver was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The newest film in the 007 series stars Daniel Craig.        
	Before James Bond became a screen icon, he was a paperback hero. A new exhibition of 007 book covers charts the changing image of the suave British spy.        
	Ranging from the 1950s to the present day and spanning the globe there are Bond books in English, German, Japanese, Greek, Hebrew and even an Italian comicbook version.

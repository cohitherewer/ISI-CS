	Ramallah, West Bank, May 4 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice today pressed Israel to ease travel restrictions on Palestinians and called Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank particularly problematic.        
	But she said Washington believed an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal was still possible before President George W. Bush leaves office in January, praising the seriousness and depth of negotiations.        
	We continue to believe it is an achievable goal to have an agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis by the end of the year and by the end of President Bushs term, Rice said after meeting Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah.        
	Negotiations on issues core to the Middle East conflict were launched at a US-hosted international conference in Annapolis, Maryland in November. Abbas voiced his continued commitment to peace efforts at a news conference with Rice.        
	But Israeli-Palestinian talks have been clouded by violence, primarily along the border of the Gaza Strip, which is now controlled by Abbass Islamist opponents, and by Israels expansion of settlements in the West Bank, which Palestinians fear will deny them a viable state.        
	At the news conference, Rice said the US regarded the settlements as particularly problematic to the atmosphere of trust that is needed.        
	Rice launched her latest two-day visit to the region yesterday by saying she would assess Israels steps on the ground to see if they had improved the daily lives of the Palestinians. These include the promised removal of West Bank roadblocks.        
	Rice said she had raised the question, with both Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and defence minister Ehud Barak, of whether those roadblocks that are to be scrapped would have a significant effect on easing movement by Palestinians.        
	After Rices last trip in late March, Israel said it planned to remove 61 barriers in the West Bank. But a UN survey subsequently found that only 44 obstacles had been scrapped and that most of these were of little or no significance.

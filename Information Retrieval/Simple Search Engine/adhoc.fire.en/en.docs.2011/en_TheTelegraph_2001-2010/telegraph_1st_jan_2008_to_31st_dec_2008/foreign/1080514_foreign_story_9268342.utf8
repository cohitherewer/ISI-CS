The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hillary poised for big win
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hillary poised for big win
                            
	Washington, May 13 (Reuters): Hillary Clinton appeared headed to a big West Virginia victory over front-runner Barack Obama in the Democratic presidential race today, although it could be too late to turn around her faltering White House bid.        
	Clinton has an advantage of at least 20 points in most opinion polls in West Virginia, a bastion of the white working-class voters who have become her strongest supporters in the gruelling battle for the Democratic nomination.        
	But Obama retains a nearly insurmountable advantage in delegates who will select the nominee at the party convention in August. A big win in West Virginia for the cash-strapped Clinton will make barely a dent in Obamas advantage.        
	Both candidates returned to their jobs in the US Senate this morning, where they exchanged a few words while voting for a measure aimed at lowering oil prices.         
	Record-high fuel prices have been a key issue in the campaign.

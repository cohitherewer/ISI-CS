	Islamabad, Aug 27: The Pakistan government today reinstated eight high court judges who were sacked by former President Pervez Musharraf last year.         
	Eight judges have been reinstated in the Sindh high court, officials told reporters in the port city of Karachi.         
	It comes after Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari adopted a conciliatory tone and apologised to Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief, while asking his party to rejoin the government.        
	Sharif pulled out of the ruling coalition on Monday, accusing Zardari of not keeping his promise of reinstating all the judges sacked by Musharraf during emergency rule last year.        
	Anwar Zahir Jamali was appointed the new chief justice of the Sindh high court. An official notification said the deposed judges of the other provincial high courts would be reinstated as well.        
	However, top lawyers, including Supreme Court Bar Association president Aitzaz Ahsan, called the reappointment a conspiracy to disrupt their campaign to reinstate all judges.         
	This included former chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, they said.         
	A dissapointed Ahsan said these judges should not have taken the oath.         
	A law ministry official said the reinstatement of the eight judges signalled the beginning of a process to restore all sacked members of the superior court.        
	Musharraf had fired at least 60 judges after they refused to take a fresh oath under the provisional constitutional order that he issued after the imposition of emergency in the country on November 3, 2007.         
	The former President, who stepped down amid a threat of impeachment, had issued an official order to reinstate the eight Sindh high court judges earlier this month.         
	However, it was aborted after the PML-N resisted the decision.

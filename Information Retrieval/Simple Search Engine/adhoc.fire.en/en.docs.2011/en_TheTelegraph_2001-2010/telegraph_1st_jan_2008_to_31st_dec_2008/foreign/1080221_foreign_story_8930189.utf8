The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Marilyn? No, its Madonna
                                                                                                               Marilyn? No, its Madonna
          TOM CHIVERS                              
	London, Feb. 20: Getting names and faces mixed up is always embarrassing, but when the people involved are two of the most famous women of all time it is especially hard to live down.         
	The BBC reports that an American couple and a purported Marilyn Monroe expert have been left red-faced after they mistook a nude picture of Madonna for one of the doomed 1950s starlet. The shot depicts a woman wearing nothing but high heels and a handbag, with a cigarette dangling from her mouth.         
	Lawrence Nicastro, 73, of Las Vegas, said that he found a poor-quality poster-sized photo in his home which he thought was a rare nude photo of Monroe. Believing it to have been left at his service station in 1962 in New York city by a customer, he brought in Monroe expert Chris Harris. Harris confirmed it as a genuine and rare find, and scheduled a news conference.         
	At a sneak preview for a few privileged journalists, however, it was quietly pointed out that far from being an exciting discovery of hitherto unpublished material, it was in fact a shot of pop diva Madonna from her 1992 book Sex, which sold millions of copies and is the most successful coffee table book ever.         
	Harris seems to be taking the incident in good humour. He still plans to hold the news conference to face the music.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gotcha! Indians for McCain
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gotcha! Indians for McCain
          AMIT ROY                          High above Times Square, New York, a sign urges Americans to vote. Telegraph picture                                  
	New York, Nov. 4: If Barack Obama does win, it will be no thanks to the BBC, which, supposedly in the interests of balance, has searched out more unfavourable stories about the Democratic presidential contender than was perhaps strictly necessary in the opinion of many commentators.        
	 For example, having reported that 95 per cent of black Americans were for Obama, the BBC went out of its way to find a handful who were for John McCain, his Republican rival. In the similar spirit of perverse journalism, The Telegraph went on the hunt in New York last night on election eve for Indians for McCain. The task was surprisingly easy.        
	 There are more than a few, declared an investment banker in New York who works for a world-famous but battered institution.        
	 He took The Telegraph to meet another Indian, a Bengali hedge funder who has an apartment (one of several he owns) on the 64th storey of his building with a panoramic sweep of Manhattan. Normally, I would vote for McCain, he admitted. Obama talks of redistributing wealth and somehow that does not sit easily with the American view of a free market economy.         
	 His friend piped in and said: Among Indians in America, especially in the financial sector, they have been pretty happy with the free market approach of the Republicans. Talk of redistributing wealth does not fit in with their philosophy.         
	The hedge funder said that Indians, being Indians, wanted to be on the winning side. But which was the winning side?        
	 If Obama won, as seemed likely, they felt they would be part of an historic movement though it may be not so good having to pay higher taxes. I am struggling with my conscience, said the Bengali.         
	Lets face it, this is a historic moment for America. I know the whole world wants Obama to win. And I want to be on the side of history. To tell you the truth, I havent made up my mind. Normally, I would have voted Republican.        
	 This conflict of emotions can henceforth be characterised as the Bengali Effect, much like the so-called Bradley Effect among whites. The latter phenomenon refers to the practice of telling pollsters that the respondent will vote for Obama because not to be seen to be a voting for a black candidate would be seen to be a politically incorrect action to take.         
	In the darkness and privacy of the booth, though, the said respondent would not be able to bring himself to vote for a black man.        
	The Bengali laid out his cards: Obama is not completely black  he is part white. And he is young, dynamic and handsome.         
	The hedge funder also referred to comments by McCain supporters  not entirely made in jest  that in the black areas of New York and other American cities, there would be riots if Obama did not win.        
	 It is also worth noting that the view of Right-wing commentators in Britain was , at first: You might think Obama is going to win but you dont know the real America. We do. New York, full of the liberal elite, isnt America. Its McCain who is going to win. Just wait and see.         
	More recently, its been: Obama may win but Americans will be sorry they elected him and didnt listen to what we said. We know whats best for America. Just wait and see.        
	 To be frank, there was not that much excitement on election-eve night in Times Square. But then the party hadnt started. And, to be sure, there were small mercies, Dev Anand was not there, for example, filming the sequel to Love In Times Square. Television production companies were setting up cameras for live broadcasts, a dozen or so photographers were milling around trying to catch the moment and the 4x4s and stretched limousines were still clogging up Broadway.        
	The giant television screens were flashing the results of the last-minute polls, while the electronic messaging systems, welcoming the world to Times Square, were reflecting the sombre mood as the hour of reckoning approached.        
	 High above Times Square, higher than the bright lights of the Broadway musicals and the ads, was an illuminated sign which urged all adult Americans to do their duty.        
	 It said: VOTE.

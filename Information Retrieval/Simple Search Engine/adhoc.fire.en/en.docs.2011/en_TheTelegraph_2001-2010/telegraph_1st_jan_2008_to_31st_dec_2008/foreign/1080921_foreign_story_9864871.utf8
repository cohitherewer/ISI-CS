	Islamabad, Sept. 20: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari today said he was ready to surrender his powers to dismiss the government and dissolve the parliament for the revival of democracy in the country.         
	This is the first time in Pakistans history that a President is giving away his powers to the parliament, he said amid cheering by MPs during his address to the House.         
	Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had said before the presidential elections that he was ready to accept Zardari as President if he relinquishes the power to dissolve parliament.        
	Zardari, who became co-chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party after the assassination of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December last year, was elected as Pakistans 12th President earlier this month days after his predecessor Pervez Musharraf resigned.         
	I call upon the parliament to form an all-party committee to re-visit the 17th constitutional amendment and Article-58 (2)(b) of the Constitution, Zardari said. He underscored the need to remove distortions made in the Constitution by successive dictators to prolong their rule.         
	The amendment conferred sweeping powers on the President to dissolve the parliament, dismiss the government, appoint armed forces chiefs, provincial governors and chief election commissioner. The controversial National Security Council, giving the armed forces, especially the army, a bigger role in national politics was also formed under the 17th amendment.         
	Musharraf had pushed the bill through parliament with the help of the Islamic alliance, Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), in December 2003 in return for a commitment to give up his role as army chief in December 2004. Later, Musharraf reneged on his promise.         
	The article that specifically deals with the presidential power to dismiss the 342-member lower house was first used by former military ruler Zia-ul-Haq in May 1988 just three months before his mysterious plane crash that killed him.         
	Former President Ghulam Ishaq Khan used the power to dismiss Benazir Bhuttos government in 1990.

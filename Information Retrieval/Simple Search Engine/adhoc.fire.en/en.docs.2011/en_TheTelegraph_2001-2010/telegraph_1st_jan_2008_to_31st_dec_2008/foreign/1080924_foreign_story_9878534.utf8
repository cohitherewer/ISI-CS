	Elton brooch    
	 London, Sept. 23: An art deco sapphire and diamond clip brooch once owned by Sir Elton John is expected to fetch over 12,000 at auction this week, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The bejewelled brooch, which was made around 1935, will be auctioned at Bonhams Sale of Fine Jewellery in Londons New Bond Street. It is designed in the form of the letter J and includes multiple old brilliant cut and baguette cut diamonds.       
	It also features five oval cut sapphires and a cluster of circular-cut sapphires. A photograph accompanying the brooch shows Sir Elton wearing it during the filming of the video for his 1988 song I Dont Wanna Go On With You Like That. The song was a modest hit in England, reaching number 30 in the charts, but fared much better in the USA, reaching Number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.       
	Sir Elton is famous for his love of bling and outlandish jewellery.

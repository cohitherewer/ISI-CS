The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Chelsea stars in family act II

          PHILIP SHERWELL                           Chelsea in Honolulu on Saturday. (AP)                                   
	Dayton, Ohio, Feb. 17: Chelsea Clinton has finally discovered her voice in public.         
	Previously a silent figure at her mothers side, the former and prospective First Daughter has hit the campaign trail solo in Hillary Clintons latest effort to counter Barack Obamas march towards the Democratic nomination.        
	Senator Clinton has already replaced her campaign manager and dipped in to $5 million of her own funds to replenish her near-empty war chest, as well as deploying her husband Bill as an attack dog  all, so far, to no avail as Obama triumphed in a series of recent primaries.        
	Facing two more possible defeats in Wisconsin and Hawaii on Tuesday, Clinton is now staking all on victories in Texas and Ohio on March 4 to keep her faltering campaign alive.         
	Daughter Chelsea has reluctantly abandoned her prized privacy to plunge into the fray after it became clear that Obama was sweeping the youth vote.        
	Chelsea, 27, who is on leave from her Manhattan hedge fund, is taking her fight to enemy heartlands  college campuses where Obama-mania is rife.        
	In a typical appearance last week, she demonstrated a near-encyclopaedic grasp of her mothers policies during a 90-minute question-and-answer session with hundreds of students at Sinclair Community College in Dayton, Ohio.         
	The attractive and assured young woman is a far cry from the gawky and awkward 11-year-old with frizzy hair and braces who first blinked in the flashlights when her father began his presidential bid 16 years ago.        
	Dressed in a student-style outfit of jeans and an oversized red sweatshirt, she spoke in clear and relaxed tones, her cadence similar to her mothers but her voice less strident.        
	Although she urged questioners to ask whatever may be on your minds, the same offer was not extended to the watching media. While the adult children of several other candidates have also lobbied for votes, Chelsea, who witnessed her fathers private life being exposed in lurid detail, is alone among them in flatly refusing to talk to journalists.        
	Even a nine-year-old reporter for an online childrens newspaper was recently rebuffed, though politely, when she tried to ask an innocent question about her father.         
	When schoolgirl Sydney Rieckhoff asked, Do you think your dad would be a good First Man in the White House? she was firmly told: Im sorry, I dont talk to the press, and that applies to you, unfortunately, even though I think youre cute.         
	This defensive stance has caused some friction, which erupted 10 days ago when a television reporter suggested Chelsea was being pimped out by her mother. The journalist concerned was subsequently suspended after Clinton complained.        
	There was no hint of that controversy last week as Chelsea stumped for her mother on college campuses in Ohio, where opinion polls showed her still holding a comfortable lead over Obama.

 BA engines

                 
	London, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Initial investigations showed the engines of a British Airways Boeing 777 failed to respond shortly before it crash-landed at Londons Heathrow Airport yesterday.
    
	Thirteen people were injured when BA Flight 83 from Beijing came down well short of the southern runway.
    
	Heathrow, the busiest international airport in the world, struggled to return to normal today. 
    
	British Airways said it planned to operate all of its long haul flights and up to 90 per cent of short haul departures, but advised passengers to call ahead for flight information.
    
	Over 50 flights, mostly short haul, were cancelled today morning.
    
	 At approximately 600 ft and two miles from touchdown, the Autothrottle demanded an increase in thrust from the two engines but the engines did not respond, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said in a statement.
    
	Captain Peter Burkill, given a rousing reception by staff at the airlines headquarters, did not comment on the cause of the incident but praised his crew for showing the highest standards of skill and professionalism.

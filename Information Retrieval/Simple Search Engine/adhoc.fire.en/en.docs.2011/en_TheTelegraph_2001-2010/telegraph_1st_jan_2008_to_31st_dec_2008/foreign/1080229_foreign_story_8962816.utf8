The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Diplomat hints at US shift on Musharraf
                                                                                                               Diplomat hints at US shift on Musharraf
                              Negroponte: People power                            
	Washington, Feb. 28 (AP): The USs second-ranking diplomat today signalled that the Bush administration was distancing itself from Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf after Opposition victories in last weeks elections.        
	Deputy secretary of state John Negroponte told senators that the US was supporting Pakistans people as they chose their leaders after the parliamentary elections. But he made scant mention of Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup, during his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.        
	Senior Bush administration officials, including Negroponte, have previously underlined their view that Musharraf has been indispensable to the US-led fight against extremists along Pakistans rugged border with Afghanistan.        
	Negroponte testified that Pakistan has been indispensable to that fight and said the US looks forward to working with the leaders who emerge from the formation of a new government.        
	When pressed by a lawmaker about whether the US would continue to back Musharraf, Negroponte acknowledged that Musharraf is still the President of his country, and we look for to continuing to work with him.        
	US lawmakers and Pakistani Opposition leaders have criticised the Bush administration for its steadfast support of the former army general despite his crackdown on the Opposition, judiciary and media. The Bush administration promoted Musharraf as a moderate leader able to hold together the nuclear-armed country.        
	But Musharraf has faced intense criticism since he declared a state of emergency in November and purged the supreme court before it could rule on the disputed legality of his re-election as President a month earlier.        
	Republican Senator Dick Lugar said the US should make it clear to Pakistans people that US interests lay not in supporting a particular leader or party, but in democracy, pluralism, stability and the fight against violence.        
	Negroponte said Pakistans recent elections were a big step towards civilian democracy and reflected the will of the voters, despite the deaths of more than 70 people on election day.        
	The violence could have been worse, Negroponte said. The Pakistani people refused to be intimidated by a wave of murderous terrorist attacks prior to election day.        
	Democratic Senator Joe Biden also urged the administration to move from a policy focused on a personality, Musharraf, to one based on an entire country.

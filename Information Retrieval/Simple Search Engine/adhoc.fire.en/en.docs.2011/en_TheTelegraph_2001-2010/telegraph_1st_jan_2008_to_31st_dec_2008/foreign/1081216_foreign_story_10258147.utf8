	Kuala Lumpur, Dec. 15 (Reuters): Malaysia may freeze permits for foreign workers due to rising unemployment, the countrys labour ministry said today.        
	It comes after Singapore said it could return thousands of foreign workers.        
	State news agency Bernama quoted the director-general of labour, Ismail Abdul Rahim, as saying that a freeze was one of the ways the government would seek to staunch the rise in unemployment.

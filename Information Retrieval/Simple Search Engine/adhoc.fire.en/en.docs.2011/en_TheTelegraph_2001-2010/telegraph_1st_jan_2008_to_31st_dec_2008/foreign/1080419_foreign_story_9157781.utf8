	Beijing, April 18 (AP): Police beat and detained dozens of ethnic Tibetans during the latest protest in a restive region of western China, sparked when monks gathered to demand the release of fellow clergy, residents and an activist group said today.        
	Authorities clamped down quickly after the protest yesterday in Qinghai provinces Tongren county, imposing an overnight curfew while police and armed paramilitary troops checked ID cards, a hotel receptionist said.        
	Crowds gathered in Tongren county after Buddhist monks calling for the release of fellow clergy were joined by shoppers at a local market, the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy reported. A senior monk tried to mediate but police moved in, beating participants and detaining more than 100 monks.

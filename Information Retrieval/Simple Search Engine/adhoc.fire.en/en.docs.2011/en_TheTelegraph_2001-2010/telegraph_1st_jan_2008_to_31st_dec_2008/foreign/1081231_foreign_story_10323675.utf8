	Private Popeye    
	 London, Dec. 30: I yam what I yam, declared Popeye. And just what that is is likely to become less clear as the copyright expires on the character who generates about 1.5 billion in annual sales, reports The Times, London.       
	From January 1, the iconic sailor falls into the public domain in Britain under an EU law that restricts the rights of authors to 70 years after their death. Elzie Segar, the Illinois artist who created Popeye, his love interest Olive Oyl and nemesis Bluto, died in 1938.       
	The Popeye industry stretches from books, toys and action figures to computer games, a fast-food chain and the inevitable canned spinach. The copyright expiry means that, from Thursday, anyone can print and sell Popeye posters, T-shirts and create new comic strips, without the need to make royalty payments.     
	Nosey DVD    
	 London: A school has started to teach its pupils how to blow their noses. The five- to 11-year-old children at Broad Oak Primary School in Manchester have been shown a DVD telling them the right and wrong ways to act when they have a cold. But one parent called the exercise as a complete waste of time. The parent added: I send my kids to school to learn, not for someone to show them how to blow their nose.

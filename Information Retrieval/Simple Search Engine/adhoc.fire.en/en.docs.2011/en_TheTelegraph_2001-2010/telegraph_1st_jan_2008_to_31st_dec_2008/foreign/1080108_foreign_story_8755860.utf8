	Buns in a bind
 
	 Beijing, Jan. 7 (Reuters): Thousands of Chinese snack vendors are happily digesting the news that Chinas steamed bun, or mantou, does not have to be perfectly round.
 
	China has battled to boost food quality and standards in the wake of a string of food safety scandals, but media reports of a new standard for mantou, a cheap wheat-based snack sold on street corners, outraged Internet users and academics.
 
	Chinas quality watchdog denied that standards recommending a perfect shape for mantou held the force of law. There are no specific regulations on the shape of wheat-flour mantou in the standard, the general administration of quality supervision, inspection and quarantine said on its website.
 
	Irish art
 
	 London (Reuters): A triptych by Irish-born artist Francis Bacon, a response to the suicide of his lover George Dyer, is expected to fetch around pound;25 million when it is sold next month, Christies said on Monday. The work, called Triptych 1974-77, could challenge the current record for the artist which stands at pound;26.6 million for Study from Innocent X, 1962 sold by Sothebys in New York in May, 2007. The triptych will go under the hammer in London on February 6.

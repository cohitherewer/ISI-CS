	Los Angeles, July 4 (Reuters): California firefighters made a desperate stand as darkness fell yesterday to save more than 4,000 homes and other structures from a pair of out-of-control wildfires burning about 273km apart along the California coast.        
	The most imminent danger was to homes around Goleta, near Santa Barbara, where flames were fast approaching 2,600 homes and transmission lines supplying power to 100,000 people on the coast.        
	All told, some 3,000 residences had been evacuated in and around Goleta and officials said the threat to life and property had made it the states top firefighting priority.

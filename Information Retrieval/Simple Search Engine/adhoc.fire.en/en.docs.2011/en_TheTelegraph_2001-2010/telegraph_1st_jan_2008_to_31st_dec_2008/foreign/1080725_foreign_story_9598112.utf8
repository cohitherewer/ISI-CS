	Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), July 24 (AP): The head of a prominent cancer research institute issued an unprecedented warning to his faculty and staff yesterday: Limit mobile phone use because of the possible risk of cancer.        
	The warning from Ronald B. Herberman, director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, is contrary to numerous studies that dont find a link between cancer and mobile phone use, and a public lack of worry by the US Food and Drug Administration.        
	Herberman is basing his alarm on early unpublished data. He says it takes too long to get answers from science and he believes people should take action now  especially when it comes to children.        
	Really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out, but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later, Herberman said.        
	No other major academic cancer research institutions have sounded such an alarm about mobile phone use. But Herbermans advice is sure to raise concern among many mobile phone users and especially parents.        
	In the memo he sent to about 3,000 faculty and staff yesterday, he says children should use mobile phones only for emergencies because their brains are still developing.        
	Adults should keep the phone away from the head and use the speakerphone or a wireless headset, he says. He even warns against using cell phones in public places like a bus because it exposes others to the phones electromagnetic fields.        
	The issue that concerns some scientists  though nowhere near a consensus  is electromagnetic radiation, especially its possible effects on children. It is not a major topic in conferences of brain specialists.        
	A 2008 University of Utah analysis looked at nine studies  including some Herberman cites  with thousands of brain tumour patients and concludes: We found no overall increased risk of brain tumours among cellular phone users. The potential elevated risk of brain tumours after long-term mobile phone use awaits confirmation by future studies.        
	Studies last year in France and Norway concluded the same thing. If there is a risk from these products  and at this point we do not know that there is  it is probably very small, the Food and Drug Administration says on an agency website.        
	Still, Herberman cites a growing body of literature linking long-term mobile phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer.        
	Although the evidence is still controversial, I am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on mobile phone use, he wrote in his memo.        
	A driving force behind the memo was Devra Lee Davis, the director of the universitys centre for environmental oncology.         
	The question is do you want to play Russian roulette with your brain, she said in an interview from her mobile phone while using the hands-free speaker phone as recommended. I dont know that mobile phones are dangerous. But I dont know that they are safe.

          HENRY SAMUEL                          Number one fan                                  
	Paris, July 3: Nicolas Sarkozy will postpone a trip to Ireland this month to hear why the country rejected the new European Treaty as it clashes with the release of his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozys new album.         
	Officially, Sarkozy put off the date of his trip from July 11 in his capacity as EU president, due to a heavy schedule. He is now slated to visit on July 21. But the change means the President, known to be his wifes number one fan, can now be by her side when she launches Comme si de rien tait (As if Nothing Happened)  her third album in which she sings of her love for her husband and of her previous thirty lovers.        
	Sarkozy is said to have taken a keen interest in the album  described by one conservative newspaper as the most awaited in France in decades  sitting in on recordings.        
	One of the songs, Ma Came (My Junk), in which she sings of her man as being more deadly than Afghan heroine, more dangerous than Colombian white, sparked a diplomatic incident in Colombia. Its foreign minister described the lyrics as very painful for his country, which is waging war against rebels backed by drug money.

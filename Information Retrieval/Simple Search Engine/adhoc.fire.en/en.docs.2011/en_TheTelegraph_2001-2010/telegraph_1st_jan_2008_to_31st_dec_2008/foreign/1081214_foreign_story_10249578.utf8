  - Official guesthouse full                                
	Chicago, Dec. 13: To the list of people having trouble finding somewhere in Washington to stay in early January, there can now be added one more entry: the Obama family.        
	President George W. Bushs aides have turned down a request from President-elect Barack Obama to move from Chicago into Blair House, the official guest residence across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, in time for Obamas daughters to start school in Washington on January 5.         
	The Obamas were told that they could move into Blair House on January 15 but no earlier because it was booked, an Obama transition official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.         
	We explored the idea so that the girls could start school on schedule, the official said. But there were previously scheduled events and guests that couldnt be displaced.        
	White House officials declined to disclose specifically who was using Blair House during that period, for what purpose or how they could take precedence over the President-elect when it came to government housing.         
	A White House official would say only that it had been booked for receptions and gatherings by members of the departing Bush administration.         
	Those receptions, the official said, dont make it suitable for full-time occupancy by the Obamas yet.        
	So the Obamas are now looking for an alternative place to stay for a few weeks, though they presumably are not searching Craiglists, which features free online classified advertisements, for a sublet.        
	Obama transition officials, who have been trying hard to highlight how well the Bush and the Obama families have been getting along, were quick to say that they were not angry about being turned away.         
	The White House has been extremely accommodating to the Obama family needs  and the entire process has been smooth and friendly, a transition official said.         
	White House officials said the protocol is that Blair House is available to Presidents-elect starting January 15, five days before the inauguration.        
	Blair House, which dates to 1824, has served as the official presidential guesthouse since 1942 for heads of state and other foreign dignitaries. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel has stayed there, as has former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

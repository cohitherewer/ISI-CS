The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fresh spasm of violence rocks Iraq
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fresh spasm of violence rocks Iraq
                            
	Baghdad, April 15 (Reuters): Two car bombs killed more than 50 people in Sunni areas of Iraq today, a sudden spasm of violence in places which had been comparatively quiet while battles raged in the Shia south.        
	Suspicion in the attacks will fall on the al Qaida, given the Sunni militant groups history of using car bombs.        
	In one of the deadliest strikes in months, one car bomb killed 40 people and wounded 80 outside a provincial government headquarters in Baquba, local capital of Diyala province north of Baghdad, police said.        
	They said the blast killed people on the busy streets and in their cars as they were passing the location. Women and children were among the victims. US forces put the death toll at 36, with 67 wounded. It said three buses were destroyed and 10 shops damaged.        
	Medical sources said ambulances struggled to get the wounded to hospitals because of the sheer number of victims. A second car bomb, believed to be driven by a suicide attacker, exploded outside a popular restaurant in Ramadi, capital of Anbar province west of Baghdad, killing 13 people and wounding 14 others, a hospital source said.

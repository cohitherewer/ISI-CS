                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Saudi race for deal to protect Pervez     -  Drive for resignation without fear of trial
                              Musharraf                                  
	Islamabad, Aug. 17 (Reuters): Speculation swirled in Pakistan today that a deal would be reached shortly enabling President Pervez Musharraf to resign without fear of prosecution, avoiding a divisive impeachment process.        
	Talk of resignation by former army chief and firm US ally Musharraf has been mounting since the coalition government, led by the party of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, said this month it planned to impeach him.        
	US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice today said Musharraf has been a good ally, but refused to say whether he would receive US asylum if he stepped down.        
	This is an issue that is not on the table, Rice said in an interview with Fox News Sunday.         
	Saudi Arabian representatives were trying to broker a deal to protect and save face for Musharraf, a senior security official told Reuters.        
	Some dignitaries have arrived here to mediate. A Saudi Royal Air Force plane is parked at Chaklala (air base), said the official, who asked not to be identified.        
	Reports that Saudi Arabia  a key political and financial backer of Pakistan  was mediating have been denied by both sides of the controversy.        
	Coalition officials have been hoping Musharraf would quit to avoid impeachment while some allies have said he should at least answer charges brought against him before stepping down.        
	Musharraf seized power in a 1999 coup but has been isolated since his allies lost a February election. All four provincial assemblies have in recent days passed resolutions pressing him to quit and several old allies have joined the campaign against him.        
	Today, another old ally, Senator Mohammad Amin Dadabhoy, announced he was joining Bhuttos party.        
	A line has been drawn between democracy and dictatorship. Its a decisive moment so obviously I want to be on this side of the line, Dadabhoy told Reuters.        
	The ruling coalition has prepared impeachment charges against Musharraf focusing on violation of the Constitution and misconduct. There have also been reports it is looking into possible misuse of funds in Musharrafs foreign travels.        
	The draft has been given a final shape and by tomorrow or the day after, itll be presented to the coalition leadership and hopefully, an impeachment motion with charge sheet will be moved this week, information minister Sherry Rehman, on the committee assigned to draft the charge sheet, told reporters on today.        
	The nature of the charges has Musharrafs camp worried he might face prosecution even if he leaves office without a fight.        
	The Presidents spokesperson has insisted Musharraf would not resign but would face the accusations.        
	Asked if the government was considering giving a safe exit for Musharraf if he quits, Rehman said: We are not interested in politics of vendetta ... we want political stability and the governments focus should be on the peoples betterment.        
	But efforts to give immunity to Musharraf could face a roadblock from former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), the main coalition partner of Bhuttos party.

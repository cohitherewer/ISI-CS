	Durham (North Carolina), June 2 (AP): Senator Edward M. Kennedy underwent what his doctors called successful surgery today to treat his cancerous brain tumour, and told his wife shortly after that he felt like a million bucks, a family spokeswoman said.        
	The surgery at Duke University Medical Centre took about three-and-a-half hours.         
	He is expected to undergo chemotherapy and radiation in coming weeks, and will remain at the North Carolina hospital for about a week.        
	The 76-year-old liberal Massachusetts Democrat was diagnosed last month with a malignant glioma, a lethal type of brain tumour.         
	Experts had said Dr Allan Friedman  the top neurosurgeon at Duke and an internationally known tumour and vascular surgeon  will try to remove as much of the tumour as possible while balancing the risk of harming healthy brain tissue that affects movement and speech.        
	Kennedy was awake during the procedure, and should not experience any permanent neurological effects, he said.

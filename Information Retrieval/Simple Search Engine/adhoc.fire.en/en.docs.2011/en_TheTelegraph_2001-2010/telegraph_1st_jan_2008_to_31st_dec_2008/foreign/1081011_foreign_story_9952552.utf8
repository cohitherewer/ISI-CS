                              Le Clezio: Awed                            
	Stockholm/Paris, Oct. 10 (Reuters): French author Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio, a globetrotting novelist hailed as a child of all continents, won the Nobel prize for literature yesterday.        
	The Swedish Academy, which decides the winner of the coveted 10 million Swedish crown ($1.4 million) prize, praised the 68-year-olds adventurous novels, essays and childrens books.        
	His works have a cosmopolitan character. Frenchman, yes, but more so a traveller, a citizen of the world, a nomad, Horace Engdahl, permanent secretary of the Academy, told a news conference to announce the laureate.        
	Underlining his international credentials, Le Clezio, who describes himself as French and Mauritian.        
	Some kind of incredulity, some kind of awe, then some kind of enjoyment and mirth, he said, describing how he felt when he heard the news. Questioned about what he would do with the prize money, he added: I have debts. Im going to pay them.        
	Engdahl stirred up resentment among some US authors and critics in the run-up to this years announcement by saying American writers were too insular and did not participate in the big dialogue of literature. The last American to win the literature Nobel was novelist Toni Morrison in 1993.        
	When asked about the issue, Le Clezio replied: I dont think you can say American literature is any one thing, because it takes many forms.        
	He added that Philip Roth, a perennial favourite among bookmakers to scoop the Nobel, would be a worthy winner. He will certainly win this prize, and even if he doesnt he will remain a very great writer. Nice-born Le Clezio moved to Nigeria with his family at the age of eight. He wrote his first works  Un Long Voyage and Oradi Noir  during the month-long journey.        
	According to the academys Web site, he studied English at a British university and taught at institutions in Bangkok, Mexico City, Boston, Austin and Albuquerque, among others.

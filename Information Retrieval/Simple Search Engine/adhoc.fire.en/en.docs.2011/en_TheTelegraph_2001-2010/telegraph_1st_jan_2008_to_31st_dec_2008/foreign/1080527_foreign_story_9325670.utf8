The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak budget gamble amid political cloud
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pak budget gamble amid political cloud
          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, May 26: Pakistans new government will unveil its first annual budget on June 7 amid heightened political uncertainty triggered by growing tensions between the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party and President Pervez Musharraf over the constitutional package.         
	The federal budget for the year 2008-09 will be presented in the national assembly on June 7, an official source told The Telegraph in Islamabad today.         
	The overall negative impact of the political uncertainty on the national economy was evident today as Pakistani share prices suffered further slump for the second time during the last three days, closing down 3.5 per cent.         
	The benchmark Karachi Stock Exchange KSE-100 Index finished the day at 12,584.78, down 426.96 points. The market saw an overall decline of 20 per cent since April 17 when it touched an all-time high of 15,622 points.         
	Analysts believe the economy might witness further downslide if the government failed to rectify the situation in consultation with its allies.         
	The ruling PPP has already finalised the draft constitutional package, which seeks to curtail Musharrafs powers of dissolving the national assembly, dismissing the government under Article 58(2)(b) and appointing the provincial governor, chief election commissioners and armed forces chiefs.         
	PPP co-chairperson and Benazir Bhuttos widower, Asif Ali Zardari, who unveiled the package over the weekend, has indicated that his party could muster the support of as many lawmakers as required for impeaching Musharraf.         
	However, he added that the PPP did not want to do that in order to avoid a political upheaval. While senior PPP leaders are in touch with their interlocutors in Aiwan-e-Sadr (presidential palace), Zardari has refused to succumb to pressures by the Bush administration to meet Musharraf and develop a working relationship with him.         
	Local daily The News today quoted Zardari as saying that he rejected the pressure. I will meet Musharraf but ask him to resign. He was reluctant to explain the agenda of his proposed meeting with Musharraf but said: I am hopeful that the outcome of my meeting with Musharraf will not disappoint the people of Pakistan. Two US Senators, Carl Levin and Bob Casey, now on a visit to Pakistan, also tried to convince the PPP leadership on the need of a meeting between Zardari and Musharraf.         
	These US Senators besides some other officials have been pressing Zardari to stop attacking Musharraf and meet him to reach some understanding on a working relationship.         
	But the PPP leader told the Senators yesterday that Musharraf was no longer part of the solution, rather he was the problem.

	New York, April 3 (Reuters): Grammy-winning singer Norah Jones says an improvisational approach and a strong supporting cast helped overcome her nerves in her first acting role, in director Wong Kar Wais film My Blueberry Nights.        
	Hong Kong director Wong relied on improvisation as much as the script in his rich, deeply visual story of losing and finding love filmed across the US  his first movie in English.         
	Hes a very musical director, he goes by feel and instinct, Jones said in an interview with Reuters.        
	The daughter of Ravi Shankar, Jones leaped to fame with her debut album Come Away With Me which won Album of the Year at the 2003 Grammy Awards.        
	Jones stars as Elizabeth, who embarks on a soul searching journey after she catches her boyfriend cheating on her with another woman.        
	The film, which opens in the US this month after debuting at the Cannes film festival last year, has seen more attention than Jones had expected when she agreed to appear in a little indie film.        
	Jones was cast first and initially was nervous when she heard of the rest of the high profile cast, which includes Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Rachel Weisz, though their experience helped put her at ease.        
	Its like playing with a great band  they just make you look better, she said.

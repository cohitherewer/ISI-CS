                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       China poison milk death
                            
	Shanghai, Sept. 13 (Reuters): China reported a first death today in a scandal over contaminated milk powder which it blamed for causing kidney stones and making 432 babies fall ill.        
	The official Xinhua news agency reported that one baby had died because of the contaminated powder.        
	Sanlu Group, a dairy producer partly owned by New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra Co-operative Group, has been ordered to halt production after a preliminary investigation found its products were responsible, officials said.        
	Nineteen people have been detained on suspicion of breaking food safety laws, and 78 have been questioned, said Yang Chongyong, vice-governor of the northern province of Hebei, where Sanlu is based. This is a severe food safety accident, Gao Qiang, a senior official at the Ministry of Health, told a news conference called by the cabinets information office in Beijing. More than 8,000 tonnes of baby formula have been pulled off shop shelves, and authorities are checking supplies and companies producing milk powder around the country.        
	The cabinet pledged to give free medical treatment to infants made ill by the contaminated powder, and asked health workers to fan out to remote rural areas to find ill babies, Gao said. Sanlu admitted this week that its baby formula had been contaminated with melamine, a toxin linked to the deaths and illness of thousands of pets in the US last year.

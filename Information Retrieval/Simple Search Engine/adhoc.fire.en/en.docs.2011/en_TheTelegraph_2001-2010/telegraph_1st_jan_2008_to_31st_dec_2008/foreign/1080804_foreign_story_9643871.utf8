	Jerusalem, Aug. 3 (AFP): Home Alone, made in Israel.        
	A four-year-old girl was left behind at Israels Ben Gurion International Airport today as her mother, father and four siblings rushed to catch a flight to Paris, police said.        
	I saw a little girl in tears. She was looking for her parents, a policewoman told reporters. Luckily, she was able to give me her name. I grabbed her and ran to the gates but it was too late, she said.        
	According to the police, the girls parents realised she was missing when the pilot informed them just when the aircraft was taking off. It is usual that travellers in a rush forget their luggage but not a child, a police officer said.        
	The little girl was eventually flown to Paris on the next flight, accompanied by an attendant, and was reunited with her family. The forgetful parents will be interrogated by authorities upon their return and risk being indicted for negligence, the police said.        
	The incident was a stark reminder of the US box-office hit Home Alone in which a little boy was accidentally left alone as his family rushed to the airport and flew to Paris for a Christmas holiday.

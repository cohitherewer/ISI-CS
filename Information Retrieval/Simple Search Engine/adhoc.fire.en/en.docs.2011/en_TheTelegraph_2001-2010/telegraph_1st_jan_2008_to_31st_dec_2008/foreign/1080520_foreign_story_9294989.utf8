	Garden of love     
	 London, May 19 (Reuters): George Harrisons widow created a special garden in memory of the former Beatle at Britains Chelsea Flower Show today and felt the labour of love had brought her much closer to her late husband.       
	I really cannot think of a more joyful thing to do for George and I know he would approve, Olivia Harrison said .       
	He was a passionate gardener, she said of her husband who died of lung cancer in 2001.    
	Tea cure    
	 New York (Reuters ): Compounds found in green tea may help ward off the neurological damage that can come with the breathing disorder sleep apnea, a new animal study hints. Researchers found that when they added green tea antioxidants to rats drinking water, it appeared to protect the animals brains during bouts of oxygen deprivation designed to mimic the effects of obstructive sleep apnea.

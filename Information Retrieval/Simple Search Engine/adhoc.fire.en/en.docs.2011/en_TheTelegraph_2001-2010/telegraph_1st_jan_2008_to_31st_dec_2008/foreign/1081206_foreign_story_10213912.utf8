	Peshawar, Dec. 5 (Agencies): Twenty one people, including three children, were killed and about 90 others injured in a powerful bomb blast at a Shia prayer hall in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar today.        
	The blast took place outside an Imambargah in the Kucha Risaldar area of Peshawars walled city.        
	Hospital sources said at least 21 people died in the blast which occurred in the evening when Shia shoppers crowded the area ahead of the Id-ul-Zuha festival.        
	North West Frontier Province police chief Malik Naveed Khan said the bomb contained 20-25kg of explosives. It caused extensive damage to the prayer hall and some nearby houses, police said. The blast triggered a massive fire in shops and warehouses in the area.        
	The explosives were believed to have been hidden inside a vehicle. The blast caused a five-foot crater in the area, police officials said.        
	Rescuers put the number of the injured at 90. Ambulances rushed to the area and took the injured to nearby hospitals where emergency has been declared. Reports said three children and four women were among the dead.        
	No group claimed responsibility for the attack.        
	There have been several instances of Shia prayer halls being targeted in Peshawar and other parts of the North West Frontier Province in the past few months.         
	It was a bomb. The number of casualties is very high. People are still trapped under the rubble, senior police official Kashif Alam said.        
	Witnesses said the blast appeared to have been caused by a car bomb. The blast knocked out power supplies in the street and rescue workers were hampered by a throng of angry and wailing people. A Reuters witness saw three bodies being brought out of the rubble.         
	Sunni militant groups have launched several gun and bomb attacks on minority Shias in recent weeks as sectarian violence worsened in the northwest.        
	Earlier today a suicide car-bomb killed at least six people in an attack apparently targetting Shias in the Orakzai ethnic Pashtun tribal region, also in Pakistans northwest.        
	The bomber was approaching a tribal council meeting, or jirga, called by Shias to settle a dispute with majority Sunnis.        
	The bomber tried to drive into a market in a Shia neighbourhood where the meeting was taking place but blew up his car when police tried to stop him at a checkpoint, said an intelligence agency official who declined to be identified.        
	A government official said seven people had been killed in the attack in Kalaya, the main town in Orakzai, while a resident, Mohammad Hanif, said he had seen six bodies at the scene.        
	Sectarian violence has flared in northwest Pakistan over the past year, mostly in the Kurram region on the Afghan border. Security analysts say al Qaida and Taliban militants, who are Sunnis and are bitterly opposed to Shias, have stirred up sectarian divisions.

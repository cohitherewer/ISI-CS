	London, April 30: A huge inflatable pig bearing the word Obama has gone missing in the California desert after it was released into the sky during a music festival.         
	Organisers for the Coachella music festival announced on Monday they were trying to locate the giant balloon, after it disappeared following a show by Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters on Sunday. The festival is offering a 5,000 reward plus four Coachella tickets for life for the safe return of the pig, spokeswoman Marcee Rondan said.         
	The pig displays the words: Dont be led to the slaughter and a cartoon of Uncle Sam holding two bloody cleavers. The other side reads Fear builds walls and the underside reads Obama with a checked ballot box for US Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama.         
	As tall as a two-storey house and as wide as two school buses, the pig was led from lines held on the ground on Sunday as Waters played a version of Pink Floyds Pigs from the 1977 anti-capitalist album Animals. Then it just floated away.

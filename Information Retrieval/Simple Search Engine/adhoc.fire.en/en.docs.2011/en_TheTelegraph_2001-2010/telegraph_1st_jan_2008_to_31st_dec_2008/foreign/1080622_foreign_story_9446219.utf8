The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kate grows old for Holocaust film role
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kate grows old for Holocaust film role
          ANITA SINGH                          Transformed                                  
	London, June 21: Here is actress Kate Winslet as you have never seen her before.         
	Prosthetics, a grey wig and a dowdy wardrobe have tranformed the 32-year-old star of Titanic into a wizened old lady.         
	She is pictured on the set of The Reader, a Holocaust drama currently filming in Berlin and based on the best-selling novel by Bernhard Schlink.         
	Winslet plays Hanna Schmitz, a woman in post-war Germany desperately trying to hide her past as a Nazi concentration camp guard. In the 1950s, she begins an affair with a teenage student but disappears one day without trace. Many years later, he discovers to his horror that she is standing trial for war crimes.         
	Ralph Fiennes is her co-star and the film is directed by Stephen Daldry. The book was first published in 1995 and translated into English two years later. It became the first German novel to top the New York Times bestseller list.         
	Winslet was first choice for the role but turned down the project due to schedule clashes as she had already committed to film Revolutionary Road, a drama directed by her husband, Sam Mendes.         
	Nicole Kidman took the part but later dropped out when she fell pregnant, leaving the way clear for Winslet.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

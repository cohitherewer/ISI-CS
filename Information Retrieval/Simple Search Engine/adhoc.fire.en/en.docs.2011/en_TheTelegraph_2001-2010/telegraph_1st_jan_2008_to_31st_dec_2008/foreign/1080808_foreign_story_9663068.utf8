	Sunday appeal    
	 Sydney, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Hollywood star Nicole Kidman and singer husband Keith Urban asked the paparazzi today to leave them and baby daughter Sunday Rose alone, saying she was a tiny doll who would be scared by the attention.      
	Keith and I are both appealing to the press and stuff just to give us a little space so we can walk around Sydney and show the baby our town, Kidman told Sydney radio station 2Day FM.      
	Shes tiny. Shes like a doll, shes like a little, little thing. Just (dont photograph) right in her face or in our faces because its scary for her, said Kidman.

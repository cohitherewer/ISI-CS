	Washington, July 3 (Reuters): President George W. Bush could attend the opening ceremonies of the Olympics during his trip to China next month, and that decision is not dependent on talks between Beijing and representatives of the Dalai Lama, the White House said today.        
	Im not able to announce the Presidents schedule, but he is going to the Olympics and I expect that the opening ceremonies could be a part of that trip, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said.        
	Perino said she was not connecting the outcome of talks between China and envoys of the Dalai Lama, Tibets Buddhist leader, to whether the President would attend opening ceremonies.        
	French President Nicolas Sarkozy has said he will decide next week whether to attend the opening of the Games, depending on the outcome of talks between Beijing and the Dalai Lamas representatives.        
	The White House has previously steered clear of saying whether Bush would attend the opening ceremonies, and todays comment was the clearest suggestion yet that Bush was likely to attend.        
	He believes hes going to China to support first and foremost our athletes, Perino said.        
	But Bush would discuss the issues of human rights and religious freedom with Chinese President Hu Jintao when he visits China next month and during a meeting on the sidelines of the Group of Eight summit in Japan next week, she said.        
	World leaders attending the Olympics opening ceremonies became an issue in March when Beijing crushed anti-Chinese protests in Tibet. Some world leaders threatened not to attend the opening ceremonies.         
	China launched another attack on the Dalai Lama today but also offered to continue talks provided he showed positive behaviour as the country readies for the Games. The comments came as China made its first official statement about a secretive meeting with the Dalai Lamas envoys in Beijing this week.

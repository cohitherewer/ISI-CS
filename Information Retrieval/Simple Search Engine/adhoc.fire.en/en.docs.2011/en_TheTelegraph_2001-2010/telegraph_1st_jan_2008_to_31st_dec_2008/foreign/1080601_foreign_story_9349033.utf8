	Charlie knot    
	 Los Angeles, May 31 (AP): The star of Two and a Half Men has moved on to marriage number three.      
	Charlie Sheen tied the knot with fiancee Brooke Mueller last night, said publicist Stan Rosenfield, who declined to give more details.      
	The 42-year-old actor and Mueller, a real estate investor, have been engaged since last summer. Shes just easy and loving and smart and if everybody was just as happy to see me when I walk through a door as her, my life would be perfect, he said soon after the couple got engaged.      
	 Sheen married Denise Richards in 2002. They divorced in 2006 and have been embroiled in a bitter custody battle over their two young daughters. Sheen briefly married model Donna Peele in 1995.

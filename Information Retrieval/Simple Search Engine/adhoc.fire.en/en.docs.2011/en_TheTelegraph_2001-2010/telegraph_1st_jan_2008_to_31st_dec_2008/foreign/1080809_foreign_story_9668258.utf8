The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Musharraf will not resign, say allies
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Musharraf will not resign, say allies
          JANE PERLEZ                                    
	Islamabad, Aug. 8: President Pervez Musharraf will stage a spirited defence against impeachment charges the governing coalition is pursuing against him, and has no intention of resigning under pressure, his key allies said today.        
	 Musharraf, who has been President for eight years, faces the first impeachment proceedings in Pakistani history, after the leaders of the two major political parties in the ruling coalition announced yesterday that they would seek to remove him.        
	The grounds for impeachment included mismanagement of the economy, along with Musharrafs imposition last November of emergency rule and the firing of nearly 60 judges, the party leaders said.        
	Mushahid Hussain, the secretary general of the Pakistan Muslim League-Q party, which supports Musharraf, said part of the Presidents defence strategy would be to draw a distinction between himself and the two leaders of the ruling coalition, Asif Ali Zardari, of the majority party in the coalition, the Pakistan Peoples Party, and Nawaz Sharif, the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-N.        
	He will say: Look here, Ive been in office for eight years. Ive made some mistakes, but at least I am not a crook. I have no foreign bank accounts, no properties abroad, unlike the Opposition leaders who are gunning for me, Hussain said.        
	In the 1990s, both Zardari and Sharif faced corruption charges in Pakistan. Zardari served nearly eight years in prison on charges that included paying for a country manor in Britain with illegal gains from Pakistan. On his return to Pakistan earlier this year after the assassination of his wife, the former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, the corruption charges were dropped as part of an amnesty deal with the Musharraf government.        
	Hussain said Musharraf would also seek to draw a sharp distinction between himself, a two-term President and an experienced soldier and former chief of the Pakistani Army, and Zardari, who served in the cabinet when his wife was Prime Minister in the 1990s.        
	What is the choice? It is between President Musharraf and President Zardari. That is the question for 160 million people of Pakistan, Hussain said.        
	Zardari has made it known that he would like to be President, according to Pakistani and western officials. As leader of the majority party, he could seek the nomination for President. The appointment of the President is decided by a vote of the national legislature and the provincial Assemblies.        
	The coalition has called a session of the National Assembly for next Monday to start the impeachment process.

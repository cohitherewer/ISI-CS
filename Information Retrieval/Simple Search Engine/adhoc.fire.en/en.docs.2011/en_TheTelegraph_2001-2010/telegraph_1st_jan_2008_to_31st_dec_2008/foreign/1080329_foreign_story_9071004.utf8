	Islamabad, March 28 (Reuters): A senior US official visiting Pakistan held out the prospect of increased assistance for the new government today, while stressing the need to work together to fight al Qaida and Islamist militancy.        
	US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher said there were militants in Pakistani tribal areas planning attacks on Pakistan, Afghanistan, Europe, the US and elsewhere. We want to move together to help Pakistan be safe and have economic opportunities and we want to move together to make Pakistan a success as a democratic society, Boucher said.        
	He made his comments at a joint news conference with Asif Ali Zardari. So, as the government lays out its plan, in that regard, we will look for the proper ways to support, he said. A body of opinion was forming in the US that Pakistan should get more assistance, he said.        
	A source close to the new government said the US military has problems adjusting to dealing with institutional mechanisms that Pakistans new leaders want to put in place governing the scope of cooperation.        
	Pakistan needs as much financial as it can get. A World Bank report released on Thursday said rapid adjustments and reforms were needed to avert an economic crisis as it suffers from the impact of high international oil and food prices.        
	U.S. assistance to Pakistan since it joined Washingtons war on terrorism in 2001 totalled over $10 billion, most of it for the military. Another $750 million has been earmarked for security and social sector projects in the tribal areas.        
	Boucher said the United States understood and was ready to support a broad-based, multi-faceted programme to counter the problem of terrorism and extremism in Pakistan.        
	Helping the United States hunt al Qaeda has brought Pakistans army into conflict with its own people, and tribes living in the semi-autonomous lands along the Afghan border have been alienated by Musharrafs policies.        
	The militants intensified a campaign of violence to destabilise Musharraf after troops stormed a Islamabads Red Mosque last July to crush an armed student movement.        
	Suicide attacks have multiplied, and almost 600 people have been killed in militant related violence so far this year.        
	Speaking three months after his wifes murder in a suicide bomb and gun attack, Zardari said it wasPakistans war as much as anybodys elses.

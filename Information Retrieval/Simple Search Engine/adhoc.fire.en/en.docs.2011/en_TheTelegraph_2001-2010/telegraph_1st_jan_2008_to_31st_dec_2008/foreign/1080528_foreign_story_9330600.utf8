	London, May 27: The latest games consoles might represent the most cutting-edge advances in computer technology, but their appeal to men is purely primal, according to a new research.        
	Scientists have found that men regress to their caveman instincts when playing the games, because the area of the brain linked with the desire to conquer becomes activated.         
	This, say researchers, is why they are more likely to become obsessed with their Playstation 3, Nintendo Wii or Xbox 360 than women.         
	The discovery was made during a study which monitored a group of men and women as they played with video games while linked up to an MRI scanner, which recorded their brain activity.         
	Professor Allan Reiss, who led the research, said that while women understood the aims of the game, they were not as driven to win as men.         
	He said: The males were just a lot more motivated to succeed.         
	The MRI data showed that the brains mesocorticolimbic centre, the region typically associated with reward and addiction, was stimulated in both sexes.         
	However, male brains showed much greater activation which increased as they progressed in their games.         
	Three structures within the reward circuit  the nucleus accumbens, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex  were also shown to influence each other much more in men than in women, the scientists wrote in the Journal of Psychiatric Research.         
	Reiss, of Stanford University, California, said the research also suggested males are more likely to feel rewarded by computer games.         
	He added: These gender differences might help explain why males are more attracted to, and more likely to become hooked on, video games than females.         
	I think its fair to say that males tend to be more intrinsically territorial. It doesnt take a genius to figure out who historically are the conquerors and tyrants of our species.

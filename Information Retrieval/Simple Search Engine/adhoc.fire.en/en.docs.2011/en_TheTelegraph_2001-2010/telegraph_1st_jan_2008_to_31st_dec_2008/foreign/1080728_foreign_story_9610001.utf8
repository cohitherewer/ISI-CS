	Dhaka, July 27 (Reuters): The Bangladesh high court ruled today that the cancellation of a public holiday to mark the death of the countrys founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was illegal.        
	The August 15 annual holiday was scrapped six years ago by the government of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, after she won the 2001 election by defeating Mujibs daughter Sheikh Hasina, another former Prime Minister.        
	Mujib was killed with most members of his family in a military coup on August 15, 1975, beginning years of rule by army generals.

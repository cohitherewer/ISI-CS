	Paris, Jan. 14: President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has married supermodel Carla Bruni at a secret ceremony held at the Elyse palace  two months after they met and three months after he divorced his second wife, it was reported today. 
    
	The regional newspaper Est Rpublicain, citing a source close to someone present at the ceremony said Sarkozy, 52, and Bruni, 40, exchanged vows at the presidential palace last Thursday after a highly publicised whirlwind romance. 
    
	If the reports are true, Sarkozy is the first French leader to marry in office since Napoleon. An Elyse spokesmen neither denied nor confirmed the report, saying that this information relates to Nicolas Sarkozys private life. 
    
	If it proves accurate then Sarkozy was true to a prediction he made last week to the press in which he confirmed the seriousness of their relationship and said: There are strong chances that you will hear about it (the wedding) when it has already happened. Previous reports had suggested that a wedding had been provisionally planned for February 8 or 9. 
    
	LEst Rpublicain has close ties to the Elyse and has had a recent scoop by publishing an exclusive interview with Sarkozys former wife Ccilia, who had refused to talk to the national press. 
    
	In October, Speedy Sarko, as he is known, announced his divorce two days after the event. In late November he met Bruni, a former girlfriend of Sir Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton, at a dinner party with an advertising friend. He appeared before photographers with her at Disneyland Paris three weeks later and has since taken her on trips to Egypt and Jordan. Bruni, now a successful singer who recently admitted to finding monogamy boring, reportedly already has a room in the Elyse for herself. She has been seen sporting two large heart-shaped diamond rings offered by Sarkozy and considered to be engagement gifts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Outrage in SA after Afrikaner abuse video
                                                                                                               Outrage in SA after Afrikaner abuse video
                            
	Johannesburg, Feb. 27 (Reuters): A video of white South African university students feeding black campus cleaners soup they had urinated in has caused outrage in a country scarred by decades of apartheid.        
	University classes were cancelled and staff and students protested today, demanding action against the four men. The video shows one student urinating into a container of soup placed on a toilet seat at the University of the Free State, situated in a conservative Afrikaner farming region.        
	This is the final ingredient, he said before heating the soup in a microwave oven and giving it to the elderly cleaners  four women and one man.        
	They were also taken to a bar where they drank alcohol and danced to Afrikaans music in what was portrayed as an initiation ceremony.        
	The leaked video  filmed last year  sparked black and white students to demonstrate at the campus, marching to the Reitz mens residence where it was made. One placard read: Stop This White Arrogancy.        
	Police used stun grenades to disperse the crowd. Five students were arrested and there were sporadic incidents of intimidation and damage to property, the university said.        
	The boers (Afrikaners) lived happily in Reitz until the day that the previously disadvantaged discovered the word integration in a dictionary, said one of the students in the video. Reitz was then forced to integrate and we started our own selection process.        
	The Young Communist League of South Africa said the video reflected that some Afrikaner students at the university still regard our people as inferior human beings equivalent to pigs.        
	The video, released by South Africas eTV, has made big news in the country, where white minority rule ended with multi-racial elections in 1994.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama outlasts Hillary, clinches nomination
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obama outlasts Hillary, clinches nomination

	Washington, June 3 (AP): Barack Obama effectively clinched the Democratic presidential nomination today after a gruelling marathon, based on an Associated Press tally of convention delegates.        
	He became the first black candidate ever to lead a major US party in a run for the White House.        
	 Campaigning on an insistent call for change, Obama outlasted former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in a historic race that sparked record turnout in primary after primary, yet exposed deep racial and gender divisions within the party.        
	The tally was based on public declarations from delegates as well as from another 15 who have confirmed their intentions to the Associated Press. It also included 11 delegates Obama was guaranteed as long as he gained 30 per cent of the vote in South Dakota and Montana later in the day.        
	It takes 2,118 delegates to clinch the nomination.        
	The 46-year-old first-term senator will face John McCain in the November election to become the 44th President. The Arizona senator campaigned in Memphis today.        
	Clinton stood ready to concede that her rival had amassed the delegates needed to triumph, according to officials in her campaign.        
	These officials said the New York senator did not intend to suspend or end her candidacy in a speech tonight in New York. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they had not been authorised to divulge her plans.        
	Top Democratic officials have been pushing for an end to a nomination battle that shattered fundraising and voter turnout records, but also exposed racial and gender divisions within the party that threatened to undermine its chances in the November election against McCain.        
	Obamas triumph was fashioned on prodigious fundraising, meticulous organising and his theme of change aimed at an electorate opposed to the Iraq war and worried about the economy  all harnessed to his own gifts as a campaigner.        
	Clinton campaigned for months as the candidate of experience, a former First Lady and second-term senator ready, she said, to take over on Day One.        
	But after a year on the trail, Obama won the kickoff Iowa caucuses on January 3, and the first-term senator became something of an overnight political phenomenon.        
	We came together as Democrats, as Republicans and independents, to stand up and say we are one nation, we are one people and our time for change has come, he said that night in Des Moines.        
	As the strongest female presidential candidate in history, Clinton drew large, enthusiastic audiences. Obamas were bigger still. One audience, in Dallas, famously cheered when he blew his nose on stage; a crowd of 75,000 turned out in Portland, Oregon, the weekend before the states May 20 primary.

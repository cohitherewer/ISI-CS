	Colombo, Oct. 28 (Agencies): Sri Lankan rebels launched a brazen airstrike on a power station on the outskirts of Colombo late tonight, plunging the capital into darkness as the military fought back with a wave of anti-aircraft fire.        
	Because of the bombing, there was a fire at Kelanitissa power station. We have sent fire engines. We have no details as to the extent of damage, an official at fire brigade headquarters said.         
	The attack comes about an hour after a rebel aircraft bombed a regional military base in the north.        
	Television Rupavahini quoted military officials as saying the plane dropped at least one bomb on Kelanitissa power plant in Colombo.         
	According to sources: The LTTE aircraft dropped two bombs at around 23.15 pm in Colombo. However, an alert Sri Lankan Navy took cover and fired anti-aircraft guns in the sky to prevent any attack on the harbour.         
	There were no immediate details about damages or casualties.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sharif pulls party out of coalition
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Sharif pulls party out of coalition

	Islamabad, May 12 (Reuters): Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif pulled his party out of Pakistans six-week-old coalition government today, plunging the volatile Muslim nation back into political uncertainty.        
	Sharif, whose Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) was the second-largest member of a four-party alliance, made the announcement after failing to break a deadlock with its main coalition partner over the reinstatement of dismissed judges.        
	Sharif made the restoration of 60 judges sacked by President Pervez Musharraf in November the main condition for joining the coalition led by the party of Asif Ali Zardari, the widower and political successor of the late Benazir Bhutto.        
	Three days of talks in London between Sharif and Zardari, whose Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leads the coalition, ended yesterday without any breakthrough.        
	Our ministers will meet the Prime Minister tomorrow and will submit their resignations, Sharif told a news conference.        
	Nine of the 24 ministers in Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilanis cabinet belong to the PML-N, including finance minister Ishaq Dar.        
	Sharif said his party would continue to support the PPP government despite quitting the cabinet. For the time being, well not sit in Opposition.        
	There had been high hopes that the alliance between the two main political forces would assert civilian rule in a country that has been led by generals, like Musharraf, for more than half the time since it was founded in 1947. Western allies in the war on terrorism dread nuclear-armed Pakistan sliding into a prolonged period of political instability.        
	If the PML-N were to withdraw support completely, analysts say the PPP could end up inviting Musharrafs allies to join the coalition, or call for another election.        
	The split in the coalition, analysts say, would be welcomed by Musharraf, who came to power in a 1999 coup and only quit as army chief last November. The humiliating loss of parliamentary support in February polls had left him isolated.        
	Sharif, who was overthrown by Musharraf, wants the judges brought back as part of a strategy to drive his usurper from office.        
	We will not be part of any movement which strengthens a dictator and destabilises the democratic process. Well not destabilise the democratic process, he said.         
	Zardari and Sharif signed a pact in March promising to restore the judges by April 30 but Sharif extended the deadline until May 12 because of Zardaris foot-dragging.         
	Musharraf purged the judiciary during a brief period of emergency rule.

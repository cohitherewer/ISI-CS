	Gori (Georgia), Aug. 13: A Russian tank battalion occupied this strategic Georgian crossroads town today and was controlling access roads into and out of the city, in what Georgia said was flagrant defiance of a peace agreement struck only hours earlier.        
	In addition, hundreds of Russian soldiers poured over the border from Russia into South Ossetia this afternoon. Attack helicopters and fuel trucks accompanied a long convoy of dozens of trucks.        
	Bitterly criticising the US for letting his country down, President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia said Russia had flagrantly defied the peace accord and effectively severed the country in two. In Gori, more than a dozen tanks roamed the centre of the city, which lies about 40 miles from Tbilisi. Some news agencies reported that a column of Russian tanks had left Gori, headed toward Tbilisi, but then turned off on a road leading back to Russia. Those reports could not be independently confirmed.        
	The Russian military denied that it had taken over Gori, but a spokesman for Russian peacekeeping forces confirmed that Russian soldiers were operating around the city and had taken over a Georgian weapons depot with the purpose of demilitarising the zone adjacent to the conflict area and also guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population, according to the Russian news agency Interfax.

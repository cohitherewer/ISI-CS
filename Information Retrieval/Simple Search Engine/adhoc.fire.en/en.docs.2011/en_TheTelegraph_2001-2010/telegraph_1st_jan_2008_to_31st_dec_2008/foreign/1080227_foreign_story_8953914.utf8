	Islamabad, Feb. 26 (PTI): Nawaz Sharifs pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) today said it will not join the planned Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)-led coalition government in Pakistan.
    
	It would, however, support the government from the outside. This is the clearest sign yet on the PML-Ns role after the two Opposition parties joined hands. The PML-N said it would not like to be in the cabinet as long as Pervez Musharraf remains President.
    
	The party said it was not seeking any share in the ministry or government to be formed at Islamabad but would support the PPP administration to implement its agenda and fulfil all commitments made by the two parties in their election campaign, spokesman Ahsan Iqbal said.
    
	Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, a senior PML-N leader and a close Sharif aide, said at a news conference: The party will not become part of the federal cabinet as we do not want to take oath under the administration of President (Pervez) Musharraf.
    
	Asked what would be the working relationship between the two parties, Iqbal said the PML-N will respect the PPPs mandate for forming a government at the centre and would not let its government be destabilised.
    
	There were also reports that Sharif was told by US ambassador Anne Patterson not to oppose Musharraf. 
    
	In Washington, White House press secretary Dana Perino said: It will be up to the people of Pakistan to see what their new government will look like. But the President (George Bush) does certainly support him (Musharraf) and has continued to. 
    
	The PML-Ns future plans were outlined a day after Patterson reportedly told Sharif not to oppose Musharraf at their meeting here yesterday.
       
	Both khan and iqbal said the pml-had set no conditions for supporting the ppp to form a government at the centre.
    
	 The ppp won 87 out of 272 seats in pakistans parliament while pml got 67.
    
	Khan also said the pml-s top leadership had informed the ppp about their reservations on the proposal to include the muttahida qaumi movement (mqm), which backs musharraf, in the federal government.
    
	 Ppp co-chairman meanwhile asif zardari denied a wall street journal report that he had offered to work with musharraf.
    
	Zardari had only pointed out that the opposition does not have the two-thirds parliamentary majority required to impeach the president, said his spokesman, farhatullah babar.
    
	That does not mean we will have a working relationship with musharraf. That relationship will be determined by the parliament, babar said.
    
	 In a separate written statement issued on behalf of zardari, babar said there is a huge difference between the admission of a ground reality (the absence of a two-thirds majority) and an explicit desire to seek a working relationship with the president.
    
	Besides their differences on the move to include the mqm in the federal government, the pml-and ppp are holding hectic consultations to reach common ground on the issue of reinstating judges who were deposed by musharraf during last years emergency rule.
    
	Nawaz sharif is planning to contest by-elections, his spokesman said which could make him eligible to run for prime ministerin the newly-elected government.
    
	His politician brother shahbaz sharif will also stand, said siddiqul farooq. Pti rhl gsn gsn 02261940 del

	London, Oct. 5: Ian Fleming, creator of the famous fictional secret agent James Bond, was responsible for saving the real-life MI6, new documents have shown.         
	Fleming, who was an officer in the navys intelligence department during World War II, helped to insert new blood into the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) by allowing it to be infiltrated by members of the Cambridge spy ring.        
	The secret files, released after more than 60 years to the National at Kew, south-west London, reveal that, within a few months of war breaking out, British naval chiefs began to lobby Prime Minister Winston Churchill to let them start their own rival espionage service after an army officer was put in charge of MI6  a post traditionally led by a navy officer.        
	However, Fleming, who was then the British navys liaison officer with MI6, steered them away from the idea.         
	Instead, his suggestion read: I think that the infusion of new blood into the existing organisation would be better than chopping off hoary but experienced heads.

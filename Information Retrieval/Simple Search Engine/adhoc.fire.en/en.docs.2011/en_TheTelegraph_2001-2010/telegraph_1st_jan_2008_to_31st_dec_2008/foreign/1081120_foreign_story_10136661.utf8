          CHARLOTTE BAILEY                              
	London, Nov. 19: Researchers have discovered how to make the perfect phone call.         
	Lasting nine minutes and 36 seconds, the ideal phone conversation should consist of chat about family news, current affairs, personal problems and the weather. Experts came up with the winning conversational formula after analysing what more than 2,000 people liked and disliked about talking on the phone.        
	They found that, during the perfect call, three minutes should be spent catching up with news about family and friends, one minute on personal problems, another minute on work/school, 42 seconds on current affairs and 24 seconds on the weather. Chatting about the opposite sex should last 24 seconds, 12 seconds should be spent on celebrity gossip, one minute and 42 seconds on laughing, 12 seconds on silence and a minute on other general topics.        
	The research, carried out by the Post Office, also showed that one in five spent most time on the phone to their mother and only three per cent named their father as the person they spent most time talking to. This is mainly because fathers tend to hand the phone over to their wives.        
	According to Catherine Blyth, author of the book The Art of Conversation, anyone can conduct a good chat.        
	She said: Conversation doesnt have to be loud, outrageous or wildly funny. It can slip along with little more than a friendly smile and an open mind. Hugh Stacey, head of telephony at the Post Office, said: This research shows us what people really want from a chat on the phone. People obviously value news about their loved ones, with news about family and friends topping the charts.

	Dhaka, Aug. 30 (Reuters): At least 50 people were injured when Bangladesh police fired teargas and used batons to disperse textile workers protesting against the sacking of fellow-workers today, police said.        
	Five policemen were also among the injured, hit by missiles thrown by workers who also ransacked a garment factory on a road in Gazipur, 40 km north of Dhaka. Eighteen workers at a local garment factory were sacked yesterday for violating factory rules.

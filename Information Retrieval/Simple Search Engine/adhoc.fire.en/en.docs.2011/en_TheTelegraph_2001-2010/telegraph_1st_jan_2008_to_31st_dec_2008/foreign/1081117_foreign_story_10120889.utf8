          PHILIP SHERWELL                          Hillary: Cash trouble                                  
	New York, Nov. 16: Hillary Clinton will face awkward questions about her husbands financial ties with Arab sheikhs and Central Asian oligarchs if Barack Obama nominates her as secretary of state.         
	The President-elect has reportedly sounded out his former bitter rival to be the international face for his new administration  just months after she mocked his foreign policy inexperience and criticised his plans to talk to Americas enemies.         
	But the ex-First Lady would first have to go through a gruelling confirmation process on Capitol Hill at which, The Sunday Telegraph has learned, Republican senators will raise her husbands secrecy-shrouded business deals and fund-raising for his glitzy presidential library and foundation.         
	Former President Bill Clinton has consistently refused to provide the names of the donors, but newspaper investigations have identified a slew of foreign contributors, many from oil-rich Gulf states.         
	His lucrative consultancy work for a friends investment group has also involved dealings with Arab partners. Republican strategists are dusting off plans to expose Clintons financial ties, which they will argue represent a serious conflict of interest for his wife as the countrys top diplomat.         
	Bills multi-million dollar deals to fund his foundation and make the family rich were always going to be a profitable source of attack for us if Hillary was the candidate, said a Republican strategist. Now it looks like were going to get the chance to have a go at her over this, thanks to President-elect Obama. How can Hillary represent our interests when Bill is said to have close financial ties with some oil sheikhs?         
	Some of their themes will echo persistent lines of attack by the Obama campaign during the tough primary battle. His aides consistently urged Hillary to provide full details of financial transactions which made the couple rich after they left the White House in debt  and separately helped turn the Clinton Foundation into one of the worlds leading philanthropic organisations.         
	Obamas campaign manager David Plouffe once dubbed Hillary one of the most secretive politicians in America today.         
	The Democrats new strength in Congress means that in the absence of a political bombshell her confirmation should not be in doubt. But to satisfy the transparency rules laid down by the Obama transition team, Clinton would first have to provide more information about his finances than he has previously supplied.                     THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

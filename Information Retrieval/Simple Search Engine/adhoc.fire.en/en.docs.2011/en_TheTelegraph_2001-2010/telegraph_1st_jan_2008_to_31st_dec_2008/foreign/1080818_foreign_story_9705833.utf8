	Riyadh, Aug. 17 (Reuters): With inflation rising across the Gulf Arab region, Saudi Arabias perennial problem of unequal distribution of wealth has never been so obvious.        
	While poor Saudis queue for hours to obtain water in the kingdoms second city Jeddah, others are able to take advantage of Americas new-found disdain for gas-guzzling four-wheel-drives by snapping up imported cars.        
	Thousands of couples are cutting costs by forgoing individual weddings in favour of mass ceremonies carried out by a charity backed by Saudi princes. But the affluent are still going on holidays, albeit opting for cheaper stays in neighbouring Arab countries rather than trips to Europe.        
	Surging oil prices have triggered a turnaround in Saudi Arabias economic fortunes and a return to some of the big spending  by wealthy individuals and the monarchy  that characterised the 1970s and 1980s.        
	But the economic boom has also stoked prices for food and fuel, leading to discontent in a rapidly changing country where around two-thirds of the 17 million-strong local population are under 30, educated and outspoken and aware of events abroad.        
	This has put the royal Al Saud family  which runs the US ally along with clerics who administer Islamic sharia law  under greater scrutiny.        
	In June, inflation in the worlds top oil exporter hit a 30-year high of 10.6 per cent, mainly on increases in food and housing costs.         
	It hasnt reached the point that its barred us from travelling. We will still travel like we used to and maintain the same lifestyle, said Ohoud, a bank manager from Riyadh.        
	However, she said she had noticed that salaries were not keeping pace with prices.        
	John Sfakianakis, chief economist at SABB bank, HSBCs Saudi subsidiary, said the government could not raise wages to match inflation if it wanted to avoid adding inflationary pressures, but it risked angering workers.        
	A January wage hike of 5 per cent for government employees disappointed those Saudis who earn less than $2,666 a month, especially after Gulf neighbours moved more quickly to raise wages by larger amounts.         
	Saudis earning less than that figure would still expect to employ a driver and at least one maid. They are not taxed and receive free health and education and other benefits.        
	I dont feel it has affected me too much because my familys financial situation is good, said Najla, 22, a bank intern in Riyadh.        
	But Ive noticed we dont buy as many things as we used to, like laptops.        
	At the other end of the spectrum is Lulwah, 36, a mother-of-five who sells snacks on a mat at a park in Riyadh. She recently had to take out a loan from a charity.        
	This is the second time I have done it and I have used the money to chip in with six other women to start a catering business, she said. I have also taken to sewing clothes, some to sell and some to dress my children with, and it has helped me a lot. But things are still difficult for my husband and me.

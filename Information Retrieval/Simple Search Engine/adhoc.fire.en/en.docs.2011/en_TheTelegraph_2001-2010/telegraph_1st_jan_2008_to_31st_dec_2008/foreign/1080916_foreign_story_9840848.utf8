                              Relatives of police recruits kidnapped by Taliban militants block a road in Peshawar on Monday. The recruits were kidnapped on September 3 while they were travelling to a training centre in Hangu, Pakistan. (AFP)                            
	Islamabad, Sept. 15 (Reuters): Pakistani security officials today said that their troops had fired on US military helicopters and forced them to return to Afghanistan.        
	However, both Pakistani and American militaries denied the incident.        
	According to security officials, the incident took place near Angor Adda, a village in the tribal region of South Waziristan where, according to officials, US commandos in helicopters raided a suspected al Qaida and Taliban camp earlier this month.        
	The US choppers came into Pakistan by just 100 to 150 metres at Angor Adda. Even then our troops did not spare them, opened fire on them and they turned away, said one official.        
	While Angor Adda villagers supported that account, US and Pakistani military officials denied the report. Pakistans army spokesman Major Murad Khan confirmed there had been a shooting but said the American helicopters had not crossed into Pakistani airspace and Pakistani troops were not responsible for the firing.        
	Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman and a US military spokesman in Afghanistan said American helicopters had not come under fire. Ive checked into that and find it to be a spurious report, Whitman told reporters. Did not happen. Ive checked all the places that would know about something like that and it doesnt appear to be accurate.        
	(I) cannot find any mission that correlates to the report I saw out of Pakistan. I cant find any (military) report of helicopters being fired upon, Whitman said.        
	The attack on Angor Adda on September 3 was the first ground incursion by American troops into Pakistan since the deployment of US forces in Afghanistan.         
	At least 20 people, including women and children, were killed in that South Waziristan raid, sparking outrage in Pakistan.        
	Today, official denials of the helicopter incident were contradicted by Pakistani civilian officials and villagers in Angor Adda. One official told Reuters by telephone that the troops stationed at BP-27 post fired at the choppers and they turned away.        
	Two Chinook helicopters appeared set to land when troops began shooting, alerting tribesmen who also opened fire on the intruders, said a senior government official in Peshawar. A resident described the tension in the village through the night.We saw helicopters flying all over the area. We stayed awake the whole night after the incident, he said.

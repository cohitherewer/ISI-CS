	London, Oct. 2: Womens success in life depends on how high their mothers expectations are, a 30-year study has shown.         
	Those whose mothers had high hopes for them will feel more in control of their lives by the age of 30. Psychologist Eirini Flouri and colleagues analysed information from a study of children born in 1970.         
	When the children were aged 10, their mothers were asked to predict the age at which their child would leave school. The question was chosen to show the mothers belief in the capabilities of her daughter.        
	Flouri then compared this information with an assessment of the childrens self-confidence when they were thirty. It found that womens self esteem was linked to their mothers belief in them.

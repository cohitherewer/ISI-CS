                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Gunmen kill Zardari security officer
                              Big blow                            
	Karachi, July 22 (Reuters): Gunmen killed a senior security officer for Asif Ali Zardari, head of Pakistans ruling party, in the southern city of Karachi today, police and party officials said.        
	Zardari is the widower of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was killed in a suicide gun and bomb attack in the city of Rawalpindi on December 27 while campaigning for an election that her party, the Pakistan peoples Party (PPP), subsequently won.        
	Ejaz Durrani, a spokesman for Zardari in Karachi, said the assailants ambushed the security officer, Khalid Shehanshah, outside his house in Karachis upmarket Defence neighbourhood.        
	Zardari, who was in Islamabad when the attack took place, condemned the killing.        
	The attackers got out of a white car and opened fire as Shehanshah was standing outside his house, provincial interior minister Zulfiqar Mirza told reporters.         
	Shehanshah was a member of Bhuttos security escort on the day she was killed.        
	Mirza declined to speculate who could have been behind the Shehanshahs killing, but said it was aimed at destabilising the three-and-a-half-month old coalition led by Zardaris party.        
	First there were bomb blasts in the city and now they have killed someone who was very close to our party, he said, alluding to a series of small blasts in Karachi earlier this month.Zardari returned to Pakistan at the weekend after a long stay with his daughters in Dubai.        
	Sharif to stay away        
	Former Pakistan Premier and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief Nawaz Sharif has decided to stay away from a crucial meeting of the PPP-led coalition tomorrow that will discuss problems confronting the country and forge a strategy to counter terrorism.        
	Sharifs brother, Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif, will represent the PML-N at the meeting to be held in Islamabad, party sources said.         
	The meeting has been convened by Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani.        
	Gilani last week called Sharif, who is in London, to invite him to the meeting. But PML-N sources said Sharif had extended his stay in Britain to be with his wife who recently underwent a major surgery.        
	The sources said Shahbaz, who is president of the PML-N, will convey the partys views on fighting terrorism at the meeting. Shahbaz is also expected to convey the partys intention to present the war against terror for a thorough debate in parliament.        
	Senior PML-N leaders have also stressed the need for the PPP to deliver on its commitment to reinstate judges who were deposed by President Pervez Musharraf during last years emergency.        
	Sharifs decision to stay away from the meeting comes after media reports said that the PML-N had agreed to stay in the ruling coaltion only if the government took concrete steps to restore deposed judges and impeach Musharraf by August 15.        
	Addressing PML-N workers in London last week, Sharif said he intended to hold a final round of talks with Zardari to resolve differences between the two parties.

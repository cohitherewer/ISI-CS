	Islamabad, Jan. 31 (Reuters): A group of retired senior military officers said today President Pervez Musharraf should hand over power to the judge he sacked three months ago to ensure national elections are fair.
    
	The backing for deposed supreme court chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry from old generals, air marshals, admirals and intelligence chiefs coincided with protests by lawyers in support of the judge and the independence of the judiciary. General Musharrafs continuation in power is damaging to the country. He should quit, retired Air Marshal Asghar Khan told journalists after a meeting of a committee formed to make recommendations. He should hand over power to Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, he told a news conference in an Islamabad hotel.
    
	Pakistans western allies hope the vote on February 18 will restore stability after months of unrest.

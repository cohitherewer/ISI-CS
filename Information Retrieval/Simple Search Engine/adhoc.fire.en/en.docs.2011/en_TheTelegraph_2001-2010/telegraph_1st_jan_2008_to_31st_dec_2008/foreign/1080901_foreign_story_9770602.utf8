	London, Aug. 31: The worlds biggest and most expensive scientific experiment has been hit by a last-minute legal challenge, amid claims that the research could bring about the end of the world.         
	Critics of the Large Hadron Collider  a 4.4-billion machine due to be switched on in ten days time  have lodged a lawsuit at the European Court for Human Rights against the 20 countries, including the UK, that fund the project.         
	The device is designed to replicate conditions that existed just a fraction of a second after the Big Bang, and its creators hope it will unlock the secrets of how the universe began.         
	However, opponents fear the machine, which will smash pieces of atoms together at high speed and generate temperatures of more than a trillion degrees centigrade, may create a mini black hole that could tear the earth apart.        
	Scientists involved in the project have dismissed the fears as absurd and insist that extensive safety assessments on the 17 mile long particle accelerator have demonstrated that it is safe.         
	The legal battle comes as the European Nuclear Research Centre, in Geneva, prepares to send the first beam of particles around the machine at the official switch on, on September 10.         
	Opponents of the project had hoped to obtain an injunction from the European Court of Human Rights that would block the collider from being turned on at all, but the court rejected the application on Friday morning.         
	However, the court will rule on allegations that the experiment violates the right to life under the European Convention of Human Rights.         
	Professor Otto Rssler, a German chemist at the Eberhard Karls University of Tbingen who is one of the scientists who submitted the complaint to the court, said: CERN itself has admitted that mini black holes could be created when the particles collide, but they dont consider this a risk.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       San Diego university drug ring busted
                            
	Los Angeles, May 7 (Reuters): Nearly 100 people were arrested in an undercover investigation of a massive drug ring at San Diego State University in Southern California that authorities said today was run largely by students and was stunning in its size and sophistication.        
	A total of 96 people, 75 of them students, were taken into custody on drug-related charges at the 30,000-student campus during Operation Sudden Fall, which began one year ago with the death of a female student from a cocaine overdose.        
	Police arrested 18 of the students yesterday morning and said raids had recovered 23 kg of marijuana, 48 marijuana plants, 350 Ecstasy pills and 30 vials of hash oil, as well as cocaine, psychedelic mushrooms, methamphetamine and illicit prescription drugs.        
	Also seized in the operation, spearheaded by the US Drug Enforcement Administration and local authorities, were a shotgun, three semi-automatic pistols, brass knuckles and $60,000 in cash.        
	The stunning thing is that it was on the college campus itself and really catering to the campus crowd, DEA spokesman Garrison Courtney said.         
	To actually have people in college this sophisticated and operating on this level is really unusual. I would call it a light cartel without the violence.        
	Prosecutors said one of the students accused of dealing cocaine was one month away from being awarded a masters degree in homeland security and worked as a community service officer for the campus police department.

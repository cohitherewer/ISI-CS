	Beijing, July 27 (AP): Thick pollution blanketed the Chinese capital today, but a city environmental official pledged that the air quality would be good by the time the Beijing Olympics start in 12 days.        
	The grayish haze was one of the worst seen in Beijing in the past month despite tough traffic restrictions imposed a week ago to help reduce pollution. Visibility was a half mile in parts of the city.         
	At the opening of the athletes village today, the complex was invisible from the nearby main Olympic green.        
	The citys notoriously polluted air remains one of the biggest question marks hanging over the Games, which begin August 8.        
	The air quality in August will be good, Du Shaozhong, the deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, told reporters today.        
	Du blamed the thick haze on a combination of fog and light wind unable to blow away the pollution, but he said pollution levels now are 20 per cent lower than one year ago in similar weather conditions. He did not provide any details.        
	Our job is to decrease the pollution as much as possible, but sometimes it is very common to have fog in Beijing at this time, Du said.        
	Olympic athletes have been trickling into Beijing, but are expected to begin arriving in larger numbers this week. Some, though, were headed to training sites in South Korea, Japan and other places to avoid the Beijing air until the last possible minute.        
	No, it doesnt really look so good, but as I said, yesterday was better, said Gunilla Lindberg, an International Olympic Committee vice-president from Sweden who is staying in the athletes village.         
	Jacques Rogge, the president of the IOC, has warned that outdoor endurance events will be postponed if the air quality is poor.        
	Drastic efforts to curb pollution include pulling half of Beijings 3.3 million vehicles off the roads, closing factories in the city and in half a dozen surrounding provinces, and halting most construction in the capital. Some 300,000 heavily-polluting vehicles, such as aging industrial trucks, have been banned since July 1.

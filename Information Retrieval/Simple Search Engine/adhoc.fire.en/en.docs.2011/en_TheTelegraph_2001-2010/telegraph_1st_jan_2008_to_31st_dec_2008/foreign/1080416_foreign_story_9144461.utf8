The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bruni reveals passion for Bard 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bruni reveals passion for Bard 
  - FRENCH FIRST LADY KEEN TO VISIT STRATFORD          ANITA SINGH                          TWO SONNETS A DAY                                      
	Paris, April 15: Frances First Lady Carla Bruni has disclosed a secret passion  the works of William Shakespeare.         
	After charming the British during the recent state visit of her husband, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Bruni is planning a return visit in search of the Bard. Im keen to visit Stratford because I have such a love of Shakespeare, the former supermodel tells British Airways magazine High Life. My friend Marianne Faithfull  or my dear professor, as I like to call her  insists that I read a couple of his sonnets every day.         
	Seasoned Bruni-watchers will know that she is of a literary persuasion.        
	The 40-year-old beauty counts folk singing among her many accomplishments and her latest album, No Promises, sets the poems of W.B. Yeats, W.H. Auden and Emily Dickinson to music.         
	While Britain has fallen for Bruni, her talents are not appreciated in all corners of the world. A hospital in Cambodia has refused a donation raised from the sale of a nude picture of Bruni, on the grounds of morality.         
	Beat Richner, a Swiss paeditrician who runs the Kantha Bopha Childrens Hospital Association, turned down an offer of $91,000  the sum paid in a Christies auction last week for a 1993 photograph of Bruni, shot for Italian Vogue. My decision was taken out of respect for our patients and their mothers, he told Le Matin Dimanche.         
	Accepting money obtained from exploitation of the female body would be perceived as an insult. In Cambodia use of nudity is not understood in the way it is in the West, he added.         
	He would not allow the Kantha Bopha Childrens Hospital Association to be involved in the media exploitation of Madame Bruni.

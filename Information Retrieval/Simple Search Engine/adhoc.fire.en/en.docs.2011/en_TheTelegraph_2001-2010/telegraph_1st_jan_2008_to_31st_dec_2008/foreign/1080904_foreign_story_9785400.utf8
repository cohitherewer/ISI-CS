	Naked rambler    
	 Berlin, Sept. 3 (Reuters): A naked German hiker has vowed to carry on rambling in the nude despite spending 10 days in jail for breaking public nudity laws.      
	Thomas Kranig, a spokesman for the administrative court in Ansbach, said Siegfried Grawert went to jail because he refused to pay a fine of 500 euros assessed for violating the public nudity code.      
	Grawert, a janitor, told a local German newspaper he planned to continue campaigning for the right to partake in organised all-natural hikes. Naked joggers have been fined in the past for running through forests wearing nothing but shoes.

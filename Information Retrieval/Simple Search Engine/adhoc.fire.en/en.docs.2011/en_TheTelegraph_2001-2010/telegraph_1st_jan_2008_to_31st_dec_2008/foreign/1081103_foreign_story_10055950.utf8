										      K.P. NAYAR                                  
	Washington, Nov. 2: French President Nicolas Sarkozy did one better than Pakistans Asif Ali Zardari yesterday when he told Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin that his wife is so hot in bed and praised a soft pornographic film in which someone impersonating Palin plays her part.        
	It was only during the seventh minute of a telephone conversation when the callers told Palin that they were pranksters did John McCains running mate realise that she was not talking to Sarkozy.        
	Zardari had famously flirted with Palin when he met her in New York in September offering to hug her and telling her that she looked gorgeous. Palin had played along, enhancing the notion that she was a lightweight and had no experience in dealing with foreign leaders.        
	But unlike the Zardari-Palin exchange which made it only to the elite US media, her conversation with two Montreal-based comedians, Marc-Antoine Audette and Sebastien Trudel, is repeatedly hitting the airwaves here just before America goes to the polls on Tuesday.        
	One of the comedians pretended to be Sarkozy and the other faked the role of his aide.        
	The fake Sarkozy told Palin during the phone call that he shared with her a passion for hunting, proposed that they hunt together and then said something absolutely outrageous.        
	I just love killing those animals. Mmm, mmm, take away life, that is so fun.        
	But Palin did not catch on. Instead, she replied coyly: Well, I think we could have a lot of fun together while we are getting work done. We can kill two birds with one stone that way.        
	The caller then told Palin that You know we have a lot in common also, because from my arse I can see Belgium.         
	That was a reference to Palins highly ridiculed answer in an interview that she knew about foreign policy because she could see Russia from land here in Alaska, her home state where she is governor.        
	But Palin still did not catch on.        
	Instead she told the French President that we are right next door to different countries that we all need to be working with, yes.        
	The callers then laid it on thick.        
	The fake Sarkozy referred to Canadian singer Steph Carse as Canadas Prime Minister, but obviously Palin did not know that Stephen Harper is the Prime Minister of Canada.        
	She replied: Well, he (Carse) is doing fine and yeah, when you come into a position underestimated it gives you an opportunity to prove the pundits and the critics wrong. You work that much harder.         
	The Quebec comedy duo, known as The Masked Avengers, are famous for tricking celebrities and politicians including Sarkozy himself.        
	Palin complimented the fake Sarkozy on his beautiful wife, Carla Bruni, and asked him to give her a big hug for her.        
	You added a lot of energy to your country with that beautiful family of yours, Palin said.        
	The prankster responded by complimenting Palin on a notorious Hustler porn film, Nailin Paylin, which he said was a documentary of her life. Oh good, thank you, Palin said.        
	Palin also reassured the fake Sarkozy when he said he would not want to bring Vice-President Dick Cheney on a hunting trip. Cheney once accidentally shot a hunting partner. Ill be a careful shot, she promised.         
	The pranksters got Palin to reveal a potential ambition for the top job in Washington. Asked if she would like to eventually become President, the Alaska governor replied: Well, maybe in eight years.        
	At the seventh minute, the callers identified themselves and the Canadian radio station that was airing the conversation.        
	Ohhh, have we been pranked? Palin asked in surprise before an aide quickly ended the call.        
	Palin campaign spokesperson Tracey Schmitt later said: Governor Palin was mildly amused to learn that she had joined the ranks of heads of state, including president Sarkozy and other celebrities, in being targeted by these pranksters. Cest la vie.        
	Obamas campaign spokesperson Robert Gibbs, said: I am glad we check out our calls before we hand the phone to Barack Obama.        
	Throughout the call, the pranksters gave ample opportunity for Palin to recognise that the caller was not Sarkozy, if only the vice-presidential aspirant knew facts about the world. Audette, who pretended to be Sarkozy, referred to quot;my special American adviser Johnny Hallyday quot; and Palin did not question that assertion. Hallyday is Frances equivalent of Elvis Presley.        
	Audette told Palin he hoped she would make a good President some day. quot;Maybe in eight years, quot; replied Palin, who giggled like a schoolgirl off and on during the seven minutes on the phone.

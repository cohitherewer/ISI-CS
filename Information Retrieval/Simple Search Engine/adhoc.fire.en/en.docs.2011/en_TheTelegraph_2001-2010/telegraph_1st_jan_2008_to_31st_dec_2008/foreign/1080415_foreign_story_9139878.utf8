	Islamabad, April 14 (AP): Pakistan has changed the route for the Islamabad leg of the Beijing Olympics torch relay today.        
	While downplaying the prospect of protests like those that have plagued the torch relay at other cities, Arif Hassan, president of the Pakistan Olympic Association, today said security will be tight for the event. Security personnel will run alongside the torch on the premises of a sprawling sports complex.        
	Hassan earlier had announced plans for the torch relay to pass along a broad, tree-lined avenue in the heart of a government district in Islamabad.        
	Asked at a news conference whether the route has been altered because of security threats or to protect it from possible anti-China protests, Hassan would only say the change was aimed at helping organisers hold the relay smoothly. The flame will arrive early on Wednesday morning from Muscat, Oman.        
	Keeping all the environments in view, we felt that this would be something that we can handle in a better way, Hassan said. We are ready to receive the torch on its journey of harmony and share the dreams.        
	This is a sporting event in which other issues if included would have very serious repercussions, Hassan added. I think sports should be treated as sports which can be used for the development of peace in the world.        
	He said Pakistan had taken all security measures to ensure the relays visit to Islamabad passed without trouble.        
	In Beijing, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf criticised attempts to politicise the Olympics Games. We think that politics must be kept out of sports, Musharraf said in a speech today to a Beijing university audience.        
	China is one of Pakistans closest allies and a major source of investment, trade and military hardware.        
	Musharraf said that the torchs one-day relay in Islamabad would be uneventful, unlike disruptive protests it has met during legs in San Francisco, London and Paris by activists condemning Chinas human rights record and its handling of Tibet. Musharraf promised tight security in Pakistan.         
	There is not one man in Pakistan who would do anything against the interests of China, he said.        
	But he did warn against outsiders trying to disrupt the relay. We have to take care that there is no infiltration by some elements who are bent on disrupting our understanding and great relationship, Musharraf said without providing details. Any attempt by anyone to disrupt the process of the torch relay is condemned by Pakistan. Musharraf will wind up his six-day trip to China on April 15 with a visit to Xinjiang.

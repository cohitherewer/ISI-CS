                              Zuniga                            
	Mexico City, Dec. 25 (Reuters): A Mexican beauty queen and international pageant winner has been detained by police along with alleged drug traffickers who had assault rifles and cash.        
	Laura Zuniga, the 23-year-old Miss Sinaloa from the marijuana-producing Mexican state, was held with seven men at a military checkpoint in Guadalajara, police said on Tuesday.        
	She is the beauty queen of Sinaloa and was aboard an SUV with the weapons and several of the men, said a police spokesman from western Jalisco state, home to Guadalajara.        
	The spokesman said police and soldiers at the checkpoint on the outskirts of Mexicos second-largest city were tipped off that traffickers were moving through the area on Monday night. No one expected this young woman to be aboard, along with more than a dozen cell phones, lots of cash, pistols, bullets and two rifles.

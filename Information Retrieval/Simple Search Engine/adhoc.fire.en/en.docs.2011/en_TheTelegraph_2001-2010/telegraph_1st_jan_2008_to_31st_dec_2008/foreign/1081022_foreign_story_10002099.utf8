	Colombo, Oct. 21 (Reuters): Sri Lankan troops advanced deeper into areas held by the rebel Tamil Tigers after smashing through a 10 km trench line that has been the site of heavy combat for two months, the military said today.        
	With diplomatic pressure mounting from New Delhi since last week, officials said Sri Lankas government was planning trips to India and Pakistan to shore up support.        
	Today, the defence ministry said soldiers fought across massive earthen dams and trenches built by the LTTE at Akarrayankulam and Vannirakulam, amid heavy monsoon downpours. The army gave no casualty figures.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sarkozy son upsets mayoral race
                                                                                                               Sarkozy son upsets mayoral race
          HENRY SAMUEL                          Jean Sarkozy: Like Papa                                  
	Paris, Feb. 12: Nicolas Sarkozys spokesman withdrew from the mayoral election in the chic Paris suburb of Neuilly after one of the Presidents sons turned against him.        
	Jean Sarkozy, 21, the second of the Presidents three sons, and two associates, had campaigned for David Martinon. But they indicated on Sunday they would back another Right-wing candidate, raising speculation that Jean may himself compete.        
	A confidential poll leaked in the French press suggested that Martinon would have lost the election next month.        
	The French media drew parallels with Nicolas Sarkozys own rise to power as mayor of Neuilly in 1983 after back-stabbing his friend the official candidate and claiming the post for himself.        
	At the time, the 28 year-old mayor was said to have exclaimed: I screwed them all. He remained mayor until 2002.        
	Yesterday, Le Mondes front page cartoon showed Martinon with three daggers in his back. Holding another two, Jean Sarkozy asks his father: Is that OK? Am I doing it right, Papa? I taught him everything he knows, sighs his proud father, holding Martinons cloak.

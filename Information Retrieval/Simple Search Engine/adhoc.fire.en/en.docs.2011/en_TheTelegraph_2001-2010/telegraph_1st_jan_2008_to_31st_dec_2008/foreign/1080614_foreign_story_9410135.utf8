	Washington, June 13 (Reuters): Electrical power was restored in Washington today after a widespread failure and subway fire darkened downtown for nearly three hours and snarled traffic during the morning rush hour.        
	The department of homeland security said there appeared to be no link to terrorism.        
	The blackout area included the White House. According to an AFP correspondent, it appeared to be business as usual at the White House with a few less lights on. We are running on generator power, White House spokesman Tony Fratto said. The Eisenhower executive office building, where the Vice-Presidents office is located, had also been affected.         
	President George W. Bush was on a trip to Europe.        
	Pepco electric company officials said they did not yet know why a power substation in the northwest had failed around 7.30 am, leaving about 11,000 downtown customers in the dark.        
	A fire in the downtown Metro Centre stop started around the same time, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority said.        
	Pepco and WMATA officials said they did not know if the power failure and the fire were related. WMATA said it extinguished the fire and had restored service by 8.30, but warned commuters to expect delays of up to an hour.        
	The power failure forced the nearby Dupont Circle station to close because its long escalators were not moving. Several other downtown stops were darker than usual because they were running on backup power, WMATA said.        
	Temperatures were expected to approach 31 degrees Celsius later in the day, which could have disrupted work if government and private-sector offices were without air conditioning. The treasury department lost power during the failure.         
	Congress, the supreme court and the state department had power during the failure.        
	Buses and cars battled to get through major intersections where street lights were not working, until police arrived to direct traffic. At one intersection, pedestrians screamed at cars to stop and let the elderly cross the streets.        
	A police spokeswoman said there had been no reports of injuries or accidents related to the outage.        
	Iowa flooding        
	Officials in Iowas capital Des Moines urged residents threatened by the rising Des Moines river to evacuate today, calling the situation extremely dangerous. We are commencing a voluntary evacuation, Des Moines mayor Frank Cownie said.

	Paris, June 30: A soldier fired live rounds instead of blanks at spectators during a military show in France yesterday injuring 17 people, including five children.         
	One witness said there were seven or eight soldiers with guns taking part in a simulated exercise to free hostages, with one of them in the middle of hundreds of spectators pretending to be a terrorist. Suddenly, people were falling, we thought it was part of the exercise, and then we saw blood, the witness, who did not want to be named said. Immediately after the real shots were fired, an official shouted out over the loudspeakers: Cease fire!, he said. A three-year-old child was one of the spectators injured, and is in a critical condition.         
	Investigations have begun into the shooting, which a senior army officer said was almost certainly an unintentional mistake. But Frances defence minister said that an experienced soldier would not make such an error. A soldier, described as having a perfect record and no history of psychological problems, was detained following the shootings at a barracks outside the southwestern city of Carcassonne.         
	Herve Morin, Frances defence minister, said: I cannot rule out anything because I dont know what might be going on in a mans head. But he added that an experienced soldier would not confuse real bullets for blanks, and the two munitions were packed in different coloured magazines.         
	Security regulations were respected ... use of blanks requires a distance of at least 10 metres from the public and the public was more than 10 metres away, he said.

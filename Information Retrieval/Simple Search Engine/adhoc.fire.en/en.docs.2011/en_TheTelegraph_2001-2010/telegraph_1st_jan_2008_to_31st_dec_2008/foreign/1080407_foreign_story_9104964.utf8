The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | London singes China torch   Flame almost grabbed from TV anchor
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       London singes China torch     -  Flame almost grabbed from TV anchor
          AMIT ROY                           Gordon Brown (left) as the torch reaches10 Downing Street                                        
	London, April 6: Aamir Khan, beware. China received what can only be called a stinging chappal in the face when the Olympic torch was carried in London today.         
	The Bollywood star has announced that he will carry the torch with a prayer in my heart for the people of Tibet but if what has happened in London is a harbinger of the intensifying protest to come, his security could be at risk when the flame reaches Delhi on April 17.         
	In the biggest demonstrations seen in London since two million took part in the march against the Iraq war on February 15, 2003, tens of thousands of people braved snow to protest against the Chinese crackdown in Tibet.         
	There were scuffles all along the 31-mile route from Wembley Stadium in west London to Greenwich in the south as thousands of airborne, mounted and river unit police sought to protect the torchbearers.         
	There was a potentially nasty incident involving Konnie Huq, 32, a Bangladeshi television presenter who was visibly startled when a protester tried to wrestle the flame from her hand.         
	The man was knocked to the ground by the ring of police and burly Chinese torch attendants encircling Konnie but she was clearly unsettled.         
	I was bashed about a bit, she admitted later.         
	The torch will be in India during an 85,000-mile journey through 20 countries before ending up in Beijing on August 8 for the start of the Olympic Games.         
	Konnie said her decision to take part did not imply she condoned the Chinese oppression in Tibet but today the sight of what is being described as the torch of shame merely served to inflame the protesters who had turned up with Tibetan flags and banners.         
	Meanwhile, the police were accused of being over-aggressive in their handling of demonstrators, some of whom did menace the torchbearers.         
	Two people who tried to use a fire extinguisher to douse the flames were arrested. The pair, Martin Wyness and Ashley Darby, said the relay was a propaganda campaign by China to cover its appalling human rights record.         
	Like many people in the UK, we feel that China has no right parading the Olympic torch through London, they said. Our protest is not directed at the Chinese people whatsoever but instead at the brutal Chinese regime that rules them.         
	In India, actor Saif Ali Khan, who has confirmed that he will be taking part in the relay, has declared: I will definitely be taking part in the relay. Why shouldnt I? My government has not made any adverse statement against China and my stance is that of my government.         
	In marked contrast somewhat, British celebrities have shown more of an ability to think for themselves and slammed Gordon Brown for accepting the torch at the Prime Ministers residence at 10 Downing Street.         
	The actress Joanna Lumley, who disclosed her grandfather was the British political officer in Tibet in the late 1920s and a friend of the 13th Dalai Lama, said the torch had only served to throw light on the dark corners of China.         
	The Prime Minister came out to stand by the torch when it arrived at 10 Downing Street, while thousands of demonstrators who had gathered on the far side of Whitehall were kept well away by hundreds of policemen.         
	Brown posed for a picture but by this time the torch had become untouchable  the Prime Minister did not actually pick it up, thereby robbing the Chinese of a propaganda photograph.         
	Unlike Nicolas Sarkozy, the French President who has threatened to boycott the official opening ceremony, Brown has said he will go. But his position is slightly more complex because the next Olympics will be held in London in 2012.         
	Among todays celebrities, England batsman Kevin Pietersen could not be bothered to run. He strolled casually across Westminster Bridge as though taking an easy single against an Indian fielding side.         
	There were Chinese in the crowd, especially students, who had come to support their government.         
	Vincent Sun, 24, from Shanghai, who is working in the UK as a service engineer, said: Im here to support the Beijing Olympic Games and the most important thing in the world is to have one China with Tibet as one part of China.         
	The Chinese ambassador in London, Fu Ying, was due to join the run in front her embassy near Oxford Circus but instead made a safer appearance in Chinatown in Soho.         
	For the last part of its journey, the Chinese humiliation was complete when the flame had to extinguished and the unlit torch carried in a bus.         
	Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell denied that the running of the Olympic torch relay through London represented an endorsement of the Chinese governments repressive policies in Tibet.         
	The pictures that will be beamed around the world of peaceful and lawful demonstration will make a very clear statement about the democratic freedom that we cherish in this country, she declared.         
	Hundreds lined Bayswater Road, many wearing Tibetan flags and carrying banners that read Stop the killing in Tibet, No Olympic torch in Tibet and China talk to Dalai Lama.         
	Helping to lead the chants was Buddhist monk Ngawang Khyentse, who summed up: We cant just remain silent. We have no other choice than to protest because there is no other voice for Tibetans inside Tibet, so we have to speak out for human rights. At the very least, the British government has to speak out and condemn the crackdown in Tibet. They must not keep silent.

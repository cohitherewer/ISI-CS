The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Somali pirates grab oil tanker
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Somali pirates grab oil tanker
                            
	Dubai, Nov. 17 (Reuters): Somali pirates have captured a fully laden Saudi supertanker far off east Africa, seizing the biggest vessel ever hijacked with a cargo of oil worth over $100 million in an attack that pushed world crude prices higher.        
	The US Fifth Fleet said the Sirius Star was being taken to the pirate haven of Eyl, in northern Somalia, today. The hijacking of the Saudi Aramco-owned vessel yesterday is certain to add to pressure for concerted international action to tackle the growing threat posed by pirates from anarchic Somalia to one of the worlds busiest shipping routes.        
	This is unprecedented. Its the largest ship that weve seen pirated, said Lieutenant Nathan Christensen, a spokesman for the Fifth Fleet. Its three times the size of an aircraft carrier.        
	The Sirius Star held as much as two million barrels of oil  more than one quarter of Saudi Arabias daily exports. The hijacking helped lift global oil prices over $1 to more than $58 a barrel, although they later lost some gains.         
	The hijacking yesterday, 450 nautical miles (830 km) southeast of Mombasa, Kenya, was in an area far beyond the Gulf of Aden, where most of the attacks on shipping have taken place.         
	The pirates have been getting bolder.        
	The Sirius Star had been heading for the US via the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, skirting the continent instead of heading through the Gulf of Aden and then the Suez Canal. The ship, at 318,000 deadweight tons, was the largest ever captured by pirates. There were no reports of damage, Christensen said. He declined to say if the US navy was considering taking action to rescue the tanker, which had 25 crew from Croatia, Britain, the Philippines, Poland and Saudi Arabia.

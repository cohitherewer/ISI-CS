	Kathmandu, May 23: Nepals King Gyanendra has left the Narayanhitti Palace for a weekend sojourn in the sylvan Nagarjuna forests in the foothills of Kathmandu.        
	Gyanendra, accompanied by his wife Komal and grandchildren, will stay in a palace located inside the Nagarjuna forests.         
	The royal entourage gave a slip to reporters who thronged the Narayanhitti Palace following rumours that the king is leaving the seat of the Shah dynasty once and for all ahead of the monarchys end.         
	However, palace sources told The Telegraph that Gyanendra would return to Narayanhitti on Sunday evening. There is no question of the king not returning home, a source said.         
	Gyanendras aged mother, Queen Mother Ratna, continues to live in Narayanhitti with her personal staff.         
	The sources said Gyanendras son Crown Prince Paras,too, has moved into the forest palace for the weekend.        
	Gyanendras weekend sojourn coincides with the eight-party ruling coalitions preparations for the first meeting of the recently elected constituent assembly on May 28.        
	 The meeting is expected to adopt a resolution scrapping the 239-year-old monarchy.

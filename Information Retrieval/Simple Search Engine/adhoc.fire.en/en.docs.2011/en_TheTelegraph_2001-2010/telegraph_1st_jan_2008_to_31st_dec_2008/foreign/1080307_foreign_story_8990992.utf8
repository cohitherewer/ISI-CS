                                                                                                               Kayani: Army out of politics
                              A shopkeeper uses a battery-powered light to show mobile phones to his customers during a power blackout in Karachi on Thursday. The outage took place after the countrys main power utility cut supply because the citys power company had not paid bills amounting to $554 million (AFP)                            
	Islamabad, March 6 (PTI): Army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani today said the military would stay out of the political process and that it would support the next government.        
	President Pervez Musharrafs hand-picked general told a meeting of top army commanders that the military fully stands behind the democratic process and is committed to play its constitutional role in support of the elected government.        
	 A military statement also quoted Kayani as saying that the army will stay out of the political process. The general hoped that the army is not dragged into any unnecessary controversy.        
	Kayanis statement comes seven days after the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) decided at a joint meeting that they would banish the army from politics.        
	At the meeting, Kayani rejected the impression that the army is distancing itself from Musharraf.        
	He stressed on the need for understanding and said a schism at any level would not be in Pakistans interests. Kayanis support comes as a boost for Musharraf, whose supporters were defeated in the February 18 general election.        
	He emphasised the importance of the constitutional relationship between the army and the national command structure. Sources said that the national command structure includes the President, who heads the National Security Council and the National Command Authority, the body that controls Pakistans nuclear arsenal.         
	Since he was appointed as army chief by Musharraf in November last year, Kayani has barred army officers from meeting politicians. He also recalled hundreds of army officers serving in civilian departments.        
	Saying that he was satisfied with the peaceful elections, Kayani said he was optimistic that there would be a harmonised relationship between various pillars of the state, as provided in the Constitution, in order to maximise national effort.        
	Kayani also reaffirmed the armys commitment to the solidarity and integrity of Pakistan which is possible only with the full support of the people. He appreciated the whole-hearted effort of officers and men alike to defeat the threat posed to the security of Pakistan.        
	 Kayani also informed the army commanders at the meeting on tangible progress made on various issues relating to Year of the Soldier with respect to accommodation, education, rations and uniform.

	Washington, May 21: Barack Obama, exuding confidence after winning the majority of his partys elected nominating delegates last night, has quietly begun assembling his team for taking over the Democratic Party and finetuning its apparatus for the presidential election in November.        
	Two top operatives of the Democratic National Committee have begun discussions with the Illinois Senators campaign officials on using the party machine for raising funds for the November election, according to reports here today.        
	The talks are expected to lead towards installing Obamas men and women in key party committees as a prelude to his formal nomination.         
	In an effort to bring round supporters of Hillary Clinton and unite the party behind his eventual candidacy, Obama, however, stopped short of declaring himself as the Democratic presidential nominee last night.         
	But his raucous rally in Iowa last night had all the trappings of a victory celebration. It was in Iowa in January that Obama emerged as an unlikely insurgent in the 2008 presidential race and unexpectedly defeated Hillary in the first party caucus of this poll season.        
	Fifteen months ago, in the depths of winter, it was in this great state where we took the first steps of an unlikely journey to change America, Obama told his supporters. Tonight, in the fullness of spring, with the help of those who stood up from Portland to Louisville, we have returned to Iowa with a majority of delegates elected by the American people and you have put us within reach of the Democratic nomination for President of the United States.        
	Obamas campaign manager David Axelrod later explained to reporters the significance of that statement. I dont think anyone has won the majority of pledged delegates and not been the nominee of the party so it is obviously very important.         
	Hillarys landslide victory over Obama in Kentucky last night was overshadowed by the latters impressive win in Oregon, but more significantly by his crossing of a threshold by bagging the majority of elected party delegates.         
	But Hillary pledged to remain in the race until the bitter end of the remaining party primaries on June 3. Tonight we have achieved an important victory, the former First Lady and New York Senator said at her own rally in Kentucky. We are winning the popular vote and I am more determined than ever to see that every vote is cast and every ballot counted.        
	Yesterday, Obama began the day as polling opened in Oregon and Kentucky just 17 short of a majority of elected party delegates. His campaign estimated last night on the basis of partial returns from the two states that voted yesterday that Obama only needed 25 more superdelegates to clinch an absolute majority at the party convention in Denver in August.         
	Super delegates are party officials of various categories who are not elected primaries, but have a decisive say in the nominating process this year because of a close fight between two potential presidential nominees. There are 221 super delegates who are yet to declare their preference for either candidate.        
	Hillary has, however, muddied the arithmetic of the partys nomination by changing the goal posts.         
	She insists that 2025 is no longer the break even count of delegates for securing the partys nomination and insists that the magic figure is 2210. That figure would count in party delegates from Michigan and Florida who are barred from the partys August convention for breaking rules in holding their state primaries.        
	Hillary won both states, but in Michigan Obama did not put his name on the ballot and neither candidate campaigned in Florida. A key party meeting is to settle the dispute on May31.

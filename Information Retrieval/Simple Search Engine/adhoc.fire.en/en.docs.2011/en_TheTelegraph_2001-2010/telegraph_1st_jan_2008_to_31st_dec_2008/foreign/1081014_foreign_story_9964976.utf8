	Bangkok, Oct. 13 (Reuters): Thailands Queen Sirikit today attended the funeral of a protester killed in clashes with police last week, giving explicit royal backing to a five-month-old street campaign to oust the elected government.        
	After chants of Long Live Her Majesty from thousands of members of the Peoples Alliance for Democracy (PAD), the queen told Jinda Radappanyawuthi, father of 28-year-old victim Angkana, that his daughter had died in a noble cause.        
	Her Majesty said my daughter was a good woman since she had helped the nation and preserved the monarchy, Jinda told reporters after a brief audience at the end of the Buddhist cremation.         
	Angkana died from chest injuries after the police fired teargas into a crowd of PAD protesters blockading the parliament on Tuesday. Another man died in a car bomb and nearly 500 were hurt in the worst street violence in Bangkok in 16 years.

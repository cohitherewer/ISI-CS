          NICK SQUIRES AND TOM CHIVERS                          Funds furore                                  
	Sydney, March 10: An ugly family row has broken out over the will of Hollywood actor Heath Ledger, who died from a drug overdose in New York in January.         
	The late actors father has called on his estranged brothers to stop commenting publicly on how Ledgers fortune will be divided up.         
	Ledgers uncles have claimed that his two-year-old daughter, Matilda, and her mother, actress Michelle Williams, 27, will not get a share of the estate because the Brokeback Mountain star left all his money to his parents and sisters.         
	The two uncles, Mike and Haydn Ledger, said Matilda was not included in the will because it was written before her birth and not updated.         
	Im concerned for Matilda, said one of the uncles, Hadyn Ledger. I have concerns about the distribution of funds. But the actors father, Kim, dismissed those claims. Matilda is our absolute priority, and Michelle is an integral part of our family. They will be taken care of and thats how Heath would want it to be.        
	Kim Ledger, who was in Los Angeles, however called on his siblings not to air the familys dirty laundry in public. It is sad at this extremely difficult time in our lives, while we are grieving the loss of our beloved son that estranged family members publicly discuss matters they have not been privy to in the past or now, he said.        
	We hope for Matildas sake they will remain dignified.                             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

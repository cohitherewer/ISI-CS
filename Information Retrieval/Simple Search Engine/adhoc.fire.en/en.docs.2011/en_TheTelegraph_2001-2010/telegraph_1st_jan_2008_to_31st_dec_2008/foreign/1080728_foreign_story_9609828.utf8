          J.HEMANTH                               
	Kathmandu, July 27: Nepal cant get over an oath in Indias national language.        
	Student bodies hit the streets for the fifth straight day today, demanding Parmanand Jhas resignation for having taken his oath as the new Vice-President in Hindi on July 23.        
	Effigies of Jha, who hails from the Terai plains bordering India in southern Nepal, were burnt in several cities. The students demanded the Vice-President take his oath again, in Nepali, or resign immediately.        
	The protests, which disrupted traffic in many towns, especially in the Kathmandu valley, stopped Jha from attending the swearing-in ceremony of the new chairman of the Constituent Assembly, held in the presidential residence.        
	The 61-year-old remained unrepentant, insisting he had done nothing wrong by taking the oath in Hindi. He argued the act was in tune with the policy of his party, the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (MJF), which had promised to make Hindi a national language in its manifesto.         
	The Supreme Court is to hear a petition demanding a fresh swearing-in. Jha has said he will accept the verdict.        
	Nepali nationalistic sentiments have also rocked the Constituent Assembly, with Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai today accusing Jha of having insulted his office. The Maoist number two went on to allege that Jha had taken his oath in Hindi deliberately to arouse passions.         
	Jhas party chief, Upendra Yadav, argued that Hindi was the spoken language in the entire Madhes region. Referring to the protests, he said an attempt was being made to divide people on the lines of language and ethnicity.        
	Nepals first President, Ram Baran Yadav, also a Madhesi, appeared to play down the controversy, urging people to maintain national unity and solidarity.

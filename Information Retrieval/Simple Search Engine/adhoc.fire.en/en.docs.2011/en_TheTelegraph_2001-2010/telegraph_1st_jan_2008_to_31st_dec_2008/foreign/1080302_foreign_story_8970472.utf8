The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 80m home is most expensive
                                                                                                               80m home is most expensive
          BEN FARMER                          The five-storey property in Kensington, London                                  
	London, March 1: A home with more than 10 bedrooms and an underground swimming pool has become the worlds most expensive single residential dwelling after being sold for 80 million.        
	The detached Victorian villa in west London broke the previous record of 67 million for the London home of Indian steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal. However, estate agents yesterday predicted the record would soon be broken again, with other properties already on the market for similar sums.        
	The five-storey house in Upper Phillimore Gardens, Kensington, has been undergoing extensive development for the past 18 months and will not be complete until April.        
	The property is believed to have at least 10 bedrooms, an underground swimming pool, a gym, a sauna, a cinema and a secure panic room in case of intruders or an attack.        
	Knight Frank, the estate agents who handled the sale, would not comment on the buyer, but it was reported to be Elena Franchuk, a Ukrainian businesswoman and philanthropist who is a friend of Sir Elton John.        
	Until 1997, the property was a girls preparatory school. It was bought in June 2006 by a firm of developers specialising in exclusive properties.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | The trio who hold the key
                                                                                                               The trio who hold the key
          
	March 16 (Reuters): How events unfold in Tibet will closely involve three Chinese officials, whose backgrounds are given below.        
	Old-hand Hu        
	Chinese President Hu Jintao has not publicly commented on the latest unrest in Tibet, but especially with his long experience in the region, he is sure to be one of the dominant decision-makers behind the scenes.        
	A water project engineer by training, Hu spent many years working in Gansu, the western province neighbouring Tibet, and he earned his political stripes in dirt-poor Guizhou and then Tibet, where he was Communist Party boss from 1988 to 1992.        
	As Tibets top official, Hu oversaw a harsh crackdown on the last major wave of protests to shake the region in 1988-89. His long-time political patron, the reformist Communist Hu Yaobang  no relation of Hu Jintao  fell from office partly because party elders blamed his more relaxed policies toward Tibet for stoking unrest.        
	Earlier this month, Hu said that stability in Tibet has a bearing on the stability of China as a whole.        
	Top cop         
	Chinas top domestic security official, Zhou Yongkang, has not served in Tibet but will have a powerful say in how the government handles the latest unrest.        
	Zhou was public security minister from 2002 to 2007. As the countrys top cop, he pushed efforts to combat police abuse and extended detentions without charge. But he also often urged officers to be tough against threats from ethnic separatism.        
	Last year, Zhou was promoted to the Chinese Communist Partys politburo standing committee, the innermost circle of power.         
	Tough novice        
	The current top official in Tibet, Zhang Qingli, is a Han Chinese whose most notable attribute is his complete lack of work experience in Tibet until he was made its Communist Party secretary in late 2005.        
	As Tibets Party boss, Zhang outranks its ethnic Tibetan government chief, Qiangba Puncog. Zhang has taken a notably tough line in Tibet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Paks voice of rigging
                                                                                                               Paks voice of rigging
                              Qayyum: Ticket advice                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 15 (PTI): The Pakistan elections will be massively rigged, the attorney general, Malik Qayyum, says in a a purported audio recording.         
	However, Qayyum later denied making any such remarks. He also threatened to sue the US-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) which released the recording.         
	In the recording, Qayyum appears to be advising an unidentified person on what political party that person should approach to become a candidate in the elections. Qayyum, a retired judge who is a close aide of President Musharraf, is heard telling the person in Urdu and Punjabi to leave former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and seek a ticket from the party that will massively rig to get their own people to win.         
	They will massively rig to get their own people to win. If you can get a ticket from these guys, take it, Qayyum says in the recording. It was not known which party he was referring to. HRW claimed that the recording was made during a phone interview with a media person on November 21 last year. Qayyum, while still on the phone, took a call on another phone and his side of that conversation was recorded.        
	 Qayyum said the comments in the audio recording were false and baseless. I would not be foolish enough to make such comments and, besides, I have nothing to do with the polls. I totally deny it (having made the remarks). It is very easy to doctor anybodys voice, Qayyum said.

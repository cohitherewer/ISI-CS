	London, June 4: Children grow up happier if their grandparents are involved in their upbringing, researchers have said.         
	Academics at Oxford University and the Institute of Education, London, found that grandparents can help young children because they often have more time to spend with them than working parents. They are good at solving their problems as well as discussing their future plans. The survey of more than 1,500 children also discovered that grandparents could help keep them calm during crises such as divorce. Researchers found that one grandmother in three regularly looked after a grandchild, while 40 per cent helped out occasionally.         
	But they believe that more grandparents should become involved in care to improve their grandchildrens well-being, and that the government should do more to recognise their importance to society.         
	Prof. Ann Buchanan, the director of the Centre for Research into Parenting and Children in the Department of Social Policy and Social Work at Oxford University, said: What was especially interesting was the link between involved grandparents and adolescent well-being. Closeness was not enough: only grandparents who got stuck in had this positive impact on their grandchildren.        
	The survey encountered one teenager who claimed that his grandmother taught us to read and write, and another whose grandparents discussed with him not only what GCSEs to take but what universities he should apply to and what career to take.

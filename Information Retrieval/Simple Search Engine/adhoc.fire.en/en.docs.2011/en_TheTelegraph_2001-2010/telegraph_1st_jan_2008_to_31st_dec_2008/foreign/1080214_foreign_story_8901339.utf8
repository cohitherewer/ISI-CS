The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Saudi vow to reconcile divorced couple
                                                                                                               Saudi vow to reconcile divorced couple
                            
	Riyadh, Feb. 13 (Reuters): Saudi Arabia has promised to allow a couple who were forced to divorce by a religious court to live together again, a UN official said today, ending a case that has embarrassed the Islamic state abroad.        
	Fatima Azzaz and Mansour al-Timani were forced to separate in 2006 after her brothers persuaded judges that her husband was not of sufficiently prestigious tribal stock.         
	It is one of a series of cases that have drawn international criticism of human rights in Saudi Arabia, a key US ally which is also the worlds top oil exporter.         
	I met Fatima and Mansour and they are both in a terrible state, they are both suffering, Yakin Erturk, UN Human Rights Councils special rapporteur on violence against women said.         
	I have been assured by the authorities this issue will be dealt with and, God willing, they will reunite, she told reporters after a 10-day fact-finding trip to the country of 24 million.        
	Fatima Azzaz is being held in a government home for orphans with a young son. She refuses to return to her family home as required by a court order divorcing her from her husband, who has custody of their daughter.

	Testing driver    
	London, July 9: A woman has finally passed her driving test 27 years and 450 lessons after she first took to the road, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Teresa Clarke, 62, went through 20 driving instructors, spent 15,000 in fees and had 450 hours of tuition before finally winning her full driving licence.      
	Clarke, who first donned her L-plates in 1981, failed 12 tests, cancelled a further 35 and had 50 mock exams. Now, following her latest effort to ditch her L-plates, on June 26, she is free to get behind the wheel of a car.       
	It took a long time for it to sink in when I was told I had passed, said Clarke, of Wroxham, Norfolk. I kissed the woman examiner.       
	Clarke, who has yet to purchase a car of her own, puts her success down to an improved focus.      
	My concentration is much better now  I dont drink coffee or tea anymore and have no additives, she said. She said she tried not to think about how much time and money she spent on learning to drive. Her instructor Patrick Beasley. said he had to be very firm with his extraordinary student.     
	Shady fuel    
	New York (Reuters): A Nevada brothel is trying to stimulate business by offering free petrol. Clients of the Shady Lady Ranch will get a $50 gas voucher if they fork out $300  worth about one hours worth of services  at the brothel in Beatty, Nevada, 209km northwest of Las Vegas. Owner James Davis said he already has had to order another $1,000 set of petrol vouchers because the first $1,000 were spent in one week.      
	Its rocking along. Were doing quite well. June and July historically are not big months, said Davis, who is co-owner of the brothel along with his wife Bobbi. The $50 rebate would roughly cover the cost of a round trip drive from Las Vegas to the ranch.    
	Lost art    
	London (Reuters): A painting by French artist Jean-Antoine Watteau presumed lost and unseen by the public for almost 200 years fetched $24.4 million at auction on Tuesday, as the art market continued to shrug off growing economic gloom. Christies said the amount, around three times expectations, was a record for any French old master painting at auction. La Surprise, depicting a musician tuning his guitar as he sits next to an amorous couple, was considered by its owners to be a copy until the auctioneer spotted it when called in to evaluate the contents of a British country house.    
	Dying cost    
	Valletta, Malta (Reuters): The cost of living is rising in Malta, but the cost of dying may be about to drop. The Maltese transport ministry announced on Monday that the government had decided to liberalise the granting of licences for hearses. No licences have been issued for 36 years, leaving only 11 owners of hearses and, in the ministrys words, creating the conditions for a cartel.

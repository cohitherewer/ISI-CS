The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Osama took part in arms deal
                                                                                                               Osama took part in arms deal
          KAREN DEYOUNG                          Very religious                                  
	Washington, April 1: Osama bin Laden flew to London in 1986 to help negotiate the purchase of Russian-made surface-to-air missiles to be used by Arab fighters then battling the Soviet military in Afghanistan, according to a new book on the bin Laden family.        
	Bin Laden and his half brother, Salem, met several times with the contacts at the luxury Dorchester hotel in London, according to The Bin Ladens, by journalist Steve Coll. Dont do any jokes with my brother, Salem is said to have told the others. Hes very religious.        
	The deal for Russian SA-7 missiles was arranged via contacts with the German arms manufacturer Heckler amp; Koch, through an associate of Salem bin Laden, the book says. It suggests that payment for the weapons was made by the government of Saudi Arabia and that the weapons eventually were purchased in South America.        
	At the time of the weapons shipments, both the US and Saudi governments were supporting Afghan and Arab forces resisting the Soviet Unions occupation of Afghanistan. But while the Reagan administration supplied Stinger missiles to the Afghans, the book says that the Afghans did not want the Americans providing such weaponry directly to Arab groups that had joined the fight, including forces organised by Osama bin Laden.        
	We have made no bones about our support for the mujahiddin fighters, Saudi embassy spokesman Nail al-Jubeir said yesterday. We matched the Americans dollar for dollar. But in terms of what was bought, I really dont know, he said, adding that the Arabs eventually did receive the SA-7s.        
	Calls to Heckler amp; Kochs offices in Virginia and in Alabama were not returned.        
	Among other revelations, the book says that Jalaluddin Haqqani, an Afghan fighter against the Soviets and now a Taliban leader in Pakistan, received tens of thousands of dollars from the CIA as a unilateral asset of the intelligence agency in 1988 and 1989.        
	It also says that US intelligence installed a listening device in a desk presented in the late 1970s to Saudi Prince Nayef when he became interior minister.         
	Nayefs discovery of the bug, it says, negatively coloured his views of the US and inhibited his cooperation with US counterterrorism efforts following the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.        
	Osama bin Ladens al-Qaida terrorist network was born in the years following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989. Coll, a former Washington Post managing editor and now president of the New America Foundation, a Washington think tank, won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction for Ghost Wars, which examined the rise of al Qaida.         
	The Bin Ladens, published today by Penguin, traces the extended bin Laden family from Osamas great-great-grandfather to Osamas children and other members of the youngest generation. His father, Mohamed, had several wives and founded an international construction company that made Osama and many of his dozens of siblings wealthy.        
	According to the book and many previous accounts, few of Osamas far-flung relatives had any contact with him during the growth of al Qaida and rejected his turn to violence. Those living in or visiting the US at the time of the 2001 attacks left the country about a week later.

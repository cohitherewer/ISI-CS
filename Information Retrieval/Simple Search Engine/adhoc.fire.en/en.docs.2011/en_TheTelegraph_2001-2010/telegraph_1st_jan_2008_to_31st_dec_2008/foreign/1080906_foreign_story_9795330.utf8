	Mosaic of corks    
	 Tirana (Albania), Sept. 5 (Reuters): An Albanian artist has set a record by creating the largest mosaic made of corks, arranged as a homage to life.      
	Albanian artist Saimir Strati glued 229,764 corks of various shapes and colours over a plastic banner measuring 12.94 metres by 7.1 metres to show Romeo with a crown of grapes playing the guitar while dancing with the sea and the sun.      
	He worked 14 hours per day for 28 days and completed the project yesterday. It gives me a personal pleasure to declare that Saimir Strati has set today the new Guinness world record for the largest cork mosaic, a Guinness official said.    
	Spears shy    
	 London: Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera will share a stage at the MTV Video Music Awards, reports The Daily Telegraph. Spears has been signed up to open Sundays show but will not perform following her disastrous appearance last year. She has also been nominated for Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video Of the Year for her track Piece of Me. Arriving at a studio to prepare for the event, she said: MTV has played an important role in my career. How can I not be there to kick off their 25th VMAs?

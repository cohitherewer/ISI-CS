          NICK PISA                          Eluana Englaro                                  
	Rome, July 10: An Italian court yesterday issued a landmark ruling allowing a father to turn off the life support machine that has kept his comatosed daughter alive for 16 years.         
	The controversial decision to end the life of Eluana Englaro is the first such ruling by an Italian court. The judgement drew instant criticism from the Vatican, which condemned it as as euthanasia.        
	Englaro, 35, has been in a vegetative state ever since she was involved in a road accident aged 19. The ruling marked the end of a lengthy legal battle led by her parents.        
	Eluanas father Beppino based his appeal on the fact that she had been in good health and of sound mind before the accident and would not have wanted to be kept alive in a vegetative state. He has been campaigning since 1999 through the courts to have the treatment to his daughter suspended and he had been turned down six times until yesterdays ruling in Milan.        
	Last night, Englaro said: I still cant believe it. I dont feel any pain as, for me, my daughter died 16 years ago.        
	I feel that I can now free the most splendid creature I have ever known. She was in an irreversible coma, now we can free her, its not euthanasia its freedom. Eluana knew the situation she was in, she just wanted to die and she wanted nature to take its course. The judges saw it as the best possible decision and Im grateful for that.        
	The ruling means that with immediate effect the feeding tube keeping Eluana alive in a Milan hospital can be disconnected.        
	However, the family, who are from nearby Lecco are expected to wait for the end of the legal 60-day waiting period during which the court sentence remains subject to appeal.        
	Monsignor Rino Fisichella, of the Pontifical Academy for Life at the Vatican, said: This is an act of euthanasia. The decision can be taken to a superior court and there it can be argued with less emotion and more serenity.        
	I have dual sentiments in this case on one hand one of sadness and on the other surprise because Eluana is a girl who is still alive, a coma is a form of life and no-one can be allowed to put an end to life.        
	The Vatican is firmly opposed to euthanasia and the Catholic Church refused a religious burial for Piergiorgio Welby, a man who campaigned for euthanasia as he lay paralysed with muscular dystrophy.         
	He died in Rome in December 2006 after a doctor agreed to unplug his respirator without a court ruling.        
	In the ruling from Judge Filippo Lamanna yesterday, he cited the extraordinary duration of Eluanas persistent vegetative state, as well as her sense of freedom and vision of life as reasons behind his decision.        
	He added: Her conception of life was incompatible with her total loss of physical capacity, she was biological only in body. Last September, the Vatican said it was wrong to stop administering food and water to patients in a vegetative state.         
	The verdict divided Italys political leaders.        
	Health ministry undersecretary Eugenia Roccella said it amounted to a death sentence. The Englaro case has been compared to that of American Terri Schiavo, who spent 15 years in a persistent vegetative state and was allowed to die after a long court battle.

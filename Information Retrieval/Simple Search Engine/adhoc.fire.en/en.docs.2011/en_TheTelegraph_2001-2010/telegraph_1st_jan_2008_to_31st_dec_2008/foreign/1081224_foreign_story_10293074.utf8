          MARK LANDLER AND HELENE COOPER                          Clinton: Powerful agenda                                  
	Washington, Dec. 23: Even before taking office, Hillary Rodham Clinton is seeking to build a more powerful state department, with a bigger budget, high-profile special envoys to trouble spots and an expanded role in dealing with global economic issues at a time of crisis.         
	A transition official dismissed as speculation reports in Indian newspapers that Obama was considering appointing Hillary as a special envoy to deal with Kashmir issues. But another transition official confirmed that Obamas foreign policy advisers were discussing the possibility of appointing a special envoy to India.        
	Hillary is recruiting Jacob J. Lew, the budget director under President Bill Clinton, as one of two deputies, according to people close to the Obama transition team. Lews focus, they said, will be on increasing the share of financing that goes to the diplomatic corps. He and James B. Steinberg, a deputy national security adviser in the Clinton administration, are to be Hillarys chief lieutenants.         
	Nominations of deputy secretaries, like Hillarys, would be subject to confirmation by the Senate.         
	The incoming administration is also likely to name several envoys, officials said, reviving a practice of the Clinton administration.

	Kathmandu, April 7 (PTI): King Gyanendra is set to deliver the traditional new year message which could possibly be his last after Nepals interim parliament voted to abolish the monarchy last year.        
	The country will celebrate the new year on April 13.         
	Though the content of the message has not yet been disclosed, there is speculation that this time Gyanendra will give best wishes for the success of the Constituent Assembly elections on Thursday.        
	Though the parliament has abolished the monarchy, subject to ratification by the Assembly, the king has not yet moved out of the Narayanhiti palace.

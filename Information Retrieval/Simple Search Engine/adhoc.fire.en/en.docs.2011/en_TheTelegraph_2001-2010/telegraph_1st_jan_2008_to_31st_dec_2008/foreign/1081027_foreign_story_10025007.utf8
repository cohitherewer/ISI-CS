	Dogged effort    
	 Sydney, Oct. 26 (Reuters): A dog was hailed as a hero today after it risked its life to save a litter of newborn kittens from a house fire, rescuers said.      
	The terrier cross named Leo had to be revived with oxygen and heart massage after his ordeal. Fire broke out overnight at the house in Melbourne, where he was guarding the kittens. Firefighters who revived Leo said he refused to leave the building and was found by them alongside the litter of kittens, despite thick smoke.    
	Croc fear    
	 Nicosia, Cyprus (Reuters): Wildlife experts in Cyprus are trying to verify reports a crocodile smuggled to the island is on the loose in a nature reserve popular with visitors. In recent years reports of crocodile sightings have been common on the island, where they do not breed and the closest thing that remotely resembles it is the much smaller chameleon.

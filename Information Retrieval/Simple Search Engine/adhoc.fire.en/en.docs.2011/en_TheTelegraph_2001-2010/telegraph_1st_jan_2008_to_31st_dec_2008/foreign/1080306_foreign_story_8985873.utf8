The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Court drops five graft cases against Zardari
                                                                                                               Court drops five graft cases against Zardari
                            
	Islamabad, March 5 (Reuters): A Pakistani court dismissed five corruption cases against former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos husband Asif Ali Zardari today, his lawyer said, in a major step towards clearing the way for him to hold government office.        
	Zardari led Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) to election victory on February 18 and is now negotiating with other parties on a coalition government. The accountability court has terminated five references against Zardari and they stand withdrawn, Zardaris lawyer, Farooq Naik, told Reuters, referring to the charges.        
	All orders about confiscation and seizure of his property have also been terminated, he said. Naik said there were two more cases pending against Zardari and a court was due to hear them on March 12.        
	Zardari did not contest in last months election, in which the PPP rode a wave of sympathy after Bhuttos assassination on December 27. The party won the most seats in parliament, though not enough to rule alone.        
	Pakistanis convicted of a crime are barred from standing for election and while Zardari has never been convicted, corruption cases have been hanging over him, raising doubts about his future.        
	A party spokeswoman said the court decision was a victory of truth and rightness.        
	These cases were always used as a bargaining chip by our opponents but they failed to bend the resolve of our leadership. They failed to prove any of the charges. It has vindicated our stance, said the spokeswoman, Farzana Raja.        
	A Prime Minister and cabinet members must be elected to parliament, although Zardari has said he would not try to become Prime Minister. The PPP is meeting tomorrow and is expected to announce its candidate for Prime Minister. Asked if Zardari would stand in a byelection, Raja said: It will purely be his own decision.        
	Zardari, 51, was a minister in Bhuttos second government before it was dismissed in 1996 over corruption accusations. Both Bhutto and Zardari denied corruption accusations which they said were politically motivated. Zardari spent 11 years in jail on various charges.        
	The government withdrew all corruption cases against Bhutto after her assassination.

                                                                                                               25 years for infant murder
                            
	Galveston (Texas), March 27 (AP): A jury has sentenced a young father to 25 years in prison for severely burning his infant daughter after stuffing her in a microwave and turning it on for up to 20 seconds.        
	 Jurors rejected Joshua Mauldins claims he was insane at the time, convicting him yesterday of felony injury to a child. The panel deliberated for 6 hours over two days before sentencing Mauldin to prison and fining him $10,000.        
	 Mauldin was teary-eyed after hearing the sentence. His mother, Joanie, loudly sobbed in the courtroom. Relatives of the little girl, named Ana, were to tell Mauldin how the crime affected their lives.

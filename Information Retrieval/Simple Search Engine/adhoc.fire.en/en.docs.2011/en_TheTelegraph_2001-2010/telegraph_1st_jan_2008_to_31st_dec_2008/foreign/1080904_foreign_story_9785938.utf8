                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Before speech, running mate Palin is coached

	St Paul (Minnesota), Sept. 3: Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, the presumptive Republican vice-presidential nominee, emerged from the seclusion of preparing her acceptance speech today and joined her husband, five children and future son-in-law on the tarmac of Minneapolis-St Paul Airport as they welcomed Senator John McCain to this convention city.        
	McCain exited his campaign plane just before noon local time and greeted his seven grown children, who were lined up next to the Palin family. He then embraced Palin and her husband, Todd, and warmly greeted 17-year-old Bristol Palin and her boyfriend Levi Johnston, who have entered the national spotlight since the revelation on Monday that they are expecting a child together late this year.        
	Bristol and Johnston, 18, held hands before and after greeting McCain, and Bristol could be seen introducing Johnston to the Arizona senator. McCain also kissed Sarah Palins infant son Trig, who was being held by the governors middle daughter, 14-year-old Willow.        
	Palin, a relative unknown on the national political scene who was chosen as McCains running mate last Friday, had been holed up in her suite in the Hilton Minneapolis since Sunday night. A parade of McCains top advisers have briefed her on the nuances of his policy positions, national politics and, above all, how to introduce herself to the national audience she will address at the Republican convention.        
	Sitting around a dining room table, the McCain team has talked to her about Iraq, energy and the economy but has focused on what she should say in her speech, struggling almost as hard as she has to prepare for what will be, along with a debate in October.         
	Not anticipating that McCain would choose a woman as his running mate, the speech that was prepared in advance was very masculine, according to campaign manager Rick Davis, and we had to start from scratch.        
	By all accounts Palin has thrown herself enthusiastically into preparations for her prime-time debut as well as for her first campaign trip without McCain. Early this morning, she toured the stage at the Xcel Energy Centre here, adjusting the microphone and getting a sense of the podium.

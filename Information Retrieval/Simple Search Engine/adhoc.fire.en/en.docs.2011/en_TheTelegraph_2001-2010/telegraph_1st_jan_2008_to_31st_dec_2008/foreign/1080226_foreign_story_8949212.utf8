The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Stars are stately, fashionable and safe
                                                                                                               Stars are stately, fashionable and safe
  - ACTRESSES REGAL WITH RICH REDS AND PURPLES                              Anne Hathaway at the Oscars in Los Angeles. (AP)                                  
	Los Angeles, Feb. 25: The best word to describe the red-carpet fashion at the Academy Awards: red.        
	Katherine Heigl, Helen Mirren, Miley Cyrus, Ruby Dee, Anne Hathaway and Heidi Klum were among the stars in red gowns last night at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles. Shades of plum were worn by Cate Blanchett and Jessica Alba.        
	The actresses went regal and royal with rich reds and purples, said Oscar.com fashion analyst Tom Julian. The other buzzword? Safe.        
	I thought people looked generally really good  and really safe, Hal Rubenstein, fashion director at InStyle magazine, told The Associated Press. I dont know if it had to do with the mood out there with the strike just over and parties cancelled, but in fashion now so much is about sheer, print and colour, but this was one solid strapless dress after another.        
	Rubenstein added: There was a kind of uniform timelessness, which is very nice, but considering those who watch this show do it to get a fashion cue, I wish they were a little more timely than timeless.        
	 He labelled French actress Marion Cotillards ivory-and-silver gown by Jean Paul Gaultier with scalloped fabric that looked like fish scales the most distinctive of the night.        
	Pregnant actresses Blanchett, in a Dries van Noten halter gown with floral beading on the skirt, and Alba, in a strapless Marchesa gown with feathers at the bustline, both embraced their revised shapes in empire-waist gowns. Nicole Kidman, also pregnant, went with a simple black gown by Balenciaga and a show-stopping necklace  7,645 diamonds totalling nearly 1,400 carats by LWren Scott.        
	Feathers were a recent trend on the runway and Penelope Cruzs black strapless gown had them too. W magazine fashion market editor Treena Lombardo reminds at-home fashion followers not to take trends from the red carpet too seriously for their own lives. I dont think any of the trends the Oscars hit are trends the rest of the world needs to know about,she said.         
	She did notice all that red, though. Heidi Klum was the most beautiful Ive ever seen.

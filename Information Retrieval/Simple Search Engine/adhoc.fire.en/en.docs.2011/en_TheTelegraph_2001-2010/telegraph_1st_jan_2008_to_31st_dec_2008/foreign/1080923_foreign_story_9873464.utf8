	Islamabad, Sept. 22: British Airways has halted all flights to Islamabad following the bombing of the citys Marriott Hotel in what is being described as Pakistans 9/11.         
	Sohail Rehman, a spokesman for British Airways in Islamabad, said: We have temporarily suspended our flight operations in Pakistan following Saturdays suicide attack. The situation is being reviewed by our head office in London. Right now, we are not in a position to give any date for the resumption of our operations.        
	The last flight from London to Islamabad, the only destination served by the carrier in Pakistan, operated on Sunday. The British Embassy in Islamabad, one of the largest in the world and employing 150 UK workers, is functioning as normal today.        
	Six British citizens, including a child, were among the 300 people injured in the attack. Two of the wounded Britons, both staff at the British High Commission, remain in hospital for observation but the four others have since been discharged with superficial injuries.        
	At least five foreigners were among the dead, including two Americans and the Czech ambassador to Islamabad.        
	Foreign secretary David Miliband said the bombing would only reinforce Britains determination to combat terrorism in the country. Miliband said: This latest bombing attack in Islamabad is yet another shocking and disgraceful attack without justification.        
	Such an indiscriminate and brutal act of terror deserves the condemnation of the entire international community. We continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the government of Pakistan against the violent extremists who have no answers but only offer death and mayhem.        
	IMF team leaves        
	Finance ministry officials were quoted by the Dawn News channel as saying that an IMF delegation had left Pakistan without completing an economic review of the country due to security concerns. The team was scheduled to complete its review on Wednesday but left after the suicide attack.

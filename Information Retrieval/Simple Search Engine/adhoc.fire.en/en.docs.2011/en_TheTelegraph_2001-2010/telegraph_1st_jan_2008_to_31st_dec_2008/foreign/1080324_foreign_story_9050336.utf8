The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pervez vows support to coalition
                                                                                                               Pervez vows support to coalition

	Islamabad, March 23 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf assured his full support today for an incoming government that will almost certainly be led by a Prime Minister he had jailed for over four years.        
	The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of slain former Premier Benazir Bhutto nominated former National Assembly Speaker, Yousaf Raza Gilani, for the premiership yesterday. However, it remains unclear whether Gilani is a stop-gap, keeping the seat warm for Asif Ali Zardari, Bhuttos widower.        
	Gilani swore allegiance to Bhutto, assassinated in a gun and bomb attack on December 27, and said he would carry forward her mission.        
	Whatever democracy we have in the country, no matter in which shape it is, its because of the martyrdom of Benazir Bhutto, he told reporters after filing his nomination for the post. We will endeavour for the supremacy of the parliament.        
	Gilani is expected to win with a thumping majority when the National Assembly votes tomorrow, particularly after a regional pro-Musharraf party pledged its support. Chaudhry Pervez Elahi, a senior leader of Musharrafs main allied party, today said he would challenge Gilani in the vote.        
	On Tuesday, if everything goes smoothly, Musharraf will swear in Gilani, who he jailed in 2001 on charges of making illegal appointments and was freed in 2006.        
	Whichever new government is formed, it will enjoy my full support, Musharraf said in a televised speech while addressing the Pakistan Day military paradeat a sports stadium in Islamabad.        
	Dressed in a white sherwani, Musharraf attended the ceremony for the first time as a civilian to commemorate the day Muslim agitators in the Indian independence movement passed a resolution in 1940 to work for the formation of Pakistan.        
	I hope that these governments will maintain political peace... and will continue the struggle against terrorism and extremism with the same force, Musharraf said.        
	While in prison, Gilani, a soft-spoken, resolute character, wrote a book that advocated a strong military, but one that was removed from politics.

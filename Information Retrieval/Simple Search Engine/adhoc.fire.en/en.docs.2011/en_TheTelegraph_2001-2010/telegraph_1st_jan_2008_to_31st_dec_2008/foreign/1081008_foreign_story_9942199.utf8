	New York, Oct. 7: Professionals call it elderspeak, the sweetly belittling form of address that has always rankled older people.         
	The doctor who talks to their child rather than to them about their health; the store clerk who assumes that an older person does not know how to work a computer, or needs to be addressed slowly or in a loud voice. Then there are those who address any elderly person as dear. People think theyre being nice, said Elvira Nagle, 83, of Dublin, California, but when I hear it, it raises my hackles.        
	Now studies are finding that the insults can have health consequences, especially if people mutely accept the attitudes behind them, said Becca Levy, an associate professor of epidemiology and psychology at Yale University, who studies the health effects of such messages on elderly people.         
	Those little insults can lead to more negative images of ageing, Levy said. And those who have more negative images of ageing have worse functional health over time.        
	In a long-term survey of 660 people over age 50 in a small Ohio town, published in 2002, Levy and her fellow researchers found that those who had positive perceptions of ageing lived an average of 7.5 years longer, a bigger increase than that associated with exercising or not smoking. The findings held up even when the researchers controlled for differences in the participants health conditions.         
	In her coming study, Levy found that older people exposed to negative images of ageing, including words like forgetful, feeble and shaky, performed significantly worse on memory and balance tests; in previous experiments, they also showed higher levels of stress. Despite such research, the worst offenders are often health care workers, said Kristine Williams, a nurse gerontologist and associate professor at the University of Kansas School of Nursing. To study the effects of elderspeak on people with mild to moderate dementia, Williams videotaped interactions in a nursing home between 20 residents and staff members. They found that when nurses used phrases like good girl or How are we feeling? patients were more aggressive. If addressed as infants, some showed their irritation by grimacing, screaming or refusing to do what staff members asked of them.

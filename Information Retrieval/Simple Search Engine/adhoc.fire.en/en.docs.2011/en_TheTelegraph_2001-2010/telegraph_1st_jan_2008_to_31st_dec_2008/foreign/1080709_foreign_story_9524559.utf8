	Tea foils thief    
	Tokyo, July 8 (AP): A Japanese woman brewed up an unusual escape plan to free herself and her 6-month-old daughter from a suspected armed robber: a cup of tea and a chat.      
	 A man who appeared to be a labourer in his 60s allegedly pulled a knife and demanded money from a 30-year-old housewife as she was walking in a hallway at a downtown Tokyo apartment building on Monday morning, police said.      
	The woman told her assailant that she had no money but he followed her and forced his way into her apartment. But rather than screaming, the woman served the man a cup of tea in hopes of calming him down.       
	 The man put his knife away and began telling the woman about his financial hardship and asked her to lend him 10,000 yen ($94).      
	Police said the woman put a 10,000 yen bill and a wallet containing about 30,000 yen ($280) on the table. When the man was looking the other way, she grabbed her daughter and ran out the door to call police from a nearby public phone. When she returned to her apartment, the man and the money were gone.    
	Bad word    
	 Jerusalem (Reuters): Israels education minister used the s-word during a televised session of a parliamentary committee on Tuesday. She just told me, piece of shit, legislator Ronit Tirosh, a former director-general of the education ministry, exclaimed suddenly after education minister Yuli Tamir whispered something into her ear. I cant believe it. Tamir spoke up quickly:No, what I said was that I am still cleaning up the shit you left behind in the system.

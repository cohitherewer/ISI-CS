	Beijing, Sept. 27 (Reuters): Astronaut Zhai Zhigang became the first Chinese man to walk in space today, clambering out of Chinas Shenzhou VII space craft in a technological feat that Beijing wants the world to marvel about.        
	Im feeling quite well. I greet the Chinese people and the people of the world, Zhai said as he climbed out of the craft, his historic achievement carried live on state television.        
	Zhai, the 41-year-old son of a snack-seller chosen for the first extra-vehicular activity, unveiled a small Chinese flag, helped by colleague Liu Boming, who also briefly popped his head out of the capsule.        
	Zhai safely returned inside the craft after about 15 minutes. The walk marked the high point of Chinas third manned space journey.        
	Chinese President Hu Jintao spoke to the astronauts, congratulating them and wishing them a triumphant return. Zhai, apparently reading from a pre-prepared script, thanked Hu.        
	The risky space walk is a step towards Chinas longer-term goal of assembling a space lab and then a larger space station. The fast-growing Asian power wants to be sure of a say in how space and its potential resources are used. China is only the third country after the US and Russia to successfully perform a space walk.        
	The Indian Space Research Organisation has signalled its intentions to develop a manned space vehicle capable of carrying two astronauts up to an altitude of 400km. Isro plans to spend Rs 125 crore this year (2008-09) on technologies for such a mission, adds our special correspondent.         
	Last year, Isro successfully recovered an unmanned space capsule from space orbit a requirement for manned missions. But it has no capabilities for life-support technologies in manned capsules.         
	Isro says it will send a formal project proposal to the government once it has decided it wants a sustained manned programme. If a project is approved, implementation could take five to eight years.         
	Chinas first manned spaceflight was in 2003. A second, two-manned flight, followed in 2005. Shenzhou VII took off on Thursday and is to land in Inner Mongolia tomorrow.

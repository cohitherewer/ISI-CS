	New York, March 6 (Reuters): A small explosion caused minor damage to a US military recruiting centre in New Yorks Times Square area early today.         
	However, there were no injuries, police said.        
	Police said a small improvised explosive device caused minor damage to the building around 0845 GMT. The thick glass door was cracked and the lower part of its metal frame was twisted. The blast also shattered a window encasing the classic recruiting poster of Uncle Sam saying: I want you.        
	The explosion, which authorities said appeared to have been directed at the recruiting centre, occurred in the early hours of the morning, when there there are few people in the often bustling area in the heart of Manhattan.        
	The US homeland security department said there was no sign of an immediate threat to the US from the blast, and said the FBI was taking an active part in the investigation.        
	Asked whether there were any indications the blast was terrorism-related, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said: It doesnt appear to be but again the investigation is still ongoing, she said.        
	New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said the explosion appeared aimed at the recruiting station. The fact that this appears deliberately targeted at the recruiting station insults every one of our brave men and women in uniform stationed around the world, Bloomberg told a news conference in Times Square.        
	Police commissioner Ray Kelly said a witness had reported seeing a suspicious man on a bicycle wearing a hood and a backpack shortly before the blast. Police were looking for any additional witnesses.        
	Bloomberg said no one saw the device go off and no one saw anyone plant it.        
	Todays incident occurred days before the fifth anniversary on March 19th of the start of the US-led invasion of Iraq. US public support for the war has dropped in recent years.        
	The targeted building sits in a traffic island between Broadway and Seventh Avenue in Times Square, sometimes called the crossroads of the world. Anti-war protesters periodically stage demonstrations there, and the building has also been hit by vandalism in the past.        
	Asked if there was a link to terrorism in the incident, homeland security department spokeswoman Laura Keehner said the probe was still in its initial stages, but added there is no credible information to suggest there is an imminent threat against the homeland at this time.        
	Police initially closed off the streets around the busy tourist and business area, but traffic was allowed through the square three hours after the explosion. Captain Charles Jaquillard, who is in charge of the Manhattan centre and works there, told Reuters at the scene that nobody was in the building when the explosion occurred.

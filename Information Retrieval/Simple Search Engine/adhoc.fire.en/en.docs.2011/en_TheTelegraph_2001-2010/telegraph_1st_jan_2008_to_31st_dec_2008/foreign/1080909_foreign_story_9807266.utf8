	London, Sept. 8: Trading on the London Stock Exchange was halted after a computer system failed on one of the most frantic days of trading so far this year.         
	In an embarrassment for the LSE, the exchange said that no orders can be entered or executions of those trades occur. The LSE plans to bring back trading in a controlled way, but couldnt say how long that will take. The computer crash left the exchanges customers fuming on a day of heavy trading following the US governments bail-out of mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.         
	Traders said the exchange was suffering an overloading caused partly because the FTSE 100 ended down sharply on Friday so traders who were betting on further falls in the index would have to close their positions.        
	Simon Denham, founder of Capital Spreads, said: It (trading) went down at 8.44am. This happens on the LSE two or three times a year, but I cant remember it ever having been down this long.         
	I dont know what excuse they will give  for the second biggest stock exchange in the world its pretty poor.        
	The FTSE 100 had surged more than 3 per cent before trading was halted, following an earlier rally across Asia, on hopes that the nationalisation of Americas two biggest mortgage lenders may help revive the troubled US housing market.        
	Sejal Patel, a trader at CMC Markets, said: Weve been having to use other exhanges like Turquoise this morning, so its obviously quite negative for the LSE. The longer its down, the more reliable its making its rivals look  its bad timing for the LSE.         
	Alongside the rally in the FTSE 100 and in stock markets in Germany, France, and Italy, prices for government bonds were hit and the dollar tumbled.

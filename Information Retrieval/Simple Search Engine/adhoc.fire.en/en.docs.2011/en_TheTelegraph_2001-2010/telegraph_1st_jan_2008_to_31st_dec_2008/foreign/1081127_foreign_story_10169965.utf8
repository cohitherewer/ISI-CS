The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama to retain Gates
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obama to retain Gates
  - Decision will give new President a defence secretary supported by both Democrats and Republicans        PETER BAKER AND THOM SHANKER                          Robert Gates                                        
	Washington, Nov. 26: President-elect Barack Obama has decided to keep defence secretary Robert M. Gates in his post, a show of bipartisan continuity in a time of war.        
	This will be the first time that a Pentagon chief has been carried over from a President of a different party, Democrats close to the transition said yesterday.        
	Obamas advisers were nearing a formal agreement with Gates to stay on for perhaps a year, the Democrats said, and they expected to announce the decision as early as next week along with other choices for the national security team. The two sides have been working out details on how Gates would wield authority in a new administration.        
	The move will give the new President a defence secretary with support on both sides of the aisle in Congress, as well as experience with foreign leaders around the world and respect among the senior military officer corps. But two years after President Bush picked him to lead the armed forces, Gates will now have to pivot from serving the commander- in-chief who started the Iraq war to serving one who has promised to end it.        
	In deciding to ask Gates to stay, Obama put aside concerns that he would send a jarring signal after a political campaign in which he made opposition to the war his signature issue in the early days. Some Democrats who have advised his campaign quietly complained that he was undercutting his own message and risked alienating war critics who formed his initial base of support.        
	But advisers argued that Gates was a practical public servant who was also interested in drawing down troops in Iraq when conditions allow.         
	From our point of view, it looks pretty damn good because of continuity and stability, said an Obama adviser, who insisted on anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. And I dont think there are any ideological problems.        
	Associates said Gates was torn between a desire to retire to a home in Washington state and a sense of duty as the military faces the daunting challenges of reducing forces in Iraq and increasing them in Afghanistan.         
	 Gates would not have to be reconfirmed by the Senate. The prospect of retaining him generated praise from the military establishment and Capitol Hill, where he is viewed as a pragmatist who turned the Pentagon around after the tenure of Donald H. Rumsfeld.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Scandal tests Obamas pledge
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Scandal tests Obamas pledge
  - Initial tepid response to seat-auction controversy raises eyebrows        TIM SHIPMAN                                                    Obama: Spitting 'fire'      
	Washington, Dec. 14: President-elect Barack Obama warned his staff that he would fire anyone who dragged his presidency into a corruption controversy weeks before the Illinois scandal broke.         
	The threat of the sack is hanging over the heads of senior members of his White House team embroiled in the case of Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who is under investigation for allegedly trying to sell Obamas vacated Senate seat to the highest bidder.         
	A senior Democratic source, who is close to members of Obamas team, told The Sunday Telegraph the President-elect made clear early in his presidential transition that he would remove anyone, no matter how senior, if they failed to live up to his promise to change the old politics.         
	Insiders believe that the pledge  which suggested Obama was sensitive about his and his senior advisers long association with cut-throat Chicago politics  may now be put to the test. Pressure is growing on Obama to come clean about links between his staff and Blagojevich, who was caught on tape by the FBI plotting to swap campaign cash and jobs for himself and his wife for political favours.         
	The Democratic strategist said: Obama made it clear straight after the election that he is not frightened to throw people under the bus if they drag his brand name down.         
	But its easier to say than to stick to. There are grey areas here. This could be a test of his ruthlessness.        
	Attention is now focused on Rahm Emanuel, Obamas incoming White House chief of staff, who took over Blagojevichs congressional seat when he became governor in 2003. It is understood that Emanuel spoke to Blagojevich on several occasions about his plans for appointing a successor to Obama in the Senate, shortly before Obamas preferred successor Valerie Jarrett dropped out of the running.        
	Obama has said he is confident that none of his staff were involved in any deal with the Illinois governor, but that does not mean that Emanuel was unaware of Blagojevichs desire for rewards. He could be in hot water if he did not report those conversations to police.         
	The scandal has gripped the political elite as Washington searched for clues about whether the Texas swagger of the Bush administration will be replaced with an equally aggressive Chicago culture when Obama is sworn in.        
	The Blagojevich scandal raised three key issues for Obama: were he and his staff involved? Are they and he tainted by the system in which they earned their spurs? And would they safely navigate his first political crisis? The President-elect has not fully convinced on any one of those three questions.         
	Obamas personal integrity got a boost since on the FBI tapes Blagojevich is heard complaining that Obamas people are not willing to give me anything, except appreciation.         
	But his political judgement came in for criticism with his tentative, defensive and secretive response to the scandal. Obama initially issued a vague and tepid response expressing sadness at the events, a contribution wildly out of step with public outrage. It took him a day to call for Blagojevich to resign.         
	Stephen Hayes, of the Weekly Standard magazine, said: As President you often dont have the time to recalibrate. You have to come out with the right response first time.         
	American commentators compared Obamas pledge to clean up politics with Tony Blairs promise his administration would be whiter than white, a pledge soon undermined when New Labour did favours for Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone after accepting a 1-million donation.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US letter hints at tougher   N-stand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Singh                                        
	Washington, Nov. 7: Barack Obamas September letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh suggests that any US reaction to a hypothetical future Indian test could be stronger than responses from the Bush White House.        
	It also implies that an Obama administration could consider Indias nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 as illegal.        
	US nuclear weapons policy considers the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a central element of that policy and it is not difficult to figure out where this will put India, which refuses to sign the NPT.        
	Obama concludes his letter to Singh with a paragraph that makes grim reading.        
	I very much hope and expect India will cooperate closely with the United States in these multilateral efforts, Obama wrote with reference to his intention to enter the CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) into force, push through an FMCT and advance the NPT.        
	With the benefits of nuclear cooperation come real responsibilities, Obama warned the Prime Minister. And that should include steps to restrain nuclear weapons programs and pursuing effective disarmament when others do so. I greatly look forward to working with you on these and other issues in the future.

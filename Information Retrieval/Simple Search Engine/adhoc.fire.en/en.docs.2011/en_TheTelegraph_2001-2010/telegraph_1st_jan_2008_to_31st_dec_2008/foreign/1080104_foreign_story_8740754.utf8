	Islamabad, Jan. 3 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf rejected any suggestion security agencies were behind the assassination of Benazir Bhutto and said today she had been warned about threats from Islamist militants.
    
	Musharraf told reporters that authorities were not responsible for a security lapse that led to the killing of the Opposition leader and former Prime Minister in a gun and suicide-bomb attack in Rawalpindi on December 27.
    
	In the last three months, there have been 19 suicide bombings, most of them against the military, against the intelligence, he said. Musharraf added that Bhutto had ignored warnings about the danger of holding a rally at the Rawalpindi park.

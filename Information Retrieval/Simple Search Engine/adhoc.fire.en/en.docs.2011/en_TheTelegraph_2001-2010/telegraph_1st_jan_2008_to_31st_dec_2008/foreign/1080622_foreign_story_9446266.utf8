	Abuja (Nigeria), June 21 (Reuters): Armed youths blew up a Nigerian crude oil pipeline operated by US major Chevron, a militant group said today, cutting more output from the worlds eighth-largest oil exporter.        
	The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta said it was contacted by youths claiming responsibility for Thursdays attack on Chevrons Abiteye-Olero crude pipeline and commended their action. The military said about 120,000 barrels per day of crude oil production were shut by the sabotage.        
	For production to have stopped, this shows the damage was serious, said army Brigadier-General Wuyep Rintip, head of the governments Joint Task Force in the western Delta. A Chevron spokeswoman confirmed that one of its pipelines was damaged, but declined to say how much output was affected. A wave of attacks in the West African country has cut production by a fifth since early 2006.

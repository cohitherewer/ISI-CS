	Colombo, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Tamil Tiger fighters killed at least 60 Sri Lankan soldiers in a counter-attack on forces advancing on the groups self-proclaimed capital, a pro-rebel website said today.        
	Military spokesperson Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara confirmed fighting broke out yesterday south of Kilinochchi. He said Sri Lankan soldiers killed at least 14 rebels while repelling the counter-attack, which wounded 34 soldiers and left 12 missing.        
	The LTTE wounded 150 in the clashes, www.tamilnet.com reported today, quoting unnamed LTTE officials.        
	The report made no mention of rebel casualties, but said soldiers were driven back 2km. The statement was denied by the military.        
	We have got confirmation of 14 LTTE killed, but there is a large number more killed and injured, Nanayakkara said, without providing specifics.        
	In a separate battle, the army said its newest fighting unit, Task Force IV, secured its first victory by capturing the eastern village of Nedunkurni yesterday.        
	Last week, both sides said they had killed more than 120 of their enemy when soldiers launched a multi-pronged attack on the defences on the outskirts of Kilinochchi.        
	The LTTE claims it as the seat of the separate state they want to create for Sri Lankas minority Tamils.

                                                                                                               Humbled Harry hails real heroes
          SEAN RAYMENT                            Prince Harry talks to an Afghan with the help of an interpreter (not in picture) and plays rugby in southern Afghanistan (AP)                                
	London, March 2: The lack of a smile said it all. Head bowed and still dressed in dusty desert combat clothing, the young prince cut a forlorn figure as he descended the steps of the aircraft after landing at RAF Brize Norton late yesterday morning.        
	While many of the other 170 servicemen and women might have cheered as the RAF Tristar touched down, Cornet Wales  who craved the anonymity that came with serving in Afghanistan  was left to ponder what might have been.        
	Just 48 hours earlier, Prince Harry was having the happiest time of his life serving as an army officer on operations close to the former Taliban stronghold of Musa Qala.         
	During his 10 weeks in Helmand, where 7,800 British troops are based, the 23-year-old Harry had called in air strikes and taken part in combat missions against the Taliban while serving on the front line.         
	But Harry, who was met on his return by the Prince of Wales and his brother, Prince William, could barely hide his disappointment at having to leave his fellow soldiers behind.         
	He insisted he was no hero when he spoke minutes after stepping off the plane, and said he felt humbled by the bravery of the men with whom he had served.         
	In a sombre interview, Harry then disclosed that he had travelled back with two seriously injured servicemen who had been wounded in a mine blast.        
	There were two injured guys who came back on the plane with us who were essentially comatose the whole way, he said. One had lost two limbs  a left arm and a right leg  and another guy who was saved by his mates body being in the way but took shrapnel to the neck.        
	The injured men in the RAF Tristar were members of the Royal Marines 40 Commando. Both were wounded on Thursday in the Kajaki area of northern Helmand. One marine stepped on a mine, which blew off his arm and leg, and the other was hit by shrapnel in the same blast.         
	Those are the heroes, Harry said. Guys who had been blown up by a mine that they had no idea about, serving their country, doing a normal patrol. I was a bit shocked.        
	It is a bit of a choke in your throat because you know that its happening. A lot of times when you are actually in theatre it isnt even mentioned that much.         
	On fighting the Taliban, he said: you do what you have to do, whats necessary to save your own guys. If you need to drop a bomb, worst-case scenario, then you will, but thats just the way it is. Its not nice to drop bombs. But to save lives, thats what happens.        
	Harry said he had achieved what he set out to do and that was to lead men in battle. As far as Im concerned, it was mission successful because the main crux of it was to lead a troop, he said.        
	Describing his feelings at seeing his tour cut short because of unexpected publicity, he said: I didnt see it coming, its a shame. Angry would be the wrong word to use but I am slightly disappointed. I thought I could see it through to the end and come back with our guys and the colonel himself. But Im back here now and I suppose deep down inside its quite nice. Im looking forward to having a bath. But I would like to have stayed back with the guys.        
	Harrys immediate future in the army is unclear. He will be allowed to go on leave for about three weeks before returning to his unit to continue his regimental duties. General Richard Dannatt, the chief of the general staff, has said it is unlikely that the young officer will return to a war zone for another 12 to 18 months.

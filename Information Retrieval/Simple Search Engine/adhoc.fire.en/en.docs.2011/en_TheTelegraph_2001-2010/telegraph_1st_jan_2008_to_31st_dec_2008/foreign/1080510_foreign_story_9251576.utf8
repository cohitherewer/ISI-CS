	Beirut, May 9 (Reuters): Lebanons Iranian-backed Hezbollah group took control of the Muslim half of Beirut today in what the US-backed governing coalition described as an armed and bloody coup.        
	At least 13 people have been killed and 30 wounded in three days of battles between pro-government gunmen and fighters loyal to Hezbollah, a Shia political movement with a powerful guerrilla army which is also an ally of Syria.        
	The fighting, the worst internal strife since the 1975-90 civil war, was triggered this week after the government tried to dismantle Hezbollahs military communications network.         
	In scenes reminiscent of the darkest days of the civil war, young men armed with assault rifles roamed the streets amid smashed cars and smouldering buildings. Fighting died down as outgunned government supporters handed over their weapons and offices to the army, which has mainly been seen as neutral during 17 months of political conflict between the Hezbollah-led Opposition and government.        
	The anti-Syria governing coalition condemned what it called an armed and bloody coup that aimed to increase Irans sway and restore the influence of Syria, which was forced to withdraw troops from Lebanon in 2005.        
	The White House restated its support for the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and urged Iran and Syria to end their support for Hezbollah, whose followers have also brought large parts of Beirut to a standstill this week with roadblocks.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pak President polls on Sept 6
          NASIR JAFFRY AND PTI                          Sharif                                  
	Islamabad, Aug. 22: Pakistan will hold presidential elections on September 6, the election commission said today.        
	The announcement came amid growing political uncertainty triggered by differences between two main members of the ruling coalition on restoring judges deposed by former President Pervez Musharraf.        
	Musharraf had resigned four days ago in the wake of impeachment threats by the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), which came to power after winning the February 18 elections.         
	Nomination papers will be submitted by August 26, scrutiny of the papers will be on August 28 while candidates can withdraw their papers by August 30, poll panel secretary Kunwar Dilshad told reporters.         
	Polling would be held simultaneously at the national and provincial assemblies and the Senate  which comprise the electoral college  from 10 am to 3 pm, he added.        
	According to constitutional provisions, presidential polls have to be held within 30 days of the position falling vacant.         
	The PPP, whose central executive committee met during the day, tonight unanimously nominated party chief Asif Ali Zardari to run for President. Zardari thanked the members and said he would look into the request. He would make his decision known within the next 24 hours.        
	The row dogging the ruling coalition eased a bit today with PML (N) leader Nawaz Sharif extending the deadline for the reinstatement of judges.        
	Sharif, who had earlier said a decision must be made today, has now said the matter should be settled by Wednesday through a resolution in the parliament.        
	The former President had earlier told Wall Street Journal that his party would quit the coalition and sit on Opposition benches if the PPP failed to reinstate the judges.        
	Sharif today met two junior partners in the coalition, Pashtoon Awami National Partys Asfandyar Wali Khan and head of the radical Jamiatul Ulema-e-Islam Maulana Fazalur Rehman, and decided to defer the deadline.         
	Sharif said a joint committee of the PPP and the PML (N) would finalise the draft resolution to be tabled in the National Assembly on Monday.        
	The resolution should be debated in the House on Monday and Tuesday, he said. Wednesday should be the day for approval of the resolution and restoration of judges.        
	Musharraf had sacked at least 60 judges after they refused to take fresh oath of allegiance following imposition of emergency in Pakistan on November 3, 2007.        
	The PPP and the PML (N) had agreed to restore the judges through a parliamentary resolution within a month of the formation of their government.         
	Analysts believe Zardari is in favour of reinstating all judges except chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry.         
	According to them, Zardari fears Chaudhry will re-open corruption cases against him and strike down the national reconciliation ordinance that Musharraf had issued to give indemnity to him and his late wife, Benazir Bhutto, as part of a power-sharing deal that later collapsed.         
	But PPP leaders, including law minister Farooq Naek, denied there was any minus-one formula under discussion within the party.

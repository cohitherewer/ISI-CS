	Indianapolis (Indiana), Feb. 22 (Reuters): Republican presidential front-runner John McCain suggested today that he hoped retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro would die soon and said Castros brother will be a worse leader.        
	I hope he has the opportunity to meet Karl Marx very soon, McCain told a town-hall style meeting of about 150 people, referring to communist theoretician Marx who died on March 14, 1883. Castro, 81, announced on Tuesday he was stepping down as President.         
	Apparently he is trying to groom his brother Raul, McCain said. Raul is worse in many respects than Fidel was.        
	Castro has not appeared in public since undergoing stomach surgery and handing power temporarily to Raul in July 2006.

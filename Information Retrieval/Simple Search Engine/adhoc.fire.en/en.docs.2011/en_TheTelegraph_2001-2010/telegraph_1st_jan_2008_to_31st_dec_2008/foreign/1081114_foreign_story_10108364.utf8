	Jolie dream    
	 London, Nov. 13: Angelina Jolie is already dreaming of becoming a grandmother, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The 33-year-old has six children with partner Brad Pitt and plans to scale back her acting career in order to concentrate on family life.      
	Im ready to do a few things now and fade away and get ready to be a grandma one day, she said. So Im not so worried that I want to keep this pace up and try to be something and be a celebrity and be a successful actress forever.      
	Asked in a BBC interview if she worried about how her career would fare if her looks faded, Jolie replied: I dont think about it much because I dont plan to keep acting very long.     
	Exam fever    
	Seoul (AFP): Rush hour was rescheduled, aircraft landings were delayed and even the stock market opened late as more than half a million South Korean children sat for a crucial examination on Thursday. Parents could be seen praying outside schools where their kids were taking the College Scholastic Ability Test, a decisive factor in determining future careers. At Incheon city near Seoul, younger students and graduates lined up outside a high school, cheering on test applicants and handing them cups of coffee before their ordeal.

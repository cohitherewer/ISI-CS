The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hobbit first edition up for sale
                                                                                                            Hobbit first edition up for sale
                            
	London, Feb. 8 (Reuters): One of the first editions of J.R.R. Tolkiens classic The Hobbit is expected to fetch more than 30,000 when it goes up for auction next month.        
	The book, published in 1937 and featuring a range of black and white sketches, was signed by Tolkien and dedicated to his close friend Elaine Griffiths. Tolkien had first written The Hobbit for his children but after reading the transcript, Griffiths thought it was so good she handed it to publisher, George, Allen and Unwin.        
	The story, which follows the quest of Bilbo Baggins to reclaim stolen treasures from the dragon Smaug, went on to become a cult classic, selling more than 100 million copies in 40 languages. Just 1,500 first edition copies were ever printed.        
	Also in the Bonhams sale will be the first foreign language version, translated into Swedish in 1947, as well as the last known photograph of the author, said to have been taken by his grandson, Michael, in 1973 just before he died. The Hobbit is expected to be turned into a Hollywood film.

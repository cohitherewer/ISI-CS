	In bars and cafes across Paris, in restaurants and casinos throughout France, the once-revered cigarette now is officially banned, relegating one of the western worlds last public smoking holdouts to the ashtray of history.
    
	Yesterday, the public act that perhaps most epitomised the French as sexy, debonair, sultry, brooding  and perhaps more than a little susceptible to cancer  was snuffed out by the government. In a single day, Parisian dining establishments and watering holes acquired an entirely new atmosphere.
    
	Davy Kazan took a deep breath and glanced incredulously around the boisterous dining room of the Vaudeville brasserie, which is usually blanketed with smoke by mid-evening.
    
	You can actually smell the food! declared Kazan, 39, a Munich resident who is on a New Years vacation in Paris.
    
	But Romain Lefevre, a 41-year-old real estate broker, was fuming in the now smoke-less bar of Le Beaujolais Cafe a block from the Eiffel Tower. Not smoking during dinner is not a problem, but after eating  yes, I would like a cigarette with my coffee, said Lefevre, a pack-a-day smoker for the past 20 years.
    
	In the end, the inconvenience, discomfort and impracticality of smoking in sometimes freezing outdoor air might force him to quit, he said. And people suffer from cigarette cancer, he noted. And it costs too much, so is it a good idea to ban smoking? He shrugged. Perhaps.
    
	The ban came as no surprise. After intense lobbying, eating and drinking establishments were granted an 11-month stay of execution from a law that was imposed on all other public facilities last year.
    
	The government even offered a final New Years concession: It delayed imposition of the law from January 1 until yesterday to allow smokers a final night of indulging indoors.
    
	However, Jean-Pierre Aiglement, a waiter, said he would defy the ban. In few nations is smoking as much a part of national identity as it is here: a dense haze shrouded the Left Bank cafes where celebrated thinkers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir once held court, and theres hardly a photograph of singer Serge Gainsbourg without a cigarette.

	Penny nurse    
	London, Oct. 28: A nurse referred to in the lyrics of The Beatles song Penny Lane has finally been identified after more than 40 years, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Since the song was released in 1967 the identity of the pretty nurse selling poppies from a tray has remained a mystery. But a schoolfriend of John Lennons, who has written a book about growing up in Liverpool, claims to have the answer. According to Stan Williams, she is Beth Davidson, who Lennon would have known from childhood.       
	The moment which provided the inspiration came when Davidson was selling poppies on Penny Lane, dressed in a cadet nurses uniform.      
	Some boys, including Lennon, saw her near Biolettis barbers shop - also mentioned in the song. Paul McCartney wrote most of the Penny Lane lyrics, but Williams, 68, is convinced that Lennon contributed the nurse reference.

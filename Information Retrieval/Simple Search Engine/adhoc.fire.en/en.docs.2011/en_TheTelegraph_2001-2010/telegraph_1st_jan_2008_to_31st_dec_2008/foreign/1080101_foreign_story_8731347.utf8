	Islamabad, Dec. 31 (PTI): Pakistans election commission today decided, in principle, to delay the January 8 general election till February to complete poll preparations which have been affected by violent protests triggered by Benazir Bhuttos assassination .
    
	After examining reports from poll officials and caretaker governments in Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan and North West Frontier Province, the poll panel decided to postpone the elections this evening.
    
	The postponement allows the commission time to replace ballot boxes and electoral rolls destroyed in the protests. It also allows them time to complete the printing of ballot papers, the Dawn News channel quoted sources in the panel as saying.
    
	The panel is expected to make a formal announcement when it meets again tomorrow morning.
    
	Elections to the national and four provincial Assemblies were scheduled to be held on January 8. However, preparations have been hit by violent protests nationwide. The reports from authorities in Sindh say preparations had been adversely affected and polls could not be held as scheduled on January 8, sources said. 
    
	The printing of ballot papers in a high-security Karachi, the Sindh capital, press has been stopped and will not be completed before January 15, they said. All nomination papers had also been burnt in the four Sindh districts. The NWFP government also urged the panel to postpone polls in several regions of the state.
    
	It said polls should be put off in the Kurram tribal agency and Swat and Shangla districts due to the poor law and order situation there. It also said elections should be postponed in Abbottabad and Kohistan due to snowfall and bad weather.
    
	Kurram has been rocked by clashes between Shias and Sunnis since mid-November and a recent spurt in fighting claimed nearly 80 lives. The army is conducting a major operation against pro-Taliban militants in Swat and Shangla. The postponement was influenced by the fact that the government would need to deploy security forces during Muharram.

	London, June 2: Premature baldness could soon be assigned to history after scientists have pioneered a treatment to clone hair.         
	Follicular cell implantation works by replicating remaining hair strands and has already shown positive results in continuing clinical trials on human beings. It could eventually help millions of people to regain a full head of their own hair.         
	The technique has been hailed as a major advance in hair restoration and is backed by a 1.9 million government grant. It has the potential to re-grow a limitless supply hair for individuals who have become bald during cancer treatment, from suffering severe burns, or simply the onset of age.         
	Trial results presented at a conference of leading hair replacement surgeons in Rome suggested that the cell therapy can increase hair count in at least two thirds of patients after six months, and four out of five if the scalp is stimulated beforehand. The procedure is being developed by Intercytex, a British company based in Manchester, which is among many competing to find a cure for hair loss.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Christmas axed from Oxford
                            
	London, Nov. 2 (PTI): Council leaders in Oxford have decided to replace the word Christmas with Winter Light Festival from this years celebrations to make the series of events more inclusive.        
	The idea came from the Oxford Inspires, a cultural development agency for Oxfordshire, which was set up to promote culture in the area.        
	But the decision to axe the word has been criticised by religious leaders and locals describing it as ludicrous.        
	This is the one occasion which everyone looks forward to in the year. Im angry and very, very disappointed. Christmas is special and we shouldnt ignore it, The Observer today quoted Sabir Hussain Mirza, the chairman of the Muslim Council of Oxford, as saying.        
	Christian people should be offended and 99 per cent of people will be against this. Christmas is part of being British.

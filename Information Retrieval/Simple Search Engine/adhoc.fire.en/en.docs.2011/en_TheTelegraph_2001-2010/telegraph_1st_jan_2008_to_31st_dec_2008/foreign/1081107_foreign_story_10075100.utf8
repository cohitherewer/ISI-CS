	Venice, Nov. 6: Now that the US has a black President-elect, the world could be ready for a black Bond, 007 actor Daniel Craig has said.        
	The prospect would probably have Ian Fleming turning in his grave, Craig joked at a news conference in Rome prior to the Italian premiere of the new Bond film, Quantum of Solace.        
	After Barack Obamas victory I think we might have reached the moment for a coloured 007. I think the role could easily be played by a black actor, because the character created by Ian Fleming in the Fifties has undergone a great deal of evolution, Craig told the Agi news agency.        
	Fleming was not known for his liberal views and his books were laced with the racial prejudices of his era.        
	I think hed probably turn in his grave, at the thought of a black Bond, said Craig, who as the first blond Bond came in for his fair share of criticism from traditionalist fans.        
	Craig, who is in Rome with his co-star, Ukrainian actress Olga Kurylenko, said he was delighted with the Democrats victory. Ive always been a fan of Obama. The political ideas that have emerged from his speeches seem to me to be genuine. Last month Craig said that he thought Obama would make a better Bond than the Republican contender for the presidency, John McCain.

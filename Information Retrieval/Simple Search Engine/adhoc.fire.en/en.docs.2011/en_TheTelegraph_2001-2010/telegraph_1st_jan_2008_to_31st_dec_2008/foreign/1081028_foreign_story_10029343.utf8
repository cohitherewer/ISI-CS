	Heavy union    
	 London, Oct. 27: The worlds fattest man  a Mexican who weighs over 305 kg  has got married, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Manuel Uribe, who hasnt left his bed in six years, married his longtime girlfriend Claudia Solis yesterday in northern Mexico.      
	Wearing a white silk shirt with a sheet wrapped around his legs, Uribe smiled as Solis, 38, walked down a flight of stairs wearing a strapless ivory dress, a tiara and hot-pink lipstick.      
	He later broke into tears as a notary declared the couple husband and wife in a civil ceremony attended by more than 400 guests. In 2006, Uribe weighed 560 kg, earning him the Guinness World Record as the worlds heaviest man. He has since shed about 250 kg with the help of Solis, who he met four years ago.

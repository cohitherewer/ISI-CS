The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Corruption-hit Zardari set to be President
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Corruption-hit Zardari set to be President

	Islamabad, Sept. 5: Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of Benazir Bhutto, is set to become President tomorrow, an accidental ascent for a man known more as a wheeler-dealer than a leader.         
	He will start his tenure burdened by a history of corruption allegations that cloud his reputation even as they remain unproved.        
	Though he has won the reluctant support of the Bush administration, which views him as a willing partner in the campaign against terrorism, Zardari will assume the presidency with what many consider untested governing skills as a tough Taliban insurgency threatens the very fabric of Pakistan, a nuclear-armed state of 165 million people.        
	It remains to be seen how forcefully he will act against militants in the face of Pakistani public opposition to American pressure. Nor is it clear how much influence he exerts over the still powerful military and the nations premier spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence.        
	The editor-in-chief of the Daily Times, Najam Sethi, once an opponent and now a supporter of Zardari, said the elevation of the Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairman would suit the Americans. Zardari, he said: Will learn on the job. And indeed, Zardari, 53, has shown canny political skills as he has moved in the last two weeks to outmanoeuvred his former coalition partner, Nawaz Sharif.         
	But with the economy in a downward spiral and foreign exchange reserves perilously low, Zardaris reputation for using political perches to benefit himself and his friends has left many here and in Washington worried about how he will restore economic confidence. There are concerns about the oversight of a $15 billion package of non-military aid proposed by the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, and backed by the Bush administration.         
	Pakistan has only $6 billion in foreign exchange reserves, disappearing at the rate of close to $2 billion a month to pay for oil and food. Several prominent economists said much investor nervousness stemmed from mistrust of Zardari, who was investment minister in Bhuttos government when it was accused of demanding illicit payments in return for deals that exceeded the accepted levels of corruption in Pakistan.

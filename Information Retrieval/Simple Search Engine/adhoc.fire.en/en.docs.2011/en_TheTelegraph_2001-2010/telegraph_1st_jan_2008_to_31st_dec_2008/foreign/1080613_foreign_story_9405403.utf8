                              All digits intact                            
	Los Angeles, June 12 (AP): Agent 007 still has all of his digits.        
	Daniel Craig was sent to the hospital after suffering a minor hand injury while filming the latest James Bond movie Quantum of Solace at Pinewood Studios near London.        
	There was a minor incident on set, Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group spokesman Steve Elzer told The Associated Press yesterday. Daniel injured his hand. He sought medical attention. He was back on the set within a matter of hours and production went on.        
	An email and phone call to the 40-year-old British actors publicist was not immediately returned yesterday.        
	Its not the first accident thats occurred during filming for Quantum of Solace. Stuntmen were injured while filming an action sequence on famously winding lakeside roads in Northern Italy in April. Neither Craig, director Marc Forster or any other cast members were at the location when those accidents occurred. Solace is the 22nd Bond film and is scheduled for release later this year.

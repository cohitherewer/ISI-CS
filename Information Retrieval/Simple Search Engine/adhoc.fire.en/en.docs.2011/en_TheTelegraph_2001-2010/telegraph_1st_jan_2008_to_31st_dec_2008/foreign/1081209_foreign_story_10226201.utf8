          SEBASTIAN ROTELLA                            (Top) Khan and Hicks				                                 
	London, Dec. 8: The Pakistani extremist group suspected in the Mumbai rampage remains a distant shadow for most Americans. But the threat is much nearer than it seems.         
	For years, Lashkar-e-Toiba has actively recruited westerners, especially Britons and Americans, serving as a kind of farm team for Islamic militants who have gone on to execute attacks for al Qaida, a close ally. The Pakistani network makes its training camps accessible to English speakers, providing crucial skills to an increasingly young and western-born generation of extremists.        
	Briton Aabid Khan was one of them. When British police arrested him at Manchester International Airport on his return from Pakistan in June 2006, they found a trove of terrorist propaganda and manuals on his laptop that the trial judge later described as amongst the largest and most extensive ever discovered.         
	The haul included maps and videos of potential targets in New York city and Washington.         
	One video, shot deep in Pakistani extremist turf, shows the then-21-year-old Khan with a grinning young man who says hes from Los Angeles  a mysterious figure in a case that apparently illustrates Lashkars dangerous reach.         
	In August, a court here sentenced Khan to 12 years in prison on charges of possession of articles for use in an act of terrorism and making records useful for terrorism.        
	As a hub of a cyber-constellation of extremist cells, the Briton organised training expeditions to Pakistan for his confederates, computer-obsessed youths who, whatever their mother tongue, communicated in the fractured English slang of the Internet and hatched plots against their homelands in the West, according to his trial.        
	Lashkars western-oriented propaganda attracts converts such as David Hicks, an Australian whom the group trained, then provided with a letter of introduction to al Qaida in 2000.         
	Hicks ended up meeting Osama bin Laden at an Afghan camp; he complained to Bin Laden about the lack of English-language terrorist manuals and translated such materials before his capture in late 2001, according to his admission in court.        
	Hicks was released from the US prison at Guantanamo Bay last year after pleading guilty to providing support for terrorism.

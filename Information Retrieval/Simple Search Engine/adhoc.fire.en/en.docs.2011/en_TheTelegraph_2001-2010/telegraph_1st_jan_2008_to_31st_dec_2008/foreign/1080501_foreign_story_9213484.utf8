	London, April 30 (AP): When John Lennon gave teenager Gail Renard the scribbled lyrics to Give Peace A Chance in 1969, he told her to hold on to the piece of paper.        
	It will be worth something someday, predicted Lennon, wearing striped pajamas at the time since he was in the midst of his and Yoko Onos famous eight-day bed- in in Montreal, Canada.        
	She did, and it is. Christies plans to auction the lyric sheet in July as the centrepiece in its rock and pop memorabilia sale. The words to the enduring peace anthem are expected to fetch more than $400,000.        
	I think the interest is there because this is certainly one of the most recognisable and influential of John Lennons solo compositions, said a Christies official.

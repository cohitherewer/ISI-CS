          ANITA SINGH                              
	London, Nov. 12: Actress Jennifer Aniston has spoken for the first time about Brad Pitts relationship with Angelina Jolie, branding her rivals behaviour really uncool.         
	At the time, Pitt and Jolie strenuously denied rumours of an affair, but the Tomb Raider actress has since admitted that they fell in love on the set. She has said of making the film: We found this strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly happened.         
	Breaking her silence on the marriage break-up in an interview with US Vogue, Aniston first asked the interviewer to turn off his tape recorder. However, she then went on the record to declare she was angry at Jolies insensitivity. There was stuff printed there that was definitely from a time when I was unaware that it was happening. I felt those details were a little inappropriate to discuss, Aniston said.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak fury over US raid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pak fury over US raid
                            
	Islamabad, Sept. 4 (AP): Pakistans National Assembly passed resolutions today condemning an American-led attack in Pakistani territory after the government summoned the US ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid.        
	The chorus of criticism grew two days before Asif Ali Zardari is expected to be chosen as President in a vote by legislators. A spokesman said Zardari condemned yesterdays pre-dawn assault in the South Waziristan tribal region. It killed at least 15 people, officials say, and was the first known foreign ground assault in Pakistan against a Taliban haven. But Zardari also said Pakistan stands with the US against international terrorism.        
	An American official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of cross-border operations, confirmed to The Associated Press that US troops conducted the raid about 1.6km from the Afghan border.        
	It was unclear whether any extremist leader was killed or captured. Pakistans border region is considered a likely hiding place for Osama bin Laden and al Qaidas number two leader, Ayman al-Zawahri.        
	Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi condemned the attack, saying no important terrorist or high-value target was killed but that innocent citizens, including women and children were targeted.        
	Pakistan army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas, citing witness and intelligence reports, said troops flew in on at least one big CH-47 Chinook transport helicopter, blasted their way into several houses and gunned down men they found there.

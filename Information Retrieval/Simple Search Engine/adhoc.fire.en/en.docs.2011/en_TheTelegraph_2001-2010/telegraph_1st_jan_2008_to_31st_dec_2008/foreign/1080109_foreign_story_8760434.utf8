The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Politics in my blood, says Bilawal
                                                                                                            Politics in my blood, says Bilawal
  - BENAZIR SON HANDLES MEDIA WITH CONFIDENCE          AMIT ROY                          Bilawal Bhutto in London on Tuesday. (AP)                                        
	London, Jan. 8: Possibly it was not the wisest choice of words but Benazir Bhuttos 19-year-old son and heir apparent, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, arrived in London today and declared: Politics is also in my blood.        
	 As he addressed a packed press conference at a London hotel, he appeared confident, as though to the manner born.         
	As Bilawal prepared to begin his second term at Christ Church, Oxford, where he is reading history, the Chancellor of Oxford, Lord Patten, told The Telegraph: I just hope that despite the obvious security issues he can get as much as possible out of Oxford. What a huge responsibility for a young man to carry.        
	The young man was certainly impressive today in the manner he handled the press. I was called and I have stepped up, he said.        
	Dressed in a light shirt and dark suit, he won journalists over by admitting: Im a bit nervous. And he showed a touch of tenderness when he asked the media to respect the privacy of his sisters, Bakhtawar and Asifa, who have returned to their home in Dubai.        
	 Every time he looked up, he had to face an explosion of flash bombs, which is something he will have to get used to. He also asked for privacy for himself so that he could lead as normal a life as possible at Oxford and spoke of how his mothers death had affected him. It has made me more resilient and I feel I really want to see democracy for Pakistan now, he responded. While other young men lugging their trunks into their rooms at Oxford will be worrying about where their next girlfriend was going to come from, Bilawal had to answer questions about the future of Pakistan and how and why a boy of 19 had the possible future leadership of his country thrust on him. This is how our party exercises leadership, he responded, displaying a little of the Bhutto streak.        
	He skirted round the questions of his own security. I understand that there are risks, but at the same time it has to be done. He expressed his familys gratitude that Scotland Yard detectives had flown to Pakistan to investigate his mothers death.        
	 But he said: However, the familys and partys request is for a UN-sponsored investigation, because we do not believe that an investigation which is under the authority of the Pakistani government has the necessary transparency. Already so much forensic evidence has been destroyed.        
	 He would not say who he thought was responsible for his mothers murder but commented: It is our belief that had she been provided with adequate protection, she would be alive today. As you know, my mother was very courageous and loved being with people. Aware of the risks, on the day of her death she knew that so many thousands had travelled from far across the country to see her and she did not want to disappoint them. It was the same courage she showed when she stood at the front of the bus on her return to Pakistan from exile last October. If elections were not held, he feared Pakistan would disintegrate.        
	Again perhaps unwisely he used the word bloodline in explaining how power had been thrust on him. Some of the questions he had anticipated and so he read out a prepared statement, which may have been written with the help of his father, Asif Zardari.

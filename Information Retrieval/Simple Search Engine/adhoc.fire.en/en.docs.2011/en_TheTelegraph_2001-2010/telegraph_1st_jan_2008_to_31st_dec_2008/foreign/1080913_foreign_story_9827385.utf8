	London, Sept. 12 (Reuters) - Britains third-largest package holiday operator XL Leisure Group grounded all flights today after going into the red, leaving tens of thousands of holidaymakers stranded.        
	XL said its companies, which include Kosmar Villa Holidays and The Really Great Holiday Company, had been unable to obtain fresh funding to keep going after suffering from volatile fuel prices and the economic downturn.        
	Customers arriving at airports expecting to head off to holiday destinations were hugely disappointed to find out their flights had been cancelled. Jim Duwaine from Portsmouth told the BBC he was absolutely devastated... We got up at midnight planning on going on holiday, but got let down, unfortunately. Were here, just trying to get some other flights, but its not looking good.

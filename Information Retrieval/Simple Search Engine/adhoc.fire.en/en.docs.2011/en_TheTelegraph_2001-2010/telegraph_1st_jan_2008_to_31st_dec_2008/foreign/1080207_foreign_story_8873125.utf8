	London, Feb. 6 (AFP): A British student swallowed his door key to prevent friends from forcing him to go home because he was drunk, reports said today        
	Chris Foster, studying computer design at Bournemouth University in southern England, had drunk six beers as well as vodka and whisky when his friends decided he should go home and sleep it off.         
	But the 18-year-old wanted to keep partying. My friends said Id had too much to drink and should go to my room. But I didnt want to so I swallowed my door key, he said, according to the Daily Mirror.        
	I just laughed at the idea of stopping drinking, I wanted to carry on and not go home. So I dry swallowed my own door key as a prank, he told the Basingstoke Gazette. It didnt hurt at the time but now my throat is slightly scratched and its painful to eat.

	Islamabad, Sept 9: Slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos widower Asif Ali Zardari today pledged to improve ties with neighbours as he was sworn in as Pakistans fourteenth President.        
	Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Doggar administered the oath of office to Zardari who was elected on Saturday by the National Assembly, the Senate and the four provincial Assemblies to lead the country for the next five years.        
	 Zardari entered the presidency three weeks after his predecessor Pervez Musharraf resigned amid threats of impeachment by the coalition government for violating the Constitution in October 1999 and November 2007 .        
	Zardaris three children, son Bilawal and daughters Bakhtawar and Asifa, and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan attended the ceremony.        
	Later, at a news conference Karzai and Zardari stressed their intention to work together to solve problems, including surging militant violence.         
	We shall stand with our neighbours... and look the problems in the eye and tell the world that we are bigger than the problems, Zardari said.        
	Karzai reiterated his call to go after militants in their sanctuaries, whether they be in Pakistan or Afghanistan, and for international forces to avoid civilian casualties, after a spate of such incidents.        
	The war against terrorism will only be won if we have the people with us. In order to have the people with us we must avoid civilian casualties, Karzai said.        
	An impatient United States is intensifying its efforts to kill militants in Pakistans ethnic Pashtun lands on the Afghan border, while the militants are responding with ever more deadly strikes in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.

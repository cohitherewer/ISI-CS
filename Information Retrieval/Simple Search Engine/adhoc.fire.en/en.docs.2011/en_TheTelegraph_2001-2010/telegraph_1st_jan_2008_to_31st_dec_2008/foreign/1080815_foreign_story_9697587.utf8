	Skyline slip-up    
	 London, Aug. 14 (AP): Britains second-largest city, Birmingham, has a new skyline  only it belongs to its American namesake.      
	Birmingham City Council in nothern England distributed 720,000 leaflets that praised residents for exceeding recycling targets.      
	Thank You Birmingham was stamped across a photograph of the citys skyline. But the photo was not of Birmingham, England, but of Birmingham, Alabama.      
	It is the second time officials have mistakenly used images of Birmingham, Alabama. Three lawmakers who represent Birmingham at the European Parliament accidentally used a picture of the US city on their joint Internet site in January. I would have thought the council would take more care, said Birmingham resident Jon Cooper. I cant believe no one at the town hall noticed.

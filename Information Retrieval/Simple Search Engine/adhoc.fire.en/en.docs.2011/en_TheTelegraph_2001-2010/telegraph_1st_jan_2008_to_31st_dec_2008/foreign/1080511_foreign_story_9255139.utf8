The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Myanmar vote amid aid chaos
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Myanmar vote amid aid chaos

	Yangon, May 10 (Reuters): Myanmar held a rare election to approve a new army-drafted Constitution today while many of the 1.5 million survivors of a devastating cyclone waited in vain for a concerted aid effort to bring them food and medicine.        
	Though nervous voters were under orders to vote yes to a Constitution that will enshrine a dominant role for the ruling military, it was the first real election in nearly two decades.        
	Army-controlled MRTV ran a final Myanmarese-style get the vote out propaganda blitz featuring jaunty actresses singing Lets go voting and Come along for voting to a boppy disco beat.        
	While the junta relentlessly focused on the poll, thousands of survivors of the cyclone that hammered Myanmar a week ago waited for food, medicine and shelter.        
	Ten thousand hungry and bedraggled refugees have turned up in Myaung Mya, west of Yangon, and their numbers were swelling by the day despite a lack of food and shelter, an aid volunteer said today.        
	The government has provided no help and the town cannot cope, residents say. We have 900 people here but we only have 300 lunch boxes. We gave it to the women and children first. The men still have not had any food, the aid volunteer told Reuters.        
	Protesters in Japan, Malaysia and Thailand denounced the junta for holding the referendum in disregard for the suffering of what the UN has estimated to be 1.5 million severely affected cyclone survivors.        
	Even before Cyclone Nargis hit on the night of May 2, groups opposed to military rule, and foreign governments led by the US, had denounced the vote as an attempt by the military to legitimise its 46-year grip on power.        
	The governments feeble response to the disaster has only fed cynicism about the juntas determination to proceed with their roadmap to democracy leading to multi-party elections in 2010.        
	The UN appealed for $187 million in aid, even though it is still not confident the food, water and tents flown in will make it to those most in need because of the juntas reluctance to admit international relief workers.        
	Health experts warned that a second disaster loomed from diseases such as diarrhoea and malaria, even if survivors do manage to find food and shelter.        
	This is the second disaster, Greg Beck, southeast Asia programme director for the International Rescue Committee, told Reuters. First was the cyclone and the surge of water, the second will come if there is no access to food, water and shelter. They will start dying, he said.        
	Official Myanmar media today revised the death toll to 23,335 people dead and 37,019 missing.         
	The generals approved one US aid flight, due to arrive as soon as Monday carrying water purification systems and supplies to ward off waterborne diseases, US officials said.        
	The US navy is sending four ships on exercises in Thailand towards Myanmar. France said it was sending a naval ship carrying heavy-lift helicopters and 1,500 tonnes of aid, which would arrive by the middle of next week.         
	The Americans say they are preparing the same kind of assistance they provided after the 2004 Asian tsunami and the 2005 Pakistan earthquake.

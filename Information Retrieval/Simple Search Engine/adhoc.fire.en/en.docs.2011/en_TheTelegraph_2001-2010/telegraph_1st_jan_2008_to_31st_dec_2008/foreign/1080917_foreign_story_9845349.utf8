	Kiev, Sept. 16 (Reuters): Ukraines pro-western coalition was dissolved today, opening the way to tough talks on finding a viable alternative to govern the country.        
	If the talks fail, Ukraine faces its third election in as many years. The orange coalition, made up of groups led by President Viktor Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, collapsed this month when the Presidents allies walked out.

	New Delhi, Sept. 15: Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, better known as Prachanda, began his five-day visit to India today, saying his countrys crucial ties with India could not be compared to those with China.        
	Because of our specific cultural and historical tradition of economic interdependence, relations with India are crucial and vital. Although we also want to develop ties with China, they cannot be compared right now and there is no question of comparison, Prachanda said at a luncheon meeting hosted by apex industry bodies CII, Ficci and Assocham.         
	Prachandas visit to Beijing to attend the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games  his first foreign trip as Prime Minister  had raised eyebrows in India. Delhi is usually the first port of call for any new Nepali head of government.         
	For much of the meeting, Prachanda made a strong pitch for Indian investments in his country.        
	We will do all we can to ensure industrial security in Nepal. The government of Nepal remains committed to adopt every possible measure to provide investors the necessary security, he said.        
	With Maoists leading the coalition government in Kathmandu, Indian companies are concerned about security and labour unrest in Nepal. The Dabur group, which has a manufacturing facility there, has faced labour problems.        
	The Prime Minister sought to allay the fears, promising to adopt every possible measure to provide investors the necessary security, including repatriation of capital and profit earned by them.         
	He stressed the need for a joint effort. We understand the security concern of India and we are also very much concerned about our own security. We would have to go ahead collectively.        
	Prachanda said a high-level investment board, headed by him, would be constituted to introduce necessary reforms in industrial policy. It would also suggest measures to simplify the process of setting up business in Nepal, create an investment-friendly environment and ensure fast-track solutions to problems.         
	Prachanda made a pitch for the joint development of Nepals hydropower potential. He said he was looking at big projects and was open to considering subsidies in the sector.

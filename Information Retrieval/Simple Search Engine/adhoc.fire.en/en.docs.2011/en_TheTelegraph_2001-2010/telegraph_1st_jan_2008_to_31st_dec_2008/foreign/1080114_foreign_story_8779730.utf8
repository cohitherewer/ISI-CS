	Abu Dhabi, Jan. 13 (Reuters): President George W. Bush accused Iran today of threatening security around the world by backing militants and urged his Gulf Arab allies to confront this danger before it is too late.
    
	Iran said it rejected such efforts to isolate it among its Gulf neighbours, adding that such policies of fooling the people in the region had already fallen flat.
    
	Speaking in Abu Dhabi, the third stop of his tour of Arab allies, Bush said ShiaIran was the worlds number one sponsor of terrorism and accused it of undermining peace by supporting the Hezbollah guerrilla group in Lebanon, Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and Shia militants in Iraq.
    
	Irans actions threaten the security of nations everywhere. So the United States is strengthening our longstanding security commitments with our friends in the Gulf and rallying friends around the world to confront this danger before it is too late.
    
	Iran is today the worlds leading state sponsor of terror. It sends hundreds of millions of dollars to extremists around the world while its own people face repression and economic hardship at home, he said in his keynote speech.
    
	Iran, which blames sectarian violence in Iraq on the US-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003, said Washingtons efforts to isolate Tehran fell flat.
    
	We advise them not to pursue such policies of fooling the people in the region, foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told a news conference. His comments were translated into English by Irans Press TV satellite station.
    
	The Bush administration has kept up a campaign of rhetoric against Iran, including accusing it of seeking nuclear capability.
    
	Bush last year said a nuclear-armed Iran could mean World War Three, and Washington is pushing for a third set of sanctions on Iran for refusing to halt enrichment work, as demand by the United Nations.
    
	Promise to IAEA
    
	Highly enriched uranium can be used in bombs. Tehran says it wants nuclear technology for civilian reasons and agreed today to clarify remaining questions about its nuclear work in the next month, the UN nuclear watchdog said.
    
	The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement Tehran also gave the watchdogs head, Mohamed ElBaradei, information about work to develop an advanced centrifuge able to enrich uranium much faster than the antiquated model it uses now.
    
	But diplomats said Tehran was stalling.

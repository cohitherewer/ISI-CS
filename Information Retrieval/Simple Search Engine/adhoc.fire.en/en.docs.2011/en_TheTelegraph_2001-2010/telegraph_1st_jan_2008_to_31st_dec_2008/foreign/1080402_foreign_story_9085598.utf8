The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Speaker probe
                                                                                                               Speaker probe
                            
	London, April 1 (Reuters): The House of Commons Speaker faces an investigation into allegations that his wife used thousands of pounds of taxpayers money to fund shopping trips by taxi, the parliamentary watchdog said late today.        
	Michael Martin will be investigated by the Parliamentary Commissions for Standards to determine whether he abused his expenses and allowances, officials said.        
	Critics called for him to resign his position overseeing a review of expenses by members of parliament. They are under intense fire after a scandal involving Derek Conway, the MP found to be paying most of his family at taxpayers expense.        
	A spokeswoman for the standards commissioner, John Lyon, confirmed the investigation following a request for a probe by the Taxpayers Alliance lobby group. The investigation centres on claims that Martins wife, Mary, claimed around 4,000 of taxi expenses, saying they were for official parliamentary business when she was actually just going shopping. Lyon said the claims might be in breach of the Commons code of conduct.        
	In essence, the part of your complaint I have accepted is that Mary Martins expenditure on taxis may not have been in accordance with the code of conduct for members of parliament, he wrote. Martin, who cannot be sacked, has resisted calls to resign despite his spokesman quitting in February because he said he had been misled over the issue. Mike Grannatt had briefed reporters that a Commons official had accompanied Mary Martin on all the trips while shopping. He resigned after it emerged that the official turned out to be her housekeeper.

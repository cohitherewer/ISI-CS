	Beijing, May 29 (Reuters): Luxury retailer Christian Dior has pulled advertisements featuring Sharon Stone from stores across China after the actress said the countrys earthquake was bad karma for Beijings policies in Tibet.        
	At least 68,000 people died in the earthquake, which came months after unrest in Tibet that sparked an international outcry over Beijings handling of the predominantly Buddhist region.        
	Due to some customer reaction we have decided to pull her image from all of the department stores and from all of China, Christian Dior China said in a statement.        
	Stone has a modelling contract with the cosmetics arm of Dior for which China is a fast-growing market.        
	The Beijing Times reported that Chinese cinemas would not show Stones films, though China already strictly limits the number of foreign films it distributes in theatres.        
	Stone apologised for her comments today. In the course of the interview I made inappropriate remarks and for any harm created towards the Chinese people I am extremely sad and apologise, the Beijing News quoted Stone as saying.

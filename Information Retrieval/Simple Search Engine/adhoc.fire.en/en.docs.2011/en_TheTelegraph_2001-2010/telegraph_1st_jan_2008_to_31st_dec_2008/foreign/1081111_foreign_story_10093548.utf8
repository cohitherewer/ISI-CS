	London, Nov. 10: Sharp-eyed 007 fans have apparently spied a string of mistakes in the new Bond thriller Quantum of Solace.         
	The film, which stars Daniel Craig as James Bond, is the 22nd Bond-based adventure and cost 100 million to make. It took a massive 24 million in its first weekend. However critics claim to have spotted as many as six continuity and factual errors that they say spoil the film.         
	In one of the chase scenes where Bond is driving his Aston Martin and is being pursued by an Alfa Romeo, one of the other cars is shown with Italian plates with a Vauxhall Corsa badge whereas in Italy all Vauxhalls are rebadged as Opels. Another error occurs on the registration plates for the Austrian vehicles, which have the prefix code in the incorrect place.         
	A similar mistake occurs when Bond, who is supposed to be a qualified pilot, reads out the registration number of a plane as Golf Zero, when it should be Golf Oscar. In the Haiti hotel room scene, the sign on the door is written in a mixture of French and English instead of grammatically correct French. In another scene, Bonds wristwatch appears in two different positions in the same shot  once with the face turned to the outside and once facing to the inside. The final blunder occurs when Bond arrives in the South American city of La Paz and the temperature is shown to be an uncharacteristic 46 degrees Fahrenheit  a chilly 7.8 degrees Celsius.

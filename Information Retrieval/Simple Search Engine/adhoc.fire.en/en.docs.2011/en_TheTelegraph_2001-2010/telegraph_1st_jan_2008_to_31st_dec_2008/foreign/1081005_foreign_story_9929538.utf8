The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kim appears in public after illness
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Kim appears in public after illness
                            
	Seoul, Oct. 4 (Reuters): North Korean leader Kim Jong-il made his first public appearance since reports last month that he may have suffered a stroke, a state news report said today.        
	US and South Korean officials said Kim, 66, may have suffered a stroke in August, raising questions about succession in Asias only communist dynasty and about who was making decisions about its nuclear weapons programme.        
	North Koreas official media said Kim saw a soccer match. It has been about 50 days since the countrys media noted Kim appeared in public. After watching the match, leader Kim Jong-il congratulated the players on their good results, saying that the revolutionary and militant students in our country are good at art and sporting activities, the Norths KCNA news agency reported.        
	South Korean intelligence sources said Kim had been recovering from his illness and that he had not lost his grip on power despite falling ill.        
	Kims reappearance came as the secretive state finished talks with a US nuclear envoy who went to Pyongyang this week trying to save a disarmament deal and prevent the North from restarting its nuclear plant.

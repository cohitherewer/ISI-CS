	Madonna movie    
	 Traverse City (Michigan), June 5 (AP): Tickets go on sale on Saturday for Madonnas appearance at the Traverse City Film Festival.      
	They will only be available, however, at the State Theatre in downtown Traverse City, where the pop star will show her new film, I Am Because We Are, on August 2. Festival founder Michael Moore has said Madonna will personally introduce the documentary, which describes the plight of impoverished people in Malawi.     
	Music plan    
	 Salzburg, Austria (AP): Austrian tourism officials are considering plans to build a Sound of Music museum in Salzburg devoted to the popular musical and film. Salzburg officials say a museum containing memorabilia from the film starring Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer could draw 140,000 visitors a year.

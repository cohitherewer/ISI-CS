                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Boucher fails to see any reform of ISI
                            
	Washington, Sept. 16 (Reuters): The Pakistani militarys powerful and controversial spy agency needs reform but there is no indication this is happening yet, the top US diplomat for South Asia said yesterday.        
	It has to be done, assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs Richard Boucher said of revamping the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, widely known as the ISI.        
	Asked if he had seen signs of reform, he told Reuters: No, I dont have anything in particular I would point to right now.        
	Despite its help in fighting the al Qaida, the ISI is viewed with deep suspicion by US officials who believe it retains links to the Taliban and other militants blamed for supporting attacks on US forces.

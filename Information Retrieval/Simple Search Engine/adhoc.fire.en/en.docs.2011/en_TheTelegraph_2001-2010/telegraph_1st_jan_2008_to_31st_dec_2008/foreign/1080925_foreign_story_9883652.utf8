	Nicole waters    
	 Sydney, Sept. 24 (AP): Oscar-winning actress Nicole Kidman said swimming in the Australian Outbacks fertility waters during production of her latest film may have contributed to her unexpected pregnancy over the past year.      
	The 41-year-old Aussie, who gave birth to daughter Sunday Rose in July, said she and six other women who swam in the waters of a small Outback town during production of the epic romance Australia fell pregnant.      
	I never thought that I would get pregnant and give birth to a child, but it happened on this movie, Kidman told The Australian Womens Weekly in an exclusive interview.

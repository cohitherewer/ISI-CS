	Strip slap     
	 Wellington, May 23 (Reuters): Road workers in a small New Zealand town got their wish granted when a woman stripped saying she was fed up with their wolf-whistles.      
	The Israeli tourist was about to use an ATM in the main street of Kerikeri, in the far north of the country, when the men whistled, the New Zealand Press Association reported.      
	She calmly stripped off, used the cash machine, before getting dressed and walking away.      
	The woman told police she didnt take too kindly to the whistling from the men.      
	She said she had thought to bugger them, Ill show them what Ive got, police sergeant Peter Masters said.    
	Stamp slip     
	Frankfurt (Reuters): German mail company Deutsche Post has inadvertently issued stamps bearing the image of Adolf Hitlers former deputy, Rudolf Hess, the company said on Wednesday. Deutsche Post printed 20 stamps with Hess next to a bouquet of flowers as part of a service which allows clients to order custom-made envelopes. It is very unfortunate. But it happened, a company spokesperson said.

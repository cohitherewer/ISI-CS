	London, Oct. 23 (AP): A team of British engineers today announced plans to shatter the worlds land speed record by creating a car that can travel over 1,600 kmph  more than 320 kmph faster than the record they set in 1997.         
	The man tapped to sit behind the wheel of the Bloodhound SSC is Wing Commander Andy Green, who steered the Thrust supersonic car across Nevadas Blackrock Desert to its record-setting success. The Royal Air Force pilot said he wasnt worried. The jets, the very high speeds, the complex systems, the quick responses, handling a 10-ton vehicle, that is something Im used to, Green said in an interview.

	Singer support    
	 New York, March 7 (AP): A leukaemia patient in dire need of a bone marrow transplant has found a donor after Grammy Award-winning singer Rihanna publicised her case, People magazine reported.      
	 Lisa Gershowitz Flynn, a 41-year-old lawyer and mother of two small children, was diagnosed in November 2007 with acute myelogenous leukaemia, a fast-growing cancer of the blood and bone marrow. People.com said last month that doctors had told Flynn she needed to find a marrow donor. When I heard about Lisas plight, my heart broke, Rihanna said.

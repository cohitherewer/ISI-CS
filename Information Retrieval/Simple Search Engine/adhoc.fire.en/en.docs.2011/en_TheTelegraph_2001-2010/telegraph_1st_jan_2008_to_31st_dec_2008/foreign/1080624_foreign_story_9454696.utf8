	Brisbane, June 23 (AP): A man found asleep in a motorised wheelchair on a highway in northern Australia has been charged with drunk driving, police said today.        
	Officers in a patrol car noticed the man slumped in the stationary chair about 10 am on Friday on an exit lane near the tourist city of Cairns, regional traffic Inspector Bob Waters said. Cars were swerving to get around him, he added.        
	The officers breath-tested the 64-year-old man, who registered a blood alcohol reading of 0.301  more than six times the legal driving limit. He was charged with operating a vehicle while drunk and ordered to report to court on July 7.        
	The vehicles that we normally hear about with drink driving are the family car, the truck, the motorbike, Waters said.         
	But there are also other classes of vehicles that are subject to drink-driving laws, including horses, bicycles, and motorised wheelchairs.

	Aug. 8 (Reuters): Some key facts about the breakaway region of South Ossetia:        
	 Separatism: The collapse of the Soviet Union spurred a separatist movement in South Ossetia, which had always felt more affinity with Russia than with Georgia. It broke away from Georgian rule in a war in 1991-92        
	 Dialect: The majority of the roughly 70,000 people are ethnically distinct from Georgians and speak their own language, related to Farsi. They say they were forcibly absorbed into Georgia under Soviet rule        
	 Russian support: Around two-thirds of annual budget revenues of around $30 million come directly from Moscow. Almost all the population hold Russian passports. They use the Russian rouble as their currency.        
	 Conflict: A peacekeeping force with 500 members each from Russia, Georgia and North Ossetia monitors a truce. Georgia accuses the Russian peacekeepers of siding with the separatists, which Moscow denies. Sporadic clashes between separatist and Georgian forces have killed dozens of people in the last few years.         
	 Peace deal: Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili has proposed a peace deal under which South Ossetia would be given a large degree of autonomy within a federal state. The separatist leaders say they want full independence.

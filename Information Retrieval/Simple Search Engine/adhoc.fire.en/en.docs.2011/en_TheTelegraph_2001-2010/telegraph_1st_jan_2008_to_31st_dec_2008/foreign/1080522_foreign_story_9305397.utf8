  - Resignation offer in return for indemnity: Report        NASIR JAFFRY                           Musharraf                                        
	Islamabad, May 21: President Pervez Musharraf has offered to resign in return for indemnity by the parliament for unconstitutional steps taken by him last year when he declared emergency, according to a newspaper report.         
	The English-language daily The News claimed that the offer was made during recent rounds of negotiations between the presidency and the Zardari camp on the constitutional package that the Pakistan Peoples Party has prepared.         
	It came through when the Aiwan-i-Sadr (the Presidents house) realised that the PPP would restore all the judges and clip the presidential powers, the paper quoted sources as saying.         
	A powerless presidency with the pre-November 3 judges back in the saddle was not an acceptable option for Musharraf,it added.         
	Musharraf had deposed the judges after they refused to take a fresh oath of allegiance to him following the imposition of emergency on November 3.         
	Critics say Musharraf sacked the judges after it looked that the Supreme Court might overturn his controversial victory in the 2007 presidential election that he contested in uniform. Musharraf is demanding a price to agree to the constitutional package and then step down, a source said.         
	However, the PPP is not willing to grant indemnity without taking its pound of flesh. The PPP will grant selective indemnity but to avoid public backlash, it wants Musharraf to step down afterwards. What steps of Musharraf will be indemnified is not yet finalised but the constitutional amendment will have a pardon for Musharraf, the source said.         
	The source, well connected with the senior PPP leadership, said the party was playing its cards shrewdly and would negotiate a tough deal with Musharraf.         
	Musharrafs spokesperson Rashid Qureshi, a retired military official, did not comment on the issue of indemnity, Musharrafs offer to resign and the said quid pro quo.         
	It was learnt that the PPP has offered Musharraf a win-win solution because if he does not step down, the constitutional petition challenging his eligibility as a candidate for President would come up for hearing in front of the restored judiciary, the paper said. In such a scenario attorney-general Malik Qayyum, who was sacked as a judge for corruption, would not be able to defend Musharrafs case.

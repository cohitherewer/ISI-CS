	Bhurban, Pakistan, March 9: Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) on Sunday unveiled a power-sharing deal, days ahead the convening of inaugural National Assembly session by President Pervez Musharraf.        
	Co-chairperson PPP Asif Ali Zardari and PML(N) chief Nawaz Sharif signed a joint declaration in the hill resort of Bhurban, 35km from Islamabad after lengthy talks, which mainly focused on formation of government and restoration of 60 deposed judges of the superior court.        
	We, the coalition partners, undertake to form a coalition government for democratic Pakistan and translating the mandate given to us by people of Pakistan in February 18 elections, Nawaz Sharif said while reading out the declaration at a joint media conference with Zardari.        
	He said the coalition partners were ready to form the government as national and provincial assemblies sessions are convened.        
	It was agreed that the PML(N) will be part of the federal cabinet while the PPP will join the provincial government in Punjab, he added.         
	The PML(N) decision to join the cabinet of ministers led by a PPP Prime Minister came as a major departure from its previous policy to confine itself to offering support from outside.        
	Sharif and other party leaders often said they would not nominate any ministers in the cabinet because they would be administered oath by Musharraf, whom they regard as illegal and unconstitutional President.        
	Under the power-sharing formula, the Speaker and the deputy Speaker of the National Assembly will be from the PPP while PML(N) will nominate its candidates for the same posts in the Punjab assembly.         
	The two leaders, however, did not announce name of the future Prime Minister.        
	We will move slowly and gradually, Zardari said without dropping a hint as to who is being considered for the top slot in the wake of differences between him and the frontrunner Makhdoom Amin Fahim, who was not present at the talks on Sunday.        
	However, Sharif said it was decided that a nominee for office of the Prime Minister shall be supported by the coalition partners, the PML(N) and nationalist Awami National Party (ANP).        
	It was suggested by PML(N) that a candidate for premiership should be one who can deliver on the joint agenda of coalition, the two-time former industrialist Prime Minister said.        
	The two parties also decided in principle to restore the judges, including deposed chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who were sacked after their refusal to take a fresh oath under the provisional constitutional order that Musharraf issued on November 3 after imposition of the state of emergency in the country.         
	In todays special summit meeting, it was decided that restoration of deposed judges, as it was on November 2, 2007, will be brought about through a parliamentary resolution to be passed by the National Assembly within 30 days of the formation of new government, Sharif said.         
	Asked if the coalition government would be ready to work with Musharraf, Zardari replied: We do not believe in personal agenda nor do we believe in offices of the President and Prime Minister. We hope that everybody will work together in harmony and strengthen democracy.         
	But Sharif was unequivocal in opposing Musharraf, saying: We consider him as illegal and unconstitutional and do not recognise him.         
	Musharraf should now realise that people have given a verdict against him. I am sure that even the hung parliament will be against his eight-year dictatorial rule, he stressed.         
	Zardari, who sounded less combative, said: We feel that Pakistan stands on the verge of making history and we intend to stick to the road to democracy.

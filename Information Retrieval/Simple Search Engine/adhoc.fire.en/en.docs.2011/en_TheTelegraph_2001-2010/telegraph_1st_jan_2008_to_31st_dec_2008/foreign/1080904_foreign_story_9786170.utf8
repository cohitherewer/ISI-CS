                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US-led strike in Pak village
          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, Sept. 3: The US-led coalition forces deployed across the border raided a village in Pakistans tribal region today and killed at least 20 people in a first-ever direct assault.         
	Pakistan instantly condemned the attack as outrageous which analysts believe will put strain on already tense relations between Islamabad and Washington, the two main allies in the war against terror.         
	Locals in Jalal Khel village near Angor Adda town in South Waziristan said four helicopters belonging to coalition forces deployed in Afghanistan dropped troops and flew them back after the attack. They said that coalition soldiers opened fire on locals when the came out of their houses on hearing sound of helicopters         
	The helicopters landed while people were eating early meals before fasting as part of the holy month of Ramazan, a local said, adding that those killed in the operation included nine members of a family of local tribesman Taj Muhammad. The dead also included five women and four children.         
	Pakistans tribal regions of South and North Waziristan have been experiencing missiles strikes in the past, which killed dozens of people including some of the top foreign militants. But the raid by coalition troops in South Waziristan, a known hub of Taliban and al Qaida fugitives was rare.         
	Pakistan has been protesting over a wave of missile strikes attributed to US-led forces in Afghanistan in recent months which have killed a number of people.         
	In one of the similar missile strikes in July, al Qaida chemical weapons expert Midhat Mursi al-Sayid Umar was killed. The Egyptian, 54, also known as Abu Khabab al-Masri, had a $5-million bounty on his head and allegedly ran terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.         
	The US and Nato officials repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction over Pakistans efforts to curb militancy and growing influence of Taliban and Al-Qaeda rebels in the tribal regions, which they believe are being used by militants to launch attacks on foreign forces operating in Afghanistan.         
	Governor North West Frontier Province Owais Ahmed Ghani termed the attack as outrageous.         
	He also confirmed that coalition helicopter gunships and commandos took part in the attack, launched in a village in South Waziristan.         
	Ghani said in a statement issued in Peshawar, the capital city of NWFP that this was a direct attack on the sovereignty of Pakistan. People of Pakistan expect that their armed forces would give a befitting reply to all such attacks, he added.

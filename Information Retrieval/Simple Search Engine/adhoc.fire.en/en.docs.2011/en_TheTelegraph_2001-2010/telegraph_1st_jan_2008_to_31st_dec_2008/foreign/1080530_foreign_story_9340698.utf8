	London, May 29: A investigation into health threats posed by air circulating in aircraft has been launched by the British government.         
	The inquiry, announced by Jim Fitzpatrick, the aviation minister, follows complaints from pilots and passengers of nausea, dizziness and other health problems both during and after flights.         
	The governments committee on toxicity believes passengers on one in 2,000 flights could be exposed to toxins in cabin air.         
	But others put the figure higher, including Sarah Mackenzie Ross, a clinical neuropsychologist at University College London, who believed as many as 200,000 passengers a year could be affected.         
	Pilots had reported bad smells or what they believed was contaminated air on a number of aircraft including the Boeing 757, Airbus 319 and BAe 146.         
	According to the department for transport there were 116 reports on contaminated air submitted to the civil aviation authority in 2007.         
	Hundreds of reports of fume incidents have also been filed by pilots across the world in recent years.         
	They deal with what happens when toxic air seeps into the cockpit or the cabin from the engine.         
	Critics have accused the aviation industry of trying to cover up a long-established problem, although this is strongly denied by airlines.         
	The impact of toxic fumes  known as aerotoxic syndrome by specialists  can be dramatic.         
	Neils Gomer, the captain of a Swedish aircraft, was rendered almost helpless. He said many of the 73 passengers on board his aircraft fell into a very deep sleep.         
	It was such incidents and a battery of complaints by pilots which led to the establishment of the committee on toxicity.         
	The committee was told by the British Airline Pilots Association that some of its members were complaining of acute and chronic illnesses as a result of inhaling minute particles of engine oil and hydraulic fluid which had seeped into the air being pumped into the cabin.         
	But the committee could find no link between cabin air and long term health damage, but it recommended further research         
	It was this which led the department for transport to embark on cabin air tests which will be carried out at Cranfield University.         
	The British government is the first to launch a detailed study of fume events, which are sporadic and can last less than a minute.

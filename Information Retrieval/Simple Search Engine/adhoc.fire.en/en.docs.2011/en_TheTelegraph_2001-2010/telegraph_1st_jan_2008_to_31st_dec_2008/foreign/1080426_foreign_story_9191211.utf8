                              No couch exercise                            
	Chicago, April 25 (AP): Tom Cruise is scheduled to return to The Oprah Winfrey Show, nearly three years after a couch-jumping appearance spawned countless YouTube parodies and late-night jokes.        
	The two-part show will coincide with the 25th anniversary of Cruises booty-shaking turn in the film Risky Business. Cruise became the butt of jokes after a May 2005 appearance on Winfreys show, where he repeatedly jumped on the talk-show hosts couch, saying his love for girlfriend Katie Holmes was beyond cool.        
	Cruise and Holmes became parents in April 2006.

	Colombo, Oct. 29 (Reuters): Dual Tamil Tiger air raids on Sri Lankas capital and a northern military base show the guerrillas are not out of the fight despite the governments confidence it is close to ending the 25-year-old civil war.        
	Analysts said the raids by the LTTE ramshackle air wing followed a familiar pattern of giving the rebels a morale boost when they appeared under pressure in the northern war zone.        
	The military has been steadily advancing into Tiger-held territory in northern Sri Lanka with the aim of ending one of Asias oldest insurgencies. The military today said troops had captured the Jayapuram area after heavy clashes.        
	The Tigers are fighting to create a separate homeland for Sri Lankan Tamils, many of whom complain of marginalisation by successive governments led by the Sinhalese majority since independence from Britain in 1948.        
	When the Tigers are under pressure militarily up north, they try to divert attention to southern or central parts and hit where the government is weak, Eurasia Group analyst Maria Kuusisto said.        
	They understand that these are going to be psychologically and strategically good targets to attack.        
	The rebel raid at the Kelanitissa power station in Colombo late yesterday started a fire and killed one person who died of a heart attack and wounded two, hospital officials said.         
	The military said an attack on the Thalladi army camp an hour earlier wounded three people.        
	As a plane appeared on radar heading south to Colombo, authorities shut off the lights and scrambled jets then anti-aircraft fire streaked the sky off the capitals shoreline.        
	The pro-rebel web site www.TamilNet.com today said the Kelanitissa raid killed a turbine operator and knocked out two turbines and two air coolers, citing unidentified sources. The government earlier had said only two coolers were hit.        
	TamilNet also said the attack at Thalladi, in Mannar district near the war zone about 250 km north of Colombo, caused heavy damage. The military said it barely caused any.        
	Colombo-based defence analyst Iqbal Athas said the latest strike by the Tamileelam Air Force, or Air Tigers, showed the resilience of what is widely regarded as one of the worlds most ruthless and effective guerrilla groups.        
	However primitive, their air ability remains. They have been able to demonstrate nine times that they can carry out a sortie and get away, and on all of those occasions the air force has not been able to neutralise them, Athas said.        
	The air force has been embarrassed and frustrated by its inability to stop the propeller-driven two-seater planes despite vastly superior supersonic jets and radar.        
	The military has said it believes the Tigers air wing, which started in March 2007, consists of three Czech-made Zlin-143 aircraft.

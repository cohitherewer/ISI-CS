The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Divisions deepen in Pak alliance

	Islamabad, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Pakistans ruling coalition parties wrangled over the presidency and deposed judges today, continuing infighting critics say keeps them from tackling rising militant violence and a sagging economy.        
	The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the leading coalition partner, said yesterday the widower of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Asif Ali Zardari, would be its candidate in the presidential election set for September 6.        
	The move further annoyed another former Prime Minister and the chief of the second biggest party in the alliance, Nawaz Sharif, who has been pressing for reinstatement of judges purged by former President Pervez Musharraf late last year in the face of PPP reluctance.        
	Musharraf resigned as President last Monday in the face of threatened impeachment by the coalition.        
	The deepening differences between the PPP and Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) look increasingly likely to lead to a break-up in the six-month-old coalition.        
	If theyre taking steps unilaterally then what can we do? It looks like the Peoples Party wants to break ties with us, Sharifs party spokesperson, Ahsan Iqbal, said today.        
	Sharif wants the post of President stripped of strong powers, in particular to dismiss the parliament. But a senior official from Bhuttos party has made it clear that would only be dealt with after the presidential election.        
	Iqbal said his partys leadership would meet tomorrow to decide on a plan of action after the move by the PPP.        
	A small coalition partner from North West Frontier Province (NWFP) said today it would support Zardari in the presidential election. The new President will be chosen by both the chambers of Pakistans parliament and four provincial assemblies.        
	Its time to keep the coalition intact as the country is facing serious threats of growing militancy and a worsening economy. We have decided to support Mr Zardari, said Zahid Khan, spokesperson for the Awami National Party which leads the government in the NWFP.        
	As the politicians bicker, militant violence has surged, adding to a sense of urgency for the fractious coalition government to end infighting and turn its attention to security and pressing economic problems.        
	The violence and political uncertainty, on top of weak economic data, have undermined investor confidence and sent the countrys financial markets on a downward spiral.        
	Pakistans stocks and currency strengthened when Musharraf stepped down but then weakened as the political squabbling dragged on.        
	Pakistans stock market, which rose for six consecutive years to 2007 and was one of the best-performing markets in Asia in that period, has fallen about 29 per cent this year.        
	On the security front, Islamabad is under pressure from allies to control violent militants viewed as sheltering Afghan insurgents and threatening Pakistans own stability.        
	In the latest confrontation, Pakistani troops and helicopter gunships targeted Islamist militant hideouts in the Swat Valley today, the military said, after fierce fighting killed 50 militants and 10 soldiers in the previous 24 hours.

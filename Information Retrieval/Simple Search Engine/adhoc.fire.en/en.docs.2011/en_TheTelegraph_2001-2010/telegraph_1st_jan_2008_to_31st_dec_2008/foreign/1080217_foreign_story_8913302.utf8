The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pollution link to lower IQ
                                                                                                               Pollution link to lower IQ
                              DIRTY AIR SCARE                            
	New York, Feb. 16 (Reuters): Kids who live in neighbourhoods with heavy traffic pollution have lower IQs and score worse on other tests of intelligence and memory than children who breathe cleaner air, a new study shows.        
	The effect of pollution on intelligence was similar to that seen in children whose mothers smoked 10 cigarettes a day while pregnant, or in kids who have been exposed to lead, Dr Shakira Franco Suglia of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, the studys lead author, said.        
	While the effect of pollution on cardiovascular and respiratory health has been studied extensively, less is known about how breathing dirty air might affect the brain, Suglia and her team write in the American Journal of Epidemiology. To investigate, she and her colleagues looked at 202 Boston children 8 to 11 years old who were participating in a study of maternal smoking. The researchers related several measures of cognitive function to the childrens estimated exposure to black carbon, a component of the particulate matter emitted in automobile and truck exhaust, particularly by diesel vehicles.        
	The more heavily exposed children were to black carbon, the lower were their scores on several intelligence tests. When the researchers adjusted for the effects of parents education, language spoken at home, birth weight and exposure to tobacco smoke, the association remained.         
	For example, heavy exposure to black carbon was linked to a 3.4-point drop in IQ, on average.

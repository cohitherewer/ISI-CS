	Islamabad, Oct. 2 (Reuters): The UN has ordered children of its international staff to leave Pakistan after raising its security level following a suicide attack on the Marriott Hotel in the capital, a UN official said today.        
	The security alert came as a suicide bomber killed himself and three other people in northwest Pakistan in an attack aimed at a prominent ethnic Pashtun politician, police said.        
	The politician, Asfandyar Wali Khan, leader of the Awami National Party (ANP) which is part of the ruling coalition government, was not hurt in the attack in the northwestern town of Charsadda, police said.        
	The blast, the latest in a wave of bomb attacks by Islamist militants, came as the UN said it was raising its security level in Pakistan and children of international staff would have to leave the country. Phase three has been approved by the secretary general, said UN information officer Ishrat Rizvi, referring to a security level under which dependents of UN staff have to leave.        
	The UN remained commited to Pakistan and the new security level would have no impact on its operations, she said. Its a matter of only evacuating the children of international staff members which doesnt make any difference to the work of the UN, she said.        
	A suicide truck bomber attacked the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad on September 20 killing 55 people, among them six foreigners including the Czech ambassador and three Americans. Aid groups and some embassies and foreign companies are expected to follow the UN move and ask dependents of their international staff to leave.        
	The Pakistani government had issued assurances about efforts to protect foreigners after the Marriott attack but unease over the security situation has grown. Britain is withdrawing the children of its diplomats from Pakistan, the foreign office said.

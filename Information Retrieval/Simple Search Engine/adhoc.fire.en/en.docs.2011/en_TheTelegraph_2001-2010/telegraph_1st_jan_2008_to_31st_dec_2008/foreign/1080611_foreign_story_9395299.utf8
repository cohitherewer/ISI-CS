	Madrid, June 10 (Reuters): Spanish drivers and shoppers stockpiled fuel and food today, fearing shortages after lorry drivers blocked deliveries across the country for a second day of an indefinite protest at the high price of fuel.        
	Cars queued at petrol stations  40 per cent of which had run out of fuel in the worst affected area of Catalonia  and supplies of fresh food began to run low in some markets, Spanish media reported.        
	Police motorbike riders escorted fuel tankers to some petrol stations to break picket lines and prevent attacks, after some strikers slashed lorry tyres yesterday.        
	I heard all the petrol stations were running out of fuel so I came to fill up, otherwise I worried I wont be able to get to work tomorrow, said a Madrid driver. Oil company Cepsa said 45 per cent of its deliveries had failed to get through to stations.

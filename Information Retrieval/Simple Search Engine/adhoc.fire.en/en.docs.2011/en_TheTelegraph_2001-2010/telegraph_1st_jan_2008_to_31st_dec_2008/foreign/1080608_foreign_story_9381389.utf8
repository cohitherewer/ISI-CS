The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China quake lake fears rise
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       China quake lake fears rise

	Majingxiang (China), June 7 (Reuters): Chinese troops today eased pressure on a swelling quake lake threatening hundreds of thousands of people, but a smaller lake burst its banks in a show of destructive force.        
	The May 12 earthquake centred in the southwestern province of Sichuan, which killed more than 69,000 people, also triggered landslides that blocked rivers and created over 30 such lakes, raising fears of lethal floods if the new dams suddenly burst.        
	Hundreds of troops were mobilised to dig a channel to release water from the Tangjiashan quake lake, the largest.        
	Early today some of the pent-up water began to flow out, and officials sounded relieved. We dont see any danger to downstream at present, Hu Peng, an official in the command centre overseeing the lake relief effort, told Reuters. Were paying very close attention, but for now the flow doesnt indicate any threat.        
	But at Majingxiang, downstream from Tangjiashan, a quake lake burst yesterday, spraying out a torrent of rock and gravel in a 500-metre-long tongue that blocked the road to the area.        
	A construction worker said he and others scrambled for their lives uphill when the lake they were trying to relieve burst through the barrier formed by a landslide caused by the quake.        
	We were releasing water through a man-made channel about two metres wide, but then it suddenly gave way and there was this roaring sound and we ran up the side of the hill, said Chen Youfu, smoking a cigarette as he looked down on the debris.         
	Corpses were exposed in the rock and gravel left by the surge, as well as four earth-moving vehicles tossed like toys upside down or onto their sides.        
	Chen and other workers and medical staff at Majingxiang said the three bodies uncovered were of people killed in the quake, not victims of yesterdays collapse. Police rescued several villagers who were caught in the surge downstream, the ministry of public security reported.

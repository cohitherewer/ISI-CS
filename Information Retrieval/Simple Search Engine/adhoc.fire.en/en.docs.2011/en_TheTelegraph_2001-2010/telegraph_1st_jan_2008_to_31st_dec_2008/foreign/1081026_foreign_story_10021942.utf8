                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Palin wigs big hit in New York
                            
	New York, Oct. 25 (Reuters): Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palins hair, with its straight bangs, beehive top and cascading locks, is proving popular among Halloween partygoers and some Orthodox Jewish women.        
	As Americans gear up for Halloween and Election Day soon after, New Yorkers are snapping up Palin-style wigs and glasses regardless of their political leanings, costume shop owners say.        
	And in an Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood in Brooklyn, the look has become popular among some Orthodox Jewish women, who buy wigs to cover their hair for religious reasons. Made of human hair, the Palin-style wigs cost $695 or more. In Brooklyns Borough Park, stylist Gail Rosenzweig said half of her Orthodox Jewish clients want Palins style.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US ships nuke fuses to Taiwan by mistake
                                                                                                               US ships nuke fuses to Taiwan by mistake
                              Pentagon: Super glitch                            
	Beijing, March 26 (Reuters): China expressed concern and dissatisfaction with the US today after the Pentagon said it mistakenly shipped four fuses for nuclear missiles to Taiwan in 2006.        
	Beijing had urged the US to thoroughly investigate and report the details promptly to China so as to eliminate the negative effect and severe consequences, foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang was quoted on a ministry website as saying.        
	We express our serious concern and strong dissatisfaction with this and have made solemn representations to the American side, he said.        
	Beijing believes self-ruled Taiwan, which held a presidential election on Saturday, is part of China and has declined to renounce the use of force as a means to reunite the island with the mainland.        
	The US military was supposed to ship helicopter batteries to Taiwan, but instead sent fuses used as part of the trigger mechanism on Minuteman missiles, the Pentagon said yesterday. Taiwan returned the parts to the US last week. No nuclear material was shipped to Taiwan, Pentagon officials said.        
	Taiwans defence ministry confirmed the parts had already been returned, and that they were seeking damages.        
	Taiwan-US military cooperation has always been close, and this was a case of mistaken shipment, it said. It will not affect continuing future bilateral relations. The problem went unnoticed until Taiwan realised it did not have the helicopter batteries it ordered and reported the issue to the US, officials said.

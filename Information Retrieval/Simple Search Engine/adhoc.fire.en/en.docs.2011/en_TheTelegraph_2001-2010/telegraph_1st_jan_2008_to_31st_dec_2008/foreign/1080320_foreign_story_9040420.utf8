	London, March 19 (PTI): Oscar-winning Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow is quitting movies to become a full-time mother to three-year-old Apple and one-year-old Moses.         
	Im not doing another film until next fall (autumn). Everything is about family, Im putting movies on a backburner. London is my home for now and this is where we are concentrating our time, Paltrow, who lives in north London with husband Chris Martin, told British tabloid Daily Mirror.        
	Paltrow, born to actress Blythe Danner and late Bruce Paltrow, a film and television director, in Los Angeles rose to fame in 1996 for starring in Emma, a film in which she received positive acclaim, particularly in Europe and Asia for her impressive English accent. She had also starred in Shakespeare in Love.

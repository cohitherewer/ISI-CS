 - THEY WERE VERY MUCH IN LOVE
     AMIT ROY
              Princess Diana and her butler Paul Burrell 
                   
	London, Jan. 14: Further evidence of Princess Dianas obsession with the Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Khan emerged today when her butler Paul Burrell gave evidence at the high court in London to an inquest into her death in a Paris tunnel in 1997.
    
	Burell, who claims the princess considered him her rock, said Diana had not given him the impression that Dodi Fayed, who died in the car crash with her, was the one.
    
	This contradicts assertions by Dodis father, Mohammed Al Fayed, the wealthy owner of the Harrods department store, that Prince Philip had MI6 assassinate Diana in order to prevent the mother of the future king of England (Prince William) from marrying a Muslim.
    
	According to Burrell, Diana had the hots for another Muslim  Hasnat Khan.
    
	In evidence today, Burrell said he had consulted a Catholic priest at her bidding to see if she and Hasnat could have a private marriage, that she was planning to install him in her own quarters inside Kensington Palace and also that she had introduced him to her sons, William and Harry, so that they should warm to him as a prospective step father before their mothers marriage to Hasnat.
    
	Hasnat, though, did not want the marriage part of it though he was more than willing to share her bed.
    
	In interviews yesterday, Hasnat paid warm tribute to Dianas work, revealed his own marriage to a Pakistani wife had ended but refused to discuss the intimate side of his relationship with the princess. The British press and publishers would pay him 5 million or even more if only he would get down to the nitty gritty.
    
	 Burrell, who has minted millions by building himself up into an authority in the UK and the US on Diana, had no such inhibitions today as he enjoyed his leading role in the biggest show currently being staged in London.
    
	As he was the butler charged with smuggling Hasnat into miladys chamber, he certainly relished holding the courts attention.
    
	Of Hasnat, he spoke in terms that would not be out of place in a Mills amp; Boon novel: Well, the Princess said that this was her soulmate, this was the man she loved more then any other and it was a very deep spiritual relationship. I witnessed it at first hand and they were very much in love.
    
	Asked by Ian Burnett QC, representing the inquest, whether Diana had contemplated marriage with Hasnat, the former butler replied: Yes, she did. 
    
	 Burrell agreed with Burnett that Diana was laying the groundwork with her children in bringing the surgeon to meet them.
    
	Burrell said: It was known in the family, in fact William and Harry were (familiar) with Dr Khan and met him on regular occasions in Kensington Palace. He was a regular fixture and fitting in the Palace. The princes were the most important things in her life, she wouldnt do nothing without consulting (them), she was adamant William and Harry would be friendly and know and grow to like Khan before a marriage took place.
    
	He also revealed: She asked me if it was possible to arrange a private marriage between her and Hasnat Khan.
    
	Burrell approached his local Catholic priest to ask about arranging a private wedding between a Christian and a Muslim. He spoke to Father Anthony Parsons, a Carmelite priest from a Catholic church near Kensington Palace that both the butler and Diana had attended.
    
	 No names were mentioned in the discussion but he knew exactly who I was talking about, he didnt know the mans name. Burrell described the night early in 1997 when Hasnat dumped the princess. 
    
	 The princess came home that night very distressed, he recalled. He (Hasnat) didnt want to become a public name. He didnt want to become known and they had reached a stalemate situation.
    
	 Later, Burrell had a heart to heart with the cardiac surgeon: He explained to me one day he worked very hard and had come from nothing to achieve what he had (and had now) become an eminent heart surgeon. He was achieving what he always dreamed of and wasnt prepared to put that on hold for the Princess.
    
	 However, the more he said no, the more the princess wanted him.
    
	Burrell added: I dont think that a relationship that lasted for 18 months was gone overnight. The princess was still holding a candle for Dr Khan.

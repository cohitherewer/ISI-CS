                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       US drone raid kills 9 in Pak
                              A pilotless drone aircraft                            
	Islamabad, Oct. 3 (Reuters): A US missile strike in a Pakistani tribal region known as a haven for Taliban and al Qaida fighters killed at least nine people today, Pakistani intelligence officials said.        
	A television report put the toll as high as 21.        
	Intelligence officials said a pilotless drone aircraft launched the attack at around 1530GMT in the village of Mohammad Khel, 30km west of Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan.        
	One missile hit the house of Daud Jan, said one of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.        
	Pakistani military spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas said he had no information. One intelligence official said nine people were killed, including foreigners. Taliban sources in the area later told Reuters eight were killed and seven wounded. Dawn News reported 21 were killed, including 16 foreigners.        
	Frustrated by an intensifying Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, US forces have in the past month carried out eight missile strikes by pilotless drones and a commando raid on the Pakistani side of the border.        
	The US strikes into Pakistan, in particular a September 3 raid by ground troops, have angered Pakistan, straining ties between the allies and leading to tension along the border which Pakistani forces have vowed to defend.         
	Earlier today, Pakistani intelligence officials reported another US airstrike on the North Waziristan village of Datta Khel, closer to the Afghan border. Abbas contradicted that account, saying the airstrike was carried out by the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force on a target across the border in Afghanistan.

	Tom film shelved    
	London, May 12: The fortunes of Hollywood actor Tom Cruise have suffered a blow with the news that his next big film has been postponed until 2009, reports The Times.      
	The release of Valkyrie, which tells the story of the 1944 assassination plot against Hitler, was first postponed from this summer to the autumn and is now not expected to appear until next year.       
	We were originally expecting the film to be released in June, said a senior executive at one of Britains leading cinema chains. I know there have been all sorts of problems with this production and we will not be screening it at all this year.       
	The film is not only a blow to Cruise as an actor but in his more recent incarnation as a movie mogul at United Artists, the studio which made the film.       
	One critic in Hollywood has declared Valkyrie is dead.    
	Sex plea

The four actresses  Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, Kim Cattrall and Kristin Davis  will give a speech before the curtain goes up asking the 1,700-strong audience not to disclose the plot.

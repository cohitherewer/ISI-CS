	Food sex appeal    
	 New York, June 9 (AP): Is there anything sexier than food?      
	Its probably no surprise that for Kim Cattrall its the people who make it. Known for her vixen character, Samantha, in Sex and the City, Cattrall put sex talk on the menu while hosting yesterdays James Beard Foundation awards, often called the Oscars of the food world.      
	Cattrall opened the ceremony talking about her own love of cooking, then asked co-host and celebrity chef Bobby Flay what has more sex appeal than food. A breath later, she offered her own answer.      
	Maybe whats sexier is the chefs who are always cooking up something new and exciting, she cooed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Israeli spy sentenced in Iran
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Israeli spy sentenced in Iran
                              Ali Ashtari                            
	Tehran, June 30 (Reuters): An Iranian court today sentenced to death an Iranian businessman on charges of being an Israeli spy who targeted the Islamic Republics disputed nuclear programme and its military, media said.        
	The Tehran court handed down its sentence at a time of high tension with Israel and speculation of a possible Israeli attack on Irans nuclear installations.        
	Iranian media identified Ali Ashtari as the manager of a company selling communications and security equipment to Irans government and said he had been accused of engaging in espionage for (Israels) Mossad intelligence service.        
	The 43-year-old Ashtari had confessed and asked for clemency after a two-day trial, the semi-official Fars News Agency said.        
	Ashtari, who had been in financial trouble, said he had accepted a loan of $50,000 from Israeli agents, Fars said.        
	His name indicated he was a Shia but Iranian media did not specify his religion.        
	In Jerusalem, an Israeli government official said: We have no knowledge whatsoever regarding this case.        
	Tension between the Islamic Republic and Israel has risen sharply since a US newspaper report this month said the Jewish state had rehearsed a possible strike against Iran aimed at thwarting its disputed nuclear ambitions.        
	Iran says its nuclear programme is peaceful and aimed at generating electricity. But the West and Israel fear Iran is seeking to build atomic bombs. Israel is believed to be the only West Asian state with nuclear arms.        
	The report has prompted tough statements of military prepardeness from Iranian commanders.        
	Our response to any aggression will be crushing, fiery and powerful and the armed forces are at a level of utmost readiness in defence of the country, Mohammad Hejazi, a senior commander of the elite Revolutionary Guards, told a military event, Fars reported.        
	Iran, which does not recognise Israel, has previously reported breaking up spy networks and accused the US and Zionists of trying to destabilise the country.        
	In 2000, 10 Jews from the city of Shiraz were convicted of spying in a closed door trial that sparked international outrage. The last five detained were released in 2003. Fars quoted Ashtari as telling the court that three Israeli agents had presented themselves to him as foreign bank representatives looking for a commercial partnership.        
	Meetings with the agents, two of whom were called Jack and Tony, took place in Thailand and Turkey and they provided him with a laptop computer for coded communication as well as satellite phones, the news agency said. Television showed images of the equipment allegedly used.        
	ISNA quoted a senior, unnamed Iranian counter-intelligence official as saying Ashtari had had business contacts with the Iranian government agency in charge of the nuclear programme as well assome defence and military centres while working for Mossad.         
	With Mossads help, Ashtari at times supplied defective and contaminated equipment ... (and) in some instances the application of these parts led to the defeat of the project with irreversible damage, the official said, without elaborating.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | McCain frees himself from his edgy past
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       McCain frees himself from his edgy past

	Peterborough (New Hampshire), Nov. 3: Somewhere in a corner of northeastern Ohio, just five days before the presidential election that more than a few pundits have declared he will lose, Senator John McCain sat in the back of his campaign bus telling his favourite jokes.         
	No one laughed harder than he did.        
	For 90 minutes, as his bus rumbled from the edge of Lake Erie to Youngstown, McCain kept up the patter with Senator Lindsay Graham and his campaigns high command. He talked about how he once saw an old borscht belt comedian perform in New Jersey. He told stories about Morris K. Udall, the legendary Arizona congressman. And he roared with Graham about a book he was reading, A Walk in the Woods, a comic account of an out-of-shape writers 2,100-mile hike of the Appalachian Trail.        
	No one is suggesting that McCain is ecstatic that he is behind in the polls or that the cognoscenti, as he puts it, have written us off.         
	But in the frantic last days of his nearly two-year second quest for the presidency, McCain has liberated himself from the irritable, edgy candidate of a month ago. He has, by all appearances, decided he will get to Tuesday by having a good time.        
	His aides say he is relieved that the race is almost over and for the most part out of his hands. He is also buoyed  and obsessed, his staff says  with polls that show the race tightening in some battleground states and allow him hope that he might still have a shot.         
	He is also now in the role that he finds at least familiar, if not comfortable  the scruffy underdog barking at Washington. It was not for nothing that his first stop Thursday was in Defiance, Ohio.        
	If we were 10 points up, wed all be a little bit happier, said Mark Salter, one of McCains closest aides. But you throw a lot of stuff at the guy, and he fights all the harder.        
	Graham and McCains other travelling buddy, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, are a frequent part of the road show and will fly home with him to Arizona in the small hours of tomorrow morning. Aides say they are essential to improving the candidates mood, Graham in particular.         
	 McCain has also been moved these last few days, his aides say, by the panorama of America that has unfolded before him. On Friday, McCain marvelled to aides about the beauty of the rolling Appalachian foothills on Ohios border with West Virginia.         
	Whatever happens tomorrow, McCains aides say he is too much a student of history not to be astonished by his own place in it.

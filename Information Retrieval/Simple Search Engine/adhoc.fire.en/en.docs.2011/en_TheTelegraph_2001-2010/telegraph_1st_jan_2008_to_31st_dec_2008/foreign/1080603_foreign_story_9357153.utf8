	Jacksonville (Florida), June 2 (AP): Bo Diddley, a founding father of rock n roll whose distinctive shave and a haircut, two bits rhythm and innovative guitar effects inspired legions of other musicians, died today after months of ill health. He was 79.        
	Diddley died of heart failure at his home in Archer, Florida, spokeswoman Susan Clary said. He had suffered a heart attack in August, three months after suffering a stroke while touring in Iowa.        
	Doctors said the stroke affected his ability to speak, and he hadreturned to Florida to continue rehabilitation.        
	The legendary singer and performer, known for his homemade square guitar, dark glasses and black hat, was an inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, had a star on Hollywoods Walk of Fame, and received a lifetime achievement award in 1999 at the Grammy Awards.

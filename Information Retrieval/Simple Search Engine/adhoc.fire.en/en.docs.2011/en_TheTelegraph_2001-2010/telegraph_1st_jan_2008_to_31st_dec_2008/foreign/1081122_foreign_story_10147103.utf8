	Baby looks    
	 London (Reuters): Children pushed in buggies which face away from their parents may suffer long-term emotional and language problems, according to a study published on Friday. The research, believed to be the first of its kind, found that children who were not facing the person that pushed them were less likely to talk, laugh and interact with their parents compared with those babies that did.

	Moss in gold    
	 London, Oct. 2: She has graced the covers of glossy magazines and been the subject of British street artist Banksys pop-art, but now Kate Moss has been immortalised in 18-carat gold, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	A 50kg gold statue of the supermodel, worth 1.5 million, was unveiled this morning in the British Museum as part of the Statuephilia exhibition.       
	The work, called Siren, was created by sculptor Marc Quinn.       
	The statue of Moss, described as an Aphrodite of our times, now stands in the British Museums Nereid Gallery.       
	The sculpture, which is hollow, weighs about as much as the supermodel herself according to the artist.

	London, July 10: iPods, mobile phones and laptops could be examined by airport customs officials for illegal downloads under strict new counterfeiting measures being considered by G8 governments this week, it is claimed.         
	The measures form part of an international agreement aimed at stamping out piracy, but there are fears that individuals who have illegally downloaded songs or video clips on to MP3 players and phones for personal use could also be caught out.         
	They coincide with plans by the European Parliament for Internet Service Providers to be held liable if their users download illegal content, and in extreme cases, forced to disconnect people who are doing so. Illegal downloading and piracy represents the biggest single problem faced by the music, film and publishing industries.         
	Earlier this month, Virgin Media resorting to writing to customers warning them that their Internet services would be terminated if they persisted in file sharing. So far, little has been revealed about the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement being considered by the G8 nations, apart from a mention in the organisations Declaration on the World Economy published this week.        
	Backing the development of the new agreement, it said: Effective promotion and protection of Intellectual Property Rights are critical to the development of creative products, technologies and economies.         
	A leak to a technology website revealed that the focus of Acta was border measures, particularly how to deal with large-scale intellectual property infringements, which can frequently involve criminal elements.

	Brussels, Dec. 6 (Reuters): Buy one, get one free: its a familiar sales pitch for happy-hour cocktails or last seasons fashions, but now a Belgian car dealer is luring customers with just that line.        
	Antwerp-based Cardoen, which sells about 10,000 new and nearly new cars per year, started the promotion at the end of November and said it would run until December 15.        
	During that period, customers can choose from a range of new, full-price cars  the cheapest being a 22,800 euro ($28,930) Hyundai van  and then pick a second free vehicle from a selection that goes up to 14,000 euros.         
	People have been coming in from all over Belgium and abroad, Cardoens commercial director Ivo Willems said.

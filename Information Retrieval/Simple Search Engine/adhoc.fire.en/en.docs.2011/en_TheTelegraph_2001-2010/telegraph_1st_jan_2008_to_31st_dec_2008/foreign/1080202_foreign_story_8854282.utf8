	Baghdad, Feb. 1 (Reuters): A female suicide bomber killed 45 people at a packed pet market in Baghdad today, police said, in the deadliest attack in the Iraqi capital in six months.
    
	Police said 80 people were wounded at the Ghazil pet market in the centre of the city. 
    
	A separate bombing shortly after killed 20 people and wounded scores at a bird market in southern Baghdad, police said.
    
	At the Ghazil market, one of Baghdads most popular gathering places which has been bombed at least three times in the past year, people stared at the destruction as workers swept up body parts and blood-stained boxes.

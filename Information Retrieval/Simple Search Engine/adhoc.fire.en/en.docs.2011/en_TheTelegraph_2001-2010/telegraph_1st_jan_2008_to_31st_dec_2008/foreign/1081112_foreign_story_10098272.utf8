                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Harvard to cut spending
                            
	Boston, Nov. 11 (Reuters): Harvard University is looking for ways to reduce spending, its president said yesterday, raising the prospect of cuts to programmes and compensation at the worlds richest university during the financial crisis.        
	We must recognise that Harvard is not invulnerable to the seismic financial shocks in the larger world, Drew Faust wrote in an email to faculty, staff, students and alumni. Our own economic landscape has been significantly altered. Faust said Harvard must be prepared for losses in its big endowment that funds a third of the universitys annual operating budget.

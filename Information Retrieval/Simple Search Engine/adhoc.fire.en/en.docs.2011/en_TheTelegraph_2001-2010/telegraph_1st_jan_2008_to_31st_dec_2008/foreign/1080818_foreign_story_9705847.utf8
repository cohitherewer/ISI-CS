	Tbilisi, Aug. 17: Ukraine inflamed mounting East-West tensions yesterday by offering up a Soviet-built satellite facility as part of the European missile defence system.         
	The proposal, made amid growing outrage among Russias neighbours over its military campaign in Georgia, could see Ukraine added to Moscows nuclear hitlist. A Russian general declared Poland a target for its arsenal after Warsaw signed a deal with Washington to host interceptor missiles for Americas anti-nuclear shield.        
	The move came as the Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev, signed a cease-fire deal that sets the stage for a Russian troop withdrawal after more than a week of warfare with its neighbour Georgia.         
	Ukraine said it was ready to give both Europe and America access to its missile warning systems after Russia earlier annulled a 1992 cooperation agreement involving two satellite tracking stations.         
	Previously, the stations were part of Russias early-warning system for missiles coming from Europe.        
	The fact that Ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with European countries to integrate its information, a statement from the Ukrainian foreign ministry said.        
	It follows a declaration from Ukraines pro-western President, Viktor Yushchenko, that the Russian naval lease of the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Sebastopol would be scrapped if any vessels joined the conflict in Georgia.        
	The crisis over Russias display of military might in Georgia has alarmed ex-Soviet satellites states in a broad arc from the Baltics to Central Asia. Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, all of which harbour bitter memories of Soviet occupation, have expressed solidarity with the Georgian position.        
	Yesterday, President George W. Bush hailed what he saw as progress in resolving the Georgia crisis, describing the ceasefire agreement as a hopeful step.        
	He reiterated, though, that the disputed regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia remained part of Georgia, despite Moscows insistence that they should now be allowed to become part of Russia. Theres no room for debate on this matter, said Bush. The international community is clear that South Ossetia and Abkhazia are part of Georgia and the US fully recognises this reality.        
	Disturbing reports of abuse of ethnic Georgians in captured parts of the disputed region have emerged. A group of captive soldiers were paraded in the streets of the South Ossetian capital, Tskinvali, and the bodies of at least 40 troops rotted in the sun.

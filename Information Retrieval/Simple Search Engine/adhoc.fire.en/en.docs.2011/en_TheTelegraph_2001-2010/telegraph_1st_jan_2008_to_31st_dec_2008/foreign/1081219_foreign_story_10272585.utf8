                              Lohan: Price of fame                            
	Phoenix, Dec. 18 (Reuters): A fan of Lindsay Lohan was arrested early yesterday after pushing past a nightclub security guard and trying to grab the actress, police said.        
	Phoenix resident Daniel Patrick Combs, 38, lunged at Lohan and her friend, British DJ Samantha Ronson, outside Jackrabbit Lounge in Scottsdale, Arizona, police said.        
	Combs was detained for a time and later released after being booked on a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge. Lohan, 22, and Ronson, 30, told officers that they did not know Combs. The actress shot to fame in Disneys 1998 remake of The Parent Trap.

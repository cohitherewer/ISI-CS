	Madonna tracks    
	 London, Sept. 11: Former punk rocker Toyah Wilcox has accused Madonna of being ashamed of singing her classic Eighties tracks.       
	Speaking as she prepared to return to the stage for a live show singing rock classics, she said of live artists: People want to hear their hits and not their arty songs.       
	She added: When I went to see Madonna at Wembley she did an hour of B sides and you could hear the audience groan. She concluded: I just dont think people should be ashamed of the hits that mean so much to so many people.       
	The Queen of Pop does appear to have taken some of Wilcoxs advice already, singing Like A Virgin to an audience in Rome. Madonna, 50, controversially dedicated the performance to Pope Benedict XVI.

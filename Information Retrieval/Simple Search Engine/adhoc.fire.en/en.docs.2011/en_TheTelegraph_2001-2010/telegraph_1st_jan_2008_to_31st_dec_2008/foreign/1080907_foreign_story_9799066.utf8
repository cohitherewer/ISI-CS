	Dog full of balls    
	 London, Sept. 6: A rattling dog had to have 13 golf balls removed from his stomach after swallowing them during walks on his owners local course, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Chris Morrison noticed an unusual sound from the stomach of his black labrador, Oscar, who he regularly walks on a golf course near his home in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland.       
	 he took the five-year-old to a vet, he was stunned to find 13 balls, each weighing around 45g and around 4cm in diameter, were lodged in the dogs stomach. Morrison, a planning administrator, said one of the balls had been in her stomach so long that it had turned black and was decomposing.       
	He said: He finds golf balls like truffles. Were not sure how long exactly this happened over  but it must have been a fair period, several months at least.

	London, July 18 (Reuters): British folk singer Yusuf Islam, formerly Cat Stevens, today accepted libel damages and an apology from a news agency which reported he refused to talk to women at an awards ceremony who were not wearing a veil.        
	The artist, who changed his name after becoming a Muslim in the late 1970s, will donate the substantial payout to Small Kindness, a UN-linked charity which he chairs.

	Glued to toilet    
	 London, Nov. 2: A man had to be taken to hospital stuck to a public toilet yesterday after a prankster covered the seat with glue, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The stainless steel lavatory was removed from the cubicle in Brierley Hill, near Dudley, with the man still attached, after the best efforts of emergency services failed to free him. The 35-year-old was taken to hospital where a doctor used special chemicals to free him unhurt while still inside an ambulance. He appeared to be none the worse for his ordeal other than being understandably somewhat embarrassed, an ambulance service spokesperson said.     
	Not in soup    
	 Berlin (Reuters) A soup kitchen exclusively for dogs has opened its doors in Berlin providing pets of the homeless and unemployed with a free meal, the director of the establishment said recently. Despite the looming financial crisis, director Claudia Hollm dismissed criticism that it may be more sensible to collect money for humans than for dogs. The opening of the soup kitchen follows last months launch of a new bus service in Berlin for dogs, which shuttles their furry friends to a luxury dog day-care centre.    
	Gay ire    
	 Madrid (Reuters): The queen of Spain drew criticism recently after she was quoted as condemning gay marriage, gay pride marches and abortion in an upcoming biography. If these people want to live together, dress as grooms and get married, they might have the right to do so or not, depending on the laws of their countries. But they shouldnt call it marriage, because it isnt, Queen Sofia was quoted as saying. The royal palace said the Greek-born queen had been misquoted. The supposed comments which, anyway, were made in a private sphere, do not exactly match the opinions expressed by Her Majesty The Queen, it said in a statement. Spain legalised gay marriage in 2005.    
	Liquor rap    
	 Sydney (Reuters): Authorities in Sydney will no longer issue 24-hour liquor licenses in an effort to stem a wave of alcohol-related violence on the citys streets. Fifty pubs and clubs will be forced to lock-out patrons and serve drinks in plastic glasses. Sydney has seen a spate of glassings in recent weeks, where drinkers, male and female, have been smashed in the face with a beer glass, and street brawls which have left police injured.

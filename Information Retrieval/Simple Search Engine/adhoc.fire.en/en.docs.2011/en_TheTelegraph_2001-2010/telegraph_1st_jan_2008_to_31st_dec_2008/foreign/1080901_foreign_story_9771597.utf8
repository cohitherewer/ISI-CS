	Fat king? Not on    
	 London, Aug. 31: The makers of BBC show The Tudors have said Henry VIII will not gain weight so that he retains his sex appeal, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	The shows bosses have said Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who plays Henry in the costume drama will not be required to put on a fat suit to reflect the kings expanding waistline. Henry, who died in 1547, was thought to have grown to more than 20st, with a waist of 54in, famously needing a hoist to life him on to his horse towards the end of his life.     
	Dog order    
	 Lima (Reuters): Dog lovers beware. A neighbourhood in Perus capital, Lima, has passed a law prohibiting families living in apartments from having more than one dog. People living in houses are allowed two dogs, while those found with more will be subject to hefty fines. According to an order published in the countrys official gazette recently, residents of Jesus Maria, a middle-class area in Lima, have said there are just too many dogs  and too much barking. Neighbours have complained they cannot live in peace, harmony, or good physical and mental health because... noisy dogs disturb the peace, the order read.     
	Ash forever    
	 Chur (Switzerland) (Reuters): Diamonds really are forever. Algordanza, a small company based in the mountainous south-east of Switzerland, uses the ashes of dead people to make diamonds as a permanent memento for their nearest and dearest. And with prices starting at less than $7,488, the jewels are not solely the preserve of the jetset. The technology for making artificial diamonds was first pioneered by General Electric in the 1950s, and mirrors nature by subjecting carbon to huge pressure and temperature.    
	Jaywalk rap    
	 Shanghai (Reuters): - Shanghai police will post photos and videos of jaywalkers in newspapers and on TV in a bid to shame them out of breaking traffic rules. Offending pedestrians, moped riders and cyclists would be snapped at selected intersections and their images put in regular columns and on special television programmes set up by the police, the Shanghai Daily said. The scheme had come under fire from lawyers who said public humiliation was too steep a punishment for jaywalking. Jaywalking is a way of life in major Chinese cities, where crossing roads legally can be a hair-raising battle of nerves with oncoming cars disinclined to give way to pedestrians.

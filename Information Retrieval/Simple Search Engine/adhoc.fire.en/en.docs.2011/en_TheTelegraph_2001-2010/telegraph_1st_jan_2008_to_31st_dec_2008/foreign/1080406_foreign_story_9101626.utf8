	Harare, April 5: The leader of Zimbabwes main Opposition party has warned that the countrys President Robert Mugabe is preparing for a war against the people.        
	Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change party, told reporters that the MDC was reluctant to take part in a second round of presidential elections because of the fear of violence. However, he stopped short of threatening a boycott.         
	Zanu-PF is preparing a war against the people, Tsvangirai said. In the runoff, violence will be the weapon. It is, therefore, unfair and unreasonable for President Mugabe to call a runoff.        
	Earlier the MDC appealed for the UN to step in to prevent violence ahead of a possible presidential run-off campaign.         
	However, South African president Thabo Mbeki urged the international community to wait for the results of any election re-run.         
	Nelson Chamisa, a spokesman for the Opposition Movement for Democratic Change, warned that there were signs that incumbent Mugabe, 84, was ready to begin a crackdown amid fears that he will use force in his efforts to retain power. They are trying to intimidate people, they are trying to set up the context for unleashing violence, Chamisa told reporters.        
	Armed police prevented the partys lawyers from entering the countrys high court to submit a legal challenge to release the full results of last weeks election. Feared veterans of the guerrilla war used in the past to beat up opponents have held an intimidating march, while opposition party offices were raided and armed police arrested foreign journalists.

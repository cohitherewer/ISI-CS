The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Golden toilet flush with cash
                                                                                                               Golden toilet flush with cash
                            
	Hong Kong, March 6 (AFP): Hong Kongs famed solid gold toilet is, well, a fixture on the citys tourist itinerary. But with gold prices touching record highs, part of the site could soon be headed down the pan.        
	 Hang Fung Jewellers said it will melt down one ton of the gold in its 24-carat lavatory if the price hits $1,000 an ounce, and use the money to help expand its stores on the Chinese mainland.        
	The company, which draws Chinese tourists by the busload to its unique hall of gold, promises that the one-of-a-kind attraction wont be de-throned  but while the toilet stays, a ton of ornaments around it will come to an end.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Anwar held in sodomy case
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Anwar held in sodomy case

	Kuala Lumpur, July 16 (Reuters): Malaysian Opposition figure Anwar Ibrahim has been arrested for sodomy, his lawyer said today, setting the stage for a political showdown that could further rattle the countrys financial markets.        
	The former deputy premier had agreed to meet police today in connection with a sodomy complaint lodged by a former aide, and police had warned they would arrest him if he did not show up for questioning. Anwars lawyers had said he would go to the police at 0600 GMT, but the arrest came about an hour before that.        
	They say he was arrested under Section 377 of the Penal Code (sodomy), Sankara Nair, Anwars lawyer, said.         
	Nair said police could detain Anwar for up to 24 hours, after which they would have to obtain a remand order from the court to allow further detention for up to 14 days without charging him.        
	Anwar, who is leading a charge by the Opposition to seize power by September, is fighting the sodomy accusation, in a replay of scenes from a decade ago when he was jailed for sodomy and corruption.        
	The authorities sealed off roads to the police headquarters where Anwar had been brought, while a water cannon was on standby and a helicopter circled overhead, as the authorities braced for a possible repeat of 1998 protests when Anwars arrest brought tens of thousands onto the streets.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chelsys wedding date with queen

	London, May 17: Chelsy Davy, Prince Harrys girlfriend, will be introduced to the Queen for the first time at the wedding of Peter Phillips to Autumn Kelly.         
	The presence of Davy, who has known Harry for four years, at the wedding is a further public sign of the seriousness with which the relationship is now regarded by the royal family.        
	Davy, 22, attended her first official function with the Prince of Wales earlier this month when Harry was presented with his first service medal.        
	She will be joined at the wedding by Kate Middleton, the girlfriend of Prince William, but the prince will not be there to see his cousin walk down the aisle with Kelly at St Georges Chapel in Windsor. He is in Kenya for the wedding of Batian, the brother of Jecca Craig, his former girlfriend. He made the commitment to attend long before Phillips, the Queens eldest grandchild and the first to get married, set a date.        
	Middletons stand-in role indicates the status that she now enjoys within royal circles and will fuel speculation of an engagement announcement.        
	Clarence House declined to comment on the diary clash. But royal sources insisted that Prince Williams decision to miss the most significant wedding in the House of Windsor since that of the Earl of Wessex in 1999 was not being seen as a snub to the rest of his family.        
	Prince William is going to be out of the country this weekend on a long-standing prior engagement, the source said. It is an unfortunate clash but he spoke to his cousin Peter and he is fine with the situation. His girlfriend will be going in his absence.        
	William will be guest of honour at the wedding of Craigs brother. He regards the Craigs as a second family and has taken Middleton to meet them.        
	Most of the senior royals, including the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, will be among the 300 guests at the marriage of Kelly and Phillips. The service will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, David Conner.        
	Phillips and his Canadian bride-to-be met in 2003 at the Montreal Grand Prix, where the couple, both 30, were working.        
	But he did not tell Kelly that he was the Queens eldest grandson and 11th in line to the throne. She learnt the truth only after she spotted him in a television programme about William.        
	The Daily Telegraph disclosed this month that Kelly, a former Roman Catholic, had been accepted into the Church of England. If she had not changed churches, Phillips would have had to give up his right to become king.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Jail bird     
	 London: A Bosnian pigeon is in custody for smuggling drugs into one of the countrys highest security jails, reports The Daily Telegraph. Prison guards grew suspicious when they saw four prisoners visibly intoxicated shortly after the pigeon landed on a prison window, said Josip Pojavnik, the deputy warden of Zenica prison. The bird was a pet of one of the inmates. When he and three other prisoners tested positive for heroin, disciplinary proceedings were launched. It is thought that the drugs were stuffed into tiny bags and attached to the pigeons legs. We suspect that the pigeon carried the drugs from Tuzla, a town town around 70km northeast of Zenica in central Bosnia, added Pojavnik.

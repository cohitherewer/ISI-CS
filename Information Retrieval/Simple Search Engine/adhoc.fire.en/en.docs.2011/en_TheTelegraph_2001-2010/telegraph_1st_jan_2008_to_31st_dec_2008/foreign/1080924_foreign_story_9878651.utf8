                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bush: US wants to help Pak protect itself
                              Asif Ali Zardari with George Bush at the UN. (AP)                             
	New York, Sept. 23 (Reuters): President George W. Bush today said the US wanted to help Pakistan protect itself amid questions about American military strikes aimed at al Qaida and Taliban militants in its remote border region.        
	Bush sat down for his first face-to-face meeting with newly-elected Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari to discuss security and economic issues before they attended the UN General Assembly.        
	There have been numerous questions about US strikes in the remote region along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan as well as an alleged commando raid, sparking anger among many Pakistanis about violations of their countrys sovereignty.        
	Your words have been very strong about Pakistans sovereign right and sovereign duty to protect your country, and the US wants to help, Bush said before the meeting.         
	Bush also expressed to Zardari his condolences for the victims of the truck bombing at the Marriott hotel in Islamabad that killed at least 53 people and raised new fears about worsening security in Pakistan. Zardari acknowledged generally that his country had problems but said it would confront them. We have a situation, we have issues, weve got problems, Zardari told reporters.         
	His remarks came as the Pakistani military said earlier today that troops backed by artillery and helicopter gunships killed 60 militants in Darra Adam Kheil, a tribal region close to Peshawar.         
	US defence secretary Robert Gates said today that the greatest threat of terrorism against the US comes from the remote tribal region of western Pakistan. If you asked me today, after the success weve had against the al Qaida in Iraq, where the greatest threat to the homeland lies, I would tell you its in western Pakistan, Gates said.

	London, July 2: If you struggled to get up for work on Wednesdays, there could be a good reason  it is the day our mood reaches its lowest point.         
	Monday has traditionally been thought of as the most depressing day of the week but according to psychologists, midweek gives more cause for concern in reality.         
	Wednesday represented the lowest point in the week as people were furthest away from the weekend that has either just gone or is coming up and often feel bogged down with work. The psychologists also found that although we look forward to it, the weekend does not actually improve our mood.         
	To start their research, the University of Sydney scientists asked around 200 people what they thought their mood would be on each day of the week. Most said their worst moods were on Monday mornings and evenings but they became increasingly cheerful as the week wore on, with their best moods falling on Friday and Saturday mornings and evenings.         
	When asked why they believed that Friday and Saturday were best, respondents said they saw them as less-structured days when they could choose how to spend their time. The psychologists then asked a further 350 people how they felt each day, on the day. They found that, on average, peoples moods remained about the same on each day throughout the week.

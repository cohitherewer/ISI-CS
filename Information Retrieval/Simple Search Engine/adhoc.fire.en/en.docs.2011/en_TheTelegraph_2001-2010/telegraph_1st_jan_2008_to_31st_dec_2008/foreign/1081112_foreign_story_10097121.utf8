The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pakistanis mired in brutal battle to oust Taliban
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pakistanis mired in brutal battle to oust Taliban

	Loe Sam (Pakistan), Nov. 11: When Pakistans army retook this strategic stronghold from the Taliban last month, it discovered how deeply Islamic militants had encroached on  and literally dug into  Pakistani territory.        
	Behind mud-walled family compounds in the Bajaur area, a vital corridor to Afghanistan through Pakistans tribal belt, Taliban insurgents created a network of tunnels to store arms and move about undetected.         
	Some tunnels stretched for more than half a mile and were equipped with ventilation systems so that fighters could withstand a long siege. In some places, it took barrages of 500-pound bombs to break the tunnels apart.        
	These were not for ordinary battle, said Gen. Tariq Khan, the commander of the Pakistan Frontier Corps, who led the armys campaign against the Taliban in the area.        
	After three months of sometimes fierce fighting, the Pakistani Army controls a small slice of Bajaur. But what was initially portrayed as a paramilitary action to restore order in the area has become the most sustained military campaign by the Pakistani Army against the Taliban and its backers in al Qaida since Pakistan allied itself with the US in 2001.        
	President-elect Barack Obama has pledged to make the conflicts in Afghanistan and Pakistan a top priority. The Bajaur campaign serves as a cautionary tale of the formidable challenge that even a full-scale military effort faces in flushing the Taliban and al Qaida from rugged northern Pakistan.         
	Pakistani officials describe the area as the keystone of an arc of militancy that stretches across the semiautonomous tribal region of Pakistan and into Afghanistan.         
	Under heavy pressure from the US, Pakistani officials are vowing to dislodge the Taliban fighters and their Qaida allies who have taken refuge in the tribal areas.         
	But a two-day visit to Loe Sam and Khar, the capital of Bajaur, arranged for foreign journalists by the Pakistani military, suggested that Pakistan had underestimated a battle-hardened opponent fighting tenaciously to protect its mountainous stronghold.         
	Taliban militants remain entrenched in many areas. Even along the road to Loe Sam, which the army labouriously cleared, sniper fire from militants continues.        
	The Pakistanis have also resorted to scorched-earth tactics to push the Taliban out, an approach that risks pushing more of their own citizens into the Talibans embrace.        
	After the Frontier Corps failed to dislodge the Taliban from Loe Sam in early August, the army sent in 2,400 troops in early September to take on a Taliban force that has drawn militants from across the tribal region.        
	Like all Pakistani soldiers, the troops sent here had been trained and indoctrinated to fight in conventional warfare against India, considered the nations permanent enemy, but had barely been trained in counter-insurgency strategy and tactics.        
	To save Loe Sam, the army has destroyed it. The shops and homes of the 7,000 people who lived here are a heap of gray rubble, blown to bits by the army.

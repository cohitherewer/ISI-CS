	London, March 22: Lawyers for the Beatles have filed a lawsuit in the US in a bid to block the release of early recordings purportedly made during Ringo Starrs first performance with the group.         
	The dispute between Apple Corps, which represents the Beatles, and Miami company Fuego Entertainment involves eight never-released tracks recorded in 1962 at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany.         
	Lawyers for the Beatles allege the songs, which include Paul McCartney performing Hank Williamss Lovesick Blues and McCartney and John Lennon singing Ask Me Why, were taped without permission. This appears to us to be a garden-variety bootleg recording, said Paul LiCalsi, a New York-based attorney for Apple Corps said. But Fuego Entertainment insists the recordings were legally made.         
	Dont claim that these were just bootlegged, Hugo Cancio, the companys president, said. Its not like today that you just go in with a phone or a BlackBerry and you record.

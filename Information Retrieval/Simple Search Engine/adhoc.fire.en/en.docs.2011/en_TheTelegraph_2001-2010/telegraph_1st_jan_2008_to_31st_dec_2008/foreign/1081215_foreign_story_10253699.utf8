	Unfazed Aniston     
	 Los Angeles, Dec. 14 (PTI): Jennifer Aniston, who recently stripped for GQ magazine, said she was not nervous to pose in nothing but a neck tie.       
	Oddly enough I dont know why but no, the actress told E!News when asked whether she was nervous for her naked photo shoot.       
	Aniston, who will be turning 40 recently, shared a few tidbits about John Mayer, in an interview to GQ and dismissed rumours that she was pregnant with his baby. She also spoke about her new film Pumas, which she said is a sort of female wedding crashers.

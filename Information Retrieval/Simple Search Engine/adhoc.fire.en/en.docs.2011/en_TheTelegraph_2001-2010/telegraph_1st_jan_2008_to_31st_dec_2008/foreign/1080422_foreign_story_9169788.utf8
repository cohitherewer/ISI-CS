	Islamabad, April 21 (PTI): Cricket hero turned politician Imran Khans wife Jemima has decided to back reformed radical Muslims by becoming the patron of an organisation that plans to challenge Islamist groups.        
	Reformed radicals will launch an organisation this week called the Quilliam Foundation in Britain to fight extremism. The challenge (to Islamism) can only legitimately come from within the Islamic community if it is to have any impact, Jemima told The Sunday Times newspaper.        
	The foundation is now intent on promoting the view that mainstream Islam does not condone violence or jihad.         
	Ed Husain, a former member of Hizbut-Tahrir, is one of the founders.         
	Husain, the author of The Islamist, said: For the first time in western Muslim history, a Muslim group is challenging extremists using a scriptural and theological paradigm.

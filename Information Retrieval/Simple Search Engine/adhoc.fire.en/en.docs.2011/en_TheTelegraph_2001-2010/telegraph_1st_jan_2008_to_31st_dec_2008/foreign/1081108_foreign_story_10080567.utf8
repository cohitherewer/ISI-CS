          WIL HAYGOOD                          Kitchen Story                                  
	Washington, Nov. 7: For more than three decades Eugene Allen worked in the White House, a black man unknown to the headlines. During some of those years, harsh segregation laws lay upon the land.         
	He trekked home every night, his wife, Helene, keeping him out of her kitchen. At the White House, he worked closer to the dirty dishes than to the large desk in the Oval Office. Helene didnt care; she just beamed with pride.        
	President Truman called him Gene. President Ford liked to talk golf with him. He saw eight presidential administrations come and go. I never missed a day of work, Allen says.        
	His is a story from the back pages of history. A figure in the tiniest of print. The man in the kitchen.        
	When he started at the White House in 1952, he couldnt even use the public restrooms when he ventured back to his native Virginia. We had never had anything, Allen, 89, recalls of black America at the time. I was always hoping things would get better.         
	In its long history, the White House  just note the name  has had a complex and vexing relationship with black Americans. In the kitchen, the folks have always been black.        
	Before he landed his job at the White House, Gene worked as a waiter at a resort and then at a country club in Washington.         
	He and wife Helene, 86, are sitting in the living room of their home off Georgia Avenue in northwest Washington D.C. A cane rests across her lap. Her voice is musical. She calls him honey.         
	They met in Washington at a birthday party in 1942. He was too shy to ask for her number, so she tracked his down. They married a year later. In 1952, a lady told him of a job opening in the White House.         
	Gene was offered a job as a pantry man. He washed dishes, stocked cabinets and shined silverware. He started at $2,400 a year. There was, in time, a promotion to butler.        
	Shook the hand of all the Presidents I ever worked for, he says.         
	I was there, honey, Helene reminds. In the back, maybe. But I shook their hands, too.        
	They have one son, Charles. He works as an investigator with the state department. President Fords birthday and my birthday were on the same day, he says. Hed have a birthday party at the White House. Everybody would be there. And Mrs Ford would say, Its Genes birthday, too!        
	He was in the White House kitchen the day JFK was slain. He got a personal invitation to the funeral. But he volunteered for other duty: Somebody had to be at the White House to serve everyone after they came from the funeral.         
	First Lady Nancy Reagan came looking for him in the kitchen one day. She wanted to remind him about the upcoming dinner for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He told her he had already picked out the china. But she told him he would not be working that night.         
	She said, You and Helene are coming to the state dinner as guests of President Reagan and myself. Im telling you! I believe Im the only butler to get invited to a state dinner.        
	Husbands and wives dont sit together at these events, and Helene was nervous about trying to make small talk with world leaders. And my son said, Mama, just talk about your high school. They wont know the difference.         
	The senators were all talking about the colleges and universities that they went to. I was doing as much talking as they were. Had champagne that night, Helene adds, looking over at her husband. Gene just grins: he was the man who stacked the champagne at the White House.        
	He was promoted to maitre d in 1980. He left the White House in 1986, after 34 years.        
	Last week, Gene and Helene speculated about what it would mean if a black man were actually elected President. Just imagine, she said. Itd be really something, he said. Were pretty much past the going-out stage, she said. But you never know. If he gets in there, itd sure be nice to go over there again.        
	They talked about praying for Barack Obama. Theyd go vote together. Shed lean on her cane with one hand, and on him with the other, while walking down to the precinct. And shed get supper going afterwards.         
	Theyd gone over their election day plans more than once. Imagine, she said. Thats right, he said.        
	On Monday, Helene had a doctors appointment. Gene woke and nudged her once, then again. He shuffled around to her side of the bed. He nudged Helene again.        
	He was all alone. I woke up and my wife didnt, he said later.         
	Friends and family members rushed over. He wanted to make coffee. They had to shoo the butler out of the kitchen.        
	The lady whom he married 65 years ago was buried on Friday. The butler cast his vote for Obama on Tuesday.        
	He so missed telling his Helene about the black man bound for the Oval Office.

	Shenzhen, Sept. 21 (Reuters): A fire at an illegal dance club in southern China left 43 mostly young people dead and another 88 injured.        
	The fire broke out just before midnight at the packed King of the Dancers club, sparked by a pyrotechniques display on the third floor, said Xinhua news agency.        
	The owner of the club, located in a blue collar area about an hours taxi ride from downtown Shenzhen, was being questioned by the police, while 12 people had been detained, said Xinhua.        
	The main hall quickly filled with deadly smoke after the Roman candle-type display touched ceiling tiles, and the lights went off soon after, plunging panicking revellers into darkness, said witnesses.

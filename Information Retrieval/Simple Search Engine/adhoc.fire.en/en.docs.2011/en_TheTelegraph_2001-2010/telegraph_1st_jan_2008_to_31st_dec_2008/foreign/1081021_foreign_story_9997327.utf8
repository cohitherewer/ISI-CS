	Colombo, Oct. 20 (AP): Troops seized a strategic village from separatist Tamil Tiger rebels following a two-month battle, cutting off a key supply route and moving the government a step closer to capturing the militants de facto capital in northern Sri Lanka, the military said today.        
	Government troops have made dramatic progress on the northern fronts in the past months, seizing a series of rebel bases and chunks of land. However, the rebels have offered stiff resistance as government troops close in on Kilinochchi.        
	The battle for Vannerikulam village, about 25km west of the rebel capital, was especially difficult because the rebels had erected a 10-km-long dirt mound from which they had a clear view of the surrounding territory, the military said. Soldiers cleared the mound, the military said, but would not give more details.        
	Lakshman Hulugalla, the official in charge of the governments security information centre, said by seizing Vannerikulam the troops had cut off a key rebel supply route.

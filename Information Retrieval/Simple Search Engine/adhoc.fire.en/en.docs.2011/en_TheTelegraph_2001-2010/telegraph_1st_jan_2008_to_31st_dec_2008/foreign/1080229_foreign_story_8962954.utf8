	Islamabad, Feb. 28 (AP): President Pervez Musharrafs allies rejected demands today for his ouster  but some called for clipping his powers to ensure democracy can flourish in a nation thats been ruled more often by generals than civilians.        
	The divisions in the pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid-e-Azam (PML-Q) party reflected the precarious position of the former army strongman  just as his opponents are getting ready to form a government after their victory in the February 18 elections.        
	Pervez Elahi, a close confidant of Musharraf and a senior PML-Q member, insisted today that Musharraf would not quit. There is no such proposal. Neither is he considering it, Elahi told reporters. He has been elected President for five years. He will remain President for five years.        
	A coalition planned by the victorious Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is expected to try to abolish Article 58(2)b of the Constitution, under which Musharraf gave himself the power to dissolve national and state Assemblies.        
	One of Musharrafs supporters, PML-Q secretary-general Mushahid Hussain, said he would support any move aimed at revoking the controversial article to ensure the supremacy of parliament. The ground realities have changed. We want to institutionalise democracy, Hussain told The Associated Press. Pakistans experience with 58(2)b has been very unfortunate, he said,referring to the four times it was used by military Presidents to sack elected civilian governments. We have to learn from the mistakes of the past, he said.

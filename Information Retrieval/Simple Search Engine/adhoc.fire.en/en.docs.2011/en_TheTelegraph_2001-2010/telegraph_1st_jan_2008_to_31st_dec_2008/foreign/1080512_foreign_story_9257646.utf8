                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Chinese held for torch-grab plan
                            
	Beijing, May 11 (AP): A Chinese has been arrested for saying on the Internet that he planned to grab the Olympic torch during its relay through eastern China, police said today.        
	The 28-year-old man, identified only as Tang, was detained in Zhenjiang in Jiangsu province in eastern China for spreading rumours online and disturbing public order, said an official with the local public security bureau who would give only his surname, Zhang.        
	Tang wrote in an Internet chat room that he wanted to organise a group to grab the torch when it arrives in Nanjing, near Zhenjiang, on May 24, the state media and the police said.        
	Tang was detained on May 7 and will be held for 10 days, Zhang said.        
	The official Xinhua news agency said Tang works for a telecommunications company in Zhenjiang, and that he wrote a message in a chat room saying he was wanted by the police for preparing to go to Nanjing to grab the Olympic torch.        
	That drew the attention of the local police in Zhenjiang who began an investigation, Xinhua said. It quoted the police as saying that while the rapid development of the Internet in China has allowed for more freedom of expression, this had to be within the law.        
	 The government says the number of Internet users in China has soared to 221 million, making it one of the worlds biggest online users.        
	 Protests marred some international segments of the Olympic torch relay before the flame returned to China at the beginning of May, receiving a boisterous reception.        
	The police have been deployed in large numbers for the relay through southern China due to the enthusiasm of local spectators, according to Around the Rings, a website that monitors the event.        
	In Guangzhou, security officers had to extinguish the torch and alter its route because of the crush of supporters, the website said.        
	The torch is to cross every region and province of China, returning to Beijing on August 6, two days ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony.

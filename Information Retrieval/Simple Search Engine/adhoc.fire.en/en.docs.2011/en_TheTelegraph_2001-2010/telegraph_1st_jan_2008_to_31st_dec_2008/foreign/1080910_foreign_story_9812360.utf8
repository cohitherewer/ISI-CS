The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Palin stays home, gets travel allowance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Palin stays home, gets travel allowance
          JAMES V. GRIMALDI AND KARL VICK                          Palin: Charging the state                                  
	Anchorage (Alaska), Sept. 9: Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has billed taxpayers for 312 nights spent in her own home during her first 19 months in office, charging a per diem allowance intended to cover meals and incidental expenses while travelling on state business.        
	The governor also has charged the state for travel expenses to take her children on official out-of-town missions. And her husband, Todd, has billed the state for expenses and a daily allowance for trips he makes on official business for his wife.        
	Palin, who earns $125,000 a year, claimed and received $16,951 as her allowance, which officials say was permitted because her official duty station is Juneau, according to an analysis of her travel documents by The Washington Post. Juneau is Alaskas capital while Anchorage is the largest city        
	The governors daughters and husband charged the state $43,490 to travel, and many of the trips were between their house in Wasilla and Juneau, 967km away.        
	Gubernatorial spokeswoman Sharon Leighow said yesterday that Palins expenses are not unusual and that, under state policy, the first family could have claimed per diem (literally per day) expenses for each child taken on official business but has not done so.        
	Before she became the Republican Partys vice-presidential nominee, Palin was little known outside Alaska. Now, with the campaign emphasising her executive experience, her record as mayor of Wasilla, as a state oil-and-gas commissioner and as governor is receiving intense scrutiny.        
	During her speech at the Republican National Convention last week, Palin cast herself as a crusader for fiscal rectitude as Alaskas governor. She noted that she sold a state-owned plane used by the former governor. While I was at it, I got rid of a few things in the governors office that I didnt believe our citizens should have to pay for, she said.        
	As a matter of protocol, the governor and the first family are expected to attend community events across the state, Leighow said. Its absolutely reasonable that the first family participates in community events. The state finance director, Kim Garnero, said Alaska law exempts the governors office from elaborate travel regulations.         
	The popular governor collected the per diem allowance from April 22, four days after the birth of her fifth child, until June 3, when she flew to Juneau for two days. Palin moved her family to the capital during the legislative session last year, but prefers to stay in Wasilla.        
	Palin rarely sought reimbursement for meals while staying in Anchorage or Wasilla, the reports show.        
	She wrote some form of Lodging  own residence or Lodging  Wasilla residence more than 30 times at the same time she took a per diem, according to the reports. In two dozen undated amendments to the reports, the governor deleted the reference to staying in her home but still charged the per diem.        
	Palin charged the state a per diem for working on November 22, 2007  Thanksgiving Day. The reason given, according to the report, was the Great Alaska Shootout, an annual college basketball tournament held in Anchorage.         
	In separate filings, the state was billed about $25,000 for Palins daughters expenses and $19,000 for her husbands.        
	Flights topped the list for the most expensive items, and the daughter whose bill was the highest was Piper, 7, whose flights cost nearly $11,000, while Willow, 14, claimed about $6,000 and Bristol, 17, accounted for about $3,400.

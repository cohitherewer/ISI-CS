	London, Nov. 3: Female accountants have been sent on a course to learn how to dress appropriately for the office.         
	Around 400 women from Ernst amp; Young took part in the sessions, during which they were warned against wearing strong perfume, low-cut tops or carrying evening bags to daytime business meetings.        
	Fleur Bothwick, head of diversity at the firm, said that while men could simply opt for a uniform of dark suit and tie, officewear was more fraught for women.        
	You dont want to be remembered as the woman with red lips, or leave people wondering: How does she walk on those heels?, she told the magazine Personnel Today.         
	The voluntary sessions, organised by House of Colour image consultants, also advised women to think of your colour palette  wear colours that bring out the best in your skin tone and hair colour.

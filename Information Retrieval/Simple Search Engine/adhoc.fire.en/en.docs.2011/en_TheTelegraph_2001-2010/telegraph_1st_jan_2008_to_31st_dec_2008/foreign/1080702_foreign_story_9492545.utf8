	London, July 1 (Reuters): A film enthusiast has discovered a long lost interview with Beatles from 1964 which has not been broadcast since.        
	Richard Jeffs came across 64 canisters of film stored in a damp garage in south London, and when he started to go through them he stumbled across a of piece of pop history.        
	 The conversation with Scottish television dates from April 30, 1964, according to the BBC, which played excerpts from the nine-and-a-half minute interview on the radio today.        
	It came shortly after the Fab Fours trip to the US during which they were besieged by fans and watched by a television audience estimated to be about half the countrys population when they played The Ed Sullivan Show.        
	During the interview, Paul McCartney and John Lennon discussed how they came up with their tunes, and Jeffs said it shed light on the songwriting process within arguably the biggest band ever.        
	When asked how they collaborated, Lennon replied: Well, you know, it depends. Sometimes we write them on old pianos, anything thats lying around.        
	McCartney added: Normally we sit down and try and bash one out. But then again, theres no formula, becase he (Lennon) can come up with one one day completely finished. We still say we both wrote it, though.        
	The two also recalled where they first met. I was playing at a garden fete in the ... village where I lived just outside Liverpool, playing with a group, and he came along and we met, said Lennon.        
	Jeffs said the canisters were probably discarded after the tele-recording machine they were made on was replaced by a video machine.        
	The Beatles recording was on the second can of film that he viewed, he told BBC Radio.

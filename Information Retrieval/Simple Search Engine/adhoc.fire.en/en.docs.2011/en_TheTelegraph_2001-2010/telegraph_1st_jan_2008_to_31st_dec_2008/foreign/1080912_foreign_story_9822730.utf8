The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Covert Bush order for raids in Pakistan
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Covert Bush order for raids in Pakistan

	Washington, Sept. 11: President Bush secretly approved orders in July that for the first time allow American Special Operations forces to carry out ground assaults inside Pakistan without the prior approval of the Pakistani government, according to senior American officials.        
	The classified orders signal a watershed for the Bush administration after nearly seven years of trying to work with Pakistan to combat the Taliban and al Qaida, and after months of high-level stalemate about how to challenge the militants increasingly secure base in Pakistans tribal areas.         
	American officials say that they will notify Pakistan when they conduct limited ground attacks like the Special Operations raid last Wednesday in a Pakistani village near the Afghanistan border, but that they will not ask for its permission.        
	The situation in the tribal areas is not tolerable, said a senior American official who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the missions. We have to be more assertive. Orders have been issued. The new orders reflect concern about safe havens for al Qaida and the Taliban inside Pakistan, as well as an American view that Pakistan lacks the will and ability to combat militants.         
	They also illustrate lingering distrust of the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies and a belief that some American operations had been compromised once Pakistanis were advised of the details. The CIA has for several years fired missiles at militants inside Pakistan from remotely piloted Predator aircraft. But the new orders for the militarys Special Operations forces relax firm restrictions on conducting raids on the soil of an important ally without its permission.        
	Pakistans army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani said yesterday that his forces would not tolerate American incursions like the one that took place last week and that the army would defend the countrys sovereignty at all costs.         
	It is unclear precisely what legal authorities the US has invoked to conduct even limited ground raids in a friendly country. A second senior American official said that the Pakistani government had privately assented to the general concept of limited ground assaults by Special Operations forces against significant militant targets, but that it did not approve each mission. The official did not say which members of the government gave their approval.         
	Any new ground operations in Pakistan raises the prospect of American forces being killed or captured in the restive tribal areas  and a propaganda coup for the al Qaida. Last weeks raid also presents a major test for Pakistans new President, Asif Ali Zardari, who supports more aggressive action by his army against the militants but cannot risk being viewed as an American lap dog, as was his predecessor, Pervez Musharraf.         
	The new orders were issued after months of debate inside the Bush administration about whether to authorise a ground campaign inside Pakistan. The debate, first reported by The New York Times in late June, at times pitted some officials at the state department against parts of the Pentagon that advocated aggressive action against Qaida and Taliban targets.        
	Details about last weeks commando operation have emerged that indicate the mission was more intrusive than had previously been known.        
	According to two American officials briefed on the raid, it involved more than two dozen members of the Navy Seals who killed about two dozen suspected Qaida fighters.         
	It now appears to have been a planned attack against militants who had been conducting attacks against an American forward operating base across the border in Afghanistan.        
	Supported by an AC-130 gunship, the Special Operations forces were whisked away by helicopters after completing the mission.

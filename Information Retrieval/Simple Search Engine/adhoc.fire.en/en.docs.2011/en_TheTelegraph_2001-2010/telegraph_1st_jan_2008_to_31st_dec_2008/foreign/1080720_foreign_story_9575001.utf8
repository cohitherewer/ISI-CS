	Kathmandu, July 19 (PTI): Nepals Constituent Assembly today failed to elect the countrys first President after the three main parties joined hands to sideline the Maoists.        
	 However, the Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum (MPRF) leader, Parmanand Jha, was elected the countrys first Vice-President after he secured 312 votes in the 594-member House. It was a partial victory for the Nepali Congress of Premier Girija Prasad Koirala and the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist (CPN-UML), the second and third largest parties after the Maoists.        
	Todays vote saw a vertical split in the House with the Nepali Congress candidate Ram Baran Yadav getting 294 votes, just four short of the magic figure of 298. Only 578 members caste their votes while 16 remained absent.        
	 Maoist candidate for the Presidents post Ramraja Prasad Singh, 74, of Nava Janawadi Morcha was close behind with 282 votes, the state-run Nepal Television reported today.        
	Singh was on course to win the election after the Madhesi parties with 86 votes had promised to back him.        
	However, this morning the Nepali Congress (110), CPN-UML (103) and the MPRF formed an alliance for the President and Vice-Presidents posts.        
	Todays election, which was a straight contest between Singh and Yadav after the CPN-UMLs Ram Prit Paswan withdrew his nomination, was expected to end the deadlock between the parties since the April 10 general elections and pave the way for a government led by Maoist chief Prachanda to take charge.However, with the three parties joining hands, analysts are not ruling out the possibility of the parties forming a government without the Maoists.        
	The Assembly is yet to decide on the date of the re-poll for electing the President who will take over most of the ceremonial duties performed earlier by ousted king Gyanendra.         
	Elite force        
	A 1000-strong elite force drafted from the Nepali Army will protect the countrys first President. He will travel in a bullet-proof car previously used by Gyanendra.        
	Home minister Krishan Sitoula said the government had set up the force under the command of a brigadier general for the security of the President.        
	The Nepal governments secretary level special class staff will head the presidential office, he said.

	London, June 15: A space probe sent to search for signs of water on Mars has found unusually sticky soil on the Red Planet which scientists believe may hold the first ice to be collected from an alien world.         
	The Phoenix Mars Lander, which touched down just over three weeks ago, has also sent back the clearest pictures to date of the rust coloured arctic landscape of the Red Planet.         
	Boulders and troughs can be seen across the undulating ground, while distant hills can be viewed on the hazy horizon.         
	The images have revealed mysterious polygon shapes stretching into the distance, which scientists believe could have been caused by seasonal expansion and contraction of ice beneath the surface.         
	Nasa also revealed that the lander has uncovered a bright layer around two inches beneath the surface of the soil, that could either be ice or salt, deposited on what may formerly have been the surface. If analysis proves that the substance is ice, it will be the first time that water has been conclusively shown to exist on the planet  raising the prospect that evidence of life will also be found.         
	Phoenix has been using an 8ft robotic arm to excavate two trenches down through the Martian soil and is expected to dig up to three feet down as part of its 150 day mission.         
	A scoop at the end of the arm last week attempted to deliver the first samples of soil into the analysing equipment carried on board the spacecraft, but scientists found the stickiness of the soil made it difficult to shake the sample off the scoop.         
	Although it is not clear what is causing the soil to clump together, scientists have speculated that ice or minerals in the soil could cause it to behave this way.         
	Theres something very unusual about this soil, from a place on Mars weve never been before, said Peter Smith, Phoenix principal investigator of the mission from the University of Arizona.         
	Were interested in learning what sort of chemical and mineral activity has caused the particles to clump and stick together.         
	Understanding the soil is a major goal of this mission and the soil is a bit different than we expected. There could be real discoveries to come as we analyse this soil with our various instruments.         
	The soil is now being baked in an oven-like instrument before tests are carried out to discover its composition.         
	Dust samples from the planet surface were also placed into a microscope on board the lander, giving experts the first highly magnified look at the soil particles and offering a snapshot of millions of years of history on the planet.         
	Images from the microscope revealed more than 1,000 separate soil particles smaller than one tenth the diameter of a human hair and at least four types of minerals have already been identified.         
	Tom Pike, a mission scientist from Imperial College London, said they had found green particles which seemed to be a mineral normally associated with volcanic eruptions called olivine.         
	He said they also found black glassy specks of what appeared to be volcanic glass that had been weathered down over millions of years.

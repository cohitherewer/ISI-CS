	Los Angeles, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Elizabeth Taylor is hospitalised but doing well, a spokesman for the Oscar-winning screen legend said yesterday, contradicting tabloid newspapers reports that she was in poor health.        
	Taylor is fine. The rumours which began in England about her health are dramatic, overstated and untrue. Her hospital visit was precautionary. She will be returning home shortly, her Los Angeles-based spokesman Dick Guttman said. At present, she is surrounded by family, friends and fabulous jewels, the statement concluded. A report on the website for the National Enquirer said Taylor, 76, was put on a life-support machine.

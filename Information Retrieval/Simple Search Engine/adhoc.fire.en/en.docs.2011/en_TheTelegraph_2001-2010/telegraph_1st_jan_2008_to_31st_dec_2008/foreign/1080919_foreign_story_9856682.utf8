	London, Sept. 18: Oxford University cannot take many more working class students because only a limited number meet the academic standards required, its admissions director has said.         
	Mike Nicholson warned there was a finite pool of deprived sixth-formers with straight As to fill the universitys undergraduate places. He said the university was committed to increasing the potential pool of candidates, but insisted it received more applications from private schools in key subject areas such as languages and science.        
	Nicholson was speaking as a study criticised elite universities for failing to recruit enough students from poor homes.         
	The Higher Education Policy Institute said Britains top institutions were spending millions in grants for the most deprived students  but numbers were failing to increase.         
	In a controversial move, it said universities should be forced to put money for bursaries into a single fund  allowing it to be diverted to those colleges with the most poor students.         
	But the recommendation was condemned as a tax on top-ranked universities.         
	Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University, said: A national bursary scheme would effectively be a tax, a forced pooling of tuition fee income, which would be distributed away from the institution to which a student pays his or her fee. It would seriously compromise the direct relationship between a students fees and their education.        
	Speaking as he began a tour of party conferences to discuss the issue of widening access, Nicholson said: There are a lot of things we can do but there are also limitations. We are fairly clear that there is at the moment a finite pool that we can draw upon.         
	We are doing a good job of getting the message out but even if 12,000 students apply with three As, we only have places for 3,000 of them. Our mission is to try to find the best students.        
	Since 2006, universities have been able to charge up to 3,000-a-year in tuition fees, although a share of the extra money must be spent on bursaries to subsidise working-class students. In 2006/7, 100 million was spent across the UK, representing a fifth of the additional income.         
	At Britains 38 top institutions some 31 million was spent. HEPI said the proportion of students from the lowest social classes remained the same  21 per cent  compared to 2005/6. It is far from evident that expenditure on bursaries is an effective way of increasing the socio-economic diversity of these universities, researchers said.

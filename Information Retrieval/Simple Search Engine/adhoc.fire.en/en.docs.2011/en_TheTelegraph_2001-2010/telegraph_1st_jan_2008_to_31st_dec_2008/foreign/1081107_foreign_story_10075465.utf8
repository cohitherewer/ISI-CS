	Washington, Nov. 6: Now that Barack Obama has been elected President, he can start fulfilling his many campaign promises  including the one to his two daughters that when the election was over, regardless of the outcome, they would be cuddling up to a new dog.        
	As the whole world heard on Tuesday night during his victory speech in Grant Park, Chicago, Obama declared that his girls had earned the new puppy thats coming with us to the White House. But as with most campaign promises, fulfilling this one may not be as simple as it sounds.        
	What kind of dog? Purebred or mutt? From a shelter or breeder? Puppy or adult? Get it now, or after the family settles in at the White House?        
	The world, as evidenced by chatter and pictures flying around on the Internet today, has become captivated by the idea of a new First Puppy.        
	By now, the Obamas should know that everything they do, including picking a family pet, will be interpreted through a political prism. Obama and his wife, Michelle, have been talking about a dog for a while.        
	He had said a year ago, while campaigning in Iowa, that his older daughter, Malia, now 10, had been investigating breeds and decided that because of her allergies, she wanted a goldendoodle, which is a cross between a golden retriever and poodle. He said his daughter thought the goldendoodle the optimal dog.        
	This prompted lobbying by dog lovers and animal groups against a purebred. The People for Ethical Treatment of Animals wrote to the Obamas saying that a purebred would be elitist. The Best Friends Animal Society gathered more than 50,000 signatures to persuade them to adopt a dog instead of going to a breeder.        
	On September 30, during an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the Obamas gave a few more details. Were going to adopt a dog, I think, said Michelle Obama. Obama then put in: A rescue dog.        
	The news sped around the dog portion of the blogosphere. Many readers were thrilled, seeing this as a sign that the Obamas were taking a populist approach. Many also assumed that the Obamas were getting a dog from a shelter, although they did not exactly say that. One commentator on the Digg Dialogg blog, for example, wrote that the Obamas planned to adopt a rescue dog, instead of purchasing a puppy from a pet store or breeder.                     
	This kind of choice is fraught with political implications. When the Clintons were in the White House, Hillary Rodham Clinton, then First Lady, squelched a suggestion that they acquire a golden retriever, saying it would send the wrong message.        
	She said that with all the dogs orphaned and in shelters, theyd be criticised if they got a dog with a pedigree, Dick Morris, a former pollster for the President, told The New York Times in 1997. They ended up with a chocolate Labrador, whom President Clinton named Buddy.        
	With Obamas announcement last night about a puppy, tongues are wagging again about their intentions. The idea of a puppy doesnt necessarily comport with that of adopting a rescue dog from a shelter. Ideally, if you buy a pure-bred puppy, you go to a responsible breeder, said Lisa Peterson, a spokeswoman for the American Kennel Club.         
	The kennel club held an online poll over the summer, during which more than 42,000 people voted for the Obamas to pick  a poodle! Despite their image as a bit prissy, they also are perceived as smart and good family pets.                             NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

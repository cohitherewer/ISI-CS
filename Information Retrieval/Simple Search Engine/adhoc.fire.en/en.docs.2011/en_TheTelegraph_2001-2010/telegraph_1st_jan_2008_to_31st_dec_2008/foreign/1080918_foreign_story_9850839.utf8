	Buddy indeed    
	 New York, Sept. 17: It was a call the emergency operator never expected to receive. Instead of tears, screams or a plea for help, she could hear only barking and a distinctly canine whimper, reports The Times.       
	Anywhere else and the emergency services might have hung up. But the specially-trained German shepherd dog Buddy had already saved his master three times by making emergency calls to police with his teeth.       
	Police in Scottsdale, Arizona, released a recording yesterday of the latest call by 18-month-old Buddy when his owner suffered a seizure. Hello, this is 911. Hello... Can you hear me? Is there somebody there you can give the phone to? the emergency worker asks. Buddy responds by barking, but the operator stays on the line because any call from his owner, Joe Stalnaker, brings up an alert on the emergency computer system to say that a trained assistance dog may call when his master is incapacitated.

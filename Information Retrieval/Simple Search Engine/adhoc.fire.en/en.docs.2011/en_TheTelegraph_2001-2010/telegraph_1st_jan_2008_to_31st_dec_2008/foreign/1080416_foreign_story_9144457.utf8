                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       William took Harry to party by helicopter
          AISLINN SIMPSON                               
	London, April 15: Prince William raised eyebrows when he used an RAF Chinook helicopter to ferry him and his little brother to a stag party.         
	The prince took off in the helicopter after receiving his wings  denoting his qualification as an RAF pilot  from his father during a ceremony at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire at Friday lunchtime.        
	He flew the aircraft to pick up Prince Harry from Woolwich Barracks in southeast London before flying on to the Isle of Wight and landing at Bembridge Airport at 4pm.         
	The helicopters co-pilot then took the aircraft back to base. The trip saved the princes a six-hour journey by rush-hour clogged roads. Chinooks, which cost around 35 million each and are in short supply in Afghanistan, can fly at speeds of 140 Knots . But Prince Williams RAF commanders defended the move, saying the sortie had been authorised.         
	Having spent a week under instruction with a Chinook helicopter, Prince William flew a legitimate training sortie which tested his new skills to the limit, an RAF spokesman said. Flying at low level, Prince William piloted the heavy support RAF Chinook helicopter through the busy London flying lanes to a helicopter landing site in central London before departing the lanes to the south west.

	Paris, Jan. 7 (Reuters): It was rumoured for some time but seems finally to have been confirmed: Pierre Sarkozy, the French Presidents eldest son, aged 22, is a hip hop producer.
    
	Parisian rapper Poison told hip hop radio Generations 88.2 in an interview last week that Pierre Sarkozy, also known as Mosey, had composed La Rue, one of the titles on his coming album Mec de Tess (City Guy), the daily Liberation reported today.
    
	Hey, Im Mosey, a young Parisian producer, with my crew: Da Crime Chantilly we produced hip hop, soul and r amp;b beatz.
    
	Thats how Mosey  which means to amble along  describes himself on the Myspace page of his label: Da Crime Chantilly: www.myspace.com/Moseyproducer.
    
	Pierre is one of President Sarkozys two sons from his first marriage to Marie-Dominique Culioli. I have known him for five years, Poison was quoted as saying. I met him at a party. When I heard (who he was), I lost it, I called him.

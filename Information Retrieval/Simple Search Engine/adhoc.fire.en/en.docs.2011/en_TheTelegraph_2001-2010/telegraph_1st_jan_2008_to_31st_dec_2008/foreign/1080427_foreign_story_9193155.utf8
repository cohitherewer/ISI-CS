                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Berlusconi wife calls for Italy break-up
          MALCOLM MOORE                          Lack of faith                                  
	Rome, April 26: Silvio Berlusconis wife added her voice yesterday to the growing calls for Italy to be partitioned.        
	In an interview with La Stampa, Veronica Lario, 51, said: Italy has never been well-suited to being a single country, and has never matured enough to become one. There is no longer any value in a unified Italy.        
	Lario, a former showgirl, married Italys Prime Minister-elect 18 years ago after catching his eye on a television show. Since then, she has rarely courted publicity, but does run Il Foglio, an influential newspaper. The prospect of a devolved Italy has grown significantly in recent weeks since the Northern League, a secessionist party, won strong support in the election.         
	Umberto Bossi, its volcanic leader, has repeatedly threatened to take up arms against the corrupt politicians in Rome who divert the wealth of Italys North to the impoverished South.        
	Lario disclosed that she was a fan of Bossi and added it was time for Italy to stop being snobbish about the League. This is a disillusioned country, even after Berlusconis victory, she said. The League expresses concrete demands from the most productive part of Italy, which is tired of dragging the rest of the country and does not find itself represented by the Left-wing.

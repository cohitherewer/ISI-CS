          TOM PETERKIN                          Bill Gates                                   
	London, May 30: Microsoft is developing a new touch screen operating system that could mean the end of the computer mouse, Bill Gates has announced.         
	Windows 7 aims to build on the success of the touch screen systems developed by Microsofts rival Apples iPhone.         
	Microsoft users will issue commands by touching the screen rather than by the traditional keyboard and mouse combination, which has dominated since the 1970s.         
	Windows 7 is due to be released in 2010 and is Microsofts attempt to catch-up with Apple, whose handheld iPhone has proved exceptionally popular.         
	Touch screens are appearing on a host of devices including sat-navs, cellphones and remote controls. A touch screen BlackBerry is expected shortly.         
	At a conference in Canda this week, Bill Gates, Microsofts billionaire chairman, said: The way you interact with the system will change dramatically.         
	Gates added that computer users of the future will interact with their machines by voice and pen as well as touch.         
	Some experts have questioned how practical a mouse-less computer would be.         
	They suggest that typing skills would be abandoned and users would have to lean forward and repeatedly lift their arms to manipulate images on the screen.         
	With a PC youd have to lift your arm every time, and with a screen thats 17 inches wide thats going to become more difficult, said Roberta Cozza, an analyst at Gartner, an IT research company.

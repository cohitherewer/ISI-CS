                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Threat to Pak coalition after talks fail
                              Under pressure                            
	Islamabad/Dubai, April 29 (Agencies): Pakistans coalition government was under mounting pressure today after its leaders failed to resolve differences over how to reinstate judges ousted under President        
	Pervez Musharraf.        
	Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Asif Ali Zardaris Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) had promised to reinstate them by the end of April.        
	But a day before the deadline they remained deadlocked over just how to do it, triggering speculation that the government could crumble  and grant a reprieve to the embattled President.        
	The PML-N team, led by Sharifs brother Shahbaz, held talks with their PPP counterparts in Dubai where Zardari had gone to meet his family.         
	A senior PML-N official repeated a threat that the party would pull its ministers from the cabinet if the judges were not reinstated on time, but insisted the party would remain in the coalition.         
	Siddique-ul-Farooq said while the deadline looked difficult to meet, there was still hope for an agreement.        
	However, Farooq said the PML-N would not take any step that would damage the coalition government.        
	 Our joining the federal cabinet was conditional. We will review the decision and we may withdraw our ministers from the cabinet but that is still a supposition, Farooq said. The party, he said, is hopeful that both parties would fulfil their solemn pledge to the nation on reinstating the sacked judges.         
	We are not going to weaken this government. We can withdraw our ministers to show to the people of Pakistan that we are loyal to our commitments. We are not going to damage the government because we are going to provide the government ample opportunity to serve the people, Farooq said.        
	 The PML-N will take a decision on its future course of action after April 30, he said.        
	The PPP said Zardari also wants to reinstate the judges. However, he wants to bundle their return with a package of reforms that could crimp the powers of deposed Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry and prevent judges from getting involved in politics.        
	Information and broadcasting minister Sherry Rehman of the PPP said reinstating the judges required legislation that needs some time to pass the Pakistan parliament. I dont think in this situation the coalition is threatened, she said.        
	Top PML-N leader Raja Zafrul Haq told reporters that Sharif would meet Shahbaz in Dubai and discuss the talks held with Zardari.         
	 Sharif is also expected to meet Zardari.

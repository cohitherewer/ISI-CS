The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cambridge Facebook fake trick on students
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Cambridge Facebook fake trick on students
          CAROLINE GAMMELL                              
	London, Oct. 29: The dean of one of the biggest colleges at Cambridge set up a Facebook profile under an assumed name to keep an eye on his students after they formed a protest group to complain about a change in drinking laws.         
	Peter Linehan, the dean of St Johns, adopted the alter ego Pedro Amigo  Peter Friend  to join the social networking website.         
	He became a member of the Facebook group St Johns Has Banned Us Taking Wine To Hall, which complained about the new wine allowance when formally dining at the College.         
	Traditionally, students were allowed to take a bottle of wine each, but as of October 1, new rules stated that the maximum was two glasses of wine. The Facebook group, which now has 344 members, was outraged by the decision and called on St Johns students to boycott dining in the hall.         
	Nearly 100 messages were posted on the groups discussion wall, debating the issue.         
	Among them was Pedro Amigo, whose email address tallied with Linehans, but had no profile photograph or friends.         
	Student newspaper Varsity claimed that students became suspicious after a number of outspoken protesters had been summoned to the deans office. It claimed that Linehan was using the site to find and discipline students, targeting those who he felt had gone too far.         
	After students started discussing the identity of Amigo, he soon disappeared from Facebook. Linehan described the report as baseless and said only one student had been called to his office. He was quoted by Varsity as saying: If a dean of Johns wanted to gain information on the student body, he would be wise not to use a forum as public as Facebook to do so. When approached by The Daily Telegraph, Linehan described the report as totally incorrect.         
	But four hours later, a spokeswoman from the college said: As its dean of discipline, Linehan is required to investigate allegations of misbehaviour by junior members of St Johns.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

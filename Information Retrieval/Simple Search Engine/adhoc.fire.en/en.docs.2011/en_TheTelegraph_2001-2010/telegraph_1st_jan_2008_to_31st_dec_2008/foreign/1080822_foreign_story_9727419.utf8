	The lyrics from his 1980 song When The World Is Running Down came top of the list. You make the best of whats still around is a line regularly misheard as You make the best homemade stew around.         
	Sting beat The Beatles, Bee Gees, Queen and David Bowie in an online poll of 2,000 music fans by specialist hearing aid retailer Amlifon. The Beatles appear twice in the top ten.         
	The song Michelle has a line Michelle ma belle, sont des mot qui vont tres bien ensemble tres bien ensemble, which is heard as Michelle ma belle, some say monkeys play piano well, play piano well, while Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds line The girl with kaleidoscope eyes is mistaken for The girl with colitis goes by.

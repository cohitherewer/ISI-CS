	Paris, Nov. 15 (AP): US actress Lindsay Lohan has been pelted with a flour bomb on arrival at a Paris nightclub wearing a fur stole.        
	Animal rights activists showered the 22-year-old actress with flour when she went to the VIP Room Theatre early today with her friend, disc jockey Samantha Ronson.        
	The owner of the nightclub helped Lohan dust off her blue sequined dress and black stole before she posed on the red carpet. Ronson went on to spin tracks for a crowd that included reggae rapper Shaggy and I Kissed a Girl singer Katy Perry.        
	Lohan rose to stardom with her leading roles in the films Freaky Friday, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and Mean Girls and Herbie: Fully Loaded.

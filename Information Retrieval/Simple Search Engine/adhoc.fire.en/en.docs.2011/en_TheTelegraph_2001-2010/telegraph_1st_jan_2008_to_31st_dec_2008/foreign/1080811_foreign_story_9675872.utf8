	Islamabad Aug. 10 (AP): US authorities have allowed Pakistani diplomats to visit a female al Qaida suspect recently captured in Afghanistan and taken to the US after she allegedly tried to kill her interrogators, the foreign ministry said today.        
	Two diplomats visited Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani citizen educated in the US, over the weekend at a detention facility in New York, ministry spokesperson Mohammed Sadiq said.        
	Pakistani state media reported she had requested a copy of the Quran, religiously appropriate food, and assurances of a fair trial. Pakistan will provide all possible assistance to her, Sadiq said.        
	Siddiqui, 36, who has been described as a possible fixer for al Qaida, was picked up in Afghanistan on July 17.

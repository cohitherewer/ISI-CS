	Washington, Nov. 4: Americas latest tryst with democracy acquired the dimensions of a movement when long queues people lined up before dawn across the country to vote in an election that will either see a black man elected President or a woman chosen to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.        
	All indicators at the time of writing pointed to a victory for Barack Obama: according to opinion polls released even as polling booths opened this morning, Obama led rival John McCain in five of eight states that will essentially decide the election by the time Indians head for work on Wednesday morning.        
	According to latest polls, Obama also expanded his margin over McCain in national polls to 11 points, an increase of four points in the two days before designated voting day today.         
	If voters from coast to coast in America were enthusiastic about this years election, this countrys notorious electronic voting machines which were tried and tested repeatedly in the run-up to polling were not.        
	In New Jersey, malfunctioning machines forced voters to cast manual paper ballots. In Ohio, where allegations of rigging through rigged voting machines in the 2004 election were rampant, jammed paper held up voting in one county. In another county, a motor accident knocked out power to voting machines and manual balloting had to be employed in two locations.        
	If voters lined up at polling booths to vote, so did an army of lawyers, anticipating disputes in many states.         
	In Florida alone, Obamas campaign has lined up at least 5,000 lawyers to help Democrats who fear that they will be disenfranchised as in 2000 which allowed George W. Bush to become President. The Democratic National Committee has created a National Lawyers Council to prevent any repeat of the incidents in the last two presidential polls to Republican advantage.        
	As many as 10,000 volunteer lawyers have signed up to help the Democratic party to navigate through any disputes today.        
	Not to be outwitted, the Republican campaign has also created a nation-wide network called: Lawyers for McCain.        
	The intense nationwide and global interest in the presidential election has obscured what may turn out to be a domestic political earthquake by late tonight. Republicans are bracing for a bloodbath in Congressional elections which are simultaneously taking place today. The intense unpopularity of President Bush is expected to greatly increase Democratic strength in the US House of Representatives.        
	But if Democrats manage to have 60 Senators in the new Congress, they can block any legislation through a process known as filibuster even if McCain becomes the next President.        
	Filibuster is a successful attempt to hold up voting on bills in the Senate but it requires a strength of 60 Senators        
	Encouraged by the unprecedented enthusiasm across America to vote, businesses in the US have got into the electoral process by handing out free gifts of those who vote.        
	At Ben amp; Jerrys, who run ice cream parlours all over the US, tasty treats are being given away to those who display the I voted badge. The owners of Ben amp; Jerrys have a history of liberal political activism.        
	Krispy Creme, doughnut-makers, handed out special star-shaped doughnuts with red, white and blue sprinkles, colours of stars and stripes, the US national flag. Starbucks also joined the freebie efforts in support of democracy.        
	Since campaigning is allowed in the US even on polling day, Obama voted in his hometown of Chicago, accompanied by his wife and two daughters and left to do some last-minute campaigning in Republican-leaning Indiana.        
	McCain voted at a church in Phoenix, Arizona and headed to fly Colorado and New Mexico for similar last-minute campaigning.

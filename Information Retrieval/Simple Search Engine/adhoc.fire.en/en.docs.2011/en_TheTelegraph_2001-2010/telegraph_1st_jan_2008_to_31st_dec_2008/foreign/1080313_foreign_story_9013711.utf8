	Lahore, March 12 (AP): Police in Pakistan were investigating today whether al Qaida was behind twin suicide attacks that killed 27 people.        
	Yesterdays bombings in Lahore were the first major acts of terrorism since a weekend announcement by former President Benazir Bhuttos party and that of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that they will form a coalition government.        
	The detonation of a small truck laden with explosives tore the facade from a seven-story federal police headquarters yesterday. Fifteen minutes later, a similar attack flattened a business in an upscale residential neighbourhood.        
	While al Qaida-linked militants in Iraq have regularly used vehicles to launch massive attacks on buildings, such damage has rarely been inflicted on a government facility in Pakistan.        
	Provincial police chief Azhar Hasan Nadeem said today that it was not yet clear whether the al Qaida was involved. Of course they have a huge organisation, and they have a very vast network, but it would be premature to pinpoint exactly as to which particular organisation is responsible, Nadeem told reporters while attending funeral prayers for the police officers who died.        
	A senior police investigator, Tasadaq Hussain, said police had collected the remains of the two attackers, and that efforts were under way to trace and capture those who orchestrated the attacks.        
	Rizwan Nasir, head of the provincial ambulance service, said three more people injured in the blasts had died, bringing the death toll to 27. He said eight patients remained in critical condition.        
	In all, officials have said that more than 200 people were injured.        
	Pakistan has suffered at least seven suicide attacks since the February 18 elections, a landmark in the countrys move toward democracy after more than eight years of military rule.        
	The spike in violence  and its spread from the wild regions along the Afghan border to relatively peaceful Lahore  is prompting Pakistanis to question Musharrafs US-backed approach to countering al Qaida and the Taliban. Musharrafs opponents say heavy-handed military action has only fuelled the violence.        
	Today, a government official said a mortar shell struck a tribesmans home during fighting between Pakistani security forces and militants in the northwest, killing five civilians.        
	The battle broke out yesterday after a bomb exploded near the troops as they collected water from a stream in Bajur, a tribal region bordering Afghanistan, said local government official Mohammed Jamil Khan. He said it was unclear who fired the shell.         
	 In the northern Swat valley, two police explosives experts died today while trying to defuse a roadside bomb, said Mohib Ullah, a local police official.        
	The army also said its forces arrested five suspected militants and seized a weapons cache in Swat, where they have been battling supporters of a pro-Taliban cleric for months. The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) have insisted that they will move to ease western fears that their victory in February 18 elections could mark a slackening in Pakistans resolve against the Taliban and al Qaida.

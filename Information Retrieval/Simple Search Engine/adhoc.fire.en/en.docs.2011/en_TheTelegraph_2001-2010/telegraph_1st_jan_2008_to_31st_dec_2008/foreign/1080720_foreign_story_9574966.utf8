	Beijing, July 19: China is abandoning Chairman Maos dream to make Beijing a workers paradise, rebuilding it under the cover of a green Olympics as a capital for its 21st century empire.        
	In a display of the citys determination to improve its air quality, officials this week vaunted the closure and relocation to the coast of its biggest polluter, the smoke-stacked mini-state of Capital Steel.        
	Three of its blast furnaces stand blackened and idle, along with two of its three steel mills. A fourth furnace will shut tomorrow, when for the sake of the Olympics industrial production will be reduced across five provinces, and cars in the city restricted to alternate days.        
	But the shutdown, a culmination of years of work that has seen hundreds of chemical and other factories close, is also part of a drive to rediscover the citys original purpose: to be the political, financial and cultural heart of the Chinese world.        
	When Mao Zedong founded the Peoples Republic in 1949, he replaced many of the Ming and Qing dynasty temples, palaces and old houses with factories. He told architects he wanted to look out from Tiananmen gate and see smokestacks.        
	Millions of peasants were brought in to change the citys character from bourgeois to working class. By the nineties, it was clear this was an environmental as well as social disaster. Beijing has no main water supply.        
	At one stage, a 10th of all Beijings pollution came from Capital Steel, one reason why the factory is being reconstructed on a purpose-built island off Chinas coast.        
	This is also a symbolic end to Mao-era industrial policies. Capital Steel once employed 134,000 people in what was a mini-state, with its own hospital, schools, police and subsidiary factories providing goods for workers.

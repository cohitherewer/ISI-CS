	Las Vegas, Dec. 5 (Reuters): .J. Simpson, who famously stunned America more than a decade ago by walking away from his murder trial a free man, was sentenced today to at least 15 years in prison for his Las Vegas kidnapping conviction.        
	The sentence was levied by a judge two months after jurors found the 61-year-old retired football star guilty of all 12 charges against him for last years gunpoint hold-up of a pair of sports memorabilia collectors in a casino hotel room.        
	The former National Football League hero turned actor, dressed in blue prison garb, appeared sombre and drawn as the sentence was pronounced. Minutes earlier, he had pleaded for leniency, saying he had only meant to retrieve possessions that he believed were wrongly taken from him. Simpson has remained in custody since he was convicted on October 3, exactly 13 years after his controversial 1995 acquittal in Los Angeles in the slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman.

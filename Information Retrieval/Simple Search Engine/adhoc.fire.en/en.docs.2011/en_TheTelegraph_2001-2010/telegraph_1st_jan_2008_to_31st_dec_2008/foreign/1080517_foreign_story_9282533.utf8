	Geneva, May 16: Al Qaida sympathisers are threatening to attack the Euro 2008 football tournament next month, according to Swiss police.        
	The championships, which begin on June 7 and are hosted by Switzerland and Austria, are in a terrorist danger zone and the police are monitoring closely a number of Internet chat forums linked to the terror group.         
	Messages have been posted on Sos Minbar and As-Sahab, two Islamist websites used by al Qaida and its followers.

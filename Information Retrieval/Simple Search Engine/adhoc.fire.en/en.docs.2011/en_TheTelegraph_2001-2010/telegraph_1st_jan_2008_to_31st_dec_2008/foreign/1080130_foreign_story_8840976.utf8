	Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 29 (AP): A teacher in Muslim-majority Malaysia has been reprimanded for forcing six Hindu schoolboys to shave their moustaches and beards, which they were growing for a religious ritual this month, a news report said today.																								
 
	The Star newspaper quoted state education director Hussain Harun as saying that the teacher in the northern Perak state was enforcing school regulations that require students to be clean shaven.
 
	 However, he was guilty of being insensitive to the students feelings, and has been told off, Hussain was quoted as saying. The teacher also forced the students to remove religious wristbands to enforce a rule that no ornaments be worn in school.
    
	If need be, the teacher would have to apologise ... for hurting their feelings by being insensitive to their religious and cultural needs, The Star quoted Hussain as saying. The best way is to ask for their forgiveness.
    
	Hussain could not immediately be reached, and the education officer investigating the case declined to comment.
    
	The students were growing their hair as part of a ritual for the Thaipusam festival that was celebrated on January 23. Many ethnic Indians, who form 8 per cent of Malaysias 27 million population, let their hair grow for a certain period and have themselves shaved on Thaipusam day.
    
	The Star did not identify the teachers religion.
    
	The incident is a reflection of growing racial friction, which threatens to unravel the countrys carefully nurtured ethnic and religious pluralism. About 60 per cent of the population is Muslim Malay, and the minority Indians and Chinese are concerned that a pro-Muslim tilt in the civil service and judiciary is eroding their religious rights.

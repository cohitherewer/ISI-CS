The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama tilts to centre, invites clash of ideas
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obama tilts to centre, invites clash of ideas
          DAVID E. SANGER                          President-elect Obama jokes with a customer during a surprise lunch-time visit to Mannys Coffee Shop in Chicago. (AFP)                                  
	Washington, Nov. 22: President-elect Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination with the enthusiastic support of the Left wing of his party, fuelled by his vehement opposition to the decision to invade Iraq and by one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate.        
	Now, his reported selections for two of the major positions in his cabinet  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state and Timothy F. Geithner as secretary of the treasury  suggest that Obama is planning to govern from the Centre-Right of his party, surrounding himself with pragmatists rather than ideologues.         
	The choices are as revealing of the new President as they are of his appointees  and suggest that, from its first days, an Obama White House will brim with big personalities and far more spirited debate than occurred among the largely like-minded advisers who populated President Bushs first term.         
	But the names racing through the ether in Washington about the choices to follow also suggest that Obama continues to place a premium on deep experience.         
	He is widely reported to be considering asking Bushs defence secretary, Robert M. Gates, to stay on for a year; and he is thinking about General James L. Jones, the former Nato commander and Marine Corps commandant, for national security adviser. Obama is also thinking of placing Lawrence H. Summers, the former treasury secretary whom Obama considered putting back in his old post, inside the White House as a senior economic adviser.         
	This is the violin model: Hold power with the left hand, and play the music with your right, David J. Rothkopf, a former Clinton official who wrote a history of the National Security Council, said yesterday, as news of Hillary Clintons and Geithners appointments leaked. Its teaching us something about Obama: while he wants to bring new ideas to the game, he is working from the centre space of American foreign policy.        
	The reason, several of Obamas transition team members say, is that they believe that the new administration will have no time for a learning curve. With the country facing a deep recession or worse, global market turmoil, chaos in Pakistan and a worsening war in Afghanistan, theres going to be no time for experimentation, a member of the Obama foreign policy team said.        
	In some ways, the choices made so far are reminiscent of the way the last senator to be elected President, John F. Kennedy, chose a cabinet. As President-elect, Kennedy soon picked three top officials significantly more conservative than he was: Dean Rusk as secretary of state, Robert S. McNamara as secretary of defence and C. Douglas Dillon, a Republican, as secretary of the treasury. They helped him navigate the Cuban missile crisis.         
	Of all the choices Obama has made so far, it is the selection of Hillary Clinton that appears the biggest gamble, in part because she has never had to engage in the give-and-take of high-stakes diplomacy, and in part because no one really knows how she will mesh with the Obama White House.         
	In her discussion with the President-elect, several members of his transition team said, Hillary Clinton expressed no doubt that she could be a loyal member of the Obama team  though she was reportedly deeply conflicted about giving up her Senate seat and the independent power base it afforded her.         
	During the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, Obama and Hillary Clinton went out of their way to point out their foreign policy differences, with Hillary Clinton portraying herself as a hawkish Democrat and defending her decision to vote in favour of the 2002 resolution that Bush later considered an authorisation to use military force against Saddam Hussein. (Later, she said she fully expected Bush to use diplomacy first  and was shocked that he did not.)

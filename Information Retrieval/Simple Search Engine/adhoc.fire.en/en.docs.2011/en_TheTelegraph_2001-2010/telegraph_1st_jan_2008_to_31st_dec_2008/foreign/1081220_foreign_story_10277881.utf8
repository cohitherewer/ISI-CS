	London, Dec. 19: Tom Cruises teenage son is about to make his film debut in the US  following in his fathers star-studded footsteps.         
	Connor Cruise, the 13-year-old son of Cruise and Nicole Kidman, will see his name on the credit sheet six days before his fathers latest film hits the cinemas. But whereas Connors role in Seven Pounds is limited to a few lines, his father will be the star of Valkyrie, the story of how some German officers tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler.         
	In a recent interview, Cruise said he had been anxious not to put his children under pressure to become actors. Who knows what hes going to do? he said. Hes grown up on (acting). Ive always had my kids there, in hair and makeup, just always around the sets.

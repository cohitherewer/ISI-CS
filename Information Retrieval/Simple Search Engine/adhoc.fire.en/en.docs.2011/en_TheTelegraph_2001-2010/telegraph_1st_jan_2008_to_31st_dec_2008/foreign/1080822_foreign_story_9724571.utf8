The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sharif threat to pull out of coalition
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Sharif threat to pull out of coalition

	Singapore, Aug. 21 (Reuters): Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has threatened to pull his party out of Pakistans ruling coalition if it does not decide by tomorrow to reinstate judges purged by former President Pervez Musharraf, the Wall Street Journal reported.        
	The deadlock over the judges opened up cracks in the coalition led by slain Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) soon after Musharraf, faced with the threat of impeachment, resigned on Monday.        
	Sharif told the newspaper that the sacking of the judges last year had shaken the foundations of the country and it was necessary to restore them to their jobs.        
	We will not try to bring the government down, Sharif said in remarks published today. But, of course, we then have no choice but to sit in the Opposition.        
	The PPP, led by Bhuttos widower Asif Ali Zardari, has wavered over restoring the judges, partly because of concern that the deposed Chief Justice might take up challenges to an amnesty from graft charges granted to party leaders last year, analysts say.        
	Leaders of two small parties in the four-party alliance have played down the dispute but said they had been given three days to resolve the problem between the big parties.        
	Sharif said Zardari had earlier assured him that the judges would be reinstated within 24 hours of Musharrafs impeachment. We supported him on impeachment. Its now his turn to support us on the reinstatement of judges.        
	The departure of Sharifs party from the coalition would not force an election, analysts have said, adding that the PPP, the biggest in parliament, should be able to gather enough support to remain in government.        
	With Sharif winning much popular support for his tough stand on the unpopular Musharraf and the judges, an election is the last thing Bhuttos party wants, Rasul Bakhsh Rais of the Lahore University of Management Sciences told Reuters today.        
	If elections are held, I dont think the Peoples Party can survive. It will be wiped out, Rais said.        
	The coalition leaders are also divided over Musharrafs future. There has been no announcement since his resignation on whether he would get immunity from prosecution and be allowed to live freely in Pakistan.        
	Sharif, the Prime Minister Musharraf ousted, said he bore no grudges towards the former military ruler but he must be held accountable for his actions.        
	Im not a man who believes in revenge. Although he mistreated me, I dont have any score to settle with him. But somebody who dismisses parliament, subverts the Constitution, arrests the judges must tell the people why he did that. He must answer these questions under whatever forum the law provides. he said.         
	Hedging its bets, the PPP has established new allies in parliament, with the second largest Opposition bloc, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a strong Musharraf backer, signalling willingness this week to join forces.        
	The new President must be elected by the middle of September.         
	The PPP insisted this week that as the largest party in the coalition, it has the right to choose the new head of state, something unlikely to go over well with Sharif.        
	Though they have yet to name a candidate, party members were backing Zardaris nomination who comes from Sindh.         
	Sharifs party were arguing for a President from either Baluchistan or North West Frontier Province in order to strengthen Pakistans strained federation.

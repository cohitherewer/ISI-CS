                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Pak blast, Indian held
                            
	Lahore, Dec. 24 (AP): A bomb-rigged truck with government plates exploded in Lahore today, killing one person in a heavily guarded neighbourhood home to many government officials in the eastern Pakistani city.        
	(The Pakistani daily Dawn reported late tonight that an Indian national had been arrested in Lahore in connection with the blast. No official confirmation was available.)        
	The target of the Lahore blast was possibly a police officer who headed an operation that led to the death of a leader of al Qaida-linked militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi in 2002, said Umer Virk, the head of the crime investigation department.        
	The officer escaped the explosion near his home, but it killed a Christian woman and wounded four of her relatives as they drove together to a Christmas function, Virk said.        
	The truck was obliterated, with pieces scattered for 200 metres, while the wall of a nearby house collapsed.        
	Police officer Pervez Rathore said the truck had apparently gained access to the neighbourhood because of its official plates. The area is walled off and filled with guards.        
	Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is a Sunni militant group blamed for killing scores of minority Shias across Pakistan.         
	Its members have also been accused of attacks against westerners in Karachi, the slaying of US journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002 and the September truck bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.        
	Separately, suspected extremists shot and wounded a Chinese engineer as he shopped at a market in the northwest.

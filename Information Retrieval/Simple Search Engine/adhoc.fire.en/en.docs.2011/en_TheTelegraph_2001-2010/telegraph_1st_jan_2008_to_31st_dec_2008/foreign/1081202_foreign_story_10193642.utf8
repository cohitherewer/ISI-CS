                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obama nominates tough Hillary

	Chicago, Dec. 1: President-elect Barack Obama today formally announced a national security team that is led by his one-time chief Democratic rival and includes a top member of President Bushs cabinet.        
	He said the bipartisan group shares his pragmatism and his commitment to strengthen Americas standing in the world.        
	In a Chicago news conference, Obama introduced Senatro Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, bringing on board the candidate who battled him for the Democratic presidential nomination during a long primary season. As Americas top diplomat, Clinton will be the face of Obamas efforts to remake the countrys foreign policy.        
	Obama also announced that Bushs defence secretary, Robert M. Gates, has agreed to remain in the job in the new administration, providing continuity while taking on what the President-elect said would be a new mission: Responsibly ending the war in Iraq through a successful transition to Iraqi control.        
	As he introduced Clinton, Gates and other members of his team, Obama stressed that in the 21st century, our destiny is shared with the worlds and that the US has a stake in global events regarding such matters as financial markets, public health, climate change and security from terrorism.        
	And so, in this uncertain world, the time has come for a new beginning  a new dawn of American leadership to overcome the challenges of the 21st century, Obama said.                   Obama with Clinton in Chicago on Monday. (AFP)       
	We will strengthen our capacity to defeat our enemies and support our friends. We will renew old alliances and forge new and enduring partnerships. We will show the world once more that America is relentless in defence of our people, steady in advancing our interests and committed to the ideals that shine as a beacon to the world: democracy and justice; opportunity and unyielding hope  because American values are Americas greatest export to the world. He said the members of his national security team share my pragmatism about the use of power and my sense of purpose about Americas role as a leader in the world.        
	He hailed Clinton as a tough campaign opponent who knows many of the worlds leaders and will command respect in every capital.         
	Obama said that Gates, who took the helm at the Pentagon two years ago, has restored accountability during his tenure and won the confidence of military commanders. Gates also has earned the respect of members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, Obama said. He added: Gates will shift the US focus in the war on terrorism to Afghanistan, where a resurgent Taliban has been gaining ground and al Qaida poses a threat from safe havens across the border in Pakistan.

                              Muntazer al-Zaidi: Celebrity                            
	Baghdad, Dec. 16 (Reuters): An Iraqi journalist who hurled his shoes at President George W. Bush appeared before a judge today and admitted aggression against a President, a judicial spokesman said.        
	TV reporter Muntazer al-Zaidi became an instant sensation in the Arab world when he called Bush a dog at a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Sunday and threw his shoes at him.        
	Al-Zaidi was brought today before the investigating judge in the presence of a defence lawyer and a prosecutor, said Abdul Satar Birqadr, spokesman for Iraqs High Judicial Council. He admits the action he carried out.        
	The court decided to keep Zaidi in custody and, after the judge has completed his investigation, it may send him for trial under a clause in the Iraqi penal code that makes it an offence to try to murder Iraqi or foreign Presidents.        
	The sentence for such a crime could be up to 15 years jail, Birqadr said.        
	Zaidis brother said today that the reporter was hit on the head with a rifle butt and had an arm broken in the chaos that broke out after he threw his shoes at Bush and was leapt on by Iraqi security officers and US secret service agents.        
	Zaidi is in a hospital in the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad, his brother Maitham al-Zaidi said.        
	All that we know is we were contacted yesterday by a person  we know him  and he told us that Muntazer was taken on Sunday to Ibn-Sina hospital, Maitham al-Zaidi said. He was wounded in the head because he was hit by a rifle butt, and one of his arms was broken.        
	The brother declined to identify the source of the information and his comments could not be independently verified. Asked about his remarks, various Iraqi officials denied having responsibility for the case.        
	Birqadr said he was not personally present during the hearing and so could not confirm that Zaidi was injured.         
	According to the Associated Press, Maitham al-Zaidi said on Al-Baghdadia television, Zaids employer, that he had spoken by telephone with his brother and that he told him thank God, I am in good health. I felt from his voice that he is good health, Maitham al-Zaidi said.        
	In Mosul, Iraqs third-largest city, located north of Baghdad, an estimated 1,000 protesters carried banners and chanted slogans demanding Zaidis release.        
	A couple of hundred more also protested today in Nasiriyah, a Shia city about 320km southeast of Baghdad, and Fallujah, a Sunni area.

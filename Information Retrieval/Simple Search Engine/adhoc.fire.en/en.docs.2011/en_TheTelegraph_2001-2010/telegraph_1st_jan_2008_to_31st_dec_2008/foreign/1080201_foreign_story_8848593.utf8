	Los Angeles, Jan. 31 (AP): Britney Spears was taken from her home by ambulance early today and escorted to a hospital by more than a dozen police officers as two helicopters followed overhead.
    
	A Los Angeles police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak on the matter, said the 26-year-old pop star was being taken to get help but did not give the ambulances destination. The Los Angeles Times, citing unidentified authorities, said Spears was taken to UCLA Medical Center to be placed on a mental evaluation hold. Center spokesman Mark Wheeler declined to comment.
    
	On January 3, police were called to her home when she refused to return her two young sons, Sean Preston, 2, and Jayden James, 1, to ex-husband Kevin Federline, who has custody. Officers had paramedics haul Spears to a hospital for undisclosed reasons. She was released after a day and a half.

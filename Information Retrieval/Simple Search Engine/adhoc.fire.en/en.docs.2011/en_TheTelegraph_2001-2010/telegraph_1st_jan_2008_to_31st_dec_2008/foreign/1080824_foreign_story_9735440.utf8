The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Led Zep classic too racy for Olympics
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Led Zep classic too racy for Olympics
          DAVID BOND AND JOHN BINGHAM                              
	London, Aug. 23: It has been delighting fans for almost 40 years but Led Zeppelins rock classic Whole Lotta Love has been deemed too racy by Olympics organisers.         
	After choosing the song for the closing ceremony tomorrow, they decided that some of the lyrics would have to be omitted or re-written amid concerns that they could cause offence.         
	The song was chosen as the centrepiece of an eight-minute 2.5million British segment at the event in Beijing at which the Olympic flag will be officially passed to the London mayor Boris Johnson.         
	Organisers of the London 2012 Games commissioned the bands guitarist Jimmy Page to record a new version of the song to be performed on top of a special red double-decker bus accompanied by Leona Lewis, winner of the ITV reality television show The X Factor, with David Beckham looking on.         
	But, according to London 2012 officials, Lewis  who grew up in east London close to the Olympic site  requested a change to the songs second verse because she was worried they would not make sense for a female singer.         
	In the original, recorded in 1969, frontman Robert Plant sings: Im gonna give you every inch of my love.         
	But in the version that will be sung tomorrow, however, Lewis changes the words to every bit of my love.         
	The band also agreed to a request from organisers to drop the third verse, which includes similar sexual innuendoes, to fit in to the eight-minute performance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Invented: Gadget to move objects with mind power

	London, July 20: From the Hollywood film Firefox to the television show Heroes, science fiction writers have always dreamt of the day when humans could control machines with the power of thought alone.         
	Now British scientists are turning the vision into reality with a device that allows objects to be manipulated with brain waves.        
	The prototype, developed at Essex University, can already be used to play simple computer games. By imagining a movement, the wearer of the hat-shaped device can tell the computer to move an object around a screen or a robot around a room.         
	The researchers hope their technology will eventually allow people to move wheelchairs and drive cars with their thoughts.        
	The development came as video games maker Nintendo disclosed that it wanted to build on the success of the motion-sensitive technology used in the best-selling console, the Wii, by developing games that can be controlled by thought.        
	To pick up the signal from the brain, the scientists use a cap fitted with electrodes that detect changes in the electrical activity produced by the neurons.        
	When a person wearing the cap imagines a particular action, such as moving a hand, it produces a distinct pattern of signals that a computer learns to recognise.        
	Dr John Gan, who is leading the research at Essex Universitys department of electrical engineering, said: We have been developing this to help disabled patients who have limited movement ability or dont have any, so they can control a computer or a wheelchair by thinking.        
	But the general applications are quite widespread, from controlling computer games to using the brain to control things in the living environment, such as turning lights on and off, opening and shutting curtains or switching channels on the television.        
	Scientists hope to change completely the way humans interact with computers and technology by abandoning keyboards for devices that interpret signals directly from the brain.        
	It is this technology that has until now been a Hollywood dream, such as in the 1982 Clint Eastwood film, Firefox, where the actor plays a pilot who flies a thought-controlled jet fighter, or the television show Heroes, in which a young boy discovers he has the power to control computers and electronic machines with his thoughts.        
	Nigel Shadbolt, of the school of computer science at Southampton University and former president of the British Computer Society, said: The old science fiction idea of interpreting brain signals is becoming a scientific reality.        
	The brain is constantly active and produces a lot of chaotic noise, but we are getting better and better devices that are able to separate useful signals from the background.        
	The Essex University scientists have developed a second device which picks up electrical activity in tiny muscle movements in the forehead and the movement of the eyes to control a wheelchair.        
	With a flick of the brow, patients can move the chair forwards, backwards, left and right.                    THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

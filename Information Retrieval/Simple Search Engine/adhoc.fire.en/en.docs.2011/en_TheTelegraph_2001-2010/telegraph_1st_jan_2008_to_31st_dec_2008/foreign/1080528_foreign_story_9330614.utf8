	Islamabad, May 27: Pakistans coalition government today hinted at impeaching President Pervez Musharraf, days after it moved to clip his wings and reportedly decided to reinstate the Supreme Court judges he had sacked.        
	The government may take this step if so desired by our people, Farzana Raja, senior leader of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), said after a meeting.        
	The coalitions top leaders met in Islamabad today for the first time since Nawaz Sharifs party, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), quit the cabinet two weeks ago over the PPPs then refusal to reinstate the judges.        
	PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari and Sharif today discussed in detail the constitutional amendment package aimed at transferring many of Musharrafs powers to Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani.        
	If the package is approved by the parliament with a two-thirds majority, Musharraf will lose the power to dissolve the House, dismiss the government and appoint governors and armed forces chiefs.        
	Zardari, who has resisted US pressure to meet Musharraf and develop a working relationship with him, has said his party can muster the House numbers needed to impeach Musharraf.        
	Musharraf reportedly offered to resign last week in return for indemnity by the parliament for the steps he took after declaring Emergency on November 3.        
	After todays meeting, Sharifs party spokesperson, Ahsan Iqbal, said: The people of Pakistan already impeached Musharraf on February 18 (with his kings party routed in the general election) and it is now up to the political leadership to take a final decision in this respect as quickly as possible.        
	Musharraf had deposed the judges after they refused to take a fresh oath of allegiance to him after the imposition of Emergency. Critics say he made the move after it appeared that the Supreme Court might overturn his controversial victory in the October 6, 2007, presidential election, which he had contested in uniform.        
	Our legal experts will carefully look into the amendments package and finalise the PML-Ns response, Iqbal said, adding that the PPP would hand the coalition partner a copy of the draft package very soon.

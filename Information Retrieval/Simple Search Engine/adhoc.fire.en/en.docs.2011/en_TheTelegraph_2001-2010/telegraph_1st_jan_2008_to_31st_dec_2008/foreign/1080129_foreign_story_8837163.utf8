The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kenya mobs on rampage
                                                                                                            Kenya mobs on rampage
                            
	Naivasha (Kenya), Jan. 28 (Reuters): Machete-wielding mobs faced off in Kenyas Rift Valley today and the death toll climbed to nearly 100 people in the latest bout of ethnic violence touched off by a disputed election.        
	The tit-for-tat violence complicated the task of former UN chief Kofi Annan, who has asked both sides to name teams to negotiate an end to the electoral crisis that has laid bare the tribal undercurrents of Kenyas politics.        
	In the normally peaceful Rift Valley town of Nakuru, a mortuary worker said 64 bodies were lying in the morgue, all victims of the past four days of ethnic fighting.

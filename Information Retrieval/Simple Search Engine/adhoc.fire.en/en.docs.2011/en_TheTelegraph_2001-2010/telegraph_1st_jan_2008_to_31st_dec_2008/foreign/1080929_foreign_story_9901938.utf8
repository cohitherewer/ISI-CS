                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Afghan top woman cop shot dead
                            
	Kandahar, Sept. 28 (Reuters): Unidentified gunmen shot dead the most senior woman police officer in southern Afghanistan today, an official said.        
	Lieutenant-Colonel Malalai was killed in her car in an area of Kandahar city where she resumed her job as an officer after US-led forces in 2001 overthrew the Taliban government which had barred women from most outdoor work.        
	She had led many police house searches in Kandahar leading to seizure of arms and drugs in recent years.        
	Unknown gunmen from a car killed her when she was heading to her office, provincial spokesperson Zalmai Ayoubi said, adding the motive behind the incident was being investigated.        
	Her son was wounded in the attack, witnesses said.        
	Officials have yet to comment about the killing of the 45-year-old Malalai who had survived several assassination attempts.        
	Kandahar is part of the main bastion for the Taliban Islamists.

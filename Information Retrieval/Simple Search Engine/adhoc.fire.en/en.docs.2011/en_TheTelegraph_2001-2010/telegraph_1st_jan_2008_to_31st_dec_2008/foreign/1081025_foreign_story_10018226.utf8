	London, Oct. 24: Stephen Hawking is to retire as Cambridge Universitys Lucasian Professor of Mathematics next year.         
	Applicants are being invited for the illustrious position, once held by Sir Isaac Newton, which will be vacated on October 1, 2009.        
	But Hawking will continue his work as usual at Cambridge University as Emeritus Lucasian Professor at the university, an honorary title.        
	A spokeswoman explained it was university policy for professors to pass the baton in the year they reach the age of 67. She said Hawkings diary is already booked up to 2012.        
	The post is retiring but Hawking isnt, the spokeswoman said. Nothing will change. It is merely a formality. Hawking, 66, will have held the position for 30 years at the time of his retirement.

	Kathmandu, Sept. 29 (Reuters): Nepals new Maoist-led government has appointed a 6-year-old girl as a living goddess or Kumari in a town near Kathmandu.        
	This is the first time that the link between the ancient ritual and the monarchy has been snapped.        
	For centuries, the head priest of the Nepali monarchy appointed the Kumaris in several towns in the Kathmandu valley. But with the abolition of the monarchy in May, that position has also disappeared.        
	Instead, officials at the state-run Trust Corporation overseeing cultural affairs appointed Shreeya Bajracharya as the new Kumari of the temple-town of Bhaktapur near Kathmandu, Deepak Bahadur Pandey, a senior official of the agency, said.        
	The government authorised us to appoint the Kumari and we have done that for the first time, Pandey said. The Himalayan nation abolished the 239-year-old monarchy and became a republic in May, following elections in April that saw the countrys Maoist former rebels emerge as the biggest political party in the 601-seat Constituent Assembly.        
	The Maoists now head the new government.        
	Shreeya was enthroned yesterday amid prayers by Buddhist priests and will be worshipped by devout Hindus and Buddhists until reaching puberty, the girls caretaker Nhuchhe Ratna Shakya said, adding: She is pretty and nice.        
	Shreeya replaces her controversial predecessor, Sajani Shakya, who retired earlier this year, after nine years in the divine role. Sajani made international headlines in 2007 after she visited the US to promote a film by a British company about the Kumari system.        
	Some religious authorities criticised the trip, saying it was against tradition. She retired at the request of her family. Under the Kumari tradition, girls selected from Buddhist Newar families through a rigorous cultural process become the living goddesses.        
	The Kumaris are a major tourist attraction and are considered by many as incarnations of goddess Kali and are revered until they menstruate, after which they return to the family and a new one is chosen.        
	Nepals Supreme Court ordered the government last month to safeguard the Kumaris human rights after complains that the practice went against the child living a normal life.

	Santiago (Chile), April 10 (AP): Melting ice in southern Chile caused a glacial lake to swell and then empty suddenly, sending a tsunami rolling through a river, a scientist said today. No one was injured in the remote region.        
	Glacier scientist Gino Casassa said the melting of the Colonia glacier, which he blamed on rising world temperatures, filled the Cachet Lake and increased pressure on the ice sheet.        
	The water bored an 8-km tunnel through the glacier and finally emptied into the Baker river on April 6.        
	The remarkable thing is that the mass of water moved against the current of the river, Casassa told The Associated Press by telephone from the Centre for Scientific Studies in the southern city of Valdivia.         
	The lake was nearly full again by late yesterday, he said. Casassa said temperatures were unusually high during the recent Southern Hemisphere summer. This is a phenomenon that occurs periodically during the summer season, he said.

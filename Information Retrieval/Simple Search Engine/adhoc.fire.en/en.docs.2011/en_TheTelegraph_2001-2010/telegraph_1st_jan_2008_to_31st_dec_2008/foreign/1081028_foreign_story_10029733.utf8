                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Beer sales fall as crisis worsens
                            
	London, Oct. 27 (AP): Britons may be reeling from the international financial crisis, but few are crying into their beer.        
	Beer sales are falling as the economy worsens, defying predictions in some quarters that consumers would switch to drinking cheap supermarket booze at home even if they did shun more expensive pubs and bars.        
	The British Beer and Pub Association reported today that total beer sales fell about 7 per cent in the third quarter of this year  the equivalent of 161 million fewer pints (76 million litres) compared with the same period in 2007.        
	Sales of the iconic British pint in pubs have been in decline for years, leading to the closure of thousands of hostelries around the country.        
	But the associations Quarterly Beer Barometer reveals that the downturn has now broadened to supermarket sales, which have until now held up as grocers attracted consumers with packs of beer at lower cost. The decline in beer sales is a clear sign of a worsening economy, said Rob Hayward, the associations chief executive.

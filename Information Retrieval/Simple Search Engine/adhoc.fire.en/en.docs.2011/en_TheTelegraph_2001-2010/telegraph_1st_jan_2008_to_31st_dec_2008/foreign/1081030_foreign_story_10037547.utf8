                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       McCain admits to tensions with Palin
          TOBY HARDEN                          Sarah Palin and John McCain in Hershey, Pennsylvania. (AFP)                                  
	Washington, Oct. 29: Senator John McCain has admitted there have been tensions between him and running-mate Sarah Palin.         
	Speaking about the Republican campaign at a rally in Pennsylvania he said: When two mavericks join up, we dont agree on everything, but thats a lot of fun.        
	The presidential candidate gave one of his now trademark awkward grins as he made the remark standing in front of her at a joint appearance.        
	The comments followed days of proxy war carried out by aides through the media.        
	Accusations between McCain advisers and those close to Sarah Palin, the vice-presidential nominee, have become very heated.        
	A senior McCain adviser was quoted as describing Palin as a whack job. Others called her a diva and complained she had been going rogue. Palin has made clear she believes she was the victim of a botched roll out plan in which the McCain campaign initially kept her hidden from the media.        
	To the anger of senior McCain staff, she recently went off script to point out that she had not chosen the $150,000 (95,000) of designer clothes. She privately blames the Republican National Committee for damaging her down-to-earth image.        
	Though McCain has in the past talked about their public disagreements on issues such as drilling for oil and gas in the Alaska wilderness, there was no doubting that the comments in Pennsylvania referred to damaging acrimony in the campaign.

	London, July 1: Police in Manchester have issued CCTV footage in the hope of apprehending a serial bottom pincher.         
	The man, in his late twenties or early thirties, is thought to have pinched the bottoms of at least 24 women over a period of 18 months.        
	Most of the incidents took place in daylight in the Northern Quarter of the city.        
	Chief Inspector Joanne Rawlinson, of Greater Manchester Police, said: We have linked a man to at least one other incident. However, I will not rule out the possibility he is responsible for a number of others. I would appeal to the public to take a good hard look at this man and contact police if they know him.        
	The CCTV images show a man walking along Dale Street, Manchester, on May 13. A few moments later a 23-year-old woman had her bottom pinched. Police say their suspect is about 5feet 8inches tall, of medium build, with short dark hair.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Georgia calls ceasefire, Russia suspicious

	Tbilisi, Georgia, Aug. 10 (Reuters): Georgia called a ceasefire today and said it was pulling its embattled troops out of the disputed province of South Ossetia, submitting to Russias far superior firepower, but Moscow disputed the pullout claim.        
	International envoys headed in to try to end the fighting between Russia and its small US-allied neighbour that erupted last week in the Moscow-backed separatist region.        
	The reported retreat came after Russia expanded its bombing blitz, targeting the Georgian capitals airport area.        
	President Mikhail Saakashvili issued a ceasefire order, the foreign ministry said and the countrys security council head said troops had withdrawn from South Ossetia.        
	 But Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, in a telephone call with his Georgian counterpart Eka Tkeshelashvili late today, cited evidence that Georgian troops remained in and around the regional capital Tskhinvali, where the fighting has been the most brutal.        
	Georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the Russian Federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities, the foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that it had notified Russias envoy to Tbilisi.        
	Russia said it wanted Georgia to first pull its troops from South Ossetia and sign a pledge not to use force against the breakaway province. But Russias deputy foreign minister Grigory Karasin said that Moscow needed to verify the Georgian claims of withdrawal.        
	We must check all that. We dont trust the Georgian side, he said.        
	Georgia wouldnt say where its troops redeployed. The region is a patchwork of separatist -- and government-controlled areas.        
	The UN Security Council began talks for the fourth time in four days to try to resolve the situation.        
	Karasin said more than 2,000 people had been killed in South Ossetia since Friday, most of them Ossetians with Russian passports. The figures could not be independently confirmed.        
	 The respected Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy reported that two journalists had been killed in the conflict zone by South Ossetian separatists, citing a correspondent of Russian Newsweek magazine.        
	 Georgia, whose troops have been trained by American soldiers, began an offensive to regain control over South Ossetia overnight on Friday, launching heavy rocket and artillery fire and air strikes that pounded Tskhinvali.        
	 In response, Russia launched overwhelming artillery shelling and air attacks on Georgian troops. Russia also expanded its bombing blitz on Sunday against Georgia, targeting an aircraft-making plant on the outskirts of Tbilisi, the capital.        
	We heard a plane go over and then a big explosion, said Malkhaz Chachanidze, an artist who lives next to the factory. It woke us up, everything shook.

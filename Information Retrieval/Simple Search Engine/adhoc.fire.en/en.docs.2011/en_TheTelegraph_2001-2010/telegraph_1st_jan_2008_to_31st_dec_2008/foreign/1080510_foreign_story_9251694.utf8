	London, May 9: Hollywood actress Liv Tyler has split from her British husband, musician Royston Langdon, after five years. The couple have a three-year-old son, Milo.        
	The rumour-mill went into overdrive earlier this week when Tyler, 30, a star of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, attended the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala in New York without wearing her wedding ring.

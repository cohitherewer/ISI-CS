The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Even at Grammys, Obama is favourite
                                                                                                               Even at Grammys, Obama is favourite

	Washington, Feb. 11: At last nights Grammy Awards too, Barack Obama was the favourite.        
	The Democratic presidential aspirants second Grammy in the spoken word category for the audio version of his book, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, gave a political touch to the ceremonies at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.         
	The Grammy win rounded off a windfall weekend for Obama, who swept all the three state primaries and Virgin Islands on Saturday and won in Maine last night.         
	His main rival, former First Lady Hillary Clinton, replaced her campaign manager and reshuffled her team after Obamas unexpected weekend sweep.         
	Obamas Grammy win was much more than a psychological defeat for Hillary and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.         
	In the spoken word category this year, Obamas rival was the 42nd US President, whose book, Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World, was also nominated.         
	With three prestigious primaries in the national capital area tomorrow, it was cold comfort for the Clintons that it would have been the third Grammy for Bill if his audiobook had been the winner last night.         
	In 2003, Bill became the first person to have served as US President to receive the prestigious award for his role in an audio version of Peter and the Wolf .         
	Again in 2004 he was awarded a Grammy for My Life, his autobiography.         
	Obama received his first Grammy in 2005 for his book, Dreams From My Father. Hillary, whose main campaign theme in the primaries is her experience of 35 years in public life that contrasts Obamas thin resume, can, of course, claim that she won her Grammy long before Obama and her own husband.         
	Hillary won a Grammy in the same category in 1997, when she was First Lady for her book, It Takes a Village.         
	Another former President, Jimmy Carter, was the winner last year for his bestseller Our Endangered Values: Americas Moral Crisis.         
	Obama won last night over not one former President, but two. Carters collection of Bible lessons, Sunday Morning in Plains: Bringing Peace to a Changing World, was also nominated this year.         
	No Republican President, perhaps, unsurprisingly, has ever got a Grammy. For that matter, the last Republican to get the award, according to Grammy trivia, was a mere US Congressman from Obamas home state of Illinois, Everett Dirksen. That was exactly 40 years ago.         
	Hollywood and Americas entertainment industry in general, with rare exceptions, generally shuns the Republicans and their policies.         
	Five Grammys last year paved the way for a comeback by the Dixie Chicks, who were boycotted by country music radio outlets and many concert organisers and threatened after the trio criticised President George W. Bush while he was preparing to go to war against Iraq.         
	The group interpreted their Grammy sweep last year as a reassertion of freedom of speech in the US.         
	The political tone in last nights Grammys was unmistakable when presenter George Lopez referred to history in the making in the candidacies of Obama and Clinton.         
	Herbie Hancock, who won the Grammy for the best album this year, referred to Obamas campaign slogan, Yes we can, in terms of his own award.

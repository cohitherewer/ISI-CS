	Los Angeles, May 30: Nasas Phoenix Mars Lander has successfully started to move the robotic arm with which it will probe the Red Planets permafrost in search of the building blocks of life.         
	Mission controllers said that the un-stowing of the arm, which was delayed by a day due to a communication breakdown, had been successfully completed, despite initial concerns about a protective sheath still covering part of the limbs elbow joint.         
	The arm, which is central to the pioneering mission to investigate Mars polar plains, spent over nine months sealed up on the landers deck during its 422 million mile journey before being released from its two restraints and moved clear of the sheath.         
	The deployment was delayed a day after commands sent via the Mars Reconnaissance orbiter were not transmitted to the lander because of a radio glitch. The instructions were re-sent using Nasas Odyssey orbiter on Wednesday.         
	The next stage of testing, due to take place today after the lander receives fresh commands, involves raising the arm into an upright position. It is scheduled to start digging into the work space, the patch of land next to the lander beneath which scientists hope to find ice, some time next week.         
	Matt Robinson, the software engineer in charge of the robotic arm, said he was ecstatic to report the arm had been un-stowed. Its busted loose now. Were excited. Everybodys raring to go out and get samples.         
	The four-jointed, nearly 8ft long arm has a square scoop for digging into the floor of the valley on which the Phoenix touched down near the planets north pole. Over the next 90 sols, or Martian days, the arm will excavate a trench in the ground and carry samples into the landers onboard laboratory for analysis.         
	Scientists believe there is ice a few inches below the surface and want to find out if it was ever water and contains organic compounds needed to sustain basic life.         
	Since its arrival on Monday, the lander has also sent back images providing a complete panoramic view of its surroundings on the arctic plain.         
	Mission leaders had begun giving names to the rocks and depressions in the work space where the Phoenix will spend the next three months digging, said Peter Smith, the missions chief investigator.         
	Despite the radio glitch and early concerns about the sheath over the arm, Barry Goldstein, Phoenix project manager at Nasas Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said the mission was exceeding the most optimistic goals.         
	Even in our wildest dreams things could not have gone as well as they have. He said he expected some major scientific breakthroughs over the next three months.

	Moscow, Sept. 17: President Dmitry Medvedev said that Russia should unilaterally claim part of the Arctic, stepping up the race for the disputed energy-rich region.         
	We must finalise and adopt a federal law on the southern border of Russias Arctic zone, Medvedev told a meeting of the Security Council.        
	This is our responsibility, and simply our direct duty, to our descendants, he said. We must surely, and for the long-term future, secure Russias interests in the Arctic.        
	Global warming has stepped up the fight for the disputed Arctic, believed to be laden with vast reserves of oil and gas. Russia has pitted itself against Canada, Denmark, Norway and the US to fight for a greater part of the region, arguing that most of it is Russian territory since an underwater ridge links Siberia to the North Poles seabed.

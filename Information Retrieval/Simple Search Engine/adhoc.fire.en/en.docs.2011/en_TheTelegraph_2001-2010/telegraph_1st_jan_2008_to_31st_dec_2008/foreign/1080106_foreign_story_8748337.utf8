The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Globes face actor boycott
                                                                                                            Globes face actor boycott
                            
	Los Angeles, Jan. 5 (Reuters): The Screen Actors Guild yesterday said nearly all its members will refuse to cross striking writers picket lines at the coming Golden Globe Awards, throwing Hollywoods award season deeper into doubt.        
	Award nominees such as Julia Roberts and Johnny Depp would be key draws for audiences of the film and television honours on January 13, and could be nominated and appear for the worlds top film honours, the Oscars, in February. If they, or other A-list actors, fail to appear, industry watchers think the Golden Globes may not be aired.

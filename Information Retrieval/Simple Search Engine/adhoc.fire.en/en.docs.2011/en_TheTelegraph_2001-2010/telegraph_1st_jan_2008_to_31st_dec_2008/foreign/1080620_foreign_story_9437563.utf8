	Washington, June 19 (PTI): In a stern warning to Pakistan, the US said that any deal with militants that allows them a safe haven or to act with impunity will come back to haunt Islamabad first.        
	Weve made very clear to the Pakistani government that the extremists who operate in the North West Frontier Privince and the federal administered tribal areas are a threat to them and to us and to everybody on the globe, secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said in reply to a question at the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC.        
	Saying that US and Pakistan have a common goal in ensuring that militants are not allowed to operate in Pakistan areas, Rice said: After all, it was the forces of some of those people, some of those extremists, that killed Benazir Bhutto.        
	It is obviously the sovereign state of Pakistans right to handle this situation, but weve made very clear that we are concerned that any deal with the militants will come back, first and foremost, to haunt Pakistan, Rice said. It will haunt the rest of us too, but first and foremost, its going to haunt Pakistan, Rice said. The top US diplomats statement comes after 11 Pakistani soldiers were killed in a US strike in Pakistani territory.

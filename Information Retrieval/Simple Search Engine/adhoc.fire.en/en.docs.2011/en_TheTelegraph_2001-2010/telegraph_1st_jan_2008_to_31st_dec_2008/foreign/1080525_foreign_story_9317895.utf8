	Berlin, May 24 (Reuters): German police are investigating a couple after they offered their eight-month-old son for sale on Internet auction site eBay.        
	Renee Beck, a police spokesperson, said today the 23-year-old woman told them it was only a joke. But he said the police were continuing their investigation and the baby was put in state custody.

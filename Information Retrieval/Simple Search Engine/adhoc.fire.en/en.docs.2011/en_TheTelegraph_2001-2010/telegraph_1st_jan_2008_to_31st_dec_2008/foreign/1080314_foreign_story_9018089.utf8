The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | After 2 years on toilet seat, woman stuck
                                                                                                               After 2 years on toilet seat, woman stuck
                            
	Wichita (Kansas), March 13: An American womans body had became attached to her boyfriends toilet after she sat on it for two years, police in Kansas said.        
	She was not glued. She was not tied. She was just physically stuck by her body, said Bryan Whipple, the sheriff of Ness County. It appeared the 35-year-old womans skin had grown around the toilet seat, he added. It is hard to imagine.... I still have a hard time imagining it myself.        
	The woman initially refused emergency medical care but her boyfriend, 36, and police officers finally convinced her to go to hospital. We pried the toilet seat off with a pry bar and the seat went with her to the hospital, Whipple said.         
	The county attorney still has to decide whether any charges should be brought against the boyfriend.         
	The man told investigators that he brought his girlfriend food and water, and asked her every day to come out of the bathroom. And her reply would be: Maybe tomorrow, Whipple said. According to him, she did not want to leave the bathroom.

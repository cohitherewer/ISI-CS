	Los Angeles, Feb. 2 (Reuters): A Los Angeles court yesterday placed the affairs of troubled pop singer Britney Spears under the temporary control of her father while she remains hospitalised under psychiatric care.
    
	Superior court public information officer Allan Parachini said the temporary conservatorship was in place until Monday afternoon, at which time a new hearing will take place. He said the court also issued a civil harassment restraining order against Spearss manager, Sam Lutfi.
    
	The conservatorship cedes control over the singers liquid assets, including her home, to Jamie Spears, who petitioned the court for control in an emergency hearing yesterday. Attorney Andrew Wallete shares conservator duties with Spearss father.
    
	With the court order, Jamie Spears now has the ability to supersede any other powers-of-attorney that may have been issued by the singer, cancel contracts she may have signed and bar people from visiting her in the Los Angeles area hospital.

          CAROLINE GAMMELL                           A picture of The Nancy                                  
	London, Sept. 18: A shipwreck which has eluded treasure hunters for more than 200 years has been found, two divers have claimed.         
	The loss of the ship was all the more tragic because on board was Ann Cargill, a famous 18th century opera singer who was returning from India with her illegitimate child. Her body  still clutching the baby  was recovered and then buried, but the wreck of the The Nancy was never traced. A total of 49 people were on board the London-bound vessel when it got into difficulty during a violent storm. It was thought she broke up as she sank.        
	Numerous expeditions searched for the wreckage in vain, but two Scilly Isles residents, Todd Stevens and Ed Cumming, said they had been looking in the wrong place. Cumming, 62, said a record of the event had confused the ship with its lifeboat: It had been written that they were driven onto Rosevear Island by the stormy sea and most people took it that meant The Nancy.         
	We realised that after the ship had hit the rocks, the passengers had got into a smaller boat and that was the one that was driven onto Rosevear. So people were looking in the wrong place for The Nancy, they should have been looking further out. Stevens, 46, who moved to the Isles of Scilly 10 years ago, said they had discovered a number of wrecks while searching for The Nancy.        
	Cargill, who made her name in Covent Garden and Drury Lane, was known for her colourful romantic life and eloped several times before heading to India to be with her latest love who was stationed in Calcutta with the British East India Company in 1783. By now a wealthy woman, she was sent home by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, who said an actress should not be defiling the pure shores of India. On her death, she was said to be worth 200,000. It is one of the best stories I have ever told, said Cumming. It has everything, a beautiful actress, a tragic shipwreck and a lost fortune.

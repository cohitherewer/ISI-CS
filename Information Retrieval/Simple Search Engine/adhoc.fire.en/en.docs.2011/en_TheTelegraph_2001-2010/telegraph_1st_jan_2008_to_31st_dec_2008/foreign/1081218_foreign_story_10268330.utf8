                              Zaidi: Arab symbol                            
	Cairo, Dec. 17 (Reuters): An Egyptian man said today that he was offering his 20-year-old daughter in marriage to Iraqi journalist Muntazer al-Zaidi, who threw his shoes at President George W. Bush in Baghdad on Sunday,        
	The daughter, Amal Saad Gumaa, said she agreed with the idea. This is something that would honour me. I would like to live in Iraq, especially if I were attached to this hero, she told Reuters by telephone.        
	Her father, Saad Gumaa, said he had called Dergham, Zaidis brother, to tell him of the offer. I find nothing more valuable than my daughter to offer to him, and I am prepared to provide her with everything needed for marriage, he added.        
	Zaidis gesture has struck a chord across the Arab world, where President Bush is widely despised for invading Iraq in 2003 and for his support for Israel. Amal is a student in the media faculty at Minya University in central Egypt.

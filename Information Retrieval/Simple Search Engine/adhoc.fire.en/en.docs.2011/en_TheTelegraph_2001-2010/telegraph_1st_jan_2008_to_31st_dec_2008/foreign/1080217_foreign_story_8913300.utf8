The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bangla cull of infected chickens begins
                                                                                                               Bangla cull of infected chickens begins
                            
	Dhaka, Feb. 16 (Reuters): Veterinary workers have started culling some 150,000 chickens infected with bird flu in Dhaka today, officials said        
	The culling of a huge number of chickens has just started and it may take until tomorrow afternoon to complete the task, a livestock department official said.        
	Officials said bird flu has spread to 42 out of 64 districts since it was first detected in the Dhaka region last March.        
	The H5N1 virus was quickly brought under control through aggressive measures, including culling, before re-emerging in January.         
	The government has raised compensation for poultry farmers to encourage the farmers to report and kill sick birds to help to stamp out the outbreak.        
	As of yesterday, more than 600,000 birds have been culled in Bangladesh since March 2007. No human infections have been reported so far but the virus has spread across nearly two thirds of the country of more than 140 million people.        
	Experts fear the H5N1 strain could mutate or combine with the highly contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark a pandemic, especially in countries such as Bangladesh where people live in close proximity to poultry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Paul had secret heart surgery in 2006
                                                                                                            Paul had secret heart surgery in 2006
                              Serious but routine operation                            
	London, Jan. 2: Sir Paul McCartney underwent heart surgery last year, it has emerged.        
	The former Beatle, 65, had coronary angioplasty to open up arteries in his heart and increase blood flow.         
	The serious but very routine operation followed a stressful year for Sir Paul, during which he was engaged in a bitter divorce battle with Heather Mills. The pair are yet to reach a settlement.         
	Sir Paul opted for the surgery after consulting a Harley Street specialist at the London Clinic, according to a report in The Sun.         
	He recovered quickly and was well enough to perform with Kylie Minogue on Jools Hollands BBC2 New Year special. He also made a surprise visit to entertain the children at Great Ormond Street Hospital in December.        
	Coronary angioplasty is performed by passing a small tube through the groin and up into the aorta.         
	A small balloon on the end of the tube is then inflated, squashing fatty deposits and allowing more blood to pass through.        
	David Beckhams father Ted underwent a similar procedure after he suffered a heart attack.         
	A spokesman for Sir Paul confirmed the operation took place during the autumn.        
	About 40,000 angioplasty ops are done each year in the UK because its a very good way of treating severe angina symptoms and the success rate is 90 per cent.        
	 The Sun quoted a source as saying: It was all very routine, but any work on your heart is a big deal.        
	McCartney is listed in Guinness World Records as the most successful musician and composer in popular music history, with 60 gold discs and sales of 100 million singles.        
	His song Yesterday with The Beatles is listed as the most covered song in history and has been played more than 7,000,000 times on American television and radio.

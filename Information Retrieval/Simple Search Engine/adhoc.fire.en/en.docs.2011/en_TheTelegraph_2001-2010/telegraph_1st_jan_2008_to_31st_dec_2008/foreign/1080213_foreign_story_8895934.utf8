The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Napoleon was not poisoned, say scientists
                                                                                                               Napoleon was not poisoned, say scientists
                              Arsenic amp; Emperor                            
	Rome, Feb. 12 (Reuters): Italian scientists say they have proved Napoleon was not poisoned, scotching the legend that the French emperor was murdered by his British jailors.        
	Napoleons post-mortem said he died of stomach cancer aged 51. However, the theory that he was assassinated to prevent any return to power has gained credence in recent decades as some studies indicated his body contained a high level of the poison arsenic.        
	It was not arsenic poisoning that killed Napoleon at Saint Helena, said researchers at the National Institute of Nuclear Physics and the University of Pavia who tested the theory the British killed him while he was in exile on the south Atlantic island in 1821.        
	The Italian research  which studied hair samples from various moments in his life which are kept in museums in Italy and France  showed Napoleons body did have a high level of arsenic, but that he was already heavily contaminated as a boy.        
	The scientists used a nuclear reactor to irradiate the hairs to get an accurate measure of the levels of arsenic.         
	Looking at hairs from several of Napoleons contemporaries, including his wife and son, they found arsenic levels were generally much higher than is common today.        
	The result? There was no poisoning in our opinion because Napoleons hairs contain the same amount of arsenic as his contemporaries, the researchers said in a statement published on the universitys website.        
	The study found the samples taken from people living in the early 1800s contained 100 times as much arsenic than the current average. Glues and dyes commonly used at the time are blamed for high environmental levels of the toxic element.

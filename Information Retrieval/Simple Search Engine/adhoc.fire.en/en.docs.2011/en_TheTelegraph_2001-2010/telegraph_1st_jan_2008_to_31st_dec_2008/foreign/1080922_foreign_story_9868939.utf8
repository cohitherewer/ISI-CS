	Papal relief    
	 Rome, Sept. 21 (Reuters): An Italian political satirist who said Pope Benedict would be punished in hell for the churchs treatment of homosexuals was spared possible prosecution recently when the government blocked an investigation against her.      
	A Rome prosecutor suspected Sabina Guzzantis comments broke a law protecting the honour and dignity of the leader of 1.1 billion Roman Catholics under a 1929 Italian treaty with the Vatican. But the treaty, signed by fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, required government approval before the investigation could go forward. Justice minister Angelino Alfano decided to block it. I decided not to authorise it, knowing well the stature and capacity of the Pope for forgiveness, Alfano said.    
	Michael rap    
	 London: Pop star George Michael has been cautioned by police after being arrested from a public toilet for possessing drugs, reports The Sunday Telegraph. Reports say the singer was arrested after a tip-off from a toilet attendant after he was seen loitering in underground loos in Londons Hampstead Heath on Friday. When officers arrived, Michael was still in the toilet and the police found him in possession of cannabis and crack cocaine.

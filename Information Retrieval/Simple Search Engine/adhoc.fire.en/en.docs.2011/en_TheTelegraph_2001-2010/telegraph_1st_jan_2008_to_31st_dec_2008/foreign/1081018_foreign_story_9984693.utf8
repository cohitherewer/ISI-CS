	Paris, Oct. 17 (Reuters): The Eiffel Tower is cutting down on its display of sparkling lights to set an example of energy saving, its management said today.        
	The Eiffel Tower has twinkled for 10 minutes every hour on the hour during the evening since January 2000.        
	Now, to reinforce the message that energy must be saved for environmental reasons, the tower will sparkle for just five minutes every hour.        
	The towers managers said the measure was mostly symbolic, as the 20,000 flashing light bulbs that produce the twinkling effect consume relatively little energy.        
	The 300-metre (984-foot) tower is Frances most recognisable monument. It has become a popular activity for tourists to gather during the evening on bridges and squares to watch the spectacle.

	Personal Beyonce    
	 Los Angeles, Sept. 9 (Reuters): Singer Beyonce will release her third solo album in the US on November 18, her Columbia Records label said yesterday.      
	The as-yet-untitled album marks the follow-up to her 2006 disc BDay, which opened at number one on the US pop chart in September 2006. Her first album apart from Destinys Child, the 2003 release Dangerously in Love, also went to number one.      
	Columbia said the new album was Beyonces most personal, reflective and revelatory collection to-date, and noted that she co-wrote and co-produced all the songs. Two tracks from the album, If I Were A Boy and Single Ladies, will be sent to radio on October 7.    
	Bald speed    
	 Wellington (Reuters): New Zealands national airline is planning to give the bald facts on plans to speed up check-in queues for passengers  literally. Air New Zealand said on Tuesday it is looking for 50 people willing to be a cranial billboard with a message temporarily tatooed on their shaved heads for two weeks advertising new speedy check-in services. The airline said it will pay $666 per head, making it easy money for bald-headed frequent fliers.

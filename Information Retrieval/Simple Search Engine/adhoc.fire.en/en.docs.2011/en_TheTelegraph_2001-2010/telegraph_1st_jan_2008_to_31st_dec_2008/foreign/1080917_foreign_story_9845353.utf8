          TOBY HARNDEN                          Hillary and Obama in Cleveland, Ohio. (AP)                                  
	Akron (Ohio), Sept. 16: Many of Hillary Clintons loyal supporters are still ignoring her exhortations to vote for her former rival and the Democratic party candidate Barack Obama in Novembers presidential election.         
	More than 1,600 Ohioans braved sweltering heat in Akron, a former rubber boom town fallen on hard times, to hear the former First Lady urge voters to support Obama.        
	The New York senator was unstinting in her support for the Democratic nominee. Barack and I may have started out on two separate paths, but we are on one pathway now, and with your help this journey will lead straight to the White House, she said.         
	But the response to her remarks about him was relatively muted. Unusually for a political rally, no signs were allowed, meaning that placards declaring Hillary for President and Hillary in 2012 had to be left outside at the behest of Obama campaign staff.        
	I still managed to get my Hillary T-shirt in here, said Marie Donnell, 47. I waved it when she spoke and she signed it for me. Shes still my candidate, my go-to girl. Im just not sure about Obama and he hasnt treated Hillary well.        
	I dont want to appear racist and its nothing personal but I just dont know who he is. He seems kind of snobbish. I work at McDonalds and theyre not too bright there so a lot wont vote for him because his name sounds like Osama bin Laden.

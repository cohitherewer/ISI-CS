The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iraqi died in custody: UK
                                                                                                               Iraqi died in custody: UK
  - Acts of abuse carried out by troops, says minister        AMIT ROY              before            (Top) Baha Mousa in happier times and (below) before he died in British custody in Basra, Iraq       after                                            
	London, March 28: The pictures show Baha Mousa, in happier times with his son, and later after the 26-year-old Iraqi hotel receptionist had been taken into custody by British forces in Basra.        
	A post-mortem examination found that Mousa suffered multiple injuries (at least 93), including fractured ribs and a broken nose, which were in part the cause of his death.        
	The second photograph, taken shortly before he died, is providing powerful ammunition to outraged Britons who question the whole basis of the Anglo-American military invasion of Iraq on March 20, 2003.        
	But other Britons find it equally outrageous that the families of Mousa and eight other Iraqis who were also taken into British custody around September 14, 2003, should be able to move court in London against the very country whose service personnel  176 to date  have died in toppling Saddam Hussein and bringing democracy to Iraq.        
	But now the British government has, more or less, admitted that Mousa was beaten to death in custody. Had it been Kashmir or Punjab, Mousa would simply have been encountered. But confronted with mounting evidence, the UK government has decided to admit breaching the human rights of Baha Mousa who died while in British custody in Basra.        
	Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said (in a reference to the black youth of 18 who was murdered by a white gang in London in 1993): Baha Mousa is the Stephen Lawrence of Iraq. A direct legal and moral consequence of todays admission that Mousa and others were unlawfully tortured and killed in British custody is that there must be a wholesale independent inquiry into what went wrong.        
	The Americans have refused to keep a body count of Iraqi casualties, though their number is put anywhere between 100,000 and 1 million. American dead has just reached 4,000.         
	In a Commons written statement, British defence secretary Des Browne said that the ministry of defence will admit breaching the rights of eight other Iraqi men who have brought a civil case in the British courts.         
	Yesterdays announcement opens the door to unlimited compensation payouts to Mousas family and to the eight others. Browne said that in relation to the claim by Mousas family, the government would admit substantive breaches of parts of the European Convention on Human Rights which protect the right to life and prohibit torture.        
	Armed forces minister Bob Ainsworth acknowledged acts of abuse had been carried out by a very small minority of British troops. I deeply regret the actions of a very small number of troops and I offer my sincere apologies and sympathy to the family of Baha Mousa and the other eight Iraqi detainees.        
	 He added: All but a handful of the over 120,000 British troops who have served in Iraq have conducted themselves to the highest standards of behaviour, displaying integrity and selfless commitment. But this does not excuse that during 2003 and 2004 a very small minority committed acts of abuse and we condemn their actions.         
	Mousa was detained under suspicion of being an insurgent. Seven members of the Queens Lancashire Regiment (QLR), which is now the Duke of Lancasters Regiment, faced the most expensive court martial in British history over the case, but all were eventually acquitted.         
	The case took more than three years of investigation and cost over 20 million.        
	Mousas father Daoud, a colonel in the Iraqi police force, said: This confession of guilt is a victory for us. Now I can feel that my sons blood wasnt totally lost in vain.        
	Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Nick Harvey commented: This is a not a good day for the reputation of Britain in Iraq and the wider world. These admissions from the MoD are of such a serious nature that there must be a full and independent inquiry into how such behaviour came about. These cases represent only a tiny minority of our otherwise exemplary armed forces personnel, but torture and abuse of any kind is utterly inexcusable and cannot go unpunished or unexamined.

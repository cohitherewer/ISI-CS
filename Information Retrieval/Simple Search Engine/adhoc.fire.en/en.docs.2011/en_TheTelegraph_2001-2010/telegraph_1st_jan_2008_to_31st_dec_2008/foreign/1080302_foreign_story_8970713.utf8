The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tired? Exercise
                                                                                                               Tired? Exercise
                            
	Washington, March 1 (Reuters): Couch potatoes who complain they are tired all the time have an easy solution  a little light exercise.        
	Regular, low-intensity workouts such as a leisurely stroll can boost energy levels by 20 percent and decrease fatigue by 65 percent, a team at the University of Georgia found. Too often we believe that a quick workout will leave us worn out, especially when we are already feeling fatigued, Tim Puetz, who helped conduct the study, said. However, we have shown that regular exercise can actually go a long way in increasing feelings of energy, particularly in sedentary individuals.        
	Puetz and a team led by Patrick Connor at the universitys Exercise Psychology Laboratory studied 36 people who said they were always fatigued. To their surprise, the researchers found the low-intensity group reported better reduction in fatigue than those who worked out harder.

               Sarkozy and Bruni
              
	Paris, Jan. 6 (Reuters): French President Nicolas Sarkozy could marry Italian singer and former model Carla Bruni early next month, a French newspaper reported today, citing unnamed sources.
    
	In a report widely picked up on French radio and TV, the weekly Journal du Dimanche said Sarkozy had given Bruni a diamond engagement ring and received a Patek Philippe watch in exchange.
    
	They are getting married! February 9? the newspaper said in a front-page headline over a photograph of Sarkozy and Bruni at the ancient site of Petra in Jordan.
    
	It said the date of a wedding had been set for Friday, February 8 or more probably Saturday, February 9.
    
	Sarkozys office declined to comment.
    
	The couple met at a party in November, weeks after Sarkozy divorced his second wife Cecilia.
    
	The report coincided with the release of an opinion poll in the daily Le Parisien, showing a 7-point drop in Sarkozys approval ratings, mainly due to mounting concerns over the economy but in part as well because of his private life.
    
	Stephane Rozes, director general of the institute that carried out the survey, said older voters in particular appeared to have been turned off by the coverage of Sarkozys private life.

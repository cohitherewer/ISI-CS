          MICHAEL LUO AND GRIFF PALMER                          Obama: Serious questions                                  
	New York, Oct. 10: Last December, someone using the name Test Person, from Some Place, UT, made a series of contributions, the largest being $764, to Senator Barack Obamas presidential campaign totalling $2,410.07.        
	Someone identifying himself as Jockim Alberton, from 1581 Leroy Avenue in Wilmington, Delaware, began giving to Obama last November, contributing $10 and $25 at a time for a total of $445 till the end of February.         
	The only problem? There is no Leroy Avenue in Wilmington. And Jockim Alberton, who listed his employer and occupation as Fdsa Fdsa, does not show up in a search of public records.        
	An analysis of campaign finance records by The New York Times this week found nearly 3,000 donations to Obama, the Democratic nominee, from more than a dozen people with apparently fictitious donor information. The contributions represent a tiny fraction of the record $450 million Obama has raised. But the questionable donations  some donors were listed simply with gibberish for their names  raise concerns about whether the Obama campaign is adequately vetting its unprecedented flood of donors.        
	It is unclear why someone making a political donation would want to enter a false name. Some perhaps did it for privacy reasons. Another, more ominous possibility, of course, is fraud, perhaps in order to donate beyond the maximum limits.        
	There is no evidence that questionable contributions amount to anything more than a small portion of Obamas fund-raising haul.        
	 The Timess analysis, conducted over a few days and looking for obvious anomalies, like names or addresses with all consonants, identified about $40,000 in suspect contributions that had not been refunded by the campaign as of its last filing with the Federal Election Commission in September.         
	It appears that campaign finance records for Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, contain far fewer obviously false names, although he has taken in about $200 million in contributions, less than half Obamas total. McCain did collect about $173,000 from donors who appear in campaign finance records with only a name and have no other identifying information. Obama collected about $314,000 from such donors.

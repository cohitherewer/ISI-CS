                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Daniel reveals he cant tie shoelaces
          CHRIS IRVINE                           Radcliffe                                  
	London, Aug. 17: Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe has revealed he suffers from dyspraxia, meaning he sometimes still has trouble tying his shoelaces.         
	The 19-year-old admitted he was a sufferer in an interview to mark his Broadway debut in the play Equus.        
	Dyspraxia is a common neurological problem that impairs the organisation of movement, often with no obvious cause.        
	Up to 10 per cent of people in Britain show signs of the condition, with about 2 per cent severely affected  males four times more likely to be affected than females.        
	It can affect any or all areas of development, including intellectual, physical and language, possibly impairing someones normal learning process.        
	Although Radcliffes is understood to be a mild form of the disorder, severe cases can make it difficult to walk up and down stairs or kick a ball.        
	The star revealed he became an actor partly because his dyspraxia meant he was not successful at school.        
	He said his mother allowed him to audition for a BBC version of David Copperfield, as a means of boosting his confidence.        
	Radcliffes spokesperson said: Yes, Dan Radcliffe does have dyspraxia. This is something he has never hidden. Thankfully his condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to tie his shoe laces and bad handwriting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama under fire for middle-class slur
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Obama under fire for middle-class slur
                              Elitist stamp                            
	Indianapolis, April 12 (Reuters): US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama came under fire today for saying that small-town Pennsylvania residents were bitter and cling to guns or religion, in comments that his rivals said showed an elitist view of the middle class.        
	Obamas Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain both pounced on the comments that Obama made last weekend at a fundraiser in San Francisco.        
	Video of the fundraiser, which was closed to the press, surfaced as Obama was campaigning in Indiana, trying to highlight issues of concern to working-class voters, such as job losses and rising mortgage foreclosures.        
	You go into some of these small towns in Pennsylvania, and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them, Obama, an Illinois senator, said. And its not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations, he said.         
	Clinton said in Philadelphia that the comments showed Obama looks down on voters in Pennsylvania, which holds a nominating contest on April 22.        
	Pennsylvania doesnt need a President who looks down on them, she told a rally. They need a President who stands up for them, who fights for them, who works hard for your futures, your jobs, your families.        
	An aide to McCain, who will run against either Obama or Clinton in November, called the fundraiser comments remarkable and extremely revealing. It shows an elitism and condescension toward hard-working Americans that is nothing short of breathtaking, Steve Schmidt, an adviser to the Arizona senator said.

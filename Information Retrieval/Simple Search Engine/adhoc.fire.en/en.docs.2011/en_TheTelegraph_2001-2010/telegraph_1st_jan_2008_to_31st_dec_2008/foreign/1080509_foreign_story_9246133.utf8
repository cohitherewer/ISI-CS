	Washington, May 8: Now facing almost insurmountable odds, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton came under fresh pressure yesterday to end her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination against Senator Barack Obama.        
	However, she vowed to remain in the race until there is a nominee.        
	Clintons narrow win in Indiana late on Tuesday provided none of the boost that her campaign advisers had anticipated. Her small margin, coupled with Obamas runaway victory in the North Carolina primary, shifted the dynamics of the Democratic race dramatically and sharply against her overnight.        
	In a conference call with reporters, campaign officials offered as upbeat an assessment of the contest as they could muster. Asked whether Clinton had discussed dropping out, senior adviser Howard Wolfson flatly told reporters: No. In her conversations with advisers yesterday, they said, Clinton talked about looking ahead to the next campaign, in West Virginia.        
	Her feeling is shes made a commitment to let the people in the remaining states have their chance to express their voice, and shell move forward with that part of the campaign in a way that will both make the case for her but also be constructive for the Democratic Party, said Geoff Garin, a top strategist in the campaign.        
	Another Clinton adviser said that there is at best a 10 per cent chance that she will end her candidacy before the last primaries, on June 3.

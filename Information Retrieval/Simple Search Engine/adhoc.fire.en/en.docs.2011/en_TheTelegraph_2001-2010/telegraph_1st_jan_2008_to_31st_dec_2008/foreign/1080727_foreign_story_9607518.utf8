The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | California ban on trans fats 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       California ban on trans fats

	Washington, July 26: California became the first state in the country to ban artery-clogging trans fats yesterday when Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law a measure to phase them out in restaurants beginning in 2010 and from baked goods by 2011.        
	California is a leader in promoting health and nutrition, and I am pleased to continue that tradition by being the first state in the nation to phase out trans fats, Schwarzenegger said.        
	Trans fatty acids, or trans fats, are commonly found in partially hydrogenated oils, which became popular at fast-food restaurants and bakeries because they have a longer shelf life than other oils.        
	But a series of studies over the past decade has shown that trans fats can lower good cholesterol (high-density lipoproteins or HDL) and raise bad cholesterol (low-density lipoproteins or LDL), which can contribute to heart disease and other ailments.        
	Researchers at the Harvard University School of Public Health estimate that artificial trans fats cause 50,000 premature heart-attack deaths every year.        
	Violators of the California law will incur fines of $25 to $1,000. Food sold in manufacturer-sealed packaging will be exempt. Trans fat is generally recognised as the single most harmful fat in the food supply on a gram-per-gram basis, said Michael Jacobson, executive director of Centre for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based health advocacy group that has called for trans fat labelling since the 1990s. This is a historic day.        
	California, the countrys most populous state, has long been a trendsetter for health and nutrition issues, and similar bills are pending in more than a dozen other states. Trans fat bans already are on the books in a number of cities and counties, including Montgomery county, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York city. Montgomery countys ban on trans fats in oils, shortening and margarines used for frying took effect on January 1, 2008. On January 1, 2009, it expands to include all other foods, as well as oils and shortenings used for deep frying.        
	Public health advocates hope that the California ban will encourage national and regional chain restaurants to alter their recipes elsewhere. Though the Cheesecake Factory, Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonalds, Taco Bell and Wendys have begun to move away from trans fats, other chains, including Burger King, continue to use partially hydrogenated oil in their restaurants.        
	The California Restaurant Association fought hard against the bill, arguing that the federal government, not individual states, should develop regulations on trans fat use. But, association spokesman Daniel Conway said yesterday: Were confident that our members can meet the mandate because many of them are already voluntarily phasing out the use of trans fats.        
	Opponents also argued that it was not clear if substitutes for trans fats would be any better for public health, but CSPIs Jacobson said: All the evidence shows is that trans fats are the most harmful. You can substitute anything in their place, and it will be an improvement.        
	I think the potential here is real for a far greater understanding of the harms of trans fats, and to encourage more states to do the same, Dr Clyde Yancy, incoming president of the American Heart Association, said of the California laws enactment.        
	He said a 2 per cent increase in transfat intake could result over time in a 25 per cent increase in the likelihood of developing coronary artery disease.

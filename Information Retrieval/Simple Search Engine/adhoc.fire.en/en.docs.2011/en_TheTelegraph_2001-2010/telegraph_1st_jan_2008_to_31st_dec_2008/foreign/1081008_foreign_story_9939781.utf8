                              Some of the 13 full-size elderly figures, vaguely suggestive of former world leaders, which battle it out in wheelchairs that move randomly, colliding and then retreating, which is part of an art piece entitled Old Persons Home by Beijing-based artists Sun Yuan and Peng Yu, are seen at the newly unveiled Saatchi Gallery in London.

	London, Oct. 7 (Reuters): Influential British art collector Charles Saatchi is back after three years out of the limelight, opening a major new gallery in central London showcasing some of Chinas hottest artists.        
	The man who introduced the world to Britart stalwarts like Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin has been largely absent from the art scene since his gallery was forced out of its previous home on the Thames in 2005.        
	Now he is back with a huge new exhibition space in upmarket Chelsea, where he hopes free entry to the imposing former headquarters of the Duke of York will attract passersby.        
	Critics have lauded the imposing three-storey building with its glass and white-walled interior, and welcomed back one of contemporary arts biggest players. But the inaugural show, opening on Thursday, has earned mixed reviews.        
	The Revolution Continues: New Art from China is dedicated to Chinese artists including established stars like Yue Minjun, Zhang Xiaogang and Zeng Fanzhi, whose painting fetched $9.7 million in May, a record for Asian contemporary artwork.        
	Some critics have categorised the crazed, laughing men of Yue or the grey, stylised portraits of Zhang as repetitive, even mass production art.        
	Generally more popular were the sculptures, particularly an installation piece called Old Persons Home by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu, involving 13 ageing men on wheelchairs moving randomly around a large basement room.        
	Their striking resemblance to late world leaders turns the work into a commentary on the pitfalls of power and conflict. The gallery calls it a grizzly parody of the UN dead.        
	But the gallerys head of development, Rebecca Wilson, said Saatchis target audience was less the experts  critics, collectors and curators  and more the general public, most of whom are unfamiliar with contemporary Chinese art.        
	There was a feeling that all of these artists were suddenly emerging from China, doing very well at auction, there were the Beijing Olympics coming up, she told Reuters.        
	There was this kind of convergence of interest in China, so we felt it should be the exhibition that we open with. Early next year the Saatchi Gallery will put on a show dedicated to contemporary West Asian art, including from Iran and Iraq, by artists never seen in Britain before.        
	None of those artists have been seen in this country before and will be very little known elsewhere in the world as well, said Wilson.        
	I think Charles has been searching for months to try to find interesting works.        
	Saatchi sells some art after an exhibition ends, partly to fund his enterprise.

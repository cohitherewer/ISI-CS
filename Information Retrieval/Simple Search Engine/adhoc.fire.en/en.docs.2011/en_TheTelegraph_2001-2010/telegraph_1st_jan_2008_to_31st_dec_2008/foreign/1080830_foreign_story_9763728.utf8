	Lucky toddler    
	 London, Aug. 29: An 18-month old baby has his disposable nappy to thank for saving his life, when it broke his fall from a third-floor apartment window, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Caua Felipe Massaneiro survived the 10-metre fall because his nappy got caught on a security spike embedded in the concrete wall around his apartment building in the northeastern Brazilian city of Recife, officials said yesterday.      
	For a moment the boy dangled precariously from the spike, then the diaper opened and the baby fell to the ground, but at a much slower speed, a police officer said. The diaper obviously lessened the impact of the fall and saved the babys life.      
	It was a miracle, said the officer who declined to be identified. He could also have been killed by one of the spikes.      
	The toddler did not suffer any serious injuries although he remained in hospital being treated for minor fractures.      
	 Police have opened an investigation to determine how the toddler fell out the window and if parental negligence was one of the causes, police said.

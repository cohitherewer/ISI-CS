The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Saddam role not revenge: Actor
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Saddam role not revenge: Actor
                        Israeli actor Igal Naor as Saddam Hussein in the BBC/HBO TV series House of Saddam. (Reuters)                          
	London, July 28 (Reuters): The Israeli actor playing Saddam Hussein in a new television series once narrowly escaped a missile fired by the late dictators army.        
	But for Igal Naor, taking the lead role in House of Saddam, the BBC/HBO dramatisation of Saddams 24-year rule airing in Britain from Wednesday, it was not about revenge.        
	Instead, the 50-year-old from near Tel Aviv believes his experience of the conflicts and complexities of West Asia, and his childhood effectively raised as an Arab in Israel after his family left Baghdad, gave him the edge over other actors.        
	In the street everyone spoke Iraqi. It was a little Baghdad around Tel Aviv, he said of the neighbourhood where he grew up that was dominated by Iraqi Jews who left Baghdad after Israels founding 60 years ago. I could understand much better than, say, a British actor or an American actor about what this man is and the environment he was living in, Naor told Reuters by telephone.        
	This is my area, West Asia, Iraq. I can understand things like the special need for honour, pride. I live in an environment of war and blood.        
	He recalled how a missile fired by Iraq at Israel in 1991, during the first Gulf War triggered by Saddams invasion of Kuwait, landed close by. As an Israeli, he was an enemy, Naor explained.In 1991, a missile he sent to Tel Aviv fell 50 metres from my house with one tonne of explosives. Luckily nothing happened to us.                  Saddam: New view      
	Nevertheless, he added: I didnt love him or hate him.        
	Naor, who has appeared in Hollywood movies Munich and Rendition, rejected the idea that casting an Israeli as Saddam should be seen as controversial. We are actors, we are artists. Why should we be Israelis, Lebanese or Egyptian?        
	Although he encountered no negative feedback at home, there was a backlash against him, and more particularly his co-star Amr Waked, in Wakeds native Egypt, he added.        
	The four-part House of Saddam, co-funded by BBC and HBO of the US, tells the story of Saddams reign from 1979, when he took over the leadership to his capture by US forces from an underground hideout at the end of 2003. Co-writer and director Alex Holmess aim was to help viewers understand the man demonised in the west for his invasion of Kuwait, defiance of diplomacy and ruthless leadership.        
	What I am hoping for is a bit of understanding, which is slightly different from sympathy, Holmes said.

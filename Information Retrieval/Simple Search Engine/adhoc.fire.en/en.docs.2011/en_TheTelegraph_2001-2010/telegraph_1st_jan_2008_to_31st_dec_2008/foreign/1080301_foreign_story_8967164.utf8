The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hillary: I can always get job in a diner
                                                                                                               Hillary: I can always get job in a diner
          ALEX SPILLIUS                              
	Rio Grande (Ohio), Feb. 29: Hillary Clinton joked yesterday that if her bid for the White House failed she could always work in a diner.        
	The former First Lady may have been speaking in jest, but her remarks betray an awareness that she may lose one of the potentially decisive primary elections in Ohio and Texas next Tuesday.        
	During a campaign stop at the Bob Evans restaurant in Rio Grande, Ohio, Clinton shook hands with kitchen staff and then stood behind the counter to pose for pictures. I am just going to take a few orders here, she smiled, adding: In case this other endeavour doesnt work out I can come back to Bob Evans.        
	Diana Lemaster, a waitress photographed with Clinton, said: She would be welcome working here any time.

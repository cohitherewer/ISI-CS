	Seattle, April 12 (Reuters): The Dalai Lama said yesterday that he did not support a boycott of the Beijing Olympic Games.        
	Asked on NBC Nightly News whether he wanted the world to boycott the Olympics this summer, the Dalai Lama replied: No. Asked if he wanted the US and other world leaders to boycott the opening ceremony in support of Tibet, he replied: Thats up to them. It is very important to make clear, not only just the Tibet case. But in China proper, the report of human right is poor. And their freedom, also very poor, he said.

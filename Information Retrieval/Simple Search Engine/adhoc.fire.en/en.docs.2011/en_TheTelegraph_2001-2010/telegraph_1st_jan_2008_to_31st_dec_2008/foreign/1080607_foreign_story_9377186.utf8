          LAURA CLOUT                               
	London, June 6: A school has banned Red Bull after staff reported a rise in bad behaviour by students who had consumed the high-energy drink.         
	Teachers at Chatsmore Catholic High School in Worthing, west Sussex, said there had been a noticeable increase in inappropriate behaviour by pupils.         
	Acting head Anne Ward said Red Bull and the Tesco-branded Kick high-energy drinks had now been banned from its grounds. She said: We found that a small number of childrens behaviour was less appropriate after they had been drinking these drinks.        
	We were becoming increasingly concerned about the level of inappropriate behaviour. If they want to drink these drinks outside school then that is an issue for their parents, but we would rather they didnt while at school.

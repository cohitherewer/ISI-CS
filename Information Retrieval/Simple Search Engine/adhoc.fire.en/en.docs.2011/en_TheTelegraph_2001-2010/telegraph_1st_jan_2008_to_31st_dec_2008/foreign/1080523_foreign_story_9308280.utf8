          ANITA SINGH                           Schwarzenegger                                  
	London, May 22: The Terminator franchise is being revived  but will Arnold Schwarzenegger be back? The makers of a new trilogy are keeping us guessing over whether the governor of California will be making a comeback in his most famous role.         
	British actor Christian Bale has signed up to play rebel leader John Connor in three sequels.         
	The first, Terminator Salvation: The Future Begins, has already started shooting.         
	Producer Victor Kubicek refused to reveal if Schwarzenegger would be appearing.         
	Unfortunately, we cant tell you, is all he would say.         
	We cant talk about the story points at all. At the moment were keeping everything under lock and key. We want the fans to be really excited and surprised.         
	Bale, 34, played the Caped Crusader in the 2005 film Batman Begins and again in the forthcoming sequel, The Dark Knight.         
	Kubicek said: Were very proud. Christian was our first choice and hes a big fan of The Terminator.         
	With Batman, hes already done the whole franchise thing, so we werent sure hed respond.         
	But Bale read the script and loved it so much that he signed on for all three.         
	The first film will be made by McG (Joseph McGinty Nichol), the Charlies Angels director, and will be released in May 2009.

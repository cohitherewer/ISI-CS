          STEPHEN ADAMS                          An iPod Touch                                  
	London, Dec. 2: Drivers can now turn their iPods into breathalyser units thanks to a device that clips on to the bottom of their music players.         
	The 55 iBreath has just gone on sale in Britain, promising to give users an accurate reading of how much alcohol is in their breath.        
	The gadget clips on to the base of an iPod and has a fold-out tube to blow into. It works in much the same way as a police breathalyser. The unit, which rather bizarrely also includes an FM radio, has been a pre-Christmas hit in the US.        
	David Steele, a California based iPod accessory retailer, described the iBreath as the ultimate iPod accessory.        
	He said: Not only can this cool gizmo save you from career-ending embarrassment, it can potentially save you thousands of dollars in legal fees and jail time.

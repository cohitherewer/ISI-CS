          DON VAN NATTA JR.                          Former President Bill Clinton with Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in Putrajaya, Malaysia. (AP)                                  
	Kuala Lumpur, Dec. 6: Former President Bill Clinton visited Malaysia yesterday to deliver his first paid speech since his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, was selected on Monday by President-elect Barack Obama to be secretary of state.        
	Clinton spoke before nearly 3,000 people in Kuala Lumpur at the invitation of Vinod Sekhar, a Malaysian businessman whose foundation paid Clinton $200,000, according to several people with knowledge of the fee. The figure is on the lower end of the scale that Clinton usually commands for his speeches.         
	You should be proud of this man, Clinton told the audience, pointing at Sekhar, the 40-year-old chief executive of the Petra Group, a privately held rubber technology company.        
	But several angry investors in Britain and Malaysia say they disagree with the former Presidents glowing assessment of Sekhar, whose company has suffered a rough few weeks.         
	I believe he is using Bill Clinton  this is what he does, said Abdul Azim Zabidi, a former board member of the Petra Group who claims Sekhar broke numerous promises to him and still owes him $100,000. He just wants to get new investors. Another investor, the actor Bruce Willis, recently settled a lawsuit with Petra over the return of $900,000. The company called it a misunderstanding.         
	And this week, after a 10-year partnership, a member of the Malaysian royal family quit as Petras chairman, saying he was tired of the many surprises during his affiliation with the company. Enough is enough, the former chairman said.         
	 Sekhar declined to comment. A spokesman for the Petra Group, Andrew Murray-Watson, said that Zabidis assertion that he was still owed money was utter rubbish, and that the Clinton event was held as a memorial for Sekhars late father, a scientist who invented an environmentally sound way to recycle tyres.        
	The idea that Vinod organised this event purely for public relations purposes is frankly ludicrous, and insulting to the memory of his father, Murray-Watson said.        
	Officials with the Obama transition team said they did not vet Sekhars background before Clintons speech.         
	The speech was one of the last Clinton will deliver without being reviewed by a state department ethics panel, a requirement he has agreed to follow if Hillary Clinton is confirmed by the Senate as secretary of state. Clinton also agreed to have his fees from business dealings and foreign speeches reviewed by the White House Counsels Office, if necessary.         
	When Hillary Clinton emerged as the leading contender for secretary of state, questions were raised about whether she could work as the nations chief diplomat while Clinton continued to pursue his global business dealings and foreign speechmaking. In a bid to erase worries about conflicts of interest, the former President agreed to every request made by the Obama transition team.        
	If she is going to be secretary of state, and I operate globally and I have people who contribute to these efforts globally, Clinton told CNN this week, I think that its important to make it totally transparent.        
	Since leaving the White House, Clinton has travelled the world fighting AIDS, malaria and other maladies. Since its formation in 1997, the Clinton Foundation has raised more than $500 million to build a presidential library and finance charitable programmes.         
	It will be the last such meeting for some time; under the terms of his agreement with the Obama transition team, Clinton agreed to no longer host those meetings overseas. His decision to accept the invitation of Sekhar, who has made contributions to the Clinton Global Initiative, surprised several Petra Group investors, who say Sekhar was using his association with Clinton to attract new investment. It was Clintons first visit to Malaysia.

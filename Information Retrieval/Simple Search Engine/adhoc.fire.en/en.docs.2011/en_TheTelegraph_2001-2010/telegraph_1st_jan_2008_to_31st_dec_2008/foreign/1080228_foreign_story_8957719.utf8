The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Victors vow to cut Pervez powers

	Islamabad, Feb. 27 (AP): Pakistans election victors vowed today to drastically reduce President Pervez Musharrafs powers  even if they lack the parliamentary strength to drive him out of office.        
	The three parties, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Awami National Party (ANP), also demanded that Musharraf convene parliament immediately.        
	PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif said that they are not prepared to wait for a single more day.        
	The PPP and the PML-N trounced Musharrafs allies in a February 18 vote. This is a window of opportunity, said Asif Ali Zardari, slain leader Benazir Bhuttos widower and PPP co-chairman.        
	He was speaking at a meeting of newly-elected lawmakers from the two winning parties. The homage to my shaheed (martyred) wife would be that we unite together, we take democracy, we take power for parliament and once and for all finish the establishment, Zardari said.        
	The meeting  a show of strength by the three parties  was held over lunch at a swanky hotel in Islamabad. The APN, which won elections in the insurgency-plagued northwest, also took part.         
	However, Musharraf is resisting growing pressure to resign, raising the prospect of a fresh political crisis that could spoil Pakistans return to democracy after eight years of military rule. Sharif urged Musharraf to quickly convene parliament so that the parties can begin the gigantic task of restoring the countrys much-amended Constitution.        
	We are not prepared to wait for a single more day, Sharif said. We are ready for a transition.         
	The three parties that met today were expected to form a coalition government as early as next month with Makhdoom Amin Fahim, a long-time Bhutto lieutenant, as Prime Minister.        
	The new Assembly could give a rough ride to Musharraf, whose role in Washingtons war against terrorism and increasingly authoritarian rule have made him deeply unpopular.        
	Sharif said today that the prospective coalition partners have 171 seats out of 272 in the National Assembly and that they would soon secure the two-thirds majority needed to change the Constitution or impeach Musharraf.        
	Pro-Musharraf parties retain a slender majority in the 100-seat Senate, the upper house. But six senators announced yesterday that they were breaking away from the erstwhile ruling bloc.        
	Farhatullah Babar, PPP spokesman, said it had great hopes that enough senators would support a move to abolish the National Security Council  a body set up under Musharraf which gave the military a formal role in policy making.

	Jerusalem, Dec. 29: Israels military operation in Gaza is aimed primarily at forcing Hamas to end its rocket barrages and military buildup.         
	But it has another goal as well: to expunge the ghost of its flawed 2006 war against the Hezbollah in Lebanon and re-establish Israeli deterrence.         
	On the second day of the offensive, which has already killed hundreds and is devastating Hamass resources, Israeli commanders yesterday were lining up tanks and troops at the border.         
	But they were also insisting that they did not intend to reoccupy the coastal strip of 1.5 million Palestinians or to overthrow the Hamas government there.        
	This is because whatever might replace Hamas  anarchy, for example  could in fact be worse for Israels security. So the goal, as stated by a senior military official, is to stop the firing against our civilians in the south and shape a different and new security situation there.        
	This means another peace treaty with Hamas, but one that has more specific terms than the one that ended 10 days ago. Such a concrete goal, however, should not obscure the fact that Israel has a larger concern  it worries that its enemies are less afraid of it than they once were, or should be. Israeli leaders are calculating that a display of power in Gaza could fix that.         
	In the cabinet room today there was an energy, a feeling that after so long of showing restraint we had finally acted, said Mark Regev, spokesman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, speaking of the government meeting that he attended.        
	Mark Heller, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, said that that energy reflected the deep feeling among average Israelis that the country had to regain its deterrent capacity.        
	Numerous commentators yesterday, both in Israel and in the Arab world, noted that the shadow of the 2006 Lebanon war was hanging over the attack on Gaza. Then, Hezbollah was lobbing deadly rockets into Israel and had captured an Israeli soldier in a cross-border raid.        
	Israel invaded southern Lebanon and for 34 days carried out air, sea and land assaults before a truce was negotiated. But Hezbollah, by successfully shooting thousands of rockets into Israel while under attack and sounding defiant to the end, won a great deal of credit among Arabs across the region.        
	The risk to Israel in Gaza seems of a parallel nature  that if the operation fails or leaves Hamas in the position of scrappy survivor, it could then dominate Palestinian politics over the pro-Western Fatah movement for years to come.

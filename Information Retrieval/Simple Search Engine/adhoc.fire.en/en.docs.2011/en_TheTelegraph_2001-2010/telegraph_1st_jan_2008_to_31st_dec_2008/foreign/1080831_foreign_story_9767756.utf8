The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gustav gets stronger as it roars to Cuba
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Gustav gets stronger as it roars to Cuba

	Havana, Aug. 30 (Reuters): Hurricane Gustav grew bigger and stronger with 230kmph winds as it roared toward Cuba today and threatened the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico and New Orleans which was devastated by a similar storm in 2005.        
	Gustav ripped across the Cayman Islands, closed in on Cubas Isle of Youth and was set to strike the Cuban mainland. Forecasters predicted Gustav would cross the Gulf of Mexico and hit central Louisiana on Tuesday with the same force that Hurricane Katrina delivered three years ago.        
	The US National Hurricane Centre said Gustav revved up as it crossed the warm Caribbean and was a Category 5 storm on the five-stage Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity.        
	Any storm with winds of at least 230kmph is ranked major by the Miami-based hurricane centre.        
	Plain and simple, Gustav is forecast to be a large and powerful hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, headed toward the northern Gulf coast, said Richard Knabb, a senior hurricane specialist a the US National Hurricane Centre.        
	Gustav could strengthen further before crossing tomorrow into the Gulf of Mexico, where offshore platforms produce 25 per cent of US oil and 15 per cent of its natural gas.        
	Gustav was expected to dump up to 30cm of rain as it crossed Cuba. The storms centre was 85km southeast of the Isle of Youth and 295km from Cubas western tip.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US drone blitz kills Osama friends kin
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             US drone blitz kills Osama friends kin
                            
	Miranshah (Pakistan), Sept. 8 (Reuters): Missiles fired by US drones killed 16 people, including Pakistani and Afghan Taliban fighters, today in a strike targeting a religious school founded by an old friend of Osama bin Laden, intelligence officials and Pakistani villagers said.        
	The missiles hit a sprawling complex comprising a house and a madarsa founded by Taliban commander Jalaluddin Haqqani near Miranshah, the main town of North Waziristan tribal region on the Afghan border.        
	Ten militants and a sister, a sister-in-law and two nieces of Haqqani as well as two children were killed in the attack, residents said. There were two drones and they fired three missiles, said a resident of Dandi Darpakheil, the village which was hit.        
	Haqqani is a veteran commander of the US-backed Afghan war against the Soviet invasion in the 1970s and 1980s, and his links with bin Laden go back to the late 1980s.        
	He is said to be in ill-health and his son, Sirajuddin, has been leading the Haqqani group. They belonged to Sirajuddin Haqqani group, said an intelligence officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, referring to the militants killed in the attack.        
	No foreign militant was killed, he added, although a junior intelligence official had said earlier Uzbek and Arab militants had been staying in the school complex.        
	One of Haqqanis younger sons said his father and brother, Sirajuddin, were nowhere near when the attack took place. Haqqani and Sirajuddin were in Afghanistan at the time of the attack. They are alive, Badruddin, the commanders third son, told Reuters by telephone.        
	Fifteen to 20 wounded people, most of them women and children, had been taken to hospital in Miranshah, the main town of North Waziristan, doctors said. Badruddin said six missiles had struck the house, which the family had owned for 30 years.        
	Military spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas said an incident had taken place and its cause was being ascertained. Haqqani has had close links with Pakistani intelligence agencies, notably the ISI. The New York Times reported in July that the CIA had given Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani evidence of the ISIs involvement with Haqqani.

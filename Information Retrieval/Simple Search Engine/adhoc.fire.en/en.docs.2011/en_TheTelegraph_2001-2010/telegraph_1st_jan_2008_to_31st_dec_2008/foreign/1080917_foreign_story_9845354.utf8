	Islamabad, Sept. 16 (AP): Pakistans military has ordered its forces to open fire if US troops launch another raid across the Afghan border, an army spokesman said today.        
	The orders mark a dangerous escalation in tension between Washington and a key ally in its seven-year war on terror.        
	Pakistani protests are hardening in the wake of a September 3 incident in which helicopters ferried US commandos into Pakistan for a highly unusual ground attack in a militant stronghold.        
	The countrys civilian leaders, who have taken a tough line against Islamic militants since forcing US ally Pervez Musharraf to resign as President last month, have insisted that Pakistan must resolve the spat with Washington through diplomatic channels.        
	However, army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas told The Associated Press that, after the cross-border assault in the South Waziristan tribal region, the military told its field commanders to take action to prevent any similar raids.        
	The orders are clear, Abbas said in an interview. In case it happens again in this form, that there is a very significant detection, which is very definite, no ambiguity, across the border, on ground or in the air: open fire.        
	US military commanders have accused Islamabad of doing too little to prevent the Taliban and other militant groups from recruiting, training and resupplying in Pakistans wild tribal belt.        
	Pakistan acknowledges the presence of al Qaida fugitives  the area is considered a possible hiding place for Osama bin Laden and al Qaida number two Ayman al-Zawahri  and the difficulties it faces in preventing militants from seeping through the mountainous border into Afghanistan.        
	However, it insists it is doing what it can and paying a heavy price, pointing to its deployment of more than 100,000 troops in its increasingly restive northwest and a wave of suicide bombings across the country.        
	American officials have confirmed their forces carried out the September 3 raid near the town of Angoor Ada but have given few details of what happened.        
	Abbas said that Pakistans military had asked for an explanation but received only a half-page of very vague information that did not identify the intended target.        
	Pakistani officials have said the raid killed about 15 people, and Abbas said they all appeared to be civilians.        
	Probably they (the US troops) meant to go into some other area, engage some other people, he said. As per our post-incident report, these were truck drivers, local traders and their families.        
	Rebel hubs bombed        
	Pakistani aircraft bombed militant strongholds today killing 14 insurgents and a suicide car-bomber attacked a security force camp killing three soldiers. The violence came as the top US military officer, Admiral Mike Mullen, arrived in Pakistan.

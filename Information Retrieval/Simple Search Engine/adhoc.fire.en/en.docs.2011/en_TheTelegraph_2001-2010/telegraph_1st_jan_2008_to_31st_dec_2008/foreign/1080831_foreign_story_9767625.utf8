	Islamabad, Aug. 30 (AP): A Pakistani lawmaker defended a decision by southwestern tribesmen to bury five women alive because they wanted to choose their own husbands, telling stunned members of parliament this week to spare him their outrage.        
	These are centuries-old traditions and I will continue to defend them, Israr Ullah Zehri, who represents Baluchistan province, said today.         
	The women, three of whom were teenagers, were first shot and then thrown into a ditch. They were still breathing as their bodies were covered with rocks and mud, according to media reports and human rights activists.         
	Zehri told a packed and flabbergasted parliament yesterday that Baluch tribal traditions helped stop obscenity and then asked fellow lawmakers not to make a big fuss about it.

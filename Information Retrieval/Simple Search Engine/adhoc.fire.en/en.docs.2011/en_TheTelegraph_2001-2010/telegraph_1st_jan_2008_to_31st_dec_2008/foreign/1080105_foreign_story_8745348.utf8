The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | From bottom of pack, Huckabee rides religious wave
                                                                                                            From bottom of pack, Huckabee rides religious wave
          MICHAEL D. SHEAR AND PERRY BACON JR.                                
	Des Moines, Jan. 4: Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee rode a wave of evangelical fervour to victory over Mitt Romney in Iowas Republican caucuses yesterday, an outcome that hardly seemed possible two months ago.        
	Tonight what we have seen is a new day in American politics, Huckabee told supporters at the Embassy Suites here. And tonight it starts here in Iowa, but it doesnt end here. It goes all the way to the other states and ends at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.        
	After spending nine months near the bottom of the pack, Huckabee surged to become the front-runner in Iowa in December and never relinquished the position, despite a barrage of negative ads from Romneys methodically built and well-financed operation.        
	But Huckabee now heads to New Hampshire, where voting takes place on Tuesday, with little support in the polls and only a ragtag organisation to mount a second come-from-behind victory.         
	To succeed, he will have to broaden his message, which has largely been designed to appeal to the Christian conservatives who helped him win last night. New Hampshire voters tend to be less focused on social issues and more concerned with lowering taxes and reducing the size of government.        
	Yesterdays turnout shattered the previous record of about 87,000 voters, with more than 125,000 projected to have caucused. Sixty per cent of Republican caucusgoers described themselves as evangelicals, according to entrance polls. Those voters went for Huckabee over Romney by more than 2 to 1.        
	With 93 per cent of precincts reporting, Huckabee had won 34 per cent of the delegates awarded, Romney held 25 per cent and former senator Fred D. Thompson and Senator John McCain were tied for third, with about 13 per cent each.        
	For Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, the defeat is a devastating blow to his kindling strateg, conceived in Boston years ago, to spark a fire in the early-voting states by outspending and out-organising his rivals. He spent millions in Iowa alone, in part by tapping his personal fortune, in the hope of building an insurmountable lead.        
	Standing with his wife and family, Romney, a former head of the Olympic Games, accepted the silver and congratulated his rival for earning the gold. But he vowed to win first place in the final games and to keep it up state after state after state.        
	He told a large and enthusiastic crowd that he had competed against more well-known names, such as McCain, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Thompson, a former actor, who qualified for a critical debate in New Hampshire tomorrow. Somehow, tonight, we beat all of them, Romney said.        
	Romney is going all out in New Hampshire, where he headed last night and where he has already begun to focus his fire not at Huckabee but at McCain, who sits atop polls there with Romney.

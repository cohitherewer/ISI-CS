The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | No death penalty for child rape: US court
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       No death penalty for child rape: US court
                            
	Washington, June 25 (Reuters): The US supreme court in a major capital punishment decision struck down today the death penalty for child rape, its first decision in more than 30 years on whether a crime other than murder can be punished by execution.        
	The nations highest court ruled by a 5-4 vote that the death penalty for the crime of raping a child violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.        
	Writing for the court majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the Constitution barred a state from imposing the death penalty for the rape of a child when the crime did not result, and was not intended to result, in the victims death.        
	Kennedy concluded that capital punishment, based on current evolving standards, should be reserved for crimes that take the life of the victim.        
	The ruling was a victory for Patrick Kennedy, 43, of Louisiana, who challenged his death sentence after being convicted for raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter in 1998.        
	Of the more than 3,300 inmates on death row in America, Kennedy and another man convicted of child rape in Louisiana are the only ones who did not commit murder.        
	The supreme court last ruled on the death penalty and rape in 1977, when it outlawed executions in a case in which the victim was an adult woman. It declared the death penalty an excessive penalty for a rapist who does not take a human life. The Louisiana law allows the death penalty for those convicted of rape of a child under the age of 12. It was later amended to change the age to 13.

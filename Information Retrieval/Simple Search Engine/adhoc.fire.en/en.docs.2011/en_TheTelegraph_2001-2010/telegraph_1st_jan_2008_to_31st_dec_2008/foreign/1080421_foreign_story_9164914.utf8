	Kathmandu, April 20 (AP): Nepalese soldiers and police with orders to shoot if necessary are guarding the slopes of Mount Everest to stop any protests by Tibetans during Chinas planned Olympic torch run to the summit, officials said today.        
	The 25 soldiers and policemen have already established several camps on the mountain, Nepals home ministry spokesperson Modraj Dotel said, adding that more troops could be sent if needed.        
	 They have been given orders to stop any protest on the mountain using whatever means necessary, including use of weapons, Dotel said, adding that any protester would be arrested and shooting would be the last option.        
	Chinese climbers plan to take the Olympic torch to the summit of the Everest  the worlds highest peak  in the first few days of May.        
	During that time, other climbers will be banned from the mountains higher elevations.        
	The Everest straddles the border between Nepal and Chinas Tibet region.        
	Dotel said Nepal couldnt allow protests against China. The police have broken up recent demonstrations by Tibetan exiles in the capital, Kathmandu, and held protesters.        
	There are already dozens of mountaineers on the Everest for the popular spring climbing season. Climbers spend weeks acclimatising and making practice runs up the slopes before pushing to the 8,850-m summit.        
	Climbers will be barred from going above Camp 2 at 6,600m until the Chinese finish their torch run. The harsh weather on the Everest allows only two windows in May when conditions are favourable for the push to the summit.        
	Tibetan exiles have protested almost daily in Kathmandu in front of the United Nations office and the Chinese Embassy against Beijings rule over the region.        
	Security has been stepped up around the embassy and offices since the protests began, with hundreds of police officers posted on the streets leading to the building.        
	The UN and international rights groups have criticised Nepal for using what they say is excessive force to stop the demonstrations. The police have beaten protesters and dragged them through streets while detaining them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pervez rejects Sarabjit plea
                                                                                                               Pervez rejects Sarabjit plea
          NASIR JAFFRY                          Sarabjit                                  
	Islamabad, March 5: President Pervez Musharraf today rejected the mercy petition of Sarabjit Singh, the jailed Amritsar villager who has been handed the death sentence.        
	The decision came a day after Kashmir Singh reached home in Punjabs Hoshiarpur district from a Lahore jail where had spent 35 years, many of them on death row.        
	The release of Kashmir Singh, pardoned by Musharraf, had raised hopes that Sarabjit would also be given clemency.        
	However, Rana Abdul Hameed, Sarabjits lawyer, said this evening that reports about the rejection of the mercy plea were rumours. I havent heard of such a thing. It is a rumour. There is no official intimation from the Presidents office, Hameed said over the phone.        
	Rejecting the petition, the President is believed to have told his aides that Sarabjits case was different from Kashmir Singhs. The interior ministry, which had sent Musharraf the petition, has informed Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore, where Sarabjit has been kept, about the rejection.         
	Sarabjit was arrested by the Pakistan army on August 25, 1990, and labelled an Indian spy. He was found guilty of plotting the 1989 blasts in Lahore and Multan. But his family claims Sarabjit had strayed across the border when he was drunk and denied he was a spy.

          VALERIE STRAUSS                          False alarm                                   
	Washington, May 20: A new study to be released today on gender equity in education concludes that a boys crisis in US schools is a myth and that both sexes have stayed the same or improved on standardised tests in the past decade.        
	The report by the non-profit American Association of University Women, which promotes education and equity for women, reviewed nearly 40 years of data on achievement from fourth grade to college and for the first time analysed gender differences within economic and ethnic categories.        
	The most important conclusion of Where the Girls Are: The Facts About Gender Equity in Education is that academic success is more closely associated with family income than with gender, its authors said.        
	A lot of people think it is the boys that need the help, co-author Christianne Corbett said.         
	The point of the report is to highlight the fact that that is not exclusively true. There is no crisis with boys. If there is a crisis, it is with African American and Hispanic students and low-income students, girls and boys.        
	The report is the latest and, according to the association, the most comprehensive, of several issued over the past two decades by groups alleging crises  first among girls, then boys.        
	Advocates for girls started making their case in the early 1990s, saying boys got more attention from teachers and were steered towards math and science more than girls, resulting in achievement gaps. More recently, advocates for boys have argued that the tide had turned and that boys were falling behind.        
	The association report looks at many indicators of educational achievement, including dropout and disciplinary rates.         
	Researchers concluded that: A literacy gap in favour of girls is not new, nor is it increasing; a gender gap still exists favouring boys in math; students from lower-income families are less likely to be proficient in math and reading  gender differences vary significantly by race and ethnicity; and there is virtually no gap between boys and girls entering college immediately after high school.

	Barcelona, Feb. 12 (Reuters): Research In Motion may bring out a touch-screen version of its popular BlackBerry email device if customers want it, according to co-chief executive Jim Balsillie, who expects to deliver new high-speed devices soon.        
	Balsillie declined to give details about future product plans. But when asked if RIM would bring out a touch-screen version of BlackBerry, which is liked for its miniature computer-like keyboard, he said it was important to be flexible to customers demands.        
	For sure were looking at all kinds of different device packaging and presentation, Balsillie said in an interview with Reuters at the Mobile World Congress. I think getting religious on packaging is not the way to go, he said. Its really user preference-oriented.

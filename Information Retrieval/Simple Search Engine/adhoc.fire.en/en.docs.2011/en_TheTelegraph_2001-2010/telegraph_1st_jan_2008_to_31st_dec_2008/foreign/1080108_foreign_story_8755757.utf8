	Washington, Jan. 7 (Reuters): Five Iranian boats made aggressive manoeuvres and showed hostile intent against three US navy ships during the weekend in the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route in the Gulf, the Pentagon said today.
    
	The Pentagon said the incident was serious. It described the Iranian actions as careless, reckless and potentially hostile and said Tehran should provide an explanation.
    
	In Tehran, the Iranian foreign ministry described the incident as ordinary. The example that happened on Saturday was similar to previous cases and is an ordinary and natural issue, foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told Irans official Irna news agency. 
    
	It was resolved when vessels from both sides identified each other, he said.
    
	The incident was the latest sign of tension between Washington and Tehran, at odds over a range of issues from Irans nuclear programme to US allegations of Iranian support for terrorism.
    
	President George W. Bush is due to travel to West Asia this week on a trip he has said is partly aimed at countering Iranian influence. We urge the Iranians to refrain from such provocative actions that could lead to a dangerous incident in the future, White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said.
    
	In March, Iran seized 15 British sailors and Marines in the Gulf and accused them of trespassing in Iranian territory while they inspected a merchant vessel. London maintained the British personnel were in Iraqi waters.
    
	The British personnel were held for almost two weeks before being freed in what Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said was a gift to the British people.
    
	Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said the three US ships had been in international waters passing through the Strait of Hormuz when they were approached by five fast boats, at least some of which were visibly armed.
    
	This is a serious incident, Whitman said.Clearly this is something that deserves an explanation.
    
	The boats were identified as Iranian and made some aggressive manoeuvres against our vessels and indicated some hostile intent, Whitman said.
    
	This required our vessels to issue warnings and conduct some evasive manoeuvring, Whitman told reporters. The US Navy vessels were prepared to take appropriate actions... but there was no engagement of the vessels.

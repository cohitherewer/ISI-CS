	Kuala Lumpur, June 24 (AP): Authorities in a northern Malaysian city have forbidden Muslim women from wearing bright lipstick and noisy high-heeled shoes to work, saying the ban will enhance their dignity and prevent them from getting raped, a news report said.        
	The municipal council in Kota Baru, dominated by a conservative Islamic party, ordered women working in restaurants and other businesses to refrain from wearing heavy makeup, including bright lipstick, and high-heeled shoes that make tapping sounds, the national news agency Bernama said late yesterday.        
	If they insist on wearing such shoes, the heels should be padded with rubber, it said. The city said in a circular that the order aims to prevent rape and to protect the womens dignity and morals, Bernama said.        
	 The circular has already been distributed to some businesses, it said.        
	City council officials could not immediately confirm the report. One employee, who declined to be named because she is not authorised to speak to the media, said she had heard of the directive but was not aware that it was being enforced.

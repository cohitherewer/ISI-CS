	Colombo, July 24 (Reuters): Sri Lankan fighter jets bombed rebel positions today while troops captured a rebel-held area, killing at least 25 militants, the military said.        
	The air raid on positions in the rebel-held districts of Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi came two days after the government dismissed a LTTE declaration of a unilateral ceasefire from July 26 to August 4.        
	Air force fighter jets attacked LTTE leaders gathering east of Thunukkai in Kilinochchi in the afternoon and a recruit training centre north of Oddusuddan in Mullaitivu this morning, said air force spokesman Wing Commander Janaka Nanayakkara. Pilots confirmed the targets were successfully engaged.        
	The military said ground troops had captured a rebel-held area in the islands northern district of Mullaitivu today.        
	Army troops captured an area 3km south of Mallavi, killed 25 LTTE terrorists and captured some weapons, said a spokesman at Media Centre for National security. He said the military had not suffered any casualties. The military said fighting yesterday in four northern districts had also killed 25 rebels and injured 21 Tiger rebels.

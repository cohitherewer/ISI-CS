                              Bruni: In the limelight                            
	London, Nov. 4: Carla Bruni has been voted the coolest celebrity in a poll of Britons.         
	 And Sir Cliff Richard made a surprise appearance in the poll  taking eighth place in the chart.         
	Former model and musician Bruni rocketed to the top of the Alternative Cool List with almost a quarter of those questioned naming her as their favourite celebrity personality.         
	Bruni, 40, has spent the year squarely in the public gaze  marrying French President Nicolas Sarkozy, performing with Metallica and staying over at Buckingham Palace when visiting the Queen.         
	The singer, who was born in Italy, has had a string of high profile relationships with stars including Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton.         
	She also famously posed in the nude  before she married Sarkozy, and one of her saucy snaps was recently sold for 45,500 to a secret bidder at a Christies auction.         
	The poll also named Sir Cliff and Peter Kays fictitious character Geraldine among its top 12 cool customers.

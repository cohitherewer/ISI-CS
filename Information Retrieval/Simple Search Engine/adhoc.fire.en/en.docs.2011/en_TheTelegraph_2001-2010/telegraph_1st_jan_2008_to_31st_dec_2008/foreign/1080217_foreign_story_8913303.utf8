                                                                                                               5 months later, Fossett dead
                            
	Chicago, Feb. 15 (Reuters): Missing millionaire adventurer Steve Fossett was declared legally dead yesterday by a Chicago court five months after the airplane he was flying disappeared over Nevada, media reported.        
	His wife, Peggy Fossett, had asked Cook county circuit court in Chicago to make the declaration in November. Her petition for a judicial finding of his death said investigators had concluded that Fossetts airplane was destroyed in a fatal accident.        
	I believe the evidence is more than sufficient, Judge Jeffrey Malak of the circuit court said in ruling declaring Fossett was dead, the Chicago Tribune reported on its website.

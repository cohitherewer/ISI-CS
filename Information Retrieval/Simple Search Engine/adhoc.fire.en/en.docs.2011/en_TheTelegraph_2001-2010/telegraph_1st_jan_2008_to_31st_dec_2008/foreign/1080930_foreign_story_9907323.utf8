	Led Zep tour off    
	 London, Sept. 29 (Reuters): Former Led Zeppelin lead singer Robert Plant has put paid to persistent rumours that the British rock giants were planning to reunite for a tour.       
	The famous foursome got back together for a one-off charity gig in London last December, and the media has speculated ever since that they could stage a comeback tour.      
	Band insiders have said that Plant, who is touring the US with Alison Krauss, has been the most reluctant to get back together, and a statement on his website today made clear his intentions.      
	Robert Plant and Alison Krauss are currently touring the USA on the last leg of their Raising Sand tour, he said. After those dates, Robert has no intention whatsoever of touring with anyone for at least the next two years.

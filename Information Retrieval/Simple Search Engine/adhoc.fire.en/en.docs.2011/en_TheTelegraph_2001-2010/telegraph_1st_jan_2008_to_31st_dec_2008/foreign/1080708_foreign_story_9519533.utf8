The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Robert De Niro warns actors over strike
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Robert De Niro warns actors over strike

	New York, July 7: Robert De Niro has warned fellow Hollywood actors against taking threatened strike action over a pay dispute with film and television studio bosses.         
	I do not think it is a good time to be striking, he said at the Karlovy Vary film festival in the Czech Republic.         
	He added: All the trade unions are affected by the strike. With the economy as it is at this time, it does not seem to be a great idea.         
	De Niro said the issues could be resolved in a few years and whatever the results is, can be set retroactively.         
	His comments at the weekend came as the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), the biggest US union for film and television actors, was expected to respond later to the latest pay offer from the studios.         
	A three-year contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers expired last week.         
	SAG has demanded that its 120,000 members get a greater share of profits from DVD and Internet sales. The dispute is complicated by the fact that a smaller actors union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, has taken a more moderate line and proposed a deal aimed at avoiding a strike.         
	Hollywood was damaged by a screenwriters strike that ended in February. The studios have warned that a strike would cost Californias economy $23 million a day and leave actors nearly $2.5 million a day out of pocket.

  - Protect India investments        J. HEMANTH                                           
	Kathmandu, Nov. 25: Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee today told Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, that Nepal would find it hard to attract Indian investment unless the Himalayan nation improved its industrial climate.         
	Mukherjee, who called on Prachanda at his official residence here, highlighted the problems being faced by Indian companies and their joint ventures like Dabur Nepal, United Telecom Nepal and Nepal Lever. He said several Indian firms were wary of investing. Mukherjee said Nepal should take immediate steps to provide adequate security to Indian ventures and protect their investments.         
	Mukherjee, who held a closed-door meeting with the chief executives of Indian companies and their partners at his hotel last night, recalled the recent abduction of top Colgate-Palmolive executives by the cadres of a particular party.         
	He said such incidents sent negative signals about not only the industrial climate but also the security situation.         
	Almost all Indian joint ventures have been facing labour problems with the Maoist-led unions making unreasonable demands. Bowing to their pressure, Colgate-Palmolive sold its stake to its Nepali partner last week and recalled its executives from the country.         
	Responding to Mukherjees concerns, Prachanda said his government was planning to create an industrial security force that would protect all industries, especially multinationals. He also promised to resolve the problems faced by Indian firms.         
	During the meeting, the two leaders also dwelt on several other issues. Mukherjee promised New Delhis support to the peace process and the writing of the Nepali Constitution.        
	Friendship treaty        
	The two leaders decided to review the 58-year-old Friendship Treaty and reshape it to suit contemporary realities, reports PTI. Mukherjee assured Prachanda that India was ready for the treaty to be upgraded.

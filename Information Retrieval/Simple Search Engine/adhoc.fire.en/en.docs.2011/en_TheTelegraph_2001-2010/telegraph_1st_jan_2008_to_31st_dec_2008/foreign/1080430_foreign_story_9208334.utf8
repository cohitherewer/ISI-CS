The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UN to set up food crisis task force
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       UN to set up food crisis task force
                                  
	Berne, April 29 (Reuters): UN agencies and the World Bank pledged today to set up a task force to tackle an unprecedented rise in global food prices that is threatening to spread social unrest.        
	The international bodies called on countries not to restrict exports of food to secure supplies at home, warning that could make the problem worse.        
	We consider that the dramatic escalation in food prices worldwide has evolved into an unprecedented challenge of global proportions, the UN said in a statement.        
	This had become a crisis for the worlds most vulnerable people, including the urban poor, it said after a meeting of 27 international agency heads in the Swiss capital, Berne, to chart a solution to food price rises that have caused hunger, riots and hoarding in poor countries.        
	Though we have seen wheat prices fall over the last few days, rice and corn prices are likely to remain high, and wheat relatively so, World Bank president Robert Zoellick told a joint news conference. Higher costs of wheat, rice, and other staples have put extreme pressure on aid providers such as the World Food Programme (WFP), a UN agency aiming to feed 73 million people this year.        
	UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon called on the international community to provide the WFP all of the $755 million in emergency funds it needs for the crisis.

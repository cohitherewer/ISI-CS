The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Shock defeats for Malay party
                                                                                                               Shock defeats for Malay party
                            
	Kuala Lumpur, March 8 (AP): Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawis ruling coalition suffered its biggest upset in nearly four decades in general elections today, reflecting widespread unhappiness at his failure to curb racial tensions, corruption and inflation.        
	Abdullahs National Front lost control of the Penang and Kedah state legislatures, and also failed to wrest control of Kelantan, which until now was the only state under Opposition rule. The Front was also set to lose Selangor state to the Opposition.        
	However, the Front managed to secure a simple majority. The election commission announced that the Front had won 112 of the 165 seats for which counting was completed in the 222-member parliament.        
	It was one of the most humiliating defeats for the Front, which has governed Malaysia since independence in 1957, and raises questions about the 68-year-old Abdullahs political future and his management style.        
	We suffered a lot of losses tonight, Abdullahs son-in-law Khairy Jamaluddin told reporters. But we are going to fight on. We are not going to quit. It is not the end of the world and we are going to get through this. The results will spoil the Fronts expected victory at the federal level.        
	For the Opposition, the Democratic Action Party (DAP) won eight seats, the Islamic Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, or PAS, got seven, and the Peoples Justice Party won eight.        
	Final results will only be known early tomorrow.        
	Its a peoples revolution. People are waking up and sending a clear message to the government that enough is enough, PAS vice-president Husam Musa told reporters.        
	Analysts have predicted that the Opposition would win 35 to 38 seats, nearly doubling its 19 seats in the outgoing parliament. Abdullah retained his parliamentary seat, but with a reduced majority of 11,246 votes compared to 18,122 votes in the previous elections.

	Barnaul (Russia), March 3 (Reuters): Eighty residents of a Siberian village carrying the name of Russias likely next President hoped that his election victory will rescue their dying community.
    
	Medvedevka, a 300-year-old village at the base of the Altai mountains 4,000 km east of Moscow, has no postal service and only one main street.
    
	Residents gather in one of two local grocery stores. It was there they collectively decided to vote for Dmitry Medvedev, President Vladimir Putins chosen successor. I voted for Medvedev, and other guys did the same. Maybe its funny, but somewhere deep within our soul we believe hes one of us, local resident Vasily Berdnikov told Reuters by phone.
    
	The village has been orphaned in the last few years. Farms have gone bankrupt, young people have left for other towns. The last Medvedevs quit the village ten years ago for a village with better prospects.
    
	Villagers cast their ballots in the local school  a building with nine classrooms and only four students. Who knows, perhaps some assistance to our Medvedevs will filter down from President Medvedev? he said.

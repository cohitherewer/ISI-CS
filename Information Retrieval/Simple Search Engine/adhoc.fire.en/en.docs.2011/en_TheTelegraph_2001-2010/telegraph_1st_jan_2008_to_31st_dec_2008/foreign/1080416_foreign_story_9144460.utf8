	Gere imprint    
	 Bedford (New York), April 15 (AP): Richard Gere is running into some zoning hurdles as he tries to put his imprint on the wealthy New York suburb of Bedford.      
	The 58-year-old actor and a partner have opened a cafe and bakery and have plans for a luxury inn and fine restaurant. But their new 55-metre cedar fence may not pass muster, building inspector Richard Megna said yesterday.      
	Bedfords rules call for a fence no higher than 1.2 metres along the street side of a property, he said, and Geres is 1.5 metres tall.      
	However, Geres representatives have been trying to win a variance from the town zoning board by landscaping the fence to make it look better, Megna said.

As for the album  Home Before Dark due out on May 6  Diamond said: This record represents a giant step in my evolution as a writer and a recording artist ... you will see Ive gone deeper. It was more painful to write this  maybe the most difficult album Ive ever written, and maybe my best.

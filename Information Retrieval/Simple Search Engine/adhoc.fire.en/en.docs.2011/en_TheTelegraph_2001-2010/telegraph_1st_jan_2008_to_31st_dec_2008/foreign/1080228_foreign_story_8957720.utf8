The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Zardari cases terminated
                                                                                                               Zardari cases terminated
                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 27 (PTI): The Pakistan government today terminated graft cases against Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari shortly after the apex court dismissed three petitions challenging a controversial order granting amnesty to PPP leaders in corruption cases.        
	The National Accountability Bureau, the anti-corruption body, terminated cases against Zardari and Rehman Malik, Benazir Bhuttos security adviser, immediately after the supreme court gave its ruling this morning.        
	NAB deputy prosecutor General Zulfiqar Bhutta said the agency had initially given directions for the termination of cases after Musharraf issued the National Reconciliation Ordinance in October last year.        
	But several anti-corruption courts had refused to stop hearing cases against Bhutto, Zardari and others after the ordinance was challenged in the apex court. It also issued a stay on all benefits granted under the law, Bhutta said. After the court order, the cases were finally terminated, he said.        
	Bhuttos name was removed as an accused from cases being heard by anti-corruption courts following her assassination in December. A five-member bench headed by Chief Justice Abdul Hameed dismissed petitions filed by Jamaat-e-Islami chief Qazi Hussain Ahmed, PML-N leader Shahbaz Sharif and an advocate challenging the constitutional validity of the ordinance.

	Dhaka, Sept. 16 (Reuters): A Bangladesh court granted bail to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in an extortion case today, setting the stage for her return from the US next month ahead of elections later this year.        
	Hasina, who was paroled in June and allowed to go abroad for medical treatment, is still facing charges of graft in three other cases. The prosecution has also been suspended until October 19.

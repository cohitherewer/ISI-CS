	Sheen shine
  
	 South Bend (Indiana), March 3 (AP): Activist-actor Martin Sheen will be honoured by the University of Notre Dame with its Laetare Medal for his humanitarian work, the school announced yesterday.
   
	Sheen, who played a US President who was a Notre Dame graduate in the TV series The West Wing, is to receive the medal at a function on May 18.
   
	Since 1883, the Laetare Medal has been awarded annually to a Catholic whose genius has ennobled the arts and sciences, illustrated the ideals of the church and enriched the heritage of humanity. Past recipients include President John F. Kennedy
  
	Judd storm
  
	 Franklin, Tennessee (AP): Wynonna Judd knows what the people of Tennessee went through the night tornadoes hit last month  because she took cover from them herself. Her children Elijah and Grace hid in a storage area under the stairs when the storms swept through, and she hung on outside their cubbyhole as the winds shook the house, the country singer said. Our road looks like a war zone. Its pretty bad, said Judd, who took part in a benefit concert on Friday for residents affected by the tornado. Judd, who lives on an 325-hectare farm, said the storm damaged her home, knocked down several trees and tore off part of a barn roof.
  
	Soul Mercy
  
	 London (Reuters): Soul singer Duffy has topped the UK singles chart for a third week running with Mercy, the Official UK Charts Company said on Sunday. The Welsh newcomer, who has been compared to Amy Winehouse and Dusty Springfield, held off the dance hit Whats It Gonna Be, by DJs H Two and Manchester trio Platnum. In a barely-changed top 10, Canadian rock group Nickelback were steady at number three with Rockstar, while Swedish DJ Basshunter was at four with Now Youre Gone. Australian singer Kylie Minogue held on to the number five spot with Wow.
  
	Pro spoof
  
	 Los Angeles (AP): Will Ferrells basketball comedy Semi-Pro dribbled to the top of the weekend box office, but it fell short of his previous blockbuster openings in the sports spoof genre, according to studio estimates on Sunday. The New Line Cinema film grossed $15.3 million.

	Islamabad, Feb. 24: Pervez Musharrafs office scrambled today to deny a report that he was considering stepping down as President rather than waiting to be forced out.        
	The Sunday Telegraph of London quoted a close aide of Musharraf as saying that the President believed he had run out of options after three of the main parties who triumphed in last weeks poll announced they would form a coalition government, and also pledged to reinstate the countrys chief justice and 60 other judges sacked in November.        
	He has already started discussing the exit strategy for himself, a close friend said. I think it is now just a matter of days and not months because he would like to make a graceful exit on a high.         
	A US Senator added his voice to the chorus, saying it would probably be a good idea for Musharraf to look for a graceful exit. But Joseph Biden, the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, brushed aside the notion that rejection of Musharrafs supporters in the polls meant a setback to American operations against al Qaida and the Taliban.        
	Asked whether Musharrafs days are numbered, Strobe Talbott, the former US deputy secretary of state, told an Indian television channel: Yes. What that number is and how that plays itself out, whether it is impeachment or nobody here is going to judge.        
	However, the Pakistan Presidents spokesperson said: I think one should not attach much credence to the report. Nothing of this sort has been discussed in the Presidents office.        
	According to senior aides quoted by The Sunday Telegraph, Musharraf wants to avoid a power struggle with the newly elected parliament, in which his opponents will be close to the two-thirds majority needed to impeach him and remove him from office.        
	He may have made many mistakes, but he genuinely tried to build the country and he doesnt want to destroy it just for the sake of his personal office, said the official close to the President.        
	Musharraf, who stepped down as head of the army late last year, had called for a harmonious coalition after the defeat of his party  which won just 40 out of 272 national assembly seats in last Sundays elections  but his political rivals have demanded his exit.        
	Officials said he had considered resigning immediately after the election results were known, but had been persuaded by party loyalists that his sudden departure could precipitate a crisis.        
	In an article published last week, Musharraf insisted that he would serve out his five-year presidential term.        
	Behind the scenes, his staff attempted to broker an agreement with Asif Zardari, who became leader of the main Pakistan Peoples Party following the assassination of his wife, Benazir Bhutto.        
	Yet, despite pressure from the US, which has relied on Musharrafs support for its war on terror, Zardari apparently refused to strike a deal.

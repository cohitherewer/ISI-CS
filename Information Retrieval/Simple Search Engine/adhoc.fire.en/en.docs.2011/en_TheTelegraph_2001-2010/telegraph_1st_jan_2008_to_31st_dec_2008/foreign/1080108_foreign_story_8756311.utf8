	Naples, Jan. 7 (Reuters): Italys army shifted mountains of rubbish from schools and streets around Naples today to ease a two-week-old garbage crisis that has triggered violent protests by residents.
    
	Locals angered at plans to revive a landfill in their neighbourhood clashed with police while Prime Minister Romano Prodi held meetings with ministers to decide a plan of action for the area, where waste collection ground to a halt. 
    
	The protest was peaceful again by this evening but residents still expressed fury about the failure to deal with Napless long-running waste crisis. They are the killers  those (politicians) who promised that there will be no more dumping here, said a 42-year-old protester named Luciano.
    
	Protesters are trying to halt the re-opening of the waste dump, closed in 1996. But rubbish dumps in the Naples area are full and a massive incinerator which was supposed to open at the end of 2007 is not ready.

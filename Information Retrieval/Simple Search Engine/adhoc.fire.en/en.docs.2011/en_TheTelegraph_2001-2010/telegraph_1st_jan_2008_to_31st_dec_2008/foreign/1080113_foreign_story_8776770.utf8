	Islamabad, Jan. 12 (Reuters): A media watchdog said Pakistan had expelled a reporter for the New York Times who interviewed Taliban leaders and visited Baluchistan province. However, the government denied he was deported. It said the journalist, Nicholas Schmidle, was not expelled and left the country of his own volition.
    
	The journalist, Nicholas Schmidle, whose reportNext-Gen Taliban appeared in the magazine at the weekend, was deported on Friday, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said.
    
	The article contained interviews with anti-government Taliban leaders and was written from ... Baluchistan province, and its capital, Quetta, the New York-based watchdog said.
    
	The Committee quoted Scott Malcomson, Schmidles editor at the magazine, as saying that no explanation was given for the journalists deportation. However, he said, the deportation was clearly connected to his writing rather than anything else he was doing. 
    
	An information ministry official said Schmidle did not have a journalists visa.He was on a two-year fellowship here and had visited sensitive areas in Baluchistan without permission and did reporting. He was not on a journalist visa, the official said, on condition of anonymity.
    
	Initially a deportation order was served to him but it was later withdrawn. He left Pakistan on his own, he added.
    
	The CPJ expressed concern over growing attacks by the government of President Pervez Musharraf on media.
    
	Media flourished in Pakistan during Musharrafs rule but sweeping curbs were imposed on it after he imposed emergency rule on Nov. 3.
    
	Almost all private news channels were taken off the air while three journalists from Britains Daily Telegraph were expelled from the country.
    
	Emergency rule was lifted on Dec. 15 and most of the channels are back on air but none is running the popular talk shows that infuriated the government.
    
	The government rejects criticism on media curbs.
    
	The media in Pakistan is the freest ever in the history of the country. There is no restriction whatsoever on media in Pakistan, an information ministry spokesman said this week.

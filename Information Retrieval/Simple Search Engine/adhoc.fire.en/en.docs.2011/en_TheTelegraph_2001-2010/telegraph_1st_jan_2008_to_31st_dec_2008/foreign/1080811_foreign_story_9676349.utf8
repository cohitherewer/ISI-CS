	 Uinted Nations (Reuters): Ambassadors from the US and Libya exchanged hugs and kisses at the UN Security Council last week in an unusual public display of affection between the former arch enemies. US ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and his Libyan counterpart Giadalla Ettalhi embraced after a meeting of the council on Iraq. A reporter asked Khalilzad if the show of affection meant that good relations between the two countries had reached a new high.

Khalilzad said it was a tradition to congratulate the grooms father.

	Monster jeans    
	 Lima, Nov. 1 (Reuters): Peruvian seamstresses hoping to snag a Guinness World Record for sewing the largest pair of blue jeans celebrated yesterday, one day after cranes buckled while trying to lift the giant 7.5-tonne pants.      
	Workers laid the pair on the ground and put big balloons inside the legs to show off the size of the jeans, which are 43mtall and 30m wide. They have pockets, red buttons and a brown belt.      
	 Thursday, disillusioned crane operators gave up trying to lift the pants with three machines and went looking for a fourth. They wanted to lift the pants to display them.

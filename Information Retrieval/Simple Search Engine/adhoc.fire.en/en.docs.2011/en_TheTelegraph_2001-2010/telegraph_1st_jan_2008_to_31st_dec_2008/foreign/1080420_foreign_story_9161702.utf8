The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Recount of votes begins in Harare
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Recount of votes begins in Harare
                            
	Harare, April 19 (Reuters): Zimbabwe began a partial recount of votes from the March 29 elections today, despite Opposition efforts to block it and widespread fears that political stalemate could erupt into violence.        
	Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, accused of treason by the government, said in Johannesburg he feared being attacked or imprisoned if he returned to the country.        
	The recount in 23 of 210 constituencies could overturn the results of the parliamentary election, which showed President Robert Mugabes ruling Zanu-PF losing its majority to the Opposition Movement for Democratic Change.        
	Zanu-PF lost 16 of those 23 constituencies in the original count, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission said. The ruling party needs to win nine more seats for a simple majority in parliament. Results of a parallel presidential ballot have not been released.

	Washington, Nov 27 (PTI) The Bush Administration and President-elect Barack Obama today strongly condemned the deadly attacks in Mumbai, offering assistance to the Indian government and convening defence and intelligence officials amid a "grave and urgent threat" of terrorism.
    "President (George W) Bush offers his condolences to the Indian people and the families of the innocent civilians killed and injured in the attacks in Mumbai, India," White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said in a statement.
    The United States condemns this terrorist attack -- which left at least 80 people dead and over 275 injured -- and will continue to stand with the people of India in this time of tragedy, she said.
    "This afternoon, the White House National Security Council convened officials from counter-terrorism and intelligence agencies as well as the State and Defence Departments," Perino said.
    "The US government continues to monitor the situation, including the safety and security of our citizens, and stands ready to assist and support the Indian government," the senior White House official said, adding the President has been updated regularly.
    Strongly condemning a series of coordinated attacks in India's financial hub, Obama said it only demonstrated "the grave and urgent threat" of terrorism and nations must work to "root out and destroy terrorist networks." "President-elect Obama strongly condemns terrorist attacks in Mumbai, and his thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and the people of India," Obama's Chief National Security Spokesperson Brooke Anderson said in a statement.

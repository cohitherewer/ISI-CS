The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak wants US to widen scope
                                                                                                               Pak wants US to widen scope
                            
	Islamabad, March 26 (Reuters): Pakistan backs the US-led campaign against terrorism but a broad approach that includes political solutions is needed to tackle the problem, Pakistans new Prime Minister told President George W. Bush.        
	Two US envoys held talks with Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani today, a day after he was sworn in to lead a government set on re-evaluating policy on terrorism.        
	Musharraf, a former general who seized power in a 1999 coup, has been a staunch US ally since the September 11 attacks on the US but he has become increasingly isolated after his allies were defeated in the February 18 parliamentary elections.        
	Analysts say the US wants to ensure the new coalition government maintains Musharrafs commitment to tackling militants.        
	Some coalition leaders have spoken of the need to hold talks with militants and that has raised questions about Pakistans security strategy, especially with Musharrafs power ebbing.        
	Bush telephoned Gilani shortly after he was sworn in.        
	Pakistan would continue to fight terrorism in all its forms and manifestations since it is in Pakistans own national interest, Gilani told Bush, according to a government statement obtained today.        
	However, he said that a comprehensive approach is required in this regard, specially combining a political approach with development programmes, the government said.        
	Gilani is a senior leader inassassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party, which won the most seats in last months elections.        
	He is forming a coalition government with the party of another former Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, whose party came second, and at least other two smaller parties.        
	Musharrafs support for the US-led campaign has been unpopular with many Pakistanis who say he has been doing Americas bidding and only inciting militant violence.

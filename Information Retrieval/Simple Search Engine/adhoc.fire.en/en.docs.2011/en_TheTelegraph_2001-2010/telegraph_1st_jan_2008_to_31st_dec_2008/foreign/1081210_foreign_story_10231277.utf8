                              Oprah: Mad at myself                            
	Chicago, Dec. 9 (AP): When it comes to her weight, Oprah Winfrey has always been straightforward.        
	The talk show queen says in the January issue of magazine that she now weighs 90kg and has fallen off the wagon when it comes to healthy living. Im mad at myself, Winfrey writes in an article.        
	Im embarrassed, she writes. I cant believe that after all these years, all the things I know how to do, Im still talking about my weight. I look at my thinner self and think: How did I let this happen again?         
	In the piece, Winfrey, 54, details her recent struggles with an out-of-balance thyroid and how the condition made her develop a fear of working out.

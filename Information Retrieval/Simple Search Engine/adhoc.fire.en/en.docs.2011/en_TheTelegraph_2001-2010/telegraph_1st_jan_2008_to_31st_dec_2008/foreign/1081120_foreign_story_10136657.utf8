          ALASTAIR JAMIESON                          Hitler: The Screamer                                  
	London, Nov. 19: Hitler really did have only one ball, according to claims by a German army medic who saved the Fhrers life during World War I.         
	The Nazi leader lost a testicle during the Battle of the Somme in 1916, the doctor claimed.        
	The medical condition, for which there has never been conclusive proof, was mocked in the World War II ditty which begins: Hitler has only got one ball, the other is in the Albert Hall.        
	The revelation is made in a document noting a conversation in the 1960s between German war doctor Johan Jambor and his priest, Franciszek Pawlar, according to The Sun. The priests document has come to light 23 years after Jambors death.         
	Although it was known Hitler suffered a groin injury in the Somme, evidence that he was monorchic  the medical word for the condition  has evaded historians.         
	Blassius Hanczuch, a friend of Jambor, said the doctor later blamed himself for saving Hitlers life. He said: In 1916 they had their hardest fight in the Battle of the Somme. For several hours, Johan and his friends picked up injured soldiers. He remembers Hitler. They called him the Screamer. He was very noisy. Hitler was screaming help, help.        
	His abdomen and legs were all in blood. Hitler was injured in the abdomen and lost one testicle. His first question to the doctor was: Will I be able to have children?.        
	The popular song emerged in 1939 and is thought to have been written by a publicist for the British Council which was tasked with helping build propaganda that would damage the Nazis.         
	The commonly-recalled version is an adaption of the original, which ran: Gring has only got one ball, Hitlers [are] so very small, Himmlers so very similar, And Goebbels has no balls at all.

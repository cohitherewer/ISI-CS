                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Prachanda warns media: no criticism
                              fresh fears                            
	Kathmandu, May 31 (Agencies): Maoist chief Prachanda has warned the media of serious consequences if it continues to criticise the party.        
	However, the Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) criticised Prachandas comments, saying that it was a move aimed at the freedom of the press.        
	We will no longer tolerate criticism as we have already been elected by the people, Prachanda said addressing a rally in Kathmandu to celebrate the countrys transition to a republic. Targeting the Kantipur daily, the Maoist chief said: You journalists did well to continuously criticise the Maoists before the Constituent Assembly polls, otherwise the elections would not have taken place at all.        
	He added that other newspapers who also criticise the Maoists will meet the same fate.         
	Reacting to Prachandas comments, FNJ president Dharmendra Jha said: This has raised suspicion over the Maoists commitment towards a free press.         
	Gyanendra hunt        
	Nepals ousted King Gyanendra is looking for a house and consulting astrologers to find out when to quit the palace after a special Assembly abolished the monarchy, newspaper reports published today said. A historic Constituent Assembly vote on Wednesday turned Nepal into a republic and gave deposed King Gyanendra two weeks to leave the sprawling Narayanhity palace in the heart of the capital.        
	Gyanendra has not commented so far about the end of the 239-year-old monarchy, but state-run daily Gorkhapatra quoted a senior palace official as telling a government minister that the deposed monarch would honour the Assembly vote.         
	It said Gyanendra was looking for a house as his son Paras and his family were living in the private home in an upmarket area of Kathmandu where the dethroned king lived before ascending the throne in 2001.        
	The independent daily Naya Patrika said the 60-year-old Gyanendra did not want to leave the palace until early July when an astrological dark phase is due to end.        
	Astrologers have told Gyanendra it would be good if he could stick on to the Narayanhity palace till then, it said.        
	Nepals deposed Hindu monarchy was known for consulting astrologers and making major decisions only on certain auspicious days. The UN plans to probe the killing of three persons by the police in Kailali district of Nepal after protesters threw stones at a government building.

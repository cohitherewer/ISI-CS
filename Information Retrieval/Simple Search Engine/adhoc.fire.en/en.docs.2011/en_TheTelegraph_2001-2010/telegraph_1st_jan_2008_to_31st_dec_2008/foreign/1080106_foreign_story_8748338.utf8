The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sharif loses cool during interview
                                                                                                            Sharif loses cool during interview
                            
	Islamabad, Jan. 5 (PTI): Former Pakistan Premier Nawaz Sharif lost his cool at an interview when asked about an exile deal with the government.         
	According to the Business Plus TV channel, Sharifs aides seized the video tapes after the incident.        
	Nawaz got angry when I asked him why he first denied the existence of any exile deal with the government before his homecoming and later admitted that it was for only five years, Rana Mubashir, the channels news director who interviewed Sharif at his home in Lahore, told the Daily Times.        
	The Business Plus management alleged that the PML-N chiefs media manager Pervaiz Rasheed seized the tapes of the interview.        
	We were held hostage after the interview when Pervaiz Rasheed realised that Nawaz had used derogatory language against President Pervez Musharraf, the Chaudhry brothers and (PML-Q leader) Mushahid Hussain while answering one of my questions, said Mubashir.        
	When I asked why the Chaudhry brothers and Mushahid Hussain had left him after 11 years, Nawaz blew his top and asked his media manager to seize the tapes, Mubashir said.

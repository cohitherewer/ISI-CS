The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Putin lashes out at US
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Putin lashes out at US

	Moscow, Aug. 29: As Russia struggled to rally international support for its military action in Georgia, Vladimir V. Putin, the countrys paramount leader, lashed out at the US yesterday, contending that the White House may have orchestrated the conflict to benefit one of the candidates in the American presidential election.        
	 Putins comments in a television interview, his most extensive to date on Russias decision to send troops into Georgia earlier this month, sought to present the military operation as a response to brazen, cold war-style provocations by the US.         
	In tones that seemed alternately angry and mischievous, he suggested that the Bush administration may have tried to create a crisis that would influence American voters in the choice of a successor to President Bush.        
	The suspicion would arise that someone in the United States created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency in the United States, Putin said in an interview with CNN. He added, They needed a small victorious war.        
	Putin did not specify which candidate he had in mind, but there was no doubt that he was referring to Senator John McCain, the Republican. McCain is loathed in the Kremlin because he has a close relationship with Georgias president, Mikheil Saakashvili, and has called for imposing stiff penalties on Russia, including throwing it out of the Group of 8 industrialised nations.        
	Putin offered scant evidence to support his assertion.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

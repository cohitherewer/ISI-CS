	Different drill    
	 Bangkok, Nov. 23: (Reuters): A maverick Thai general who has threatened to bomb anti-government protesters and drop snakes on them from helicopters has been reassigned as an aerobics teacher, the Bangkok Post said recently.      
	Major-general Khattiya Sawasdipol, a Rambo-esque anti-communist fighter, reacted with disappointment to his new role as a military instructor promoting public fitness at marketplaces. It is ridiculous to send me, a warrior, to dance at markets, he said, before launching an attack on army chief Anupong Paochinda. The army chief wants me to be a presenter leading aerobics dancers. I have prepared one dance. Its called the throwing-a-hand-grenade dance, he said.    
	Mens bra    
	 Tokyo (Reuters): Who said bras are only for women? A Japanese online lingerie retailer is selling bras for cross-dressing men and theyve quickly become one of its most popular items. Since launching two weeks ago on Rakuten, a major Japanese web shopping mall, the Wishroom shop has sold over 300 mens bras for $30 each. The shop also stocks mens panties, as well as lingerie for women.    
	Girth mirth    
	 Ottawa (Reuters): Obese people have the right to two seats for the price of one on flights within Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled recently. The high court had declined to hear an appeal by Air Canada of a decision by the Canadian Transportation Agency that people who are functionally disabled by obesity deserve to have two seats for one fare.

	Islamabad, Aug. 20 (PTI): Former President Pervez Musharraf today made it clear that he will not fly away from Pakistan.         
	After listening to one of his favourite Mohammed Rafi songs, Chal ud ja re panchi ke ab ye des hua begana from the 1957 film Bhabhi, on his first day out of office yesterday, Musharraf said that he is no bird and that he will stay on in Pakistan.        
	Speaking to a friend, the former President said: I am here. I will not not run away. I am not a panchi who will fly away from Pakistan.        
	Responding to intense speculation in Pakistan and abroad about his future, Musharraf, who stepped down as President on Monday, denied reports that he would leave the country and settle elsewhere.        
	My resignation as President does not not reflect my defeat as I resigned in the interest of Pakistan and its people, Musharraf was quoted as saying by the Geo News channel yesterday.        
	The former army chief, who quit to avoid impeachment by the Pakistan Peoples Party-led ruling coalition, told the people who met him yesterday that he did not not intend to leave Pakistan as it was his first love.        
	Musharraf called the media reports saying that he would move to the US after a Mecca pilgrimage as baseless.         
	His son runs a well-established business in the US .        
	Musharraf met the visitors yesterday at the army chiefs residence in Rawalpindi called Camp Office. The former President has held on to the home even after stepping down as army chief last year.        
	Time for tennis        
	According to an aide, Musharraf seems to be enjoying life out of office, listening to music, mingling with family and friends and playing tennis.        
	He was in a good mood, very relaxed, said Tariq Azim, who was among 30 supporters who gathered at the house in Rawalpindi.         
	We used to meet him there in the past, but with no official duties, he was completely different.        
	Yesterday began with breakfast with his family and he was relaxed because there was no no hurry of going to office on time.        
	There were courtesy calls from old friends. Musharraf sought their views on his resignation, the future of Pakistan after his resignation and the election of the next President.         
	During a meeting with a delegation of the Opposition Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam) in Rawalpindi today, Musharraf said he had no immediate plans to join politics, he was quoted as saying by a PML-Q lawmaker.         
	Musharraf wanted to rest and relax, the lawmaker said.        
	PML-Q MP Marvi Memon, daughter of Musharraf loyalist and former minister Nisar Memon, said the former President made it clear that he would not leave the country.        
	Memon said the party would continue to benefit from the visionary leadership of Musharraf.        
	A court will conduct a hearing on a petition asking authorities to restrict Musharraf from travelling abroad.

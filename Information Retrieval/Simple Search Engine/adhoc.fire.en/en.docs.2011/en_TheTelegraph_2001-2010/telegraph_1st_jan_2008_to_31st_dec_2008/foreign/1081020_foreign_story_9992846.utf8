	Primitive druggies    
	 London, Oct. 19: Researchers have found equipment used to prepare hallucinogenic drugs for sniffing which date back to prehistoric South American tribes, reports The Sunday Telegraph.      
	Quetta Kaye, of University College London, and Scott Fitzpatrick, an archeologist from North Carolina State University, have found ceramic bowls, as well as tubes for inhaling drug fumes or powders in the Caribbean island of Carriacou which appear to have originated in South America between 100BC and 400BC and were then carried 400m to the islands. Scientists believe that the drug being used was cohoba, a hallucinogen made from the beans of a mimosa species.     
	Giant bite    
	 Tehran (Reuters): Iran has failed to register what it said would be the worlds largest sandwich in the Guinness World Records after people rushed forward and began eating it  before it was measured. Event organisers had planned to stuff the 1,500-meter-long sandwich with 700kg of ostrich meat and 700kg of chicken, and display it in a park in the capital Tehran. But as the sandwich was being measured, chaos ensued. The giant snack was gone in minutes, leaving the three Guinness representatives present with a dilemma.

	New York, June 29 (AP): A European Vogue cover supermodel fell to her death from her Manhattan apartment building yesterday in an apparent suicide, published reports said.        
	Ruslana Korshunova, 20, died in a fall from a building on Water Street, in Manhattans Financial District, The New York Post, the Daily News and Newsday reported. The newspapers cited unnamed officials and police.        
	The police said the fall was under investigation.        
	Witnesses described seeing her plunge from a ninth-floor balcony in the building yesterday afternoon.        
	Local media, citing the police sources, said there was no sign of a struggle inside her apartment and that Korshunova was believed to have leaped to her death.        
	A friend told The New York Post, however, that Korshunova had just returned from a modeling job in Paris and seemed on top of the world.        
	There were no signs, the unidentified friend was quoted as saying. I dont see one reason why she would do that.        
	Korshunova was represented in New York by IMG Models, a top-tier international agency that lists supermodels Kate Moss and Heidi Klum among its clients. A spokesperson for IMG said: Were shocked and our heart goes out to her family.         
	Originally from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, the almond-eyed, flowing-haired Korshunova appeared in advertisements and on runways for such designers as Marc Jacobs, Nina Ricci and DKNY. Vogue hailed her as a face to be excited about.

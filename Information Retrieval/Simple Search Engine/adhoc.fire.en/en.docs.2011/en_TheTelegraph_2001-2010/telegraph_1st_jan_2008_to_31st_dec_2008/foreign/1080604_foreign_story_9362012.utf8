	Bubbly sea test    
	 Paris, June 3 (Reuters): One of Frances oldest champagne producers is testing a new way of ageing its bubbly: on the seabed off northern France.      
	Louis Roederer wants to find out if its wine tastes better if it is kept in cold sea water and rocked by currents than in the cellars of the city of Reims, where it is normally stored.      
	Roederer said yesterday it had placed several dozen bottles 15 metres underwater in the bay of Mont Saint-Michel, a rocky tidal island off the coast of Normandy, last weekend.      
	A cellarman came up with the idea after realising that the water temperature in the bay, a constant 10 degrees Celsius, was ideal for ageing wine.      
	 12 months time, Roederer will hold a tasting session to compare champagne from the bottles kept on the seabed with those from its cellars.    
	Lennon bar    
	 New York (Reuters): John Lennons sons and widow, Yoko Ono, on Monday lost a battle to block the use of the song Imagine in the documentary Expelled: No Intelligence allowed.       
	Ono, her son Sean Ono Lennon, and Julian Lennon, John Lennons son from his first marriage, filed a suit in April seeking to bar the filmmakers from continuing to use Imagine.

	Dhaka, Sept. 9 (Reuters): The Bangladesh high court granted bail to detained former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia today, clearing the way for her release after 12 months behind bars on corruption charges.        
	The court bailed her on the remaining two of four charges brought after her arrest in September 2007 by the army-backed interim government.        
	Khaleda denied any wrongdoing while in power. Her lawyers said she would leave jail very soon. Now no further obstacle remains on her way to freedom, said attorney Rafiqul Haque. Officials said it might take one or two more days to complete the formalities for her release.        
	Khaledas arch rival and co-detainee, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was granted parole in June to travel to the US for treatment of ear and eye complaints. Last week the high court bailed Tareque Rahman, Khaledas son.

	London, Dec. 8: Dogs are prone to complex emotions such as jealousy and pride, according to scientific research that sheds new light on their relationship with humans.         
	Canines do not like seeing their owners offering affection to other creatures, especially other dogs, and react negatively when their owners bring home new partners, the research found.         
	Psychologists previously believed most animals lack the sense of self needed to experience so-called secondary emotions such as jealousy, embarrassment, empathy or guilt. These emotions are more complex than feelings associated with instant reaction. Friederike Range, of the University of Viennas neurobiology department, has shown that dogs feel intense jealously when they spot that they are unfairly treated.

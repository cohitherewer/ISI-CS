	Islamabad, Jan. 30 (AP): Pakistans deposed chief justice launched a withering attack today on President Pervez Musharraf, branding him an extremist general for sacking 60 judges and keeping his family, including his disabled seven-year old son, under house arrest for the past three months.
    
	Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhrys open letter, smuggled out of his Islamabad residence and addressed to western nations, showed how the US-backed leaders increasingly harsh attacks on his critics are backfiring  leaving the President in hotter political water as he struggles to cling onto power.
    
	On an official trip to Europe last week, Musharraf described the respected judge as inept and corrupt. 
    
	In response, Chaudhry penned a 7-page letter that was circulated today at a news conference held by sympathetic lawyers and delivered to the Islamabad embassies of the US, Britain, France and the EU. 
    
	In it, Chaudhry questioned Musharrafs legitimacy as head of state, and accused him of illegally changing the Constitution and squashing the judiciary for his own personal advantage. Is there a precedent in history, all history, of 60 judges including three chief justices (of Pakistani supreme and two of the high courts), being dismissed and arrested at the whim of one man? Chaudhry wrote. This incredible outrage has happened in the 21st century at the hands of an extremist general out on a charm offensive of western capitals and one whom the West supports.

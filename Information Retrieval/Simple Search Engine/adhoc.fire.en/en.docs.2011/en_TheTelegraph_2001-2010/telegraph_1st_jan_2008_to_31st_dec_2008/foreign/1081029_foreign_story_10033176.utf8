	New York/Detroit (Michigan), Oct. 28 (Reuters): General Motors Corp has asked the US government for roughly $10 billion in an unprecedented rescue package to support its acquisition of Chrysler LLC from Cerberus Capital Management, sources familiar with the talks said.        
	The government funding would include roughly $3 billion in exchange for preferred stock in a merged automaker, according to one of the sources, who was not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.        
	The US treasury department is considering a request for direct aid to facilitate the merger and a decision could come this week, sources familiar with the still-developing government response said yesterday.        
	The request for federal aid is being led by GM. The automakers chief executive, Rick Wagoner, was in Washington in recent days to lobby administration officials. Cerberus has not been involved in any of the lobbying efforts, a source familiar with the matter said.        
	GM has been in talks with Cerberus about buying Chrysler since last month but the discussions have been snagged by difficulty in securing investment or financing at a time when credit is tight and global auto sales are in rapid retreat, others close to the talks have said.        
	A decision by the Bush administration to provide the governments first funding for the auto sector since the $1.5 billion bailout of Chrysler in 1980 has been widely seen as the mergers best chance for success. The automakers are facing a maelstrom and thats why I think an unprecedented government infusion could happen, said Efraim Levy, an automotive equity analyst with S amp;P.        
	An injection of $3 billion in equity to support a GM acquisition of Chrysler would be roughly equivalent to the current, depressed value of the top US automaker. It would also give US taxpayers a large stake in the turnaround of a struggling auto industry that employs more than 350,000 American workers and is credited with supporting employment for another 4.5 million in related fields.        
	Analysts perceive GM, Chrysler and rival Ford Motor Co as driven to the brink of failure by a combination of management missteps, slowing global growth and problems in credit markets.        
	Now, in addition to taking a stake in what would be the worlds largest automaker by volume, the US government is also being asked to provide support by taking over some $3 billion in pension obligations, the first source said.        
	The final component of the proposed support would be a credit line that could include US government purchases of commercial paper to relieve short-term pressure on liquidity, the person said. GM could not immediately be reached for comment. Cerberus and Chrysler had no comment.        
	A combined GM-Chrysler would control roughly a third of the US auto market by sales and would face immediate pressure to cut costs stemming from excess capacity in almost every facet of its business.         
	Those would include a stable of 11 brands, some 10,000 dealers and 97,000 union-represented factory workers. But one of the conditions of a merger would be that GM-Chrysler spare as many jobs as possible to win broad political support for the government funding.

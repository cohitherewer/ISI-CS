	Author Charles Dickenss writing desk and chair at Christies in London on Wednesday. The desk where Dickens wrote Great Expectations and his final correspondence hours before his death will be sold at auction in June, Christies said on Wednesday. The writing desk and chair from the study of his Gads Hill residence near Rochester, Kent, was passed on by descent to Christopher Charles Dickens and his wife Jeanne-Marie Dickens. She then donated them to the Great Ormond Street childrens hospital in London, with which Dickens had a close association, so that they could be sold to raise funds. The items, included in the Christies valuable books and manuscripts sale on June 4, are expected to fetch 50-80,000. Charles Dickens was a champion of the poor and needy and an enthusiastic patron of Great Ormond Street hospital in its early days, said Jeanne-Marie Dickens. My husband shared his ancestors desire to help the disadvantaged and when I became aware of the fundraising needs of Great Ormond Street childrens hospital, I knew that I had to give the desk and chair to them. Dickens was an early patron of Great Ormond Street, and was a friend of its founder Charles West. The hospital also benefitted from the support of other famous British authors including Peter Pan creator J.M. Barrie and Oscar Wilde. In its early years, Great Ormond Street would organise fundraising events including the Annual Festival Dinner, where Dickens and Wilde both spoke. According to the hospitals website, it was an appearance by Dickens in 1858 which helped it overcome a funding crisis and expand its bed capacity to 75 from 20. According to Christies, Dickens wrote Great Expectations and a number of other late novels and short stories at the mahogany writing desk. The auctioneer quotes the memoirs of Dickenss eldest daughter Mamie Dickens saying that on the evening of June 8, 1870, Dickens wrote letters and arranged some trifling business matters in the library where the desk stood. He went for dinner and collapsed after suffering a stroke, and died the following day aged 58.

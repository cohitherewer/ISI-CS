The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Palin to blame: Poll
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Palin to blame: Poll

	Washington, Oct. 31: A growing number of voters have concluded that Senator John McCains running mate, Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska, is not qualified to be vice-president, weighing down the Republican ticket in the last days of the campaign, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.         
	All told, 59 per cent of voters surveyed said Palin was not prepared for the job, up nine percentage points since the beginning of the month. Nearly a third of voters polled said the vice-presidential selection would be a major factor influencing their vote for President, and those voters broadly favour Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee.        
	And in a possible indication that the choice of Palin has hurt McCains image, voters said they had much more confidence in Obama to pick qualified people for his administration than they did in McCain.        
	After nearly two years of campaigning, a pair of hotly contested nominating battles, a series of debates and an avalanche of advertisements, the nationwide poll found the contours of the race hardening in the last days before the election on Tuesday.         
	The survey found that Obama and McCains opinions had hardened considerably, as 9 out of 10 voters who said they had settled on a candidate said their minds were made up. A growing number of them called it extremely important that their candidate win the election.

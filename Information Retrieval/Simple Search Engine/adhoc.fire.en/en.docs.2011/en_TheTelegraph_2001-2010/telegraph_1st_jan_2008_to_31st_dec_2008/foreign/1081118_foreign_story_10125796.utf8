	Free ride for name    
	 Milan, Nov. 17 (Reuters): You name it, you ride it.      
	 Internet contest to name the new M-346 combat jet trainer has elicited more than 2,000 ideas. First prize includes a free ride.      
	Manufacturer Alenia Aermacchi, a subsidiary of Italys aerospace and defence giant Finmeccanica, is not revealing any names, but aviation buffs at Internet forums have proposed choices like the Pizza Pie, Italian Stallion, Turbo Pigeon and Pompeii.      
	In-house aircraft naming competitions are common enough. But the month-long Internet contest, taking entries until November 23, has drawn far-flung responses from countries such as Britain, the US, Canada, Indonesia, Bahrain, Turkey, the Philippines and Slovenia. Name contest entry forms are available at http://concorsom346.aermacchi.it.

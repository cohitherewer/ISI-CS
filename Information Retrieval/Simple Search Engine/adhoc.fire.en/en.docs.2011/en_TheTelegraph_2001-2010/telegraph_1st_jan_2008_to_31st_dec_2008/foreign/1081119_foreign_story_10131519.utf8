The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Australia sends navy on 2-month vacation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Australia sends navy on 2-month vacation
                            
	Canberra, Nov. 18 (Reuters): Australias navy has been sent on a two-month Christmas vacation, with military chiefs saying today the long shutdown would not leave the country unprotected and was the only way to deal with staff shortages.        
	Navy commanders ordered all ships not on overseas operations to return to port over the traditional holiday, while docked vessels would have only a skeleton staff to maintain on-board security as other staff took leave.        
	The stand down will not impact operations and is to ensure that our people who are not required on operations are able to take a meaningful period of time off and spend time with their families, deputy navy chief Rear Admiral Davyd Thomas said.        
	The navy, one of Asias most advanced, faces serious staff shortages, with 2,020 skilled vacancies and a 27-per cent yearly recruitment shortfall.        
	In March this year, the 12,000-strong navy admitted having only enough qualified submariners to operate half its six-boat submarine fleet, as the nations mining boom was drawing seamen to higher paying jobs in outback mines.

          MATTHEW MOORE                          Aniston: Familiar face                                  
	London, Oct. 29: The faces of different celebrities spark reactions in separate cells of our brains, according to a new Jennifer Aniston study that could pave the way for mind-reading technology.         
	The Jennifer Aniston neuron, as it has been dubbed, helps explain why we are able to recognise familiar faces so quickly.        
	When shown a picture of the Friends actress, a particular cell in peoples brains is fired up. Photos of other celebrities  such as Halle Berry, Tom Cruise or Oprah Winfrey  spark a reaction in entirely different cells, the study by neuroscientists at the University of Leicester showed.        
	The findings throw doubt on theories that humans process images using complex networks of brain cells. It appears that we assign individual cells to recognise faces we see regularly  from television stars and politicians to close friends and family. Quian Quiroga, who led the study, says his research will help the development of mind-reading medical technology.

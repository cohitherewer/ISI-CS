	Survivor shoes    
	 London, March 1: A pensioner told yesterday how she has had the same pair of shoes for almost 70 years, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Kathleen Dodd, 87, was in the Land Army during World War II and was issued with the shoes as part of her uniform.       
	The shoes saw her through three years of service, from 1941-44, and she continued to wear them for decades.       
	They also have deep sentimental value for Dodd because she was wearing them when she met her husband, Harry, who died shortly after their golden wedding anniversary 14 years ago.       
	She said: Im not sure why I have kept them. I think its for sentimental reasons.

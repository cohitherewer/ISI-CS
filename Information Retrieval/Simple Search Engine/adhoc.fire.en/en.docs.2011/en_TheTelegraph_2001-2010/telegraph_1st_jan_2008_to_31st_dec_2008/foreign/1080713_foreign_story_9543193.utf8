	Peshawar, July 12 (AP): A militant ambush and subsequent shootout today killed at least six security forces and three insurgents in Pakistans northwest, police said.        
	The clash underscores the shaky hold Pakistan has over stretches of its northwest, where Taliban- and al Qaida-linked militants are believed to have found safe havens and where insurgents have often clashed with Pakistani troops.        
	Meanwhile, the fate of a group of hostages held by Taliban fighters in the same region remained unclear hours after a militant-set deadline to start killing them passed.         
	Details of todays clash were in flux. Aslam Khan, a local police official in Hangu district, said a group of militants ambushed a Frontier Constabulary convoy in the Zargari area. The paramilitary forces returned fire.        
	He said six troops were killed along with three militants. But another police official in the area, Shaukat Ali, said at least nine security forces died as did four or five militants. Todays clash also came as Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited Pakistan on a surprise, one-day trip. US embassy officials confirmed the visit but said they had no details on Mullens itinerary.        
	Hangu district has witnessed unrest in the past few days since the arrest of a suspected militant leader known as Rafiuddin. Pakistani Taliban spokesman Maulvi Umar said yesterday that militants had captured 29 people, most of them security forces, and would start killing them if the government did not release Rafiuddin and several other insurgent prisoners by 2pm today.        
	Hangu district official Haji Khan Afzal said only 16 or 17 people were being held.        
	Negotiations over the captives were reported to be continuing today and the hostages status remained unclear by the evening.        
	Afzal said the hostages were taken in the wake of a militant siege of a local police station earlier in the week.        
	Officials said more than 100 militants surrounded the Doaba station to demand their associates be freed, and the siege ended after army troops appeared.        
	Rafiuddin, an alleged deputy to top Pakistani Taliban commander Baitullah Mehsud in the South Waziristan tribal region, was believed to be among those prisoners.        
	Strong protest        
	Mortar shells fired from Afghanistan wounded six Pakistani security forces along the border as Pakistan lodged a strong protest with Nato, the armys top spokesman said.        
	The six mortars were fired overnight yesterday and fell close to a military post in the town of Angore Adda in the South Waziristan region, Major General Athar Abbas said. Pakistani forces immediately returned fire, and casualties were reported on the other side, he said. This was mortar fire from the Afghan side, Abbas said.        
	Whether it was foreign forces or Afghan forces its yet to be determined. Asked if militants across the border could have been behind the firing, Abbas said he did not want to speculate. US officials in Afghanistan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

	Baghdad, Dec. 14 (Reuters): President George W. Bush made a farewell visit to Baghdad today, flying in secret out of Washington just weeks before he bequeaths the unpopular Iraq war to President-elect Barack Obama.        
	Bush held talks with President Jalal Talabani and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and was due to address US troops. He made a show of the improved security in Baghdad after five years of sectarian bloodshed by landing in daylight and venturing out beyond the heavily fortified international Green Zone.        
	Bushs visit was intended to thank US troops for their efforts and pat the Iraqis on the back for all theyve accomplished this last year, said General Douglas Lute, White House coordinator for Iraq and Afghanistan.        
	Bush arrived first by helicopter at the presidential palace for talks with Talabani and his two Vice-Presidents.        
	Talabani called Bush a great friend of the Iraqi people who helped us to liberate our country and to reach this day, when we have democracy, human rights, and prosperity gradually in our country.         
	He said he hoped that friendship would continue when Bush went back to Texas after leaving the presidency.        
	Bushs trip  his fourth to Iraq since the 2003 US-led invasion  follows approval of a security pact between Washington and Baghdad last month that paves the way for US forces to withdraw by the end of 2011.        
	Bush, beaming with obvious delight during the meeting with Talabani, said he had come to herald the passage of the security pact.         
	And the work hasnt been easy, but it has been necessary for American security, Iraqi hope, and world peace, he said.        
	The pact has its critics in Iraq, who doubt the US will live up to its promise to leave Iraqi cities by the end of June next year and withdraw completely by end-2011.

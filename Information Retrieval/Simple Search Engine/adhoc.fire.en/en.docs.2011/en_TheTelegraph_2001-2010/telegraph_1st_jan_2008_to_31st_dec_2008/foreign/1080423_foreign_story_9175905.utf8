	Washington, April 22 (Reuters): Hillary Clinton warned Tehran today that if she were President, the US could totally obliterate Iran in retaliation for a nuclear strike against Israel.        
	On the day of a crucial vote in Pennsylvania, the New York senator said she wanted to make clear to Tehran what she was prepared to do as President with the hope that this warning would deter any Iranian nuclear attack against Israel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nuclear Khan seeks freedom
                                                                                                               Nuclear Khan seeks freedom
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                               
	Islamabad, April 2: The father of Pakistans nuclear programme, Abdul Qadeer Khan, today hoped that the new coalition government would free him soon.         
	I am being kept under illegal detention and my health is deteriorating, Khan told the English-language daily The Nation in an interview.         
	He said official claims of the government about his physical well-being do not carry weight, adding that the cardinal cause of his bad health was his solitary confinement.         
	Khan was put under house arrest by President Pervez Musharraf in Islamabad after an investigation was launched in late 2003 and he confessed on television in early 2004 to passing nuclear secrets and materials to Iran, North Korea and Libya.        
	Lionised by many Pakistanis as the father of the countrys atomic bomb, Khan escaped more severe punishment. Khan rejected the impression he was kept under detention for his own security.        
	It is nothing but a lame excuse, Khan was quoted as saying in the interview carried on his birthday. He turned 72 yesterday. It is simply irrational. I was roaming around the world freely at times when in 1979 numerous fake cases had been registered against me in Holland and I faced no security threat.        
	Army changes        
	Pakistani army chief General Ashfaq Kayani has appointed a new head of Military Intelligence, an army spokesman said today, in a widely expected move to replace a close confidant of President Pervez Musharraf.        
	Major-General Muhammad Asif has been appointed as chief of Military Intelligence and Major-General Nadeem Ijaz has been posted out, military spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas said.

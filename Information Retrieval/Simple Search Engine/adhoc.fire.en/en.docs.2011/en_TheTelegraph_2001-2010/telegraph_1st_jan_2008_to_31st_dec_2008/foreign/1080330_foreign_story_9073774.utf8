The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Terrorism fight on top of agenda, says Gilani
                                                                                                               Terrorism fight on top of agenda, says Gilani

	Islamabad, March 29 (Reuters): Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani laid out plans today for his governments first 100 days, saying the fight against terrorism, poverty and unemployment would be on top of his agenda.        
	Gilani, a top official from assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos party, secured the unanimous approval of the National Assembly earlier today without a vote of confidence after the Opposition said it supported him.        
	A new Prime Minister is required by the Constitution to secure the backing of the lower house of parliament.        
	Shortly after the National Assembly Speaker announced that Gilani had secured unanimous approval, he began to lay out his coalition governments plans. Terrorism and extremism are our greatest problems. They have put the country in danger. Therefore, it is our first priority to bring peace to the country and fight terrorism, Gilani said.        
	The government would be willing to talk to militants who laid down their arms, he said.        
	Militants responsible for a wave of bombings and attacks on the security forces in recent months are based in remote ethnic pashtun tribal areas on the Afghan border.        
	Gilani said the tribal areas needed comprehensive economic, social and political reforms and the regions separate laws would be scrapped, as human rights groups have long demanded.        
	Last months election was a major step in restoring civilian rule in nuclear-armed Pakistan, which has been ruled by the military for more than half its history since 1947. Gilani praised the new army chief for his steps to remove the military from civil affairs.        
	He did not mention Musharraf but said his government would play a role in reinstating judges Musharraf dismissed in November.        
	The coalition partners have pledged to reinstate the judges Musharraf sacked out of fear they would rule as unconstitutional his re-election in October by the old Assembly. If reinstated, they are expected to take up legal challenges to the President.        
	Gilanis government has inherited a range of economic problems including widening trade and fiscal deficits, rising prices and power shortages.        
	He told parliament poverty was a huge problem and his government would seek to create jobs in the public and private sectors.

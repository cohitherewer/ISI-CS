          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, Sept. 15: President Asif Ali Zardari will have the issue of border violations by US troops in Pakistani territory high on his agenda during talks with his President George Bush on September 21.         
	The main item on the Presidents itinerary is to address the UN General Assembly, but he will utilise this opportunity to meet President Bush and express Islamabads concern on frequent missile strikes by US drones on Pakistani tribal regions, official sources told The Telegraph.         
	This will be Zardaris first visit to the US after becoming President.

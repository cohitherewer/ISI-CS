                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nepal row over firing of Indian priests
                            
	Kathmandu, Dec. 30 (PTI): The Nepal governments decision to remove south Indian priests from the Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu has resulted in a bitter row.        
	The Nepali Congress party and local pro-Hindu groups have criticised the Maoist-led government for removing south Indian Brahmins from the temple and appointing local priests in their place.        
	 The party said the removal of the priests was not done through the proper process.        
	The way the Maoist government replaced the priests serving at the Pashupatinath temple without fulfilling any formality has hurt the religious sentiments of the Hindu people of Nepal, said party chief Laxman Ghimire.         
	He said their removal, based on a personal decision of the Pashupatinath Area Development Trust secretary , is a violation of the rules. However, secretary Parmananda Shakya said the trust appointed the new priests only after the south Indians resigned from their posts.        
	 They were accused of siphoning off the funds of the temple.

	Islamabad, Feb. 14 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf issued a warning to Opposition parties to accept the result of Mondays election and not resort to agitation if it goes against them, while guaranteeing it will be free and fair.        
	They should not be under any illusion that they will bring people to the streets after the election. Nothing of that sort will be allowed, Musharraf said in comments at a seminar telecast today by the state-run Pakistan Television. In this situation of extremism and terrorism, no agitation, anarchy or chaos can be acceptable.        
	Musharraf, who came to power as a general in a 1999 coup, quit as army chief in November after securing a second five-year term in circumstances his foes describe as unconstitutional. Mondays vote is for a new National Assembly and provincial Assemblies, and a hostile new parliament could seek his ouster.        
	Opposition parties have accused the government of trying to rig the polls to favour Musharrafs allies and have threatened to launch protests if they feel cheated.        
	Dont show arrogance if you win, and show grace if you lose, accept the results, Musharraf said, rejecting the Oppositions allegations.        
	I am conscious of the fact that the elections should be free, fair and transparent and they have to be seen free, fair and transparent and also peaceful. The entire world is watching us, he said.        
	I guarantee that these will be free and fair.        
	He said there could be lower-level tactical irregularities by candidates but the government would not be involved.        
	The US and Pakistans other western allies fear instability in nuclear-armed Pakistan could play into the hands of militants linked to al Qaida and the Taliban.        
	Violence has intensified in the country in the run-up to the vote that was delayed from January 8 after the assassination of Opposition leader and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.        
	Her Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), led by her widower Asif Ali Zardari, is expected to emerge as the largest party in the 342-seat National Assembly partly due to sympathy.        
	Earlier this week, Zardari met Nawaz Sharif, the Prime Minister Musharraf overthrew, to discuss how to fight for democracy. Zardari said the PPP would go to any extent to protest a rigged election, without elaborating.        
	US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice yesterday said she was concerned about election violence in Pakistan.        
	At least 24 persons have been killed and more than 30 wounded in bomb attacks on political workers in the last week alone.        
	Musharraf described Mondays vote as mother of all elections and urged international opinion poll firms not to incite trouble by pre-judging results.        
	Dont destroy peace of this country. Dont destroy peace of this region. You are playing with the peace of the world, said Musharraf, whose job approval ratings have plummeted.        
	A BBC World Service/Gallup Pakistan poll, conducted in late January, found that almost two-thirds of Pakistanis say the prompt resignation of Musharraf would improve security, while less than a third view his November re-election as valid.         
	Thousands turned out today in the eastern city of Faisalabad to hear Zardari. Armed police and bodyguards ringed the stage, and snipers stood on rooftops. A flak jacket appeared to bulge through Zardaris shawl as he told the crowd the party would keep up the fight against dictatorship.

	Houston, Sept. 11 (Reuters): Thousands of people fled coastal areas in the path of Hurricane Ike today as the storm gathered strength on its collision course with the Texas coast.        
	Ike is a Category 2 storm with 160kmph winds and could grow to a ferocious Category 4 storm on the five-step intensity scale with winds of 213kmph before coming ashore late tomorrow or early on Saturday, the National Hurricane Centre said.         
	The latest projections pointed Ike toward the middle of the Texas coast, skirting to the west of the main region for offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico.

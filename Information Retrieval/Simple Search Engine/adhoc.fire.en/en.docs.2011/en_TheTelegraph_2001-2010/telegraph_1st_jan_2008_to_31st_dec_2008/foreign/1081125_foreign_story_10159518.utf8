The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama savours life as plain old Barack
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Obama savours life as plain old Barack
          ELI SASLOW AND PETER SLEVIN                          Obama in Chicago. (AP)                                  
	Washington, Nov. 24: A familiar number showed up on Terry Links mobile phone last week, the one that belonged to the friend he tutored in politics, dominated in golf and sometimes referred to playfully as Ears.        
	At least once each week for almost a decade, the Illinois state senator had talked on the phone to Barack Obama, but now the number seemed to belong to somebody else. This time I answered, Hello, Mr President, Link said. When he called, it used to just be Hey, Barack. Whats going on? But plain old Barack is gone.        
	Obamas home in Chicagos Hyde Park neighbourhood has become a compound guarded ever more closely by bomb-sniffing dogs and Secret Service agents who peer through binoculars at neighbouring rooftops. When he travels around the city, it is in an armoured limousine and 20-car motorcade, so he has mainly stayed bunkered at home or a downtown transition office. Last week, Obama told one friend that he felt a little boxed in.        
	This is only the beginning of the transformation that awaits the President-elect and his family. In two months, they will move into a sterile house in an unfamiliar city where they have never felt particularly comfortable.         
	Friends say Obama is savouring these final weeks in Chicago and spending as much time as possible with his family before he takes the oath of office on January 20.        
	During his political rise, Obama safeguarded times of normalcy and credited them for keeping him sane. A run on the treadmill in the early morning. An evening meander through 57th Street Books. Date night with his wife, Michelle, at one of their favourite restaurants. Basketball at a gym downtown.        
	Obama already has learned that his mundane routine will be difficult to replicate as President, but his friends say that establishing some kind of similar comfort zone is critical to his success in Washington. They consider it one of the most pressing  and most challenging  issues of Obamas transition: How can he create a life as President that keeps him happy?        
	Look, there are just certain things that he cant do anymore, or he cant do as easily, and thats going to be hard, said Marty Nesbitt, Obamas closest friend in Chicago. The objective is to just make sure that things stay as similar to the way they used to be as they can. The same routines, the same conversations  thats what he wants.        
	The Obamas have said they will personalise the White House by buying a dog and hosting sleepovers for their daughters. Friends expect them to occasionally spend time back in their Hyde Park home and take annual vacations to Hawaii. Inside the White House, Obama, by instinct an introvert, can write in his office, alone and unbothered.

	Bloody bite    
	 Helsinki, Dec. 22 (AFP): Finnish police believe they have caught a car thief thanks to a DNA sample taken from his blood found inside a mosquito.      
	Last June, a car was stolen in Lapua, some 380km north of Helsinki. It was later found near a railway station in Seinaejoki, about 25km from where it was stolen. A police patrol carried out an inspection of the car and they noticed a mosquito that had sucked blood. It was sent to the laboratory for testing. It showed that the blood belonged to a man who was in the police registers, inspector Sakari Palomaeki said.      
	The suspect, who has been interrogated, has insisted he did not steal the car, saying he had hitch-hiked and was given a lift by a man driving the car.    
	Comic Marx    
	Tokyo (AP): Just in time for Christmas, Karl Marx is finding a new audience among Japanese comic book fans. The manga edition of his masterpiece, Das Kapital, hit Japanese bookstores this month and sold about 6,000 copies in its first few days, said Yusuke Maruo of EastPress Co. I think people are looking to Marx for answers to the problems with the capitalist society, Maruo said. Obviously, the recent global crisis suggests that the system isnt working.

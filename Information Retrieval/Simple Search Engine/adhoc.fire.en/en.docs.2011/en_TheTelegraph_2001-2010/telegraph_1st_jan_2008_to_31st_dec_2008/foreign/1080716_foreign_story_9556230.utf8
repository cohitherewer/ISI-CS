	London, July 15: Spectators planning to attend the Beijing Olympics next month have been warned to avoid nudity, swearing and drunkenness.         
	Issuing the Spectators House Rules along with a campaign billed as Good Habit for a Good Games , the Beijing Olympics committee set out how they expect those attending the event to conduct themselves to prevent causing embarrassement for their hosts.         
	Large banners and flags are banned, with a view to preventing the political protests the authorities fear, while vices such as gambling along with streaking are also prohibited. The eclectic rules include a warning that while fountain pens, suntan lotion and lip gloss are permitted, they must only be brought along in small quantities.

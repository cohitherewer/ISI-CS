The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Blasts in Lahore juice shops and salon
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Blasts in Lahore juice shops and salon

	Lahore, Oct. 7 (Agencies): Five persons, including a woman and two children, were injured after three low-intensity explosions rocked three shops within 15 minutes in Lahores Garhi Shahu area, witnesses and rescue workers said.        
	The first two blasts hit juice shops while the third exploded in a hairdressing salon.         
	Special Superintendent of Police (Operations) Chaudhry Shafique told reporters the third explosion took place after a bomb disposal squad reached the area. Their vehicle was damaged in the blast.         
	Police cordoned off the area and ambulances rushed the injured to hospital. The bomb disposal squad combed the area for more explosives.        
	Garhi Shahu has a mix of private homes and commercial outlets and is usually crowded well past midnight. The blasts caused panic in the city and people rushed back home.         
	Pakistan has been rocked by a wave of blasts and suicide attacks since July last year. A suicide attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad last month killed nearly people, including the Czech ambassador.         
	Sajjad Bhutta, a city official, said the bombs appeared designed to spread panic and fear rather than to kill anyone.         
	He said local religious hardliners might have planted them to scare young unmarried couples who frequent the area. However, he offered no evidence and no group claimed responsibility.        
	Lahore lies far from the western border, where Islamic militants blamed for attacks in both Pakistan and Afghanistan have found refuge. But it has not been spared from the violence.        
	On January 10, a suicide bomber blew himself up among police guarding a court, killing 24 people and wounding scores more.         
	Militant talks        
	Having escaped assassination by a suicide bomber last week, an influential politician in northwest Pakistan said today he was ready to negotiate with Islamist militants if they laid down arms. I want to make it clear that I cant negotiate at gunpoint, Asfandyar Wali Khan, head of the ruling party in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), told a news conference in Peshawar.        
	The bomber killed himself and three others in the attack near Khans house in the town of Charsadda last week.        
	Pakistani Taliban based in the lawless ethnic Pashtun tribal lands bordering Afghanistan had claimed responsibility.        
	I again appeal to these people, even though they have taken responsibility for the attack, that they come and sit because issues can be resolved through talks not through guns, Khan said.        
	After coming to power in March, Khans Awami National Party struck peace deals with the militants in the hope of ending violence in the province where hundreds of people have perished in a wave of suicide and bomb attacks since mid-2007.        
	However, the militants scrapped the peace deals after security forces launched operations against them in nearby tribal areas, regarded as havens for al Qaida and Taliban militants.         
	The death toll from a suicide attack on a Pakistani Opposition politicians home rose to 17, police said today, a day after the bomber struck in the town of Bhakkar, deep in the central province of Punjab. Investigators said they found the head of the bomber, and from its appearance he appeared to come from the nearby militant-infested tribal lands.        
	He was around 30 years-old and looks as if he was ethnic Pashtun from a tribal area. Probably he had links with militants there, Punjab police chief Shaukat Javed said.        
	The latest attack targeted a parliamentarian from the party of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Rashid Akbar Khan Nawani, a member of Pakistans Shia minority, had spoken out in the parliament against a surge in sectarian violence several times recently.

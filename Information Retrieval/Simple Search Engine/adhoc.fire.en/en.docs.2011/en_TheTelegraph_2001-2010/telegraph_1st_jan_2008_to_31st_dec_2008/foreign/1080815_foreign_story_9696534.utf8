	Kathmandu, Aug. 14: Maoist chief Prachanda is poised to be elected as the first Prime Minister of the Nepal republic in elections to be held tomorrow.         
	Prachanda filed his nomination papers for the polls after signing a seven-point power sharing agreement with the Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist (CPN-UML), the third-largest party in the Constituent Assembly, and the ethnic Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (MJF), the fourth-largest.         
	Prachandas nomination was proposed by CPN-UML chief Jhalanath Khanal and seconded by MJF leader Upendra Yadav.         
	However, the Nepali Congress chose to contest the poll by nominating former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba as its candidate.         
	The election, however, is turning out to be purely symbolic in nature as none of the parties, except the Nepali Congress, are keen to support Deuba. The Congress, which is the oldest party in the Assembly, opted to stay out of the coalition government after several differences with the Maoists over the defence portfolio.

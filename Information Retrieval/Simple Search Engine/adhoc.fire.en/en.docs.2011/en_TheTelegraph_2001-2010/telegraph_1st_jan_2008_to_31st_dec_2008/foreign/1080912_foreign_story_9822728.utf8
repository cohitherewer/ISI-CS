	Dhaka, Sept. 11 (Reuters): Bangladeshs army-backed interim government freed former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia on bail today after a year in prison on alleged graft charges, paving the way for a credible election to restore democracy.        
	She was arrested on September 3 last year in an anti-corruption drive by the interim authority, but the high court granted her bail on Tuesday on the last of four charges she faced.        
	Analysts said the release of Khaleda and her rival, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is now on parole, was important to ensure their parties took part in a parliamentary election planned for December that would be fair and peaceful.        
	Khaleda herself confirmed the participation of her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in the coming polls.        
	Thousands of supporters and party officials greeted Khaleda, 63, after she left the jail and drove to the graveside of her slain husband, former President Ziaur Rahman. She then went to a city hospital to visit her ailing son and political heir Tareque Rahman, and announced he had resigned from his top party post.        
	Tareque has relieved himself of the post of senior joint secretary-general of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Khaleda said. His treatment may take three to four years, she added. He was expected to fly to Britain tonight for treatment of what his doctors say is a broken spine.         
	Tareque will be away from politics until he fully recovers, she said, adding that her party would take part in the December parliamentary elections.

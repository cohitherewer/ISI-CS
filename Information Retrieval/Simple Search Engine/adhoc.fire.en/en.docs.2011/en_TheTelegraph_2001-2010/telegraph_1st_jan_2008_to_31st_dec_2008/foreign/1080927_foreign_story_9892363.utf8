The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China astronauts enjoy spicy food
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       China astronauts enjoy spicy food
                            
	Beijing, Sept. 26 (Reuters): Chinas third manned space mission today reached its final orbit where astronauts preparing for the countrys first spacewalk enjoyed spicy food and the convenience of an onboard toilet.        
	The Shenzhou VII blasted off from a remote desert site yesterday on a trip designed to showcase Chinas technological mastery and crown the success of the Beijing Olympics.        
	The launch, part of a space programme that could eventually lead to a landing on the moon, was watched by millions of Chinese and the event has dominated state media.        
	The craft is circling at 343km above the Earth, orbiting every 90 minutes, preparing for what a senior engineer said would be the most challenging part of the mission.        
	For the space walk the demands are higher, and the challenge is more difficult, he told state television.        
	Zhai Zhigang, who dreamt of flying into space as an impoverished teenager, is expected to make Chinas first footprint in space tomorrow at about 0830GMT and which will last up to half-an-hour.        
	As this is the first time weve done a space walk, there are a lot of uncertainties, and so the time may be changed depending on the situation, programme spokesman Wang Zhaoyao told a news conference. One of the main features of this mission is that it involves great risk ... (namely) the execution of the space walk.        
	The son of a snack vendor, Zhai will wear a Chinese-designed space suit, named after a flying Buddhist goddess and with a price tag of 30 million yuan ($4.40 million), the official Xinhua agency said.        
	Astronauts began to unpack and assemble the indigenous Feitian extra-vehicular activity suit in preparation for the first spacewalk, Xinhua said.        
	Feitian, which means flying the sky, has 10 layers and weighs about 120 kg. It takes up to 15 hours for an astronaut to assemble and put on.        
	The worst-case scenario for me is becoming a real spaceman  that is, never coming back again once I get out of the spacecraft, the China Daily quoted Zhai as saying before take-off, but he added that there was no chance his equipment would fail.        
	The 42-year-old from the frigid northeastern Heilongjiang province, who has spent a decade training to fly into space, will also be able to have a private phone chat with his family.         
	A colleague will wait in the orbital module in a Russian suit for backup. The men will assemble and test the suits on Friday, Xinhua said.        
	As they ready for the space walk the trio are testing the countrys first ever space toilet.

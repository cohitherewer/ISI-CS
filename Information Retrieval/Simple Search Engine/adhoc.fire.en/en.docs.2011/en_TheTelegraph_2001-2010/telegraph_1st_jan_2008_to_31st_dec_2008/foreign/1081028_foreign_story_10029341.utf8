	Chicago, Oct. 27 (Reuters): Police today found the body of a young boy following a search for Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Hudsons 7-year-old nephew, who has been missing since Hudsons mother and brother were slain last week.        
	Police did not immediately release the boys identity but local media reports said a vehicle in which the body was found belonged to Hudsons slain brother, Jason, 29. Police had issued an alert on Friday saying the boy may have been abducted in that vehicle.        
	The boy, Julian King, has been missing since Hudsons mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and Jason Hudson were found shot dead in Donersons South Side Chicago home.        
	Police said the slayings appeared to be part of a domestic disturbance. Various media reports said police had taken William Balfour into custody as a suspect in the double homicide investigation. Balfour, 27, had a relationship with Hudsons sister Julia but is not the father of the missing boy. Balfours mother said earlier her son and Julia were estranged.

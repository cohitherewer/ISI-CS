	Le Carre secret    
	 London, Sept. 14 (PTI) Former secret agent and English author John le Carre, who keeps his readers on tenterhooks through his spy thrillers, has revealed that he was tempted to renegade to the Soviet Union during the cold war.      
	When you spy intensively and you get closer and closer to the border... it seems such a small step to jump... and, you know, find out the rest, the writer said in an interview with The Sunday Times. Asked if he was genuinely tempted to defect to the enemy camp, he said, Yes, there was a time when I was, yes.

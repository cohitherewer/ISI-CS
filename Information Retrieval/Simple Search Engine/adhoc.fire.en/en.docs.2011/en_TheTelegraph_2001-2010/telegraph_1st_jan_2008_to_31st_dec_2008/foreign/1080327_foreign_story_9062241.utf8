                              Trained suckers                            
	London, March 26: It seems some celebrities really will stop at nothing to stay healthy and young-looking.        
	Demi Moore, who once spent 220,000 on a head-to-toe surgical makeover, admitted she has been covered in leeches in an attempt to detoxify her blood. The actress, who at 45 is 15 years older than her husband Ashton Kutcher, told the US chat show host David Letterman that she prepared for the therapy by shaving and bathing in turpentine.         
	She said: I feel like Ive always been someone looking for the cutting edge of things that optimise your health and healing. I was in Austria doing a cleanse and part of the treatment was leech therapy.         
	These arent just swamp leeches though  we are talking about highly trained medical leeches. These are not some low level scavengers  were talking high level blood suckers. The medicinal leech, which is native to Europe, and has been used for clinical bloodletting for thousands of years. In the wild, blood-sucking leeches feed on the blood of vertebrates.         
	The actress, also a follower of the Kabbalah religion, said the leeches were allowed to bite her to release a detox enzyme. It detoxifies your blood  Im feeling very detoxified right now. I did it in some womans house lying on her bed. We did a little sampler first, which is in the belly button.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

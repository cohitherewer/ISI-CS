	London, Feb. 28 (AP): Prince Harry has been serving on the front line in Afghanistan with the British army, the ministry of defence said today.        
	Officials said the prince, a lieutenant in the Blues and Royals regiment, was still deployed in the country. His conduct on operations in Afghanistan has been exemplary, said the head of the army General Richard Dannatt. He has been fully involved in operations and has run the same risks as everyone else in his battle group.        
	Harry, who is third in line to the throne, has been in Afghanistan since December. The deployment was not reported due to an agreement between the ministry of defence and news organisations, including The Associated Press.        
	The story was leaked by an Australian magazine and a German newspaper. Dannatt said he was very disappointed that the story had leaked.        
	Harry, 23, has been fighting in the restive Helmand province, where most of the 7,800 British troops in Afghanistan are based.        
	Last year military chiefs ruled Harry could not be sent to Iraq with his regiment because publicity surrounding his deployment could put him and his unit at risk.

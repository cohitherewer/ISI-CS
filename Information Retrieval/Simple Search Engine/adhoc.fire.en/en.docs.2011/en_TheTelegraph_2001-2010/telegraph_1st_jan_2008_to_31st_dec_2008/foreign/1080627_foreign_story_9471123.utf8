          TOBY HARNDEN                          Eclectic taste                                  
	Washington, June 26: Bob Dylan, Jay-Z, Howlin Wolf, Yo-Yo Ma, Sheryl Crow, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker may have little in common musically but they each have a place in the pretty eclectic selection on Senator Barack Obamas iPod.         
	The Democratic presidential nominee told Rolling Stone magazine that his iPod also contained tracks from singers and groups he grew up listening to in the 1970s, including the Rolling Stones, Elton John and Earth, Wind amp; Fire.         
	He named Stevie Wonder as his biggest musical influence from the era while his favourite Rolling Stones track was Gimme Shelter. If I had one musical hero, it would have to be Stevie Wonder, Obama said.         
	When I was at that point where you start getting involved in music, Stevie had that run with Music of My Mind, Talking Book, Fulfillingness First Finale and Innervisions, and then Songs in the Key of Life. Those are as brilliant a set of five albums as weve ever seen.         
	He was gratified to have been endorsed for President by so many of his musical heroes. Ive got to say, having both Dylan and Bruce Springsteen say kind words about you is pretty remarkable. Those guys are icons.        
	While he had not yet met, he and Springsteen had talked on the telephone.         
	Not only do I love Bruces music, but I just love him as a person, Obama said. He is a guy who has never lost track of his roots.

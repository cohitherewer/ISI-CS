	Kathmandu, July 17: Former crown prince Parass wife Himani and their three children today left Nepal as commoners to settle down in Singapore.        
	Himani and her son Hridayendra and daughters Kritikka and Purnika were accompanied by Dilasha, the youngest daughter of former king Gyanendras brother Dhirendra.        
	Paras has rented an apartment in a posh area of Singapore.        
	Sources close to the former royal family told The Telegraph here that Paras, who earned notoriety for his wayward ways and drunken excesses, transformed himself into a responsible father to choose a good school for his children.         
	Paras will return to Kathmandu once he settles in his family in the new environment, the sources said.         
	Paras, who left for Singapore with his brother-in-law earlier this month, has been camping there in a five-star hotel to make arrangements for shifting his family.         
	The former crown prince has been staying in a well-known hotel under an assumed name to keep the media at bay, the sources said.

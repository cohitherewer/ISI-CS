	Seoul, June 26 (AP): North Korea prepared to destroy the most visible symbol of its nuclear weapons programme, blowing up the cooling tower at its main reactor complex as a sign of the communist nations commitment to stop making plutonium for atomic bombs.        
	Tomorrows planned demolition of the 20-metre tall grey tower was a gesture in response to concessions from the US. In a move charged with symbolism, the North invited TV reporters from countries involved in the nuclear talks to film the cooling tower being blown apart  just some 20 months after Pyongyang shocked the world by detonating a nuclear bomb in an underground test.

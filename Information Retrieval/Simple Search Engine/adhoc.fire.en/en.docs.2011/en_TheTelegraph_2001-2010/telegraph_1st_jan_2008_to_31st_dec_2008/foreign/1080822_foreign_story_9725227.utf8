	Generous George    
	 London, Aug. 21: George Clooney apologised for hitting a fans car by splashing out on a 14,000 replacement, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The 47-year-old Oceans Eleven star shunted the womans Lancia Ypsilon from behind in his black saloon, leaving minor damages.       
	But he quickly accepted blame for the accident, which happened in Penabilli, central Italy. When the woman went to collect it from the repair garage, she found a brand new model and a note of apology on the windscreen.       
	The Hollywood star, who rose to fame in ER, had written: Im so sorry . Hope youll forgive me. George Clooney. Last year it was reported that Clooney was involved in an accident while driving his Harley-Davidson with his then-girlfriend Sarah Larson in New Jersey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US floods threaten global food prices

	London, June 21: Disastrous flooding in the US cornbelt this week will be felt worldwide in higher food prices, farmers have warned.         
	The floods, which began at the end of May, have killed 24 people and caused damage estimated at billions of dollars. They have also dashed hopes of a bumper harvest in the Midwest.         
	Donnie Miller, who has farmed in Iowa for three decades, said he had never known such a disastrous year. Ever since the Iowa river, a tributary of the Mississippi, flooded three weeks ago, much of his 1,400-acre maize and soya bean farm near Solon has been waterlogged.         
	If the floods dont go away, nothing will get planted and its getting very late, said Miller, who now estimates his maize harvest will be down 50 per cent on last year. Anything thats growing is stunted. Normally its chest-high at this time of year. Now, its five inches.         
	Bad weather  a cold spring followed by heavy rain  had already prompted fears of a poor harvest even before the Mississippi broke its banks so spectacularly that even President George W Bush came to see. This years maize (known in the US as corn), soya bean and rice crops were all planted late because of the rain, increasing the likelihood of a poor yield.         
	Now, the flooding that has swept through Iowa, Illinois and Missouri may lead to the loss of up to five million acres of crops. Some agriculturalists say that by the time the water recedes in the next week or two, it will be too late for crop recovery or replanting.         
	While some experts dispute the comparisons that have been made with the Great Depression, nobody denies that the repercussions will be felt far beyond America. Its farmers produce 60 per cent of the maize traded internationally, as well as a third of the soya beans, a quarter of the wheat and a tenth of the rice.         
	Used for feeding livestock, food manufacturing and ethanol production, maize is particularly in demand as global stocks are low. Rising maize prices  which have quadrupled in 15 years  have had a knock-on effect upon other crops like wheat as cattle farmers turn to them as alternatives.         
	The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation warned this week that higher animal feed prices would continue to push up the price of meat.         
	 However, farming leaders are being optimistic, insisting that the Midwest has merely fallen foul of a cyclical weather pattern that will not happen again for years. Ron Litterer, an Iowa farmer, said the weather has improved.

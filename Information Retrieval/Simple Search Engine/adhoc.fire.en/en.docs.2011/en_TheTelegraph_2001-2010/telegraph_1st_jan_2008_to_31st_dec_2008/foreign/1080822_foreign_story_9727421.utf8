	London, Aug. 21: Nepals living goddess has been told that she must go to school, after the supreme court branded the custom of worshipping a virgin child outdated.         
	The centuries-old custom involves a girl being chosen at the age of three, locking her in a palace and worshipping her until she starts menstruating, at which point a new goddess is chosen. But the current deity is going to retire at the end of the year after the countrys supreme court said that nine-year-old Preeti Shakya has the right to go to school.        
	The court said there was no justification for the specially chosen pre-pubescent girl, known as the Kumari, to be subjected to a practice. The courts verdict was prompted by a complaint from local lawyers that keeping a young girl cooped up in an ornate but decrepit palace in Kathmandus medieval quarter was a violation of her rights.        
	The courts spokesman, Hemanta Rawal, said: The court ruled there were no historic or religious documents that state the child should be denied the rights of education, movement etc. She should not be denied these things just because she is the Kumari. The living goddess concept may be scrapped entirely now that Nepal is officially a secular republic run by Maoists keen to do away with the countrys feudal practices.        
	The people in charge of looking after the Kumari said they took orders from the heavens, not the court. They denied that her human rights were violated because, they said, a teacher comes to the palace every day and she is allowed to meet people for three hours every day.

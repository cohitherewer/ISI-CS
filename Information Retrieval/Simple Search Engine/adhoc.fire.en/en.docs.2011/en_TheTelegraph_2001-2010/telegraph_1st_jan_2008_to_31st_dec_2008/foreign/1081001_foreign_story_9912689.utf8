	Pub bars horse    
	 London, Sept. 30: A horse who has been a regular at a pub for several years has been barred after the landlady bought new carpets, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Peggy, a 12-year-old mare, used to enjoy a pint of John Smiths bitter and a packet of pickled onion crisps alongside owner Peter Dolan inside Malleys in Jarrow, South Tyneside.       
	But when landlady Jackie Gray had the pub refitted and renamed as the Alexandra Hotel, she had to bar Peggy.      
	 Dolan said that Peggy began drinking in the pub when one day, instead of staying outside on the grass when he went inside, she followed him in and became a regular ever since. He said: No-one even took any notice of her. Everyone just saw her as one of the locals.     
	Spears tour    
	 Los Angeles (Reuters): Britney Spears said she plans to make her first international tour since 2004 to support her new album, Circus. In an interview broadcast on Monday by New York radio station Z100, Spears was asked if she planned to tour. Oh definitely, next year, she said, adding the tour would probably take her around the world. That would mark her first major concert tour since 2004.

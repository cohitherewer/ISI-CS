The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lanka ends truce with Tigers
                                                                                                            Lanka ends truce with Tigers
                            
	Colombo, Jan. 2 (Reuters): Sri Lankas government decided today to annul a six-year ceasefire agreement with the Tamil Tigers which would allow a full-scale military campaign to recapture the rebels de facto state in the north of the island.        
	The truce has been dead on the ground since a new phase of a two-decade civil war opened in early 2006 and the announcement came hours after suspected Tiger rebels bombed a military bus in downtown Colombo, killing four people and wounding 24.        
	The government has decided to withdraw from the ceasefire, Lakshman Hulugalle, director general of the Media Centre for National Security, told Reuters.        
	Today, at a cabinet meeting, it was decided now the government will give notice to the other party, because there is a clause that says we have to give 14 days notice.        
	The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were not immediately available for comment.         
	President Mahinda Rajapaksa said last month he might outlaw the rebels if they continued to mount large-scale attacks, because there was a limit to our patience, our tolerance.

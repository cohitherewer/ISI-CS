	Chongqing (China), May 12 (Reuters): Chinas most devastating earthquake in three decades killed nearly 9,000 people today, with the toll likely to soar as authorities struggle to reach casualties in large areas cut off from relief.        
	The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Chinas southwestern province of Sichuan killed 8,533 people, the official Xinhua news agency said today, citing the provincial government.        
	The quakes epicentre was in nearby Wenchuan, a mountainous county of about 100,000 people, but its force was enough to cause buildings to sway across China and as far away as the Thai capital Bangkok.The road started swaying as I was driving. Rocks fell from the mountains, with dust darkening the sky over the valley, a driver for Sichuans seismological bureau was quoted by Xinhua as saying as he was driving near the epicentre.        
	The quake hit in the middle of the school day, toppling eight schools in the region. Chemical plants and at least one hospital were also flattened, trapping many hundreds, state media said. About 900 teenagers were buried in the rubble of a collapsed three-storey school building in the Sichuan city of Dujiangyan.        
	Local villagers had already helped dozens of students out of the ruins and five cranes were excavating the site as anxious parents looked on, Xinhua said. Some buried teenagers were struggling to break loose from underneath the ruins while others were crying out for help, the agency said.                    
	Nightfall, severed communications and blocked roads have hampered rescue efforts and the death toll was likely to rise significantly.         
	In Beichuan county, just east of the epicentre, 80 per cent of the buildings had collapsed and some 10,000 people were injured aside from 3,000 to 5,000 dead, Xinhua said. It and other state media said a chemical plant in Shifang city cratered, burying hundreds of people and spilling more than 80 tons of toxic liquid ammonia from the site. About 6,000 people were evacuated.        
	 The epicentre lies on a fault where South Asia pushes against the Eurasian land mass, smashing the Sichuan plain into mountains leading to the Tibetan highlands near communities that rose up in sometimes violent protests against Chinese rule in mid-March.        
	Beichuans population is 161,000, meaning about one in 10 residents were killed or injured. The county is a part of Mianyang city, and about 160 km from the provincial capital, Chengdu.         
	In Beijing, where hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors are expected for the Olympics, which starts on August 8, venues for the games were undamaged.        
	Li Jiulin, a top engineer on the 91,000-seat National Stadium  known as the Birds Nest and the jewel of the Olympics  was conducting an inspection at the venue when the quake occurred. He told reporters the building was designed to withstand a 8.0 quake. The Olympic venues were not affected by the earthquake, said Sun Weide, a spokesman for the Beijing organising committee.

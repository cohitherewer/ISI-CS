The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pauls night of alimony suspense
                                                                                                               Pauls night of alimony suspense
                            
	London, March 16 (Reuters): Paul McCartney learns tomorrow just how much of his Beatles fortune will go to his estranged wife in a divorce settlement that could set a legal precedent for the short-lived marriages of the super-rich.        
	After one of the most acrimonious divorce battles in show business history, judge Hugh Bennett is to hand out his judgment at Londons high court but, despite much media clamouring, his final ruling could be kept confidential.        
	Heather Mills, 40, whose marriage to the 65-year-old McCartney lasted less than four years, sacked her lawyers and represented herself in the case against McCartney, whose fortune has been estimated at 825 million.        
	Media estimates of what Mills might get have varied wildly from 200 million down to 25 million .        
	The judge could also decide to impose a gagging clause on the warring pair.        
	The couple, who have a four-year-old daughter blamed their split on media intrusion into their private lives.        
	The remorseless glare of the tabloid spotlight has certainly not faded in the most high-profile show business split since Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman broke up.        
	McCartney and Mills bitter divisions were splashed across tabloid front pages with endless Beatles-inspired headlines aboutCant Buy Me Love andHard Days Fight.        
	That was inevitable as McCartney, a founder of the worlds most famous pop group and a national icon in Beatles-mad Britain, was pitted against the outspoken Mills, target of lurid tales in the press about her colourful past.        
	She hit back, saying she had been driven to the brink of suicide because the media had branded her awhore and a gold-digger.

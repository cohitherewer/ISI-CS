	Washington, Dec. 4 (AP): Humbled US automakers pleaded with Congress today for an expanded $34 billion rescue package, but heard fresh scepticism in a bumpy encore appearance.        
	Were here today because we made mistakes, General Motors chief executive Rick Wagoner told the Senate Banking Committee in prepared testimony.        
	The three executives made the trip in new-model autos made by their respective companies, two weeks after a botched attempt for aid that included harsh criticism of corporate leaders who flew here on private jets to beg for money.        
	Ahead of testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Wagoner apologised for asking for the help from taxpayers. Speaking with reporters, he said: We wish the market conditions were better. Theyre not.        
	Chrysler chief executive Bob Nardelli said: I can tell you in my 38 years in business, Ive never attended a more important session where more is reliant upon both the House and the Senate.        
	Ford chief executive Alan Mulally said in his prepared remarks that while his company is not in as desperate straits as rivals GM and Chrysler, his company could still use a federal guarantee of some $9 billion as a critical backstop.         
	Senator Richard Shelby, the senior Republican on the panel, complained that the pricetag on the package had jumped since the trio last appeared just two weeks ago        
	He pressed the automakers to explain why, and to justify how such aid would not simply prop up a failed business model for a few months ... and how are you going to pay it back to the taxpayers?        
	Banking Committee chairman Chris Dodd, a Democrat, said detailed plans submitted to Congress earlier this week by the three auto companies on how they would use low-cost federal loans to reorganise still left a lot of questions unanswered.

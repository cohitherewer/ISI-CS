	London, Oct. 14 (Reuters): A man discovered making kebabs near a corpse has been banned from managing food businesses and fined 3,800, Wolverhampton City Council said today.        
	Jaswinder Singh, 45, was found by police making kebabs at Pappu Sweet Centre and Catering in Wolverhampton in August in a kitchen where a dead man was lying on a sofa.        
	As well the corpse, the policeman discovered another man smoking and spitting repeatedly on the floor, while in a room near the kitchen, a defrosting chicken, oozing blood and juices, was covered with flies.        
	Environmental health officers had visited the shop over a number of months previously where they had warned Singh to improve his food hygiene standards after finding rat droppings as well as a dead rat beneath a pot.        
	We were called to reports of a sudden death, said West Midlands police spokesperson Joanne Hunt. A post-mortem was carried out, but found the death was not suspicious, so the matter was referred to the coroner.

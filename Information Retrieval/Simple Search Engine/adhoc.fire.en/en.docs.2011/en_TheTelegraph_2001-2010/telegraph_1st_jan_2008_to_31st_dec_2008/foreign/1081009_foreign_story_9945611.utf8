	Islamabad, Oct. 8 (Reuters): Pakistans new military spy chief briefed lawmakers on the internal security threat, and conflict in tribal lands seen as al Qaida and Taliban havens, in a rare closed door session of parliament today.        
	It will help evolve a national consensus and formulate a national policy on how to tackle growing terrorism and extremism, defence minister Ahmed Mukhtar told Reuters.        
	Everybody knows the security situation in the country, he said, as troops sealed off roads leading to parliament and government buildings and helicopters hovered over Islamabad.         
	The briefing by Lieutenant-General Ahmad Shujaa Pasha came as troops backed by helicopter gunships killed 20 militants in Bajaur.         
	Pasha who was appointed ISI director general last week, briefed an in-camera joint session of the two houses of parliament. There will be a question-answer session tomorrow, a spokesman said.

          NASIR JAFFRY                           no interviews                                  
	Islamabad, July 21: A Pakistani judge today relaxed restrictions on nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, allowing him to travel and meet close relatives and friends five years after he was detained for proliferating nuclear technology.         
	However, Khan was barred from giving any interviews to print or electronic media on the issue.         
	The scientist, who is revered at home as a national hero, triggered new controversies when he said in a recent interview that the army supervised shipment of centrifuges to North Korea in 2000 and President Pervez Musharraf knew about it.         
	Pakistani Stratergic Plans Division (SPD) denied the claim saying that there was enough evidence to substantiate the facts that Khan ran a proliferation network from 1987.        
	A.Q.Khan will be allowed to meet his close relatives and friends subject to security clearance, Islamabad high court chief justice Sardar Muhammad Aslam said in a short order on a petition filed by Khans counsel Iqbal Jaffrey challenging the scientists illegal detention.

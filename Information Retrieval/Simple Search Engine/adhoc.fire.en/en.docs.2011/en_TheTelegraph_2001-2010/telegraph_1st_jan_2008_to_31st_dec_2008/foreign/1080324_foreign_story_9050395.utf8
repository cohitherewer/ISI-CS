The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Less-able kids suffer in large classes
                                                                                                               Less-able kids suffer in large classes

	London, March 23: Large class sizes are proving disruptive and damaging the prospects of less-able children, a ground-breaking study has established.        
	Pupils struggle to concentrate and have little interaction with the teacher, according to the research by the London Institute of Education.        
	The study provides ammunition for teachers, who yesterday threatened the government with a rolling campaign of strike action to demand that class sizes are capped at 20. It comes only days after Jim Knight, the schools minister, insisted classes of up to 70 pupils were perfectly acceptable in secondary schools.        
	Researchers found that adding five pupils to a class in English schools increased by 40 per cent the likelihood that less academic children would be off task.        
	Those pupils were twice as likely to misbehave in classes of 30  a size common in state schools  as they were in classes of 15, a size typical of the independent sector. The study found that teachers in charge of larger classes spent more time trying to re-engage distracted pupils, indicating that all children suffered.

	Allegedalligator    
	 London, Aug. 24: When an alligator was reported loose on the streets of Bristol, police and the RSPCA snapped into action, reports The Sunday Telegraph.      
	Roads were sealed off as they staked out the creature, which appeared to be lying in garden bushes with the remains of a bird in its jaws. After a tense 30-minute stand-off, emergency workers used a camera to zoom in on the reptile  and discovered that it was a stuffed toy. It is unclear if the emergency was a prank but the toy had fluff in its mouth to appear like feathers and an elastic band made to look like a muzzle was wrapped around its jaws.    
	Typo rap    
	 London: Two obsessive grammarians who changed a historical handpainted sign at the Grand Canyon national park have been sentenced to probation for vandalism, reports The Sunday Telegraph. Jeff Deck and Benjamin Herson, both 28, had spent this spring travelling across the US correcting errors on government signposts. The pair set up the Typo Eradication Advancement League and were interviewed by National Public Radio and the Chicago Tribune, which referred to them as a pair of Kerouacs armed with Sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation.    
	Off golf     
	 Seoul (Reuters): South Koreas President Lee Myung-bak has told officials to give up golf for the moment because it sends the wrong signal just as the economy has hit the rough. Golf is not bad but... as prices are unstable and the economic situation is not getting better, President Lee thinks they need to consider public sentiment, Yonhap news agency quoted a presidential Blue House official as saying. Lee asked officials to put their clubs away at least in the run-up to the major Chuseok holiday in September.    
	Jail divine    
	 Chicago (Reuters): Theres a new sheriff in jail. Sheriff Mark Curran of Lake County, Illinois, walked into his own jail recently to spend a week as a prisoner, saying he was divinely inspired to learn what it was like to be confined and to sample jail programmes designed to reduce recidivism. The biblical adage that we reap what we sow is very true in criminal justice, said Curran, 45, before exchanging his business suit for a prison jumpsuit at the Waukegan, Illinois, facility near Chicago. Curran will spend time in the general population of some 600 inmates who are awaiting trial on charges of murder, rape and lesser crimes, though at times he will have his own cell.

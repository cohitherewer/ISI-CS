	NY goes green    
	 New York, March 17 (AP): A sea of step dancers, men in kilts, and marchers in green are taking to the streets for New York citys St Patricks Day parade.      
	The crowd was up to seven people deep in some places along the Fifth Avenue route. Amid the Irish music, bagpipes also were playing God Bless America.      
	 Morgan of Kilcoo in County Down, Northern Ireland, says she came to New York just for the parade. She said: Its much more Irish than at home.      
	Officials for the 247th annual parade include 90-year-old Mario Biaggi, named aide-at-large to Grand Marshal Tommy M. Smyth. Biaggi, a former NYPD lieutenant, has remained popular despite his two years in prison for a 1988 extortion conviction.    
	New show

The former American Idol winner sold 7 million copies of her debut album Some Hearts and shot to superstardom almost overnight with hits including Before He Cheats and Jesus, Take the Wheel.

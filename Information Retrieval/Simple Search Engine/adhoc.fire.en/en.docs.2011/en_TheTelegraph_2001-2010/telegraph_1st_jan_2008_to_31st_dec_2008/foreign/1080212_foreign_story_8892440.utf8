	Nerd Oscar    
	Beverly Hills, Feb. 11 (AP): At the first Academy Award presentations of the year, 20 computer geeks graciously accepted honours for their work on particle flow simulation technology  stuff that makes water scenes in the movies look more realistic.      
	The Academy of Motion Picture Arts kept its Scientific and Technical Awards dinner on Saturday night as charmingly unglamorous as ever. A magician provided the entertainment, Jessica Alba showed up to present the awards  and be gawked at  and nerddom was held up as something to celebrate.       
	 Fluid effects rock and all of us who work in fluids know this, one honouree, Nafees Bin Zafar, said earnestly. All writing for the show was done by an Academy administrator.

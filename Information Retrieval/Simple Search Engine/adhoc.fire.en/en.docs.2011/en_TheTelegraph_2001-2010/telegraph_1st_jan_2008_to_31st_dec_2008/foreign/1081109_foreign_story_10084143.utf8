                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Palin calls McCain aides jerks
          WILLIAM YARDLEY AND MICHAEL COOPER                          Palin: Taken out of context?                                  
	Anchorage (Alaska), Nov. 8: Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska fired back yesterday at the unnamed McCain campaign aides who have been maligning her in recent days, saying that their criticism was cruel and its mean-spirited, its immature, its unprofessional, and those guys are jerks.        
	Palin spoke out upon her return to the governors office here, defending herself from a barrage of criticism that has been aimed at her from unnamed McCain aides ever since the McCain-Palin ticket was defeated on Tuesday.        
	The McCain campaign aides complained about the $150,000 that the Republican National Committee had spent on Palins clothes, the way a Canadian comedian was able to embarrass the campaign by calling her and pretending to be the President of France, and the political ambitions she seemed to harbour beyond 2008.         
	By the end of the week, their complaints had escalated considerably, with Fox News quoting unnamed McCain campaign officials as saying that Palin had not known that Africa was a continent, not a country, and claiming that she did not know which countries were covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).        
	Palin told reporters in Alaska that the anonymous criticism was cowardly, and that she had discussed the campaigns position on Nafta at her debate prep sessions.        
	I remember having a discussion with a couple of debate preppers, she said. So if it came from one of those debate preppers, you know, thats curious. But having a discussion about Nafta  not: Oh my goodness, I dont know who is a part of Nafta.         
	So, no, I think that if there are allegations based on questions or comments that I made in debate prep about Nafta, and about the continent versus the country when we talk about Africa there, then those were taken out of context, Palin said.         
	And thats cruel and its mean-spirited, its immature, its unprofessional, and those guys are jerks, if they came away with it taking things out of context and then tried to spread something on national news. It is not fair.        
	Palin fought back after the infighting had made its way up to Senator John McCain, who made it clear that that he was upset by the back and forth, and ordered his campaign workers to stop it, aides said. Some in the staff worried that questioning the qualifications of the woman McCain had chosen as his running mate was damaging his reputation.         
	Palin said that her experience made her realise how brutal national politics could be. And she had some pungent criticism of the national news media, saying that there had been some bad apples in the bunch. For the most part, absolutely, media persons, reporters, have been absolutely right on and there has been fairness and objectivity, she said. There have been some stinkers, though, who have kind of made the whole basket full of apples, once in a while, smell kind of bad.

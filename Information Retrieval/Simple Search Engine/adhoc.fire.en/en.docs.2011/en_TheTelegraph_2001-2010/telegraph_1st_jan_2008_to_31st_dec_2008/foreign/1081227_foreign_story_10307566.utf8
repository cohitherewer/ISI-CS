	Beijing, Dec. 26 (Reuters): Three Chinese naval vessels left for Somalia today to help tackle piracy in a sign of the countrys rising global clout.        
	The destroyers Haikou and Wuhan, two of Chinese navys most sophisticated warships, set sail from the southern resort island of Hainan along with a supply vessel, the official Xinhua news agency said. The three ships have about 800 crew, including 70 special operations troops, Xinhua said.        
	We have made special preparations to deal with pirates, even though these waters are not familiar to us, it quoted mission commander Rear-Admiral Du Jingcheng as saying.         
	The crack forces are expected to give the fleet an edge in seeing off the pirates.

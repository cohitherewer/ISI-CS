          RICHARD GRAY                              
	London, Nov. 23: Britain is to launch its first mission to the moon to try and understand the cause of mysterious quakes which vibrate through the lunar rock.         
	Backed by Nasa, the mission comes just weeks after India successfully launched its first mission to the moon and crash landed a small probe onto the surface.        
	UK ministers will give their approval next month to push ahead with the project which will help engineers to build a lunar base which can withstand the force of the moonquakes.         
	The 100 million mission involves putting an unmanned spacecraft into orbit around the moon before firing a series of probes into the lunar surface. Scientists hope to use the penetrators to examine the chemical composition of the rocks and even search for water if they are fired into the lunar poles.         
	The existence of moonquakes has puzzled scientists because the moon does not have the tectonic plate activity that causes quakes on Earth.         
	The launch of Britains moon mission, known as the Moon Lightweight Interior and Telecommunications Experiment or MoonLITE, will be announced by science minister Lord Drayson next month.         
	Scientists and engineers will begin work on the technical designs, calculations and costs with the aim of launching the satellite between 2012 and 2014.         
	Dr Ian Crawford, from the school of earth sciences at Birkbeck College, University of London, who was one of the scientists who first proposed the MoonLITE mission, said: The moon still holds an awful lot of secrets. Most of what we know about the moon is from a relatively small area on the nearside of the moon and we have no samples or data from the far side.         
	While Earth has eroded away that first 1,000 million years of history, the moon however still holds a record of how frequently we were being hit by meteorites and the extent to which we were having water and other molecules delivered by comets.         
	We are expecting an announcement that will take MoonLITE from being a mere concept to being something with realistic feasibility         
	The MoonLITE spacecraft will fire four suitcase-sized penetrator probes into different points around the lunar surface. Travelling at around the speed of sound, the dart shaped probes will pierce up to six feet into the surface. Seismic and temperature readings taken by the penetrators for up to a year from four different points around the moon will then help scientists to build up a picture of how the moonquakes are caused.         
	Data gathered during Nasas Apollo missions has shown that there are several different types of moonquakes, some of which are thought to be caused by Earths gravitational pull on the moon and others of which are caused by the expansion of rocks when heated by sunlight.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Children killed in Pak firing
                                                                                                               Children killed in Pak firing
                            
	Islamabad, March 13 (Reuters): Foreign forces in Afghanistan killed four Pakistani civilians, including two children, when they fired across the border, a Pakistani military spokesman said.        
	Upto 2,000 villagers protested against the firing that took place on Tuesday night in Pakistans North Waziristan border region.        
	They fired five rounds which landed in our territory and in the process a house was destroyed resulting in the deaths of two women and two children, said military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas. Pakistan had lodged a very strong protest with international forces in Afghanistan over the attack on the house, which was about 2 km inside Pakistan, he said.        
	A spokesman for Afghanistans Nato-led International Security Assistance Force said he had no knowledge of any such incident. However, a spokesman for a separate US-led force said it did fire into Pakistan early yesterday. Coalition forces did use precision guided munitions in response to a threat said spokesman Major Chris Belcher.

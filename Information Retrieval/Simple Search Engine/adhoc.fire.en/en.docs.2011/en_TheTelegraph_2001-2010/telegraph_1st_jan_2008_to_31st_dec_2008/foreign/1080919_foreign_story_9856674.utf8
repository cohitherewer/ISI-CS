	Drinks go under    
	 Canberra, Sept. 18 (Reuters): An Australian pub offering free drinks to women who remove their underwear and display it to patrons and staff will be investigated by alcohol licensing regulators, authorities said today.      
	The Saint Hotel in Melbourne has promised a No Undie Sundie event over the coming weekend, where woman who remove their underwear and hang it above the bar will receive $39 worth of free drinks.      
	 Women who flash their bras and underwear to staff also get free drinks, the pub said, in a promotion that womens protection groups said was almost an invitation to sexual assault.   
	 On its website the Saint describes itself as the home of Melbournes fashionable set.

	Times sure have changed in the 19 years since Harrison Ford last donned the signature fedora of thrill-seeking archaeologist Indiana Jones. The viral spread of the trailer for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is proof of that.
    
	The trailer for the May 22 release has drawn highly enthusiastic responses in theatres. But it may have had its biggest impact online, on a younger audience that may not think of Ford, 65, as equal to todays spry action heroes.
    
	After premiering on February 14 on Good Morning America, Lucasfilm and Viacom Incs Paramount Pictures sent the trailer to the Web, plus movie theatres and TV stations around the world. Paramount estimates the trailer was seen more than 200 million times worldwide in the first week alone. 
    
	Harry Knowles, who runs the movie fan site AintItCool.com , says he first saw a bootleg version of the trailer online, then the official version online, and then saw it twice in theatres.
    
	There were cheers in the theatre when the familiar theme song kicked in, Knowles said, and comments on his website have been positive. People generally really, really loved the trailer, he said. Some people think its a little more cartoonish-looking compared to the prior (films), with him whipping the lights and swinging on them and stuff. But at the same time, it seems that everyone is extremely excited that theres a new Indiana Jones film. The excitement for it is palpable. Its much more aggressively anticipated than anything else thats coming out right now.
    
	The trailer caught on like wildfire, around the world, in all mediums, said Gerry Rich, Paramounts president of worldwide marketing, who is targeting moviegoers from 8 to 80. The response has been sensational and it shows what technology can do when you have material that is so appealing to audiences.
    
	Older audiences certainly remember Indy, but thats not the prime ticket-buying demographic. Thus the aggressive online campaign, which included what Paramount says is a record 4.1 million views on the Yahoo movie site in the first week and 2.6 million on the official IndianaJones.com site, the most ever for the studio. It looks to be THE highly anticipated movie of the summer, said Mark Mazrimas, marketing manager for independent theatre chain Classic Cinemas. However, this hasnt been on the screen for so long, (the challenge) is capturing the youth.

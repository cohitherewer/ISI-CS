	Naked madness    
	 London, Aug. 5: Actress Eva Mendes has shocked Americans by flashing her breast in an television advert for       
	Calvin Klein, leading US networks to ban the clip, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	 The campaign for new perfume Secret Obsession was deemed too racy for TV because it shows a brief glimpse of her nipple.      
	The black and white advert shows Mendes, 34, rolling on a dishevelled bed before caressing herself and showing her chest. Between love and madness lies obsession, she whispers seductively during the footage. Love... madness. Its my secret.      
	Although networks have pulled the advert, Calvin Klein is running the clip on its website.

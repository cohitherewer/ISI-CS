	London, March 31: A young Saudi Arabian woman was murdered by her father for chatting on the social network site Facebook, it has emerged.        
	The unnamed woman from Riyadh was beaten and shot after she was discovered in the middle of an online conversation with a man, the al-Arabiya website reported.         
	The case was reported on a Saudi Arabian news site as an example of the strife the social networking site is causing in the Islamic nation.         
	Saudi preacher Ali al-Maliki has emerged as the leading critic of Facebook, claiming the network is corrupting the youth of the nation.         
	Facebook is a door to lust and young women and men are spending more on their mobile phones and the Internet than they are spending on food, he said.         
	The woman was murdered in August but her death was highlighted following Malikis comments.         
	Social customs and religious rules oblige women in Saudi Arabia to cover their head and figure with a veil so that men are not distracted by the female form.

	More than 6,500 people have signed the online petition in a bid to stop the conservative Muslim kingdom following Syria in banning access to the network. There are estimated to be more than 30,000 Facebook users in the oil-rich kingdom. Many Saudi women use nicknames and post comic images or drawings on their pages instead of photographs. Some Saudi bloggers have dubbed the network Faceless.

	One of the most popular Facebook groups among Saudi Arabian youth is Single and Looking in Saudi Arabia, which has 1,823 members and hosts many sexually explicit images.         
	Due to the sites popularity, Facebook has met some criticism in its short lifespan because of privacy concerns                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

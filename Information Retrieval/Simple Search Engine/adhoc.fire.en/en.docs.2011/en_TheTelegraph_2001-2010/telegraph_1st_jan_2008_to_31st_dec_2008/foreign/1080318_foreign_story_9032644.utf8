	Madrid, March 17 (AP): A former drummer for the Swedish pop band Abba was found dead with cuts to his neck in the garden of his house on the Spanish island of Mallorca. Police said today an autopsy showed it was an accident.        
	A neighbour found the body of Ola Brunkert last evening at his house in a coastal area outside the eastern town of Arta, a Civil Guard spokesman told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

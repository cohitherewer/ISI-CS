	Jackos hot pants    
	 London, Sept. 10: Michael Jacksons underpants are up for sale on eBay with a reserve price of $1 million, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The 28 inch-waist Calvin Klein briefs are still in an evidence bag sealed with police tape after they were taken as evidence in a child abuse case. The pants were confiscated in 2003 by then-Santa Barbara district attorney Tom Sneddon, who wanted a DNA sample for his unsuccessful child-molestation case against the 50-year-old singer.      
	They have been put up for sale by New Jersey businessman Henry Vacarro, who obtained them in a bankruptcy case, along with other Jackson memorabilia including a note explaining why he wants an annulment from Lisa Marie Presley and a used half-ounce tube of skin-bleaching cream.

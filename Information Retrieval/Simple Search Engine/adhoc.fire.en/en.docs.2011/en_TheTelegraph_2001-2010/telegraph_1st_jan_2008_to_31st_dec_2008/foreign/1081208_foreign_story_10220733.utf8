	Beijing, Dec. 7 (Reuters): China lodged a strong protest against French President Nicolas Sarkozys weekend meeting with the Dalai Lama, saying it had damaged bilateral and Sino-EU ties, Chinese vice-foreign minister He Yafei said today.        
	In the first official reaction since the two met in the Polish port of Gdansk yesterday, Beijing said it had summoned the French ambassador to China, Herve Ladsous, to issue the sharp rebuke.        
	We urge the French side to prioritise bilateral relations and interests of the two peoples, to... fully understand the damage generated from the meeting between Sarkozy and the Dalai Lama on bilateral relations as well as Sino-EU relations, Yafei said in comments broadcast on state-run CCTV.         
	He also urged France to take concrete actions to correct the mistakes on the Tibet issue.        
	Yafei added that proper attention should be paid to what he called Chinas reasonable concerns.

	Islamabad, Oct. 21 (Reuters): Pakistan requires $10 billion to $15 billion of support from foreign lenders to avert a balance of payments crisis, the countrys newly appointed economic troubleshooter said.        
	In 24 months, we must correct the imbalance we have created, Shaukat Tarin, adviser to the Prime Minister on economic affairs, told Dawn News television.        
	Pakistan is undergoing an annual economic health check-up, which all IMF members have to go through, but it is already in a critical condition, with the central bank holding barely enough foreign currency to cover six weeks of imports.        
	Islamabad was expected to seek a multi-billion-dollar rescue package from the International Monetary Fund at a meeting between officials in Dubai today. Other donors are expected to help if the IMF paves the way and approves Pakistans economic strategy.        
	Pakistan has already approached the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and bilateral donors, including Saudi Arabia and China, for support. Immediately we dont need more than $10-15 billion, Tarin said.        
	Inflation in Pakistan is running close to 25 per cent, the budget deficit is unsustainable, government borrowing from the central bank has squeezed liquidity in the banking system and the international bond market has priced in a debt default.        
	The talks that are now taking place today will ensure that the Fund can act quickly should there come a request from the Pakistani authorities, said a source in Dubai with knowledge of the discussions underway.        
	Consultations with the IMF were taking place in the Gulf because of a security scare posed by the Taliban and al Qaida in Pakistan, and were expected for several days. Last month, an IMF team left Islamabad in a hurry after a suicide bomber killed 55 people and destroyed the Marriott hotel.        
	The seven-month-old civilian government led by President Asif Ali Zardari has been trying to get IMF endorsement for its economic strategies in order to persuade other multilateral lenders and friendly countries to come to its rescue. But it has not wanted to take IMF money unless there was no other option.         
	Boucher praise        
	Assistant US secretary of state Richard Boucher today praised Pakistani offensives against Islamist militants and played down hopes negotiations could end violence in Pakistan and Afghanistan.        
	Boucher also said the US and nuclear-armed Pakistans other allies wanted to support its efforts as it struggles with a balance of payments crisis. But a Friends of Pakistan group, which includes the US, would not simply offer Pakistan a cash advance, he said.

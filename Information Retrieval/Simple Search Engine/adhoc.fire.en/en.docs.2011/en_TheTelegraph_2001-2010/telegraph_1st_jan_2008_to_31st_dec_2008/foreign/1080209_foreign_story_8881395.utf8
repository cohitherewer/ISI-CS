	House sale shock    
	 London, Feb. 8 (Reuters): An estate agent who took a prospective buyer to view a house in central England found the owner hanging dead in a closet, the agency said Thursday.      
	It was the first viewing of the 350,000 house which had been on the market for a week. The owner was hanging from a belt inside a walk-in closet in the main bedroom. It was quite a shock, said a spokesman for estate agents Hartleys.    
	Hospital to ban gossiping    
	 Belgrade (Reuters): A ban on grumpiness, gossiping, mini-skirts and rudeness is what the doctor orders to improve patient care in Serbias hospitals, according to new health ministry rules. Staff are not allowed to criticise their hospital or their superiors.

	Male, Oct. 29 (Reuters): The President of the Maldives for the past 30 years conceded electoral defeat today to a former dissident he had repeatedly jailed during years of crusading for democracy on the Indian Ocean archipelago.        
	Mohamed Anni Nasheed, victorious with 54.2 per cent of a runoff vote held yesterday, stood with President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom in the office he inherits on November 11, with both praising the Maldivess first multi-party poll.

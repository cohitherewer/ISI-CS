	London, April 11: The whisky industry has been split by a row over a new classification that critics claim will dumb down the product and threaten the future of Scotlands most famous export.        
	One distiller said yesterday that the move could lead to distillery closures and undermine the credibility of the countrys renowned single malts. The row has been caused by the Scotch Whisky Associations plans to introduce a blended malt category to describe Scotch made of malts from different distilleries. This would replace the traditional term vatted malt, and, according to critics, will confuse consumers by combining the description of the two main types of Scotch  blended whisky and single malt whisky.         
	Around 1,000 people have signed a petition opposing the move, and some in the industry warn of a scenario where whisky follows the route of sherry and cognac, becoming homogenised and dominated by a few brands.        
	However, the SWA insisted the move was supported by the majority of the industry and that research proved the change would not confuse consumers.        
	According to Mark Reynier, of Bruichladdich distillery on Islay, the new category is designed to support the interests of the drinks giants Diageo and Pernod Ricard, which dominate the industry. Blends, made from malt and grain whisky, are characterised by large volumes with poor profit margins, while single malts, associated with one distillery, are highly profitable but the stock is limited.

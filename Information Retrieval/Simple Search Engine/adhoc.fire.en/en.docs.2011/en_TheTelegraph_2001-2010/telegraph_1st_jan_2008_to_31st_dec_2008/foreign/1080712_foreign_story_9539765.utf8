	Baghdad, July 11 (Reuters): Iraqs defence ministry today denied any Israeli air force drills had taken place in its airspace after a report that the Israelis were preparing there for a possible strike on Iran.        
	An Israeli military spokesman also described the report, carried on the website of the Jerusalem Post as utterly baseless. The Post report, citing sources in the Iraqi defence ministry telling a local news network, said Israel Air Force war planes were practising in Iraqi airspace.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hundreds evacuated after Canyon dam breach
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hundreds evacuated after Canyon dam breach
                            
	Phoenix (Arizona), Aug. 18 (Reuters): A rain-soaked earthen dam near the Grand Canyon broke yesterday, prompting the evacuation of hundreds of residents from a flooded village in a downstream Indian reservation, a National Park Service spokeswoman said.        
	Five helicopters from the Arizona National Guard and the state public safety department ferried some evacuees, including campers and river-runners, to higher ground after floodwaters cascaded into the remote Native American town of Supai at the bottom of a canyon, spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge said.        
	Seventy five people had been airlifted to safety and another 350 were waiting to be flown out, Oltrogge said, adding that some evacuees may be forced to spend the night on higher ground near the flood zone.        
	Supai is home to about 400 members of the Havasupai tribe. The dam broke at about 6 am, following a day of heavy rains that weakened the earthen structure, which sits about 20 miles east of Supai in a side gorge of the Grand Canyon.

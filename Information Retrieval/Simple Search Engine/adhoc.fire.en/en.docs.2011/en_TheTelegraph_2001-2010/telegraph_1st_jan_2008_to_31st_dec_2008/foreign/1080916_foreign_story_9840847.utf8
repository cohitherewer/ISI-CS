	Kuala Lumpur, Sept. 15 (PTI): An Indian national was arrested in Malaysia for allegedly smuggling 5kg of ketamine powder, an anaesthetic drug, worth over Rs20 lakhs.        
	The 21-year-old youth, whose identity was not revealed, reportedly arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday night on an Air India flight from Mumbai. He then waited till the customs officers changed their shift. However, the officers became suspicious after the Indian had problems carrying an aluminium suitcase at the airport. They searched his belongings and found the powder.        
	Customs deputy director-general Mardina Alwi said the suspect arrived at 10.15pm and waited for the officers to change their shift at 11pm before trying to walk through the checkpoint. We believe the syndicate members would have advised him to wait for the change of shift and use this opportunity to escape attention.        
	 However, the plan backfired and he could now be facing the death sentence, Alwi said.        
	The man, suspected to be a drug mule, was sent to seven-days police remand. PTI JB RRD RRD 09132232 DEL NNNN

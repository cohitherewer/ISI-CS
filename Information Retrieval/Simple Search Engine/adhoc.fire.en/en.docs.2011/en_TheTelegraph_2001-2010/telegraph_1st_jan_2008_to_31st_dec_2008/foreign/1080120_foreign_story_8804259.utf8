	Karachi, Jan. 19 (Reuters): Pakistani police said today they had averted a disaster with the arrest of five militants planning to attack Shia processions with cyanide and suicide bombs.
    
	The arrests late yesterday in the southern city of Karachi came as minority Shias across Pakistan gathered for Muharram that have in recent years drawn attacks from Sunni militants.
    
	Their arrest has averted a big disaster ... but the threat of suicide attacks is still there, provincial police chief Azhar Ali Farooqi told a news conference.
    
	The five militants, one of whom was preparing to become a suicide bomber, belonged to different Sunni militant groups and were picked up in raids in different parts of the city, Farooqi said.
    
	They planned to carry out suicide and grenade attacks on processions, he said.
    
	Police seized 6kg of explosives for use in suicide jackets, 2kg ball bearings, 1kg of nails, detonators, three hand grenades and two pistols.
    
	Police also seized 500g of cyanide that Farooqi said was going to be used to poison drinks handed out to people taking part in the Shia processions.
    
	Sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia sects flares every year during Moharram, which marks a period of mourning for Prophet Mohammeds grandson Imam Hussein. Killed in a battle in AD 680 in Karbala, a city in modern day Iraq, Imam Hussein is revered by Shias, who make up about 15 per cent of Pakistans 160 million people.
    
	Security forces are on high alert for violence this weekend when many Shias beat themselves into a frenzy of grief during processions. Ordinary Pakistanis and police say sectarianism is being used as a cover by shadowy groups intent on creating chaos.
    
	Militants captured
    
	Pakistani forces captured 40 militants in the South Waziristan region on the Afghan border, a military spokesman said today, a day after up to 90 rebels were killed in two battles.
    
	Fighting has intensified in recent days between government forces and al Qaida-linked militants led by a commander the government and the CIA say was behind the assassination of Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto last month.
    
	Last night, during the operation at Chaghmalai, we captured 40 miscreants ... the complete Chaghmalai area is cleared of militants, said military spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas. A wave of violence including a barrage of suicide bombs in recent months has raised fears about stability in Pakistan.

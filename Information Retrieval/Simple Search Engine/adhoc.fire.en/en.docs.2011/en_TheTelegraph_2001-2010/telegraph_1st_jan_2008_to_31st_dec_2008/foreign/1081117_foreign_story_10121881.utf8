	Greek joke    
	 Athens, Nov. 16: (Reuters): For those who believe the ancient Greeks thought of everything first, proof has been found in a 4th-century AD joke book featuring an ancestor of Monty Pythons Dead Parrot sketch where a man returns a parrot to a shop, complaining it is dead. Ill tell you whats wrong with it. Its dead, thats whats wrong with it, he says.      
	The 1,600-year-old work titled Philogelos: The Laugh Addict, one of the worlds oldest joke books, features a joke in which a man complains that a slave he has just bought has died, its publisher said recently. By the gods, answers the slaves seller, when he was with me, he never did any such thing!    
	Sexy scar    
	 London: A facial scar, preferably one that looks like it was inflicted in anger rather than the aftermath of chickenpox or acne, increases mens attractiveness to a women for short-term relationships, according to researchers. Faced with picture of men with and without different scars, women rated the scarred faces as better looking, but scars did not enhance womens attractiveness to men, reports The Daily Telegraph. It has been suggested that scarring associated with violence may signal to a woman that the man has a risk-taking personality or above average masculinity, both of which might appeal to women for short-term relationships.     
	Rabies feat    
	 Brasilia (Reuters): A 15-year-old boy in Brazil has recovered from a normally deadly rabies infection, becoming one of a handful of survivors of the virus worldwide and the first in the country. The teenager, who was bitten by a blood-sucking bat in Pernambuco state, was found to be clear of the virus after more than a month of hospital treatment using a combination of drugs. The case is one of only three known in which a person survived a confirmed rabies infection, the health ministry said. The virus causes inflammation of the brain and usually leads to death if left untreated.

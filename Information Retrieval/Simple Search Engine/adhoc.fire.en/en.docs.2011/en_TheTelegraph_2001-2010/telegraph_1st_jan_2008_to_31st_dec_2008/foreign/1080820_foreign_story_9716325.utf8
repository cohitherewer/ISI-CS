                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Retrosexual male makes a comeback
                            
	London, Aug. 19 (PTI): Men, its time to throw away your razor in the bin, start fashioning a handlebar moustache, get a crate of strong beer in and begin referring to women as the little ladies.         
	In other words, just shrug off the nancy boy image of a metrosexual male and be a real man if indeed you want to be a retrosexual.        
	Confused? Well, a new book has hailed the birth of retrosexual male  he who never cries in public and thinks that foreplay is nothing but a band, leading British tabloid The Sun reported.         
	The book, penned by Dave Besely, has set some rules for retrosexual males  while on a date, be assertive, order for her and always pay for the food and drinks even if she tries to insist.        
	When it comes to sex, a retrosexual man believes in foreplay  for example, by getting her to send a text when shes ready.         
	The retrosexual man must never say: Im sorry cry in public; and declare undying love. Instead he could jolly well try to assume a silent reverie. So, to be specific a retrosexual is a hairy-chested pint drinker who wont apologise for farting in front of the missus. Cheers, men!

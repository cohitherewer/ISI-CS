          PAUL STOKES                              
	London, Aug. 5: Bill Gates, the worlds third richest man, may owe some of his business acumen to Yorkshire forebears, according to a genealogist.         
	The founder of the Microsoft empires family has been traced back through 13 generations to the mill town of Halifax. His great grandfather is believed to have been Jonas Halstead, born in 1611.         
	The Halsteads were a Puritan family in the area and became increasingly disturbed about the direction the parish church in Halifax was taking.         
	David Glover, who spent a year working on the Gates family history, said: The final straw seems to be the appointment of a very high church priest. Jonas joined a number of people from the area who sailed from Bristol in May 1635 for Boston.

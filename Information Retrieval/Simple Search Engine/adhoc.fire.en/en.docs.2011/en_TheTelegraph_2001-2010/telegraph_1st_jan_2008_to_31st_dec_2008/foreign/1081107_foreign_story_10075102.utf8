The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Abuzz over Obamas Rahmbo
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Abuzz over Obamas Rahmbo

	Washington, Nov. 6: After President-elect Barack Obama ran a nearly flawless 21-month campaign, Democrats are second-guessing one of his first and most important post-election decisions: Why is he asking Representative Rahm Emanuel  Rahmbo, one of the capitals most in-your-face partisan actors  to be his chief of staff?        
	A second question has the political networks abuzz: Why would Emanuel, now on a ladder potentially to be speaker of the House someday, take the job?        
	For both men, who are close friends from Chicago, the answers capture their separate calculations as to how best to seize the historic moment. In the decisive election of the nations first African American President, they see a mandate to push through actual change in the nations domestic and foreign policies.        
	Late tonight, two Capitol Hill sources said Emanuel had accepted Obamas offer to become White House chief of staff in the new administration.        
	Emanuel, as a House Democratic leader, already is in a prime position to help Obama. But in the modern White House, the chief of staff is one of the most powerful posts in all of government, the gatekeeper to the President on every issue, and the person with the last word.        
	Obama first broached the idea with Emanuel weeks ago, say people familiar with their exchanges. Youd have my back, he is said to have told Emanuel. Obama believes, and the sceptics acknowledge, that few people are better suited for the job on paper.        
	Emanuel, who turns 49 this month, knows the White House, having been a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton. In a brief career as an investment banker after that, he made millions and became familiar with Wall Street; in the House, he helped negotiate the government bailout of the financial system that the next President inherits.        
	And by all accounts, Emanuel knows Congress like few others; in his second term, in 2006, he engineered House Democrats victories to regain the majority. The Democrats in turn elected him as their caucus chairman; he was immediately viewed  not least by himself  as a prospective speaker.         
	A centrist Democrat, Emanuel knows policies as well as politics, easily distills complex issues into a simple message and is renowned for always seeing several steps ahead in the legislative process. But theres the matter of his temperament  or, as Emanuel says: I swear a lot. He also yells a lot, and in his sentences his favourite expletive can serve as subject, verb or adjective when he is facing down either recalcitrant Democrats or Republican opponents.         
	As the House Democrats campaign chairman for 2006, he swore at Hispanic and African American House members, nearly all of whom had safe seats, to contribute more of their personal campaign finances to the party effort. Speaker Nancy Pelosi intervened to smooth things over.        
	To many Democrats, including some who are close to both men, Obamas choice of Emanuel to run the White House seems at odds with the atmosphere Obama enforced at his Chicago campaign headquarters. The motto there was No drama with Obama, in contrast with the backbiting and shakeups in rivals campaigns. Some Democrats say former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle, who is as laid-back as Emanuel is brusque, would be a better fit. Several have privately expressed or relayed reservations to Obama about Emanuel. To one Obama replied: Rahms grown a lot.         
	Emanuels supporters say his reputation for a big ego, over-the-line volatility and take-no-prisoners partisanship is overblown and out of date, rooted still in the Clinton years.        
	Hes very self-aware, said Marcia Hale, a longtime friend and colleague in the Clinton White House who has spoken with Emanuel about the pros and cons of switching jobs. He told me: Look, I know who I am, and I know that I can push too hard, and I know what can happen if I do. At the start of the Clinton administration, Emanuel raised eyebrows when, as chairman of the 1993 inaugural committee, he rode in the parade in a car emblazoned with his name.         
	Early on, he was blamed for alienating two Democratic senators, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, then the chairman of the committee that handled Clintons major initiatives.        
	In the first months, the First Lady, Hillary Clinton, manoeuvred to have Emanuel fired. Clintons chief of staff, Mack McLarty, instead demoted him from political director to the press office.        
	To his great credit, he didnt leave, he took a demotion, lost his office, moved into one of those tiny rooms in the press office and just went to work, Hale said.        
	Emanuel ultimately regained rank as a counsellor, with an office adjoining the Oval Office, and was credited with helping Clinton to pass crime, welfare and trade laws. He worked his way back into Hillarys good graces, as well.        
	Torn by his allegiances to her and his friendship with Obama, he remained neutral in the Democrats nomination battle.        
	House Republicans are said to hate Emanuel for his partisanship, and yesterday, the former Florida congressman Joe Scarborough said on his cable television show that Obamas enlistment of Emanuel amounted to politics as usual when the President-elect had promised conciliation.         
	But Emanuel has worked at good relations with Republicans, and has the grudging respect of some.

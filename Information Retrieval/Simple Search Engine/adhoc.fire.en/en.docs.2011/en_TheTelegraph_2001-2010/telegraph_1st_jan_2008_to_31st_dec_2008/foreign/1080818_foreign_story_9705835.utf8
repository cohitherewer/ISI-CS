	Dhaka, Aug. 17 (Reuters): Bangladesh police launched a special intelligence unit today to monitor the activities of political parties, one of which branded the move as unfortunate and undemocratic.        
	Bangladeshs main political parties have been mounting pressure on the military-backed interim government to end the 19-month-old emergency powers.        
	We created the Political Intelligence Operation (PIO) to gather advance reports of what they (political parties) plan to do, police commissioner Naim Ahmed told reporters.        
	The PIO will not only keep track on activities by political parties and allied organisations but also have an overall responsibility to help ensure a peaceful public life, he said.        
	Suranjit Sengupta, a former lawmaker and senior leader of the Awami League party, described the units launch as unfortunate, undemocratic and unconstitutional.        
	The main task of the police is to track down and punish criminals, not to put a trail on political parties and their activities, he told Reuters over the phone.        
	Such a move is possible only where politics is banned. Thats why we want politics to be fully restored.        
	The two biggest parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), want the government to lift the emergency that was imposed in January 2007 after months of political violence.        
	They want full political freedoms restored as a precondition of participation in a parliamentary election in December.        
	We will hold fresh talks with the interim authority soon, with the main focus on ending the emergency which curbed political and constitutional rights of the citizens of Bangladesh, senior Awami leader Amir Hossain Amu said today.        
	The interim government has detained nearly 170 key political figures since it took over in January 2007 and has put many of them on trial in special courts for alleged corruption.        
	Those key figures include Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina and the BNPs Begum Khaleda Zia, both former Prime Ministers.        
	They both deny charges of wrongdoing while they ruled Bangladesh in turn over the 15 years leading up to October 2006 and say the government wants to destroy their political careers.        
	Hasina was paroled in June for medical treatment in the US, while Khaleda is still in jail. The government has repeatedly said she could also be paroled soon but is yet to set a date for her release.

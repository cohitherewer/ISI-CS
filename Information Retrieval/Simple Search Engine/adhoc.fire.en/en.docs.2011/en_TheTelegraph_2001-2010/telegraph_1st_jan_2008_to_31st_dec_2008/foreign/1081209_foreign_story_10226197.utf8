                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Women feel most sexy at 34, says survey
          MURRAY WARDROP                              
	London, Dec. 8: Women feel most sexy at the age of 34, according to a new survey.         
	The poll also found that middle-aged women have half as much sex as they did when they were younger.         
	However, 56 per cent said they enjoyed it now more than they did when they were younger.         
	The study discovered that on average women aged 45 to 60 has sex 4.5 times a month, compared to 10.4 times a month in their 20s and 30s. When asked at what age they had felt most sexy, the average was 34.        
	Sex and relationship advisor Catherine Hood said: Many of us make the assumption that older people have less sex than the young, and this research appears to confirm this.         
	However, it does show that women are still enjoying great sex lives as they get older.         
	Womens sexual needs, libido and lifestyle change over time, but there is absolutely no reason why older women cant enjoy an extremely fulfilling sex life in their middle age and well into their senior years.         
	The fact that over half of those quizzed said they had better sex now than in their 20s and 30s suggests that these women are more confident and self-assured than they were in their younger days and arent afraid of getting what they want.         
	The research commissioned by moisturiser brand Astral questioned 1,031 women about their sex lives.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Minneapolis/St Paul (Minnesota), Sept. 4: Americas Republicans are to campaign for their elections in November touting the Indo-US nuclear deal as a feather in their foreign policy cap.         
	The party has unequivocally gone beyond their Democratic rivals in expressing support for the deal. We welcome Americas new relationship with India, including the US-India Civil Nuclear Accord, says the Republican platform  manifesto  adopted by the partys national convention here.         
	The references to India in the platform are one of the few foreign policy credits for the party which is going into the election tied to the legacy of George W. Bushs nearly eight-year presidency that has seen an unprecedented erosion of support for the US across the globe.         
	About the only other positive foreign policy references in the platform are to Britain and Israel. The platform is confrontational on Russia, combative on Taiwan and suspicious on China. On Asia, it is condescending towards Japan and sees South Korea only in the context of US interests in the region.         
	About India, the platform says the common security concerns of India and the US and shared commitment to political freedom and representative government can be the foundation for an enduring partnership.         
	Despite the unequivocal support for the nuclear deal and a broad endorsement of the Bush administrations policy towards India, there are aspects in the document that should be cause for concern in New Delhi.         
	The platform offers a salute to the work of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, which has repeatedly baited India and demanded that New Delhi should be equated with communist countries and some former Soviet republics which restrict religious freedom.         
	The commission has recommended some of these countries for sanctions by US government agencies.         
	The commission has sought permission to officially visit India to study its secular record, but such permission has been denied by governments in New Delhi led by both the BJP and the Congress. Even yesterday, the commission called on the US state department to urge the central government and its Human Rights and Minority Commissions to continue their investigations, issue reports on the status of their investigations.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Soyuz lands 420km off course
                            
	Kazakh Steppe (Kazakhstan), April 19 (Reuters): A Russian space capsule landed about 420km off course in Kazakhstan today but South Koreas first astronaut and the other two crew were safe.        
	The Soyuz capsule landed west of the target area and about 20 minutes past the scheduled time after it adopted a so-called ballistic landing, space officials said. Rescue helicopters rushed to the site. The capsule landed with an overshoot. Such things happen, said mission control spokesman Valery Lyndin.        
	He said the crew had begun leaving the capsule, which carried Yi So-yeon, a 29-year old nanotechnology engineer from Seoul, US commander Peggy Whitson and Russian flight engineer Yuri Malenchenko. A Reuters photographer, who travelled to the landing site in a helicopter with rescue crews, saw plumes of smoke rising from the capsule.

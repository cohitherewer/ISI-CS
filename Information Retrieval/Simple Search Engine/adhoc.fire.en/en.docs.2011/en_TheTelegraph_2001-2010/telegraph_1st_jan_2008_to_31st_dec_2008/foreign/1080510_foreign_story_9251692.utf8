	London, May 9 (PTI): Upset with Chancellor Alistair Darling for raising the price of beer in the budget, pub owners in Cumbria, northwest England, have banned him from entering their outlets.        
	Members of the Kendal Bar Watch Scheme have voted unanimously to keep Darling out. The Chancellor increased duty on a pint of beer by 4 pence and raised duty on spirits by 55 pence a bottle from every pub in Cumbria.        
	 Local residents dont remember spotting Darling on their streets, but if he does come visiting, he will not be able to walk into a pub for a drink. Irate pub owners believe that raising the price of a beer pint amounted to anti-social behaviour.        
	 Paul Little of the George and Dragon Pub, who is a member of the watch scheme, told the BBC: If he turns up he wont be welcome, definitely not. The bar watch is a very serious tool that the landlords can use to keep out the undesirables and keep staff safe. But if someone threatens myself, staff or business then we take that seriously.

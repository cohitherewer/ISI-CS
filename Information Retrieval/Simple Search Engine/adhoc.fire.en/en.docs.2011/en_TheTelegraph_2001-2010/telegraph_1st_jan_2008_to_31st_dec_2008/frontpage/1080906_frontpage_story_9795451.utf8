The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Shibu Soren leaves bureaucracy guessing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Shibu Soren leaves bureaucracy guessing
  - All five commissionerates without bosses as chief minister heads for Delhi          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                            The waiting game                                        
	Ranchi, Sept. 5: The states simmering political scene may have settled to some extent, but its bureaucracy still remains on tenterhooks.        
	The uncertainty over who is to man which department is likely to continue, at least, for the next few days, as chief minister Shibu Soren is in New Delhi to express his gratitude to the king-makers at the Centre.        
	Although before leaving yesterday he settled speculation over the change of chief secretary by re-appointing A.K. Basu, Soren also gave new positions to the three other claimants to the post.        
	He posted the three in the rank of chief secretaries  A.K. Chug, S.K. Chaudhary and A.K. Singh  as revenue board member, development commissioner and director-general of Administrative Training Institute (ATI), respectively.        
	But, till date, all five divisional commissionerate of the state  South Chhotanagpur with headquarters at Ranchi, North Chhotanagpur with its headquarters at Hazaribagh, Palamau with its headquarters at Daltonganj, Kolhan with headquarters at Chaibasa and Santhal Pargana with headquarters at Dumka  are functioning without a head.        
	Besides, Sukhdev Singh, the principal secretary to former chief minister Madhu Koda and the busiest of all bureaucrats till a few days ago, is jobless for more than 10 days. He has been waiting for his new post since the change.        
	Also, the post of the home secretary has been running under the additional charge of human resources department secretary J.B. Tubid for a fortnight. So, a reshuffle in the bureaucracy is imminent.        
	The Santhal Pargana commissionerate, too, has been thrown headless since August 30 after divisional commissioner B.K. Tripathy was appointed the principal secretary to chief minister Shibu Soren.        
	The posts of divisional commissioners at Ranchi and Palamau are also lying vacant after incumbent Mohanlal Rai retired on August 31.         
	Incidentally, the musical chair over the posts in recent months has put a question mark on the validity of these posts. Till July 31, Nidhi Khare was in-charge of the South Chhotanagpur and Kolhan commissionerate. Rai was put in charge after Khare went on central deputation as the director in the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment.         
	In fact, Tripathy, for some time, held the post of three commissioners of Kolhan, Hazaribagh and Dumka, all 200km from each other. He remained shuttling between the three cities for almost a month.        
	The post of divisional commissioner acts as an interface between the state headquarters and district administration. The commissioner, on his or her part, happens to be the inspecting authority of the district administration. He also issues arms licences for revolvers and bus route permits. Besides, he happens to be the appellate authority in revenue cases, disposed of by the deputy commissioner.        
	The post monitors the functioning of the district administration when there is a lack of communication. Now, in the cyber age, there is supposedly a direct link between the headquarters and the district administration, said a senior IAS officer.        
	However, a senior personnel department official pointed out that the absence of commissioners would have an obvious impact on the functioning of the government. We have not received any instruction as yet from the chief minister, he added.         
	Personnel secretary R.S. Sharma said the posts would be filled up soon.         
	Now its up to Soren to end the suspense.

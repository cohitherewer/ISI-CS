 - SC issues notices on plea for pictorial warnings

	New Delhi, Jan. 25: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Union health secretary and a host of tobacco companies on a petition seeking to make pictorial warnings mandatory on cigarette packs and tobacco pouches.
    
	The government had framed the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Packing and Labelling Rules, 2006, making the skull-and-cross-bones warning a must for all tobacco-makers, but they are yet to be implemented.
    
	The rules were supposed to come into effect from February 1, 2007. The deadline has been extended several times since then. The latest deadline is March 17, 2008. 
    
	The rules had, among other things, specified that the warnings would have to cover 50 per cent of the packets.
    
	In case of cigarettes, they would have to clearly state that 2,500 people die as a result of smoking every day. Pouches of gutkha, which is chewed, would mention that tobacco causes cancer. 
    
	These warnings, in English and one more regional language, would have to be displayed on both sides of the packets.
    
	The petition, filed by lawyers Himanshu Gupta and Narinder Sharma, alleged that instead of enforcing the rules, the government had diluted them under pressure from the tobacco lobby. The rules were changed to make these mandatory warnings optional on the ground that they could hurt religious sentiments.
    
	The petition said the rules did not address the issue of revealing product contents on packages. The government had argued that it did not have the technology or the manpower to regulate the level of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide in a product. 
    
	The petition urged the court to also impose a ban on misleading advertisements, which plug mild, light and ultra-mild cigarettes as less harmful. Beedi packets should be asked to state clearly that smoking beedis causes cancer, the petition said.
    
	Scrapping of major portions of the rules and making a display of pictorial warnings optional will defeat the very purpose of the rules, it argued, adding that tobacco companies would obviously not comply for fear of loss of business.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gangtok, April 18: A cargo vehicle packed with children headed to a fest skidded 30ft off the road in South Sikkim today, killing a Class XII student and injuring 32.        
	Narendra Sharma died on the spot near Rabongla. The injured students were taken by local people to Namchi District Hospital and Sir Thutob Namgyal Memorial Hospital in Gangtok, 55km away. Sonal Chopen Bhutia, one of the injured, was shifted to Siliguri by helicopter. Two others, Sangam Rai and Deepak Prasad, were taken there by road. Their condition is said to be stable.        
	The driver of the vehicle was also injured and sent to the Namchi hospital. Police said a case of negligent driving has been started against him.        
	Students of VC Ganju Lama High School at Rabongla have accused the police of overloading the vehicle bound for the golden jubilee celebration of Biring High School, 12km away.         
	Although the cultural programme was cancelled, Sikkim chief minister Pawan Chamling, who was the chief guest, read through the inaugural speech and announced Rs 1 lakh as compensation for the family of the deceased.         
	The accident brought back memories of a similar incident in Gujarat two days ago when a state government bus fell into the Narmada canal and killed at least 41 students. Earlier this month a bus in Calcutta had plunged into a canal, killing 20 passengers.        
	Students and residents of Rabongla in South Sikkim protested in front of the local police station for five hours and blocked all roads leading to Singtam, Gyalshing, Ralong and Yangang.         
	The crowd dispersed after police resorted to lathicharge in the evening.         
	Tashi Tshering Bhutia, a Class XII student, said from his bed at the hospital that a police officer had insisted that they all board the goods carrier that belonged to the school in Biring.        
	We had objected, but the police officer insisted. We were 8km downhill from Rabongla when the driver tried to negotiate a turn and the vehicle overturned and fell off the road, said Bhutia.        
	Rabongla town, 55km from here, was shut as a mark of respect for the dead student.        
	Later in the evening, Chamling with Rabongla MLA and state urban development minister D.D. Bhutia and health secretary V.B. Pradhan visited the injured in the state general hospital. Chamling said his government would bear the treatment cost of the injured.        
	A statement issued by the state information and public relations department said the chief minister has expressed deep shock at the incident.        
	In Gangtok, the opposition parties  the Congress, the BJP and the CPM  in a statement claimed that the students were forcibly made to attend the programme which did not have enough audience although it was being chaired by the chief minister.        
	The students were compelled by the police and Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) workers to attend the programme at Biring. This is exploitation that resulted in the death of an innocent boy, the statement read.         
	The SDF is the ruling party in Sikkim.

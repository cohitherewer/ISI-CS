  - Apex court wants state legislature to rethink move          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                            A leprosy patient. Telegraph picture                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: The Supreme Court has upheld an Orissa law that debars leprosy patients from contesting for municipal body posts, but urged the state legislature to rethink whether it should retain such a law in the statute books in view of recent medical developments which make the disease curable.         
	Sections 16(1)(iv) and 17(1)(b) of the Orissa Municipal Act, 1950, state that no person shall be qualified to stand for election as a councillor of a municipality if such person has been adjudged by a competent court to be of unsound mind or was a leprosy or a tuberculosis patient. Section 17 goes a step further. It states that a councilor shall also cease to hold his office, if he becomes of unsound mind, a leprosy or a tuberculosis patient.         
	Whether or not a person stands disqualified would be decided by a district judge at the request of the municipality or any of its councilors and his decision shall be final.         
	The election tribunal-cum-district judge, Balasore, had disqualified councilor Dhirendra Pandua from contesting and holding the post under Section 38 of the Act.         
	That was later upheld by the High Court on Oct 7, 2005.         
	Pandua was elected as a councillor in the elections held on 19th September, 2003 for the Notified Area Council. Days later on 30th September, 2003, he was also elected as the chairperson of the Municipal Council.

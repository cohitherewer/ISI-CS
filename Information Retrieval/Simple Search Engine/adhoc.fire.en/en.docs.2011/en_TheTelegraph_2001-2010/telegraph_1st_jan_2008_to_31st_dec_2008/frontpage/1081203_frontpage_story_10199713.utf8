          AMIT ROY                             Dev Patel (left) and Anil Kapoor (right) in Slumdog Millionaire                                  
	London, Dec. 2: A life-affirming movie set in Mumbai called Slumdog Millionaire, based on the best-selling novel by the diplomat-author, Vikas Swarup, has swept the British Independent Film Awards in London, winning three of the top awards  Best Film, Best Director (Danny Boyle) and Most Promising Newcomer (Dev Patel).         
	The terrorists who struck Mumbai last week appear to have inspired what in movie circles is being called the Bombay bounce.         
	Patel, the UK-lead character who plays Jamal Malik, an 18-year-old youth from the slums who somehow manages to answer all the questions in a TV quiz (and is soundly thrashed by the police as a consequence), has told The Telegraph in an interview that he loved the whole Bollywood experience.         
	I cant wait to be back in Mumbai, he said.         
	The film, which is doing well at the US box office, has started an Oscar buzz. It is due to be released in India on January 23 and may well pull in larger than anticipated audiences in Mumbai.         
	The director, Boyle, and his screenplay writer, Simon Beaufoy, has tampered with Swarups story  in the original, for example, the lead character, a sort of Amar Akbar Anthony mixture of unknown religion, was not a Muslim, nor was there poisonous Hindu-Muslim enmity.         
	Nevertheless, Slumdog Millionaire, featuring a group of chalu children from the Dharavi slums, does manage to engender a feel good, life-enhancing mood.         
	The only one to have missed out at the 11th British Independent Film Awards, just held at Old Billingsgate Market in London, is Anil Kapoor who has given a convincing performance as the devious bastard question master, Prem Kumar.         
	At the awards ceremony, Johanna von Fischer and Tessa Collinson, the ceremonys co-directors, said: Its been another stellar year for independent film in Britain. The diverse range of films nominated showcases an astounding line up of talent both new and established that demands to be celebrated.         
	Elliot Grove, founder of Raindance and the British Independent Film Awards, added: The nominations and award winners prove that filmmaking in Britain is alive and well.         
	There are hopes of greater Indo-British collaboration now that there is a film treaty in place between the two countries.         
	John Woodward, the chief executive officer of the UK Film Council, the major funding partner of the awards, commented: This years nominations and award winners really highlight the range of talent working in the UK with powerful, ground-breaking and imaginative films coming from filmmakers with diverse voices. Over the years these awards have developed a great knack for discovering exciting new talent and promoting them to a wider film world, consequently championing British independent film excellence and originality.         
	Doyle called Patel a very talented young lad. He comes from an Indian background but its a big ask to come to Bombay and play a local among a completely Bollywood cast.         
	The brush with Bollywood has not gone to Patels head  not yet anyway. Patel lives in London in a traditional Gujarati immigrant family with his father, Raj, an accountant, and mother, Anita, a careworker.         
	Clutching his Most Promising Newcomer award, Patel, who has had one minor role in a British soap, said: I live these two different lives where Im Danny Boyles lead in India and then I go home and my mum is saying, make your bed and help with the washing up. It keeps me grounded.

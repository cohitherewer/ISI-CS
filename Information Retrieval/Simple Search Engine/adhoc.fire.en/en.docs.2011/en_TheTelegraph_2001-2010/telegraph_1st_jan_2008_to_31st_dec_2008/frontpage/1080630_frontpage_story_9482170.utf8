The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Jindal runs into voter backlash
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Jindal runs into voter backlash

	Washington, June 29: Indian American Bobby Jindals honeymoon with the people of Louisiana, who elected him as their governor only a few months ago, appears to be over.        
	Citizens of the state, angry over his approval of a 123 per cent pay increase for legislators, have initiated a recall petition against the governor who promised during his election campaign to prohibit such excesses by politicians.        
	The recall effort is a longshot: it requires verifiable signatures from more than 900,000 registered Louisiana voters.        
	That may be difficult in a state where normal governance is in disarray as it continues to reel from the fallout of the devastating hurricane Katrina in 2005.        
	Jindal, Jim Tucker, the Speaker of Louisianas House of Representatives and two other lawmakers are all targets of the recall efforts after they facilitated the salary raise for legislators -- with additional increases pegged to inflation -- even as the state is unable to bring back its citizens who sought refuge outside Louisiana after hurricane Katrina.        
	Jindal is under severe attack in the state and nationally for two other reasons.        
	This week he signed into law a bill that seeks to undercut the teaching of evolution in Louisianas public schools. The bill is a back-door effort by Louisiana to bring back its infamous Creationism Act, passed in the 1980s, that prohibited the teaching of Charles Darwins theory of evolution in schools unless it was accompanied by instruction in creation science which highlights, in practice, the role of God in creating the universe.        
	That law was declared unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court on the ground that it amounted to an endorsement of religion. Jindal this week spurned nationwide appeals to him to veto the attempt to bring God back into classrooms in his state through the back door.        
	Arthur Landy, who taught Jindal at the Ivy League Brown University issued a statement: Governor Jindal was a good student in my class when he was thinking about becoming a doctor and I hope he doesnt do anything that would hold back the next generation of Louisianas doctors.        
	The New York Times appealed in an editorial to the conservative governor to stop the bill from becoming law. If Mr. Jindal has the interests of students at heart, the sensible thing is to veto this Trojan horse legislation. The appeal fell on deaf ears.         
	Jindal is also under fire for signing into law another bill that would permit chemical castration of convicted rapists and other sex offenders in his state.        
	The law has been attacked by many experts and civil society arguing that it is against the US Constitution because it amounts to a cruel and unusual punishment.        
	Jindal signed the bill after the US Supreme Court last week struck down Louisianas decision to execute child rapists. He called the Supreme Courts decision atrocious.        
	While Jindal is trying to shore up his conservative credentials in the run-up to the choice of a Republican vice-presidential candidate, the disaffection for him is also being fanned by those who do not want him to be Senator John McCains running mate in the November election to the White House.        
	It was clear during the weekend, however, that the normally cocky governor has been taken somewhat aback by the backlash in Louisiana to his decision to raise the pay for legislators, who only work part-time and have other sources of income.        
	He released a statement about the recall effort: The voters of our state are angry that the legislature more than doubled their own pay and I agree with them. It was excessive and they should reverse it. I am sure more voters will take extraordinary steps to show their anger over the pay raise before this is all said and done  thats how a democracy works.        
	He said in a speech yesterday that he made a mistake in letting the state legislature control its session, but continued to insist that he would not veto the pay rise.

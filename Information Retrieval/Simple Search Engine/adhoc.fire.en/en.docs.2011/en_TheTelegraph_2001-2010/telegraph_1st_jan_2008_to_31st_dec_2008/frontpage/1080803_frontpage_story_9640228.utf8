          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Karzai in Colombo. (AP)                          
	Colombo, Aug. 2: Pakistan was today portrayed as a country in the grip of sanctuaries of terror as Afghan President Hamid Karzai ripped the diplomatic veneer of a multilateral summit and spoke of institutional nurturing of extremists in the region.        
	Karzai converted Afghanistans second appearance on the Saarc stage into a blunt denouncement of border-less terrorism, mentioning Pakistan by name and commenting on the countrys internal affairs that are increasingly being blamed for the rise of militant attacks in South Asia.        
	The Kabul embassy attack and the serial blasts fresh on his mind, Manmohan Singh also spoke the same language, condemning the ideologies of hatred, (and) fanaticism, but did not name Pakistan.        
	About Karzais speech, sources said it was unusual for a head of state at an international conference to name and blame another country.        
	In Pakistan, terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of shaheed (martyr) Benazir Bhutto, Karzai said in his 18-minute speech on the summits opening day. The topic is likely to be played up further when he visits Delhi on Monday.        
	Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani betrayed no emotion but appeared to be watching Karzai keenly at times, with his right hand supporting his chin.        
	When his turn came to speak, Gilani made no reference to what Karzai had said. But Bhuttos assassination received a mention, this time as proof that Pakistan was a victim of terrorism.        
	Singh termed terrorism the biggest threat to our stability. He said the attack on the Kabul mission and the Bangalore and Ahmedabad blasts were gruesome reminders of barbarity.        
	Karzais direct mention of Pakistan left the Indian camp purring, with officials saying the President had brought out in the open what everybody knows.        
	The Pakistanis, however, would have been sorely missing their President, a man with an eye for gimmickry who may have been relied on to spring some out-of-the-box response. At the 2002 Kathmandu Saarc summit, amid reports of shelling across the LoC, Pervez Musharraf had walked up to Atal Bihari Vajpayee and shaken his hands on the dais. He later claimed he had done it on impulse.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dec. 28: Chased by police, a college student out drag racing with friends in Bangalore dropped his motorcycle and ran for his life into the nearby house of a brigadier, where he was shot dead by army guards.        
	Mohammed Mukarram, 20, was racing his bike  a Saturday night ritual for many in Bangalore  with other youths on Old Airport Road past 1am today when a mobile police squad spotted them.         
	Police permission is needed to hold a drag race  where participants in cars or bikes race each other on a short strip, Dhoom style. Night races flout this rule, and so are illegal.         
	The BCom student, who was doing wheelies (riding the bike on its rear wheel), rode off towards the Ulsoor cantonment area when chased by the police, then dropped his bike and ran into Flag Staff House, the residential quarters of the commander of the Karnataka and Kerala sub-area.         
	The army guards opened fire after he was discovered on the terrace of Brigadier P.S. Ravindranaths house in the defence area at Ulsoor around 2am and tried to jump over the compound wall, ignoring their warning to surrender, Ulsoor area inspector M.K. Thammaiah said over the phone.         
	He was noticed by the guards on the terrace of the single-storey army bungalow who asked him to come down and surrender. Instead, he managed to jump into the garden and began running. The guards first tried to stop him by firing in the air but shot him when he tried to scale the compound wall, Thammaiah added.         
	The sentries, on their guard in these times of terror and security alerts, fired six rounds, sources said.        
	They heard Mukarram calling friends for help on his cellphone from the terrace. He spoke in Urdu, the sources added.         
	The police have registered a case of trespass and entering a restricted area under Sections 448 and 103 of the Indian Penal Code against the victim on a complaint by army police.         
	Mukarrams body was handed over to his parents after post-mortem. His father is a bus driver.        
	According to a news release issued by the defence public relations office, a man managed to enter Flag Staff House.         
	After a thorough search, the sentries on guard sensed the presence of somebody on the top of the house. Before the guards could apprehend the intruder, he jumped down and fled towards the compound wall towards the main road. When the intruder did not heed the armed guards warning to surrender, the intruder was fired upon.        
	The police crack down on drag races because the speeding makes roads unsafe. In the past, Dhoom star John Abraham had appealed to bikers to go slow and be safe.

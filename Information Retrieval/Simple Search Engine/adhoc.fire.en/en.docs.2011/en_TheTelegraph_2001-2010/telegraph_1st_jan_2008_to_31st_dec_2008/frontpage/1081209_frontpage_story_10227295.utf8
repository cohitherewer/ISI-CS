  - Performance pays: Congress: 3, BJP: 2, Terrorism overkill: 0        MANINI CHATTERJEE                                                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: Performance and effective leadership emerged the twin winners today in the crucial semi-final round of elections in five states.        
	A mature electorate gave the thumbs-up to three incumbent governments in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and voted out the high-profile but unpopular Vasundhara Raje-led regime in Rajasthan and the jaded, decade-long rule of Zoramthangas Mizo National Front in the northeastern state.        
	The Congresss 3:2 score  won in the backdrop of the Mumbai terror strikes and a global financial crisis  came as a shot in the arm for the party which had made losing Assembly polls something of a habit over the last four years.        
	The states of Delhi, Mizoram and Rajasthan may account for a mere 34 seats in the Lok Sabha but the triple victory gives the ruling party a big psychological advantage in the run-up to the general elections less than six months away.        
	For the BJP, the spectacular victory in Madhya Pradesh and the good showing in Chhattisgarh  thanks to its chief ministers Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Raman Singh who managed to counter the resentment against party MLAs effectively  were a source of some consolation. But the losses in Rajasthan and Delhi put a damper on the celebrations that the party was all set to unleash till the results rolled in.        
	The results also confirmed that despite relentless efforts made by the Bahujan Samaj Party, the elephant was yet to become a major player in northern India outside Uttar Pradesh. The BSP increased its vote percentage and seats but not to the extent some expected after Mayavati stormed to victory in the Uttar Pradesh elections 18 months ago.        
	Of all the results today, Delhi was the most significant. If the capital proved to be the jewel in the Congress crown, the BJPs failure to wrest it even after 10 years of Sheila Dikshits rule was particularly distressing for reasons both political and ideological.        
	The BJP national leadership had made national security the partys primary poll issue even before the Mumbai assault took place and was confident that the UPA governments soft attitude towards terror would swing the Indian voter, particularly in urban areas, to its side.         
	After the Mumbai strikes on November 26, the BJP went on a no-holds-barred offensive. It issued gory advertisements in Delhi newspapers depicting splotches of blood with the words: Brutal terror strikes at will, Weak government, Unwilling and Incapable, Fight Terror, Vote BJP.         
	Mumbai, the party was confident, would evoke the strongest response in Delhi, given the capitals own periodic brushes with terror and the influence of 24/7 television coverage on the citys dominant middle class.        
	But far from effecting a last-minute post-Mumbai swing in favour of the BJP, the Congress surpassed even its own most optimistic estimates to win a comfortable majority in the Assembly for the third term in a row.         
	Delhi voters came out in large numbers to support a government that had visibly improved the city and a leader who was largely popular instead of getting swayed by the BJPs emotive campaign on terror.         
	In fact, the BJPs unseemly exploitation of the Mumbai carnage, even when the security forces had not ended their battle with the terrorists, made certain sections of the Delhi public come out and vote in favour of the Congress on November 29.         
	As in the case of Delhi, the role of governance and leadership was also central to the BJPs victories in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.         
	Although Congress leaders such as Digvijay Singh have attributed the partys poor showing in Madhya Pradesh and less-than-expected tally in Rajasthan to the BJPs exploitation of the Mumbai strikes, Delhis results do not bear out this thesis.        
	The terror plank may have galvanised the BJP support base to come out in larger numbers in towns such as Indore, Ujjain, Kota or Jaipur but that alone would not have worked in the absence of other factors. In Rajasthan, for instance, the Vasundhara government had been reeling under charges of corruption, malgovernance, caste clashes and infighting within the ruling BJP  and that proved too strong an anti-incumbency even after Mumbai.        
	In Madhya Pradesh, on the other hand, Chauhan had managed to package himself as a clean, compassionate, and unassuming leader who was devoted to the states development sans Narendra Modis machismo. The local BJP leadership steered clear of raising emotional issues even though sadhvi Pragya Thakur hailed from the state and chose to focus on aam aadmi issues.         
	It was the same story in neighbouring Chhattisgarh (the only state to go to polls before the Mumbai strikes) where the portly Raman Singh opted for an avuncular image and focused on development rather than Hindutva.         
	In both these states, the RSS organisation has always been very active but the overt face of the BJP was represented by the low-profile yet popular chief ministers.        
	The BJPs incumbency advantage was helped enormously by the organisational weakness and leadership deficit in the Congress. In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress high command parcelled out ticket distribution to sub-regional satraps such as Kamal Nath, Suresh Pachouri, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Digvijay Singh under the illusion that if no one leader was projected, there would be less internal sabotage during the campaign.         
	In Chhattisgarh, wheelchair-bound Ajit Jogi ran a vigorous campaign but was not projected as the prospective chief minister. That the Congress fared much better in Chhattisgarh than in Madhya Pradesh perhaps tells its own tale.        
	The Congress may argue that the party wrested Rajasthan despite the absence of a leader but, arguably, it would have done a much better job of harnessing the anti-BJP sentiment with an identifiable general in command.        
	This is clear from the Delhi result  where Dikshits personality towered over that of her opponent V.K. Malhotra and proved a big plus with the voters.         
	The Congresss refusal to change its elected MLAs will decide the CM stance has already extracted a heavy price in election after election in the states. It remains to be seen whether the party will draw a lesson from this and project Manmohan Singh as the prospective Prime Minister in Election 2009.

	Paris, April 7 (Agencies): Paris has forced the Olympic flame to catch a lowly bus, not once but many times.        
	The flame was extinguished at least twice in Paris today, prompting Chinese officials to call off the chaotic relay in the face of waves of protests by pro-Tibetan activists.        
	The Paris protests against Chinas policies on human rights and Tibet outstripped those that had already marred the Olympic relay in London and earlier stops.        
	In the end, security officials gave up and put the flame on a bus for the final stretch of the journey  stopping just soon enough for a torchbearer to finish the last five meters on foot.        
	Despite massive security, at least two activists got almost within arms length of the flame before they were grabbed by police. A protester threw water at the torch but failed to extinguish it.        
	Officers tackled numerous protesters and carried some away. A handful of French activists supporting Tibet had a fist-fight with pro-Chinese demonstrators. The French activists spat on them and shouted: Fascists!                    
	At the start of the relay, on the Eiffel Towers first floor, Green Party activist Sylvain Garel lunged for the first torchbearer, former hurdler Stephane Diagana, shouting freedom for the Chinese. Security officials pulled Garel back.        
	Soon afterwards, activists waving Tibetan flags confronted the torchbearer on a road along the Seine River. Security officers put the flame out and whisked the torch away on a bus.        
	Less than an hour later, the flame was being carried out of a traffic tunnel by a woman athlete in a wheelchair when the procession was halted by activists. Again, the torch was extinguished and put on a bus.        
	Later, security officials apparently interrupted the procession because they spotted demonstrators ahead. The torch disappeared inside the bus a fourth time shortly after a protester approached with a fire extinguisher near the Louvre museum. Police grabbed the demonstrator before he could spray.

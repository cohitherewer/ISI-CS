              Ansari: Innocent
                 
	Jan. 14: Aftab Alam Ansari, a young Calcuttan arrested on the charge of ferrying explosives for the court blasts in Uttar Pradesh, is innocent, police said today.
    
	We have found that his arrest was a case of mistaken identity, Brij Lal, the additional director-general of Uttar Pradesh police, told The Telegraph this evening, a little over a fortnight after the youth was yanked off bed and hauled off to the northern state from Calcutta.
    
	Lal said the police would tomorrow urge the court to set Ansari free.
    
	Ansari, who worked in a power distribution company, was arrested on December 29 from his home in Baranagar, north Calcutta, by officials of the Bengal CID and the Uttar Pradesh polices special task force.
    
	The police had claimed that the 27-year-old Ansari had single-handedly carted the entire cache of explosives used in the chain blasts in Uttar Pradesh courts in November that killed 15 people.
    
	Ansaris mother Ayesha Begum had said soon after his arrest that her son was innocent. Today, officer Lal could only mumble: Now all we can tell his mother is we are sorry. We are also happy to announce that he is innocent.
    
	Told of the dramatic turn of events this evening, Ayesha Begum wept for joy. Insha Allah, mera bachcha ab wapas ghar aa jayega (Thank god, my son will now return home), she said in Calcutta.
    
	I went to Lucknow to see my son. But I found him nowhere. I went to the court and the jail, but no one helped. I have not seen him since the day the police picked him up, she added.
    
	Ansaris younger brother Wahid said: I knew my brother was innocent and would get justice one day. But we demand punishment for the guilty policemen.
    
	Asked whether action would be taken against the policemen, Lal said in Lucknow: We will look into that later. 
    
	The police officer said Ansari was picked up on the basis of a statement by Mohammad Khalid and Tariq Quazmi, two suspects caught in Lucknow a couple of days before Ansaris arrest. 
    
	However, during the course of investigations, it transpired that he was not the person we were looking for, Lal said.
    
	A senior officer of the STF said the person the police were looking for was one Aftab but this is not him.
    
	Ansari, who dropped out of school after passing Class X, had shifted to Calcutta from Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh in 2005. His father used to work in Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ajmals loss is Congs gain
                                                                                                           Ajmals loss is Congs gain
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, March 27: Four members of the Assam United Democratic Front resigned today to join the Congress, making the ruling party rejoice at the prospect of a political realignment that could leave the Opposition in disarray.         
	The desertions occurred in minority-dominated Barpeta and included the AUDFs district president, Minhazur Rahman. The other three  Rahim Badshah, Rashminara Ahmed and Lutfur Rahman  are zila parishad members.        
	Minhazur Rahman said in his resignation letter to AUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal that he was quitting to protest the partys growing friendship with the communal BJP and the parochial Asom Gana Parishad in the name of Opposition unity.         
	An alliance of this nature, he said, was contrary to the AUDFs ideology and clashed with the interests of the minorities. I cannot accept your friendship with the AGP and the BJP.         
	Badshah and Lutfur Rahman said they were held hostage by the AUDF leadership after the zila parishad poll results were declared last month. The duo filed FIRs with Barpeta police, saying they were tortured.        
	Ajmals loss was not only the Congresss gain, but a moral victory, too. The ruling party recently described floor co-ordination among the three main Opposition parties as an unholy nexus.         
	Minister and government spokesman Himanta Biswa Sarma said the churning had just begun and that the AUDF would pay for its leaderships decision to align with the AGP and the BJP. I had been saying that the people of Assam would not accept such an unholy alliance. That four AUDF members have chosen to join the Congress vindicates my claim. He said AUDF members in Nalbari district were restive and willing to cross over to the Congress.        
	A PCC leader said this was the beginning of the end for Ajmals party. The Congress is in touch with several legislators to engineer a vertical split ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, he added.        
	The AUDF was formed after the Supreme Court scrapped the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act. Ajmal then accused the Congress of failing to protect the minority communitys interest.

 - Attacked by goons, election personnel make bonfire of materials in Hailakandi
    OUR CORRESPONDENT 
                     
	Hailakandi, Jan. 9: Assam today made electoral history of the most dubious kind when officials on panchayat poll duty made a bonfire of ballot boxes and other election materials to protest the administrations failure to protect them from groups out to rig voting.
    
	Goons allegedly hired by the Congress and its rival, the Assam United Democratic Front, assaulted polling officials at several places in this south Assam district throughout last night and during the third phase of elections today. 
    
	That may have been expected given the friction between political workers in the run-up to the last phase of elections, but what nobody had bargained for is the polling personnel retaliating the way they did. By evening, the army was out in Hailakandi, Katlicherra and Serishpore to prevent a possible backlash.
    
	Official sources said nearly 100 polling officials were injured, one of them critically, in the attacks since last night. A policeman was injured, too.
    
	As many as 2,500 of the 3,300 polling staff engaged for todays polling in 621 polling stations in Hailakandi district were schoolteachers. Barely had they opened the booths this morning, when the goons arrived and continued from where they left off during the night. 
    
	Voters who queued up in the first hour dispersed at the sight of the goons, leaving them to target the polling personnel. Apart from ballot boxes and other materials, they snatched mobile phones and other valuables.
    
	Bruised and battered polling personnel later gathered at S.S. College in Hailakandi town and made a bonfire of the polling materials they had managed to save from the goons. A few policemen looked on helplessly. 
    
	Nearly two hours had elapsed by the time police and paramilitary forces reached the college campus to chase away the irate polling personnel. 
    
	Hailakandi deputy commissioner S.P. Kakati Bora said the rowdiness of the polling staff was unprecedented. He hinted at fresh polling in most booths. No arrests were made till late this evening. 
    
	Polling staff had an inkling of what was in store for them and had demanded better security. Some of them even refused to head for their stations after receiving the polling materials on Monday. 
    
	Inspector-general of police Ramesh Chandra Jain gathered the polling staff that evening and assured them of the highest possible level of security in all the booths. The polling personnel left for their stations yesterday escorted only by homeguards.
    
	In other incidents during the day, workers of a particular party damaged the office building of the State Institute of Rural Development at Boalipar in the same district. One person was injured in Dinanathpur when goons fired on rural voters lining up at a polling booth. 
    
	There was trouble in Dhubri district, too, in the run-up to the election. A legislator who was allegedly doling out blankets and money to panchayat voters on Monday night was critically injured in an attack by workers of rival parties. 
    
	Gouripur legislator Mohibul Hoque, an associate Congress member, was visiting Naidor village in Dhubri district with three candidates in tow when supporters of rival parties got wind of his alleged plan to bribe voters and mounted the attack. He was admitted to a Guwahati hospital with multiple injuries.
    
	But the poll observer (law and order) for elections in Dhubri, J.P. Meena, said today that the attack on Hoque was not because he violated the poll code of conduct. 
    
	The percentage of polling in the third phase was 80 per cent, the election office said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Waiver cash, via rare route
                                                                                                           Waiver cash, via rare route
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                               
	New Delhi, March 12: The Centre today asked lawmakers to clear a farm debt-relief fund of Rs 10,000 crore, removing some of the opacity that has surrounded the programme to waive farm loans of Rs 60,000 crore by June 30.        
	The Rs 10,000-crore fund  part of a Rs 1.4-trillion supplementary demand for funds this financial year  will be used to partly retire debts of 40 million farmers.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram surprised lawmakers with his third and final batch of supplementary demands for grants for 2007-08  a trick he used last year as well to repay government debts of Rs 3.4 trillion.         
	The debt relief fund will be used to scrap loans disbursed to farmers by scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks and co-operative banks. Chidambaram had announced the grand farm loan-waiver programme in his budget for 2008-09 last month.         
	It isnt unusual for a government to seek a third supplementary demand  and it is normally made around the same time as the budget for the next year. But rarely has it been sought more than a week after the general budget has been presented and possibly never to cover a waiver announced in the budget.         
	This is highly irregular. Allocations in supplementary demands are always made to finance extra expenditure arising from commitments made in earlier budgets. It is never used to fund something committed in a budget for the future, said Gurudas Dasgupta, the CPIs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha.        
	Chidambaram can, of course, argue that he can do this since he is waiving loans that became overdue on December 31, 2007, a date that falls within the current financial year.         
	In interviews after the budget, the finance minister had held his cards close to the chest, refusing to say how he intended to fund the waiver scheme that is being described as a pre-poll package.        
	P. Chengal Reddy, the secretary-general of a consortium of farmers associations, said: The farmers are not bothered about how the finance minister funds the loan write-off. They are only concerned with it being written off.        
	Chidambaram had said earlier that the loans would be written off by June 30 and the banks would be compensated for their losses over a three-year period.         
	Finance ministry officials indicated that a little more than Rs 35,000 crore could be handed out to banks in three years. Banks may write off another Rs 15,000 crore which has turned into bad debt in the normal course, they said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Five kids die after taking milk and snack at school

	Ranchi, Nov. 13: At least five boys have died after consuming milk and snacks in a government-run residential school in Jharkhand, the tragedy unfolding on the eve of childrens day and certain to impair the trust that persuades parents in backward belts to educate their wards.        
	The age of the children could not be ascertained till late tonight but the youngest studied in Class II and the oldest in Class VIII.        
	As many as 68 children fell ill at Rajkiya Adivasi High School at Bero, 45km from Ranchi, this afternoon, half an hour after they had milk along with beaten rice (chira) and banana.         
	Police said they were investigating whether the milk was contaminated because some students complained of an odour. But RIMS doctor J.K. Mitra said: Nothing could be said about the nature of the poison before proper examination by the toxicology department.        
	A doctor in Delhi said the speed with which the children began to fall sick pointed to a poisonous substance rather than an infection.         
	Something that made them extremely sick within half an hour is more likely to be a poison than a bacterial infection, said Ambrish Mithal, a senior consultant endocrinologist in New Delhi. But sometimes toxins produced by bacteria may be already present in food and gross contamination may cause symptoms fast.         
	Twenty-four critically ill students were admitted to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi.        
	The five victims  as Sunder Bhagat (Class VIII), Sikandar Oraon (Class II), Jackson Minz (Class VIII), Vineet Oraon (Class V) and Jugeshwar Oraon (Class VIII)  died while they were being taken to the hospital. Five more were being treated at the intensive care unit tonight.        
	Hostel superintendent Yugeshwar Sahu, who also suffered food poisoning, has been admitted to the same hospital in a critical condition.        
	The children who had consumed the milk and snacks around 4pm fainted either on the premises of the school, established to promote education among tribals, or near a river where some had gone to play or relieve themselves.        
	Karamchand Bhagat, a Class X student, said: Out of 248 students, around 140 had lined up for the milk. Some threw the milk after detecting a foul smell, while some stored it in their room to take it after dinner.        
	The school provides gram and jaggery as breakfast at 6am and a lunch of rice, pulses and vegetables at 9.30am. After the 4pm snacks, a dinner of rice, pulses and vegetables is served at 6.30pm. Paneer and eggs are on the menu once a week.        
	Making food available in schools is one of the key features of Indias efforts to promote education. Despite some criticism, the mid-day meal scheme  it has no link with todays tragedy  is considered successful in drawing children to schools and keeping them there.        
	M.S. Bhatia, the Ranchi senior superintendent of police, said the milk suppliers would be arrested.         
	The Milk was supplied by some local suppliers. Usually 40 litres of milk are purchased every day but 30 litres were supplied today. Apparently, something was wrong with the milk and we have started an investigation, he said.        
	Chief minister Shibu Soren has ordered the suspension of all teachers of the school. Sources said the teachers had fled the school.         
	The government has announced Rs 1 lakh for the relatives of the children who died. However, as it is a residential school, few parents live in the vicinity and little information was available on their whereabouts.

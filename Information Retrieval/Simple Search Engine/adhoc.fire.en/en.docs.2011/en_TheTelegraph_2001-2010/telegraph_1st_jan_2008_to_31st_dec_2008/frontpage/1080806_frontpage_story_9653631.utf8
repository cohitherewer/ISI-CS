          K.P. NAYAR                            Jatin Das                                  
	Washington, Aug. 5: Painter Jatin Dass dream of a museum for traditional and contemporary art in his native Orissa has gone international.        
	Das was in Washington and New York last week outlining his plans for the J.D. Centre of Art in Bhubaneswar to his American and Indian American fans.        
	At an interactive evening at the Indian embassy here, hosted by Indias deputy chief of mission Raminder Singh Jassal, with slides of his lifes work, Das said the proposed centre would be the first in India to display both traditional and contemporary art in 14 permanent galleries under one roof.        
	The Orissa government has allotted an acre of land to the painter, who was born in Mayurbhanj. B.V. Doshi, the famous architect from Ahmedabad and associate of Le Corbusier, has designed the master plan for the ambitious centre.        
	The painter said he had been dreaming of the project for almost a decade and expected that it would cost Rs 50 crore to make it a reality.        
	I have been funding the centre, which has a board and a small staff of six people, with money from my paintings. They are temporarily working out of a house in Bhubaneswar given by the state government, Das told this correspondent.        
	But he plans to make international requests for funding and hopes Indian Americans will join in the effort.        
	When the centre is ready, Das will donate his entire collection of 45 years, including paintings, books and antiquities, to the new venture to be housed in one place.        
	But it will come as a disappointment to many Oriyas that his spectacular collection of 6,500 pankhas will not be on display in Bhubaneswar.        
	Das rationalises that, as of now, the J.D. Centre of Art will not have enough space to house the pankhas he picked up during his itinerant life from Kerala to Nigeria in 26 years of travel.        
	His hope is that the fans can now be displayed at a National Fan Museum that he hopes to create in New Delhi.

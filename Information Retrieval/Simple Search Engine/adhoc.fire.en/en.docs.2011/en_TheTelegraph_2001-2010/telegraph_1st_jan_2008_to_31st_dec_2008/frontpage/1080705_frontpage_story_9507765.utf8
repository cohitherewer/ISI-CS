          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, July 4: A crack team likely to be armed with assault rifles and automatic pistols has been raised to encounter riot-like situations in Darjeeling district.        
	The basic idea is to maintain a standalone force and deploy trained personnel in police stations to handle riot-like situations or any other serious breach of law and order, district superintendent of police Rahul Srivastava said today.         
	The commandos, to be stationed in Darjeeling town and Siliguri, will be under the district police chiefs command.

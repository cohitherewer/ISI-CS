	Calcutta, Jan. 20: The city has passed the richest Indians road test.
    
	ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel company, will set up a base of engineers in Calcutta, Laxmi Niwas Mittal told The Telegraph in an exclusive interview today.
    
	We will have an office. Hundreds of engineers will work here, said Mittal, who celebrated his homecoming to Calcutta by driving from the airport to Alipore.
    
	I drove from the airport to Alipore. I could not resist. When you come to town and feel like driving  (it) talks about the quality of life, said Mittal, who is returning to the city after three and a half years and for the first time since he took over Arcelor.
    
	Homecomings do give a rose-tinted perspective to boys who made it good  Mittal also found the Calcutta traffic and pedestrians more disciplined. But he suggested that the engineers base could be the launch pad for a series of initiatives through which he hoped to repay the city in which he spent his youth.
    
	I feel very sad that I have not been able to make investments in the state as yet. I am telling my guys to explore opportunities here.... We have to do something here, Mittal, whose personal fortune is estimated at $51 billion (over Rs 2 lakh crore), said in response to a question.
    
	He discussed such opportunities later in the day with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.
    
	This was my first meeting with the chief minister. I have come to introduce myself and my company. He apprised me of the opportunities in Bengal. I am very impressed with his openness and frankness, Mittal said after the session that stretched beyond the scheduled 30 minutes to an hour and 10 minutes at Writers.
    
	During the interview, Mittal said teams would be sent to explore opportunities in steel downstream (value-added products) and processing and petrochemicals.
    
	ArcelorMittal has already committed $25 billion on two new plants in Jharkhand and Orissa in the hope that it would get iron ore mines.
    
	Since Bengal does not have iron ore, big plants are unlikely. 
    
	But a processing unit? Quite possible. I dont rule out the investment opportunity. We were going to send our team to study. Once we will have our office, a base, they will scout for what opportunity is there to set up a processing unit. We want do something. So, let us see. There could be old, closed-down coal mines. We may look into them, he said.

   Jet and Kingfisher strike distress deal          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                     
	Mumbai, Oct. 13: Naresh Goyal and Vijay Mallya, who have been locked in a grim dogfight in the skies, today eased off on the throttle and announced plans for a wide-ranging alliance subject to regulatory approvals.        
	The two airlines  with a combined domestic market share of nearly 60 per cent  will have a code-sharing arrangement on domestic and international flights.        
	Under the terms of the alliance, they will have common ground-handling facilities, a joint fuel management strategy to trim expenses and will strive for reciprocity in their frequent-flyer programmes.        
	They plan to cross-sell seats on each others planes and rationalise their flights. The two airlines aim to cross-utilise their crews on similar aircraft. However, Goyal and Mallya will not be picking up stakes in each others airline.        
	The late-night announcement capped a day of intense speculation that was triggered when Mallya walked into Jet Airwayss corporate office to meet Goyal.        
	Later, Goyal, accompanied by senior executives of Jet Airways, went to the Kingfisher headquarters at Vile Parle, a western suburb in Mumbai. The meeting lasted about six hours.        
	The alliance comes at a time the industry faces the grim prospect of closing the year with a loss of over Rs 9,000 crore. Last year, the industry had ended up with losses of Rs 4,000 crore.        
	All of us are loss-making airlines, Goyal told reporters after the meeting. It is estimated that both Jet Airways and Kingfisher Red are posting losses of Rs 10 crore a day.        
	Goyal said the alliance with Kingfisher should not be seen as the formation of a cartel. The airline industry has been going through trouble and we do not want a situation where we might be forced to go back to a state-owned monopoly.        
	The economic downturn has aggravated problems for the global airline industry, forcing many rivals to forge similar alliances. If Lufthansa and Continental of the US can do it, and if British Airways and American Airline can forge ties, why cant we do the same in India? asked Goyal.        
	Mallya was more circumspect and said the alliance represented a meeting of minds and hearts. He added that the two airline bosses might talk about the specifics in Hyderabad tomorrow in the presence of civil aviation minister Praful Patel.        
	The two airlines have come under intense pressure because of rising jet fuel costs and the recent merger of two state-owned carriers  Indian and Air India. Jet Airways alone spends about Rs 400 crore a month on jet fuel. In a bid to cut losses, airlines have been rationalising routes and shedding jobs.        
	Goyal said: The Jet Airways-Kingfisher alliance represents a completely new industrial model for aviation in India which would be based on an unprecedented depth of co-operation.        
	I look forward to this alliance delivering superior quality, cost savings, flexibility and enhanced consumer value, Mallya added.        
	While maintaining their separate legal and brand entities, the airlines will examine co-branding opportunities.        
	Goyal said the entire aviation industry had been passing through tough times over the past four years because of irrational pricing.         
	The stock markets appeared to have got wind of the development. On the BSE, shares of Kingfisher Airlines (earlier Deccan Aviation) surged 32.4 per cent while that of Jet Airways gained 10 per cent.

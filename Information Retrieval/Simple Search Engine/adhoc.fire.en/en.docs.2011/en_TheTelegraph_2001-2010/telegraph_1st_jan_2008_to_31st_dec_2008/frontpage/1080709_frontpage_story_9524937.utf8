	Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs big day in Japan will be tomorrow, which will start literally at the crack of dawn with a pre-breakfast meeting with President George W. Bush.        
	The Prime Minister is scheduled to leave his hotel at 5am and drive for over two hours to the picturesque resort of Toyako, sandwiched between the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean.        
	Manmohan will have a 35-minute chat with Bush from 7.40am to 8.15am, during which he is expected to thrash out the timeline for the next steps of the nuclear deal.

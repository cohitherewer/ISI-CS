  - Gloom spreads from trading floor to factories; RBI steps in          OUR BUREAU                                                 
	Oct. 10: The festival season has rarely been so full of fury.        
	Indian stocks tumbled by over 7 per cent, the rupee sank to a historic low of Rs 49.30 to a dollar and gold soared above Rs 14,000 per 10 gm amid signs that the economy had started to falter.        
	The day had begun ominously: data released by the government showed that industrial growth had slowed sharply to 1.3 per cent in August, the slowest growth in 14 years, exacerbating fears that the economy would shudder into a low gear this year along with the rest of the world.         
	The reliability of the anaemic figure, which suggests companies are either not executing projects or manufacturing at their full capacity in the wake of higher interest rates, has been challenged by the finance minister himself.         
	But such is the fear stalking the economic landscape after the global credit crisis that ripples of panic began radiating across the country. So much so that the Prime Minister had to assert there was no question of a recession.        
	The economy will grow by 7.5-8 per cent this fiscal. There is no question of a recession, Singh told a media conference in Srinagar. The situation is being watched on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour basis. We will take appropriate steps to protect our economy.        
	If Singh was seeking to talk up confidence, so was his friend George W. Bush in Washington.        
	Warning that anxiety can feed anxiety, President Bush implored Americans to remain confident and promised to restore stability in the face of a global stock market panic.        
	Finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven are meeting in Washington in a desperate bid to repair the system. Bush spoke in a televised address soon after Wall Street opened with an 8 per cent slide in the Dow Jones Industrial Average before trimming those losses in half.        
	In Mumbai, the sensex sank to an intra-day low of 10239.76, a drop of 9.60 per cent or 1088 points over Wednesdays close  and almost triggered a circuit breaker that would have forced a one-hour halt in trading.        
	Under the rules, if the sensex or the Nifty (the National Stock Exchange index) move by 10 per cent either way before 1pm, trading must be halted for an hour. The sensex finally closed the day at 10527.85, a drop of 800.51 points or 7.07 per cent. The Nifty fell by 6.65 per cent to 3279.95 points.        
	The response from the authorities was swift with the RBI pumping another Rs 60,000 crore into a financial system that is struggling to cope with a mounting demand for dollars that foreign investors want to take out after selling shares on the bourses.        
	The funds infusion was made by slashing the amount of cash that banks must set aside as reserves with the central bank. The RBI cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 7.5 per cent in what was seen as a desperate attempt to jump-start the stuttering economy.        
	The CRR cut  which becomes effective from tomorrow  is the second this week. On Monday, the RBI trimmed the rate for the first time in five years by half a percentage point to 8.5 per cent, which also takes effect from Saturday.         
	Investor wealth worth Rs 2,51,066 crore was wiped out today on the bourses. The Puja week  Diwali is a little over a fortnight away  has been one of the worst weeks for stocks with the sensex losing nearly 16 per cent or 1988 points.         
	Few have been spared, wherever they are, however rich they are. Lakshmi Mittal is losing nearly 7 million (Rs 60 crore) every hour in the past four months because of the turmoil abroad, according to an estimate.        
	In Delhi, finance minister P. Chidambaram expressed reservations about the industrial growth figures. The numbers are not very satisfactory and at the same time they are not very reliable, he said. It does not sound right at all. The IIP numbers have to be looked into carefully.

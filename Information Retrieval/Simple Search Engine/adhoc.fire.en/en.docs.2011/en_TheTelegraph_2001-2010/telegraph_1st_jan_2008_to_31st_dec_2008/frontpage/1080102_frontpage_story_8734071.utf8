	Guwahati, Jan. 1: The Assam forest department is looking to acquire a portion of a Tata-owned tea estate near Kaziranga National Park to save wildlife from straying into an area where they are most likely exposed to killer pesticides.
    
	Animal carcasses have been found amid the tea bushes in Rongagora division of Hathikuli tea estate, part of Tata Teas North India Plantation Operations, in recent months.
    
	The decision to acquire that part of the estate was taken after forest staff found the carcass of a royal Bengal tiger cub on Saturday. 
    
	Another cub was found in a semi-conscious state two days earlier. The two cubs are believed to have consumed cattle carcasses laced with pesticides.
    
	The chief conservator of forests (wildlife), M.C. Malakar, met park officials on Sunday to draft a proposal to acquire the Rongagora division. Samples of the cattle flesh that the tiger cubs consumed were sent to the State Forensic Laboratory in Guwahati for tests to ascertain the presence of pesticides.
    
	Malakar said the forest department would take legal action against the garden if the presence of pesticides in the cattle viscera were confirmed.
    
	Wild animals often stray into the tea estate, which forms part of a corridor from Kaziranga to the Karbi Anglong hills on one side of National Highway 37. Animal traffic through that corridor increases when floodwaters inundate the national park. 
    
	Kaziranga straddles two districts, Golaghat and Nagaon, and is 217km from Guwahati. Although its most famous resident is the one-horned rhino, it is home to several other endangered animal and avian species.
    
	The divisional forest officer of Kaziranga, Bankim Sharma, said the only way to protect animals from being exposed to chemicals used in tea production was to acquire the Rongagora division. The park management filed a case against Hatikhuli tea estate at the Kohora outpost near Bokakhat town after the tiger carcass was found.
    
	Malakar, the states top forest official, had a discussion with the tea estate management only last week on protecting straying wildlife. He requested the tea estate not to use high doses of pesticides. 
    
	The manager of the tea estate, Joydeep Singh, said his company was aware of its responsibilities and had decided to convert the 470-hectare tea estate into an organic plantation. As of now, we have 160 hectares under organic cultivation but we have decided to go for total organic production by next year. We have a responsibility towards Kaziranga. 
    
	Sharma contested the Hathikuli managements claim, saying that a garden worker who lost cattle in a tiger attack recently sprayed pesticides on a half-eaten carcass. A bottle containing pesticides was found at the site. It would not have been possible for the worker to get hold of a small amount of pesticide unless he had siphoned it out from the estates storeroom. This indicates that the management is still using pesticides, he said.
    
	Forest guards are searching for the siblings of the dead tiger cub and their mother, assuming they were poisoned too, Sharma said. 
    
	The estate manager did not rule out a worker spraying pesticides on cattle carcass to poison tigers, but said the company had nothing to do with it.
    
	A senior Tata Tea official said it would take three years for the tea estate to become fully organic. Letekujan tea estate in Golaghat district will also be converted into an organic plantation since wild elephant herds frequent the area.

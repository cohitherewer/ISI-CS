          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 12: The chief ministers office received another threat letter, a week after the additional resident commissioner in New Delhi had received a threat call from an unidentified caller.        
	Confirming the news, home secretary T.K. Mishra said the name of the sender was written as Maoist Association, Western Orissa. However, the words were spelt wrong, he added.        
	Mishra, however, refused to divulge the detailed content of the letter. He only said that the letter was addressed to Naveen that was received by the chief ministers office and was forwarded to him today. After receiving the letter, the office referred it to the director-general of police and to the director of intelligence to ascertain the veracity of the letter and locate the source.        
	Mishra, who returned from Delhi this afternoon, also confirmed that a threat call was received by the office of additional resident commissioner M. Satyanarayanan from phone number 09968151909 about a week ago. An FIR was lodged at Chanakyapuri police station in New Delhi and a case was also registered by the Delhi police, Mishra said, adding that he had also informed his Delhi counterpart.        
	Asked whether the state government was contemplating to step up security arrangements for Naveen in view of the recent threats, Mishra said there was no such immediate plan. The state-level review committee would review the requirement for stepping up Naveens security. At present, Naveen is provided with z-plus security cover.        
	Naveen, however, seemed unperturbed over the threat letter and phone call. I am not afraid of such threats, he told the reporters here. Asked whether he needed additional security cover, Naveen said: No, my security is enough.        
	The threat letter and phone call assume significance in view of the recent killing of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and the subsequent communal violence in Kandhamal.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CESC firm on power plant in Dumka
          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 7: Notwithstanding yesterdays clashes, Calcutta-based CESC Limited, an RPG Group company, today made it clear that it would go ahead with the proposed power plant at Kathikund in Dumka.        
	Villagers, armed with bows and arrows, had clashed with police, some 3km from the Kathikund outpost, yesterday while protesting the arrests of Jharkhand Ulgulan Manch activists. Those arrested include Munni Hansda, Charan Kumar, Hopna Baski and Rajcharan Murmu.        
	Two tribal men were killed in the police firing, while six villagers and police personnel sustained injury, in what may be called the first confrontation between industry and rural populace in Jharkhand.         
	We have been pursuing this (proposed) project for two years now. There is no question of turning back. What we can guarantee is that not a single family would be unnecessarily displaced due to the project. We require 700 acres of which majority would be barren land. Only 10 per cent of the required acres would be farmland, said Sanjeev Sengupta, the chief project co-ordinator for Jharkhand project of CESC.         
	Sengupta was talking to The Telegraph over phone from Calcutta, where he added that his company was keen to hold dialogues with the oustees. CESC requires about 700 to 800 acres in Kathikund block of Dumka (Santhal Pargana). The company has deposited Rs 5.39 crore with the district administration against the transfer and acquisition of 328 acre of private land, 53 acre of government land and 42 acre of forest land.         
	The companys requirement for the 1,000MW coal-based power plant is lower than those been sought by ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel and JSW Steel Limited plants that would require 6,000 to 10,000 hectares. Interestingly, CESC has been allotted the Mahuagiri coal block by the Centre.        
	According to a 2005-MoU signed between the government and CESC, the company would provide 250MW to Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) at regulated prices while rest 750MW would be given to the national grid  out of the 1,000MW proposed production.        
	Nalin Soren, the Shikaripara legislator and agriculture minister, would like to blame manch leader Munni Hansda for misleading the rural people.         
	Soren believes that Hansda is eyeing the Kathikund seat for the next Assembly polls. The woman is associated with anti-social people, Soren adds.        
	In his telephone conversation, Sengupta clarified that the company would use ultra-modern closed conveyer belts for transportation of coal from the mines to the power plant, reducing possibility of pollution markedly.

  - Two of different faiths united in name           BASANT RAWAT                            The flower shop in Bharuch. (Manish Vaidya)                                        
	Bharuch, June 1: The nameplate says: Mohamedbhai Ramanlal Maali. Thats the first hint that something may be unusual about the house.        
	Surely, the man couldnt be Muslim and Hindu at the same time? No, he wasnt  that is, they werent.        
	Mohamedbhai and Ramanlal, both now dead, were two persons who virtually lived as one, merging their names, their families and  in a way  even their religions.        
	The two were inseparable, they would always eat together from the same plate. They looked ordinary but their life is an extraordinary message for the entire town, said Ayoob Malik Kada, a leading social worker in Bharuch, a town with a long history of communal disturbance.        
	It all began in the late 1950s when Mohamedbhai, a florist and a devout Muslim, and Ramanlal, an equally religious Hindu, met for the first time.        
	Both were young men. My father joined Mohamedbhais flower shop as a servant but they quickly became friends. Mohamedbhai made him a partner, said Ramanlals son Amit Maali.        
	Amit, 26, now runs the shop in downtown Katopor Bazaar.        
	In 1974, the friends bought a house behind the Jama Masjid in the Parsiwad locality and moved in, living under the same roof in a town where Hindus and Muslims lived in separate ghettos. In their forties then, the two men adopted the surname Maali (gardener), married Mumtazben and Ramilaben, and lived as one family with a single bank account.        
	As you enter the house, you see two pictures of Mecca and Medina adorning the living room, with verses from the Quran written as captions. On the facing wall, on a shelf, stand several Hindu idols amid flower offerings.        
	Mumtazben, Ramilaben and their children offer puja and namaz together in the room every day. One half of the family  for they insist its one family  reads from the Quran and the other from the Bhagdav Gita.        
	They eat from a common kitchen and celebrate Holi, Id and Diwali. Amit said the family had just one bank account, in the name of Mumtazben.        
	Everyone in the town knows the house. They know about the legendary friendship of Mohamedbhai and Ramanlal, and how they inspired people to maintain peace during communal disturbances, said Bharatbhai, 33, who works for Amit.        
	Bharuch has a mixed population of over one lakh and trouble would break out quite often. At those times, the two friends would be out on the streets, asking people not to get provoked. All the community leaders knew and respected them, said Kada, the social worker.        
	We have never had any trouble in Parsiwad after they moved in 34 years ago. Even if there was curfew in the town, the authorities would allow people to move about freely in this locality because they knew nothing would happen here, a neighbour said.        
	Ramanlal died in 2001 but Mohamedbhai was still alive when the riots broke out across Gujarat in February-March 2002. Residents say there was no major violence in Bharuch despite its history, and it could be partly because of Mohamedbhais efforts. He died in an accident a year later, in his seventies like his friend.        
	The current occupants of the house are Amit, Ramilaben, Amits teenaged sister Jyotsna, Mumtazben and her three daughters -- Zeenat, who is married and lives in Canada, and Minaz and Seema, both students.        
	Amit was alone in the house when this correspondent went visiting. The rest had gone on pilgrimage to the Ajmer Sharif dargah, travelling from one symbol of interfaith harmony to another.

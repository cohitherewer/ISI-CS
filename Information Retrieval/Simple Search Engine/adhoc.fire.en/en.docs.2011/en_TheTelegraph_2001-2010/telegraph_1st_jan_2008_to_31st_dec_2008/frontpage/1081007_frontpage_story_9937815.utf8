  - Sensex crashes as global crisis deepens         OUR BUREAU                                                     
	Mumbai, Oct. 6: A gang of suspected terrorists was rounded up in Mumbai  but rivulets of blood continued to flow down Dalal Street as stock markets around the world were gutted again over concerns of a deepening credit crisis.         
	The sensex plunged below 12K  a level the market hasnt seen since September 19, 2006. Todays crash wiped out Rs 2,39,879 crore worth of investor wealth.         
	The bellwether index plunged 724 points, or 5.78 per cent, to 11801.70, mirroring the trend on the bourses from Tokyo to New York.         
	Fears of deepening bank problems in Europe and wider economic woes around the world sent global equity markets skidding and crude oil prices tumbling below $90 a barrel to its lowest level in eight months.         
	The Dow Jones industrial average, the barometer of the US markets, slid below the 10,000 mark  a level not seen since October 2004. In early morning trades, the Dow was down 493.89 points, or 4.78 per cent, at 9831.49. The slump on Wall Street followed a sharp drop in Asian markets, while major European equity indexes fell 8 per cent.         
	On the local bourse, all the powerhouse stocks were clobbered as investors struggled to make sense of the credit crisis and how it would unravel in the weeks ahead.         
	Reliance Industries plummeted nearly 7 per cent to Rs 1,641.90. Infosys, due to announce its second quarter results on Friday, fell 5.3 per cent to Rs 1,317.80 while Tata Steel crashed 11 per cent to Rs 350.25.         
	Market mavens blamed the bloodbath on global factors that had prompted foreign institutional investors to dump stocks and flee. The FIIs have sold stocks worth over $9 billion this year.         
	The Indian markets saw some aggressive selling by the FIIs after Asian markets buckled, said Amitabh Chakraborty, president (equity) at Religare Securities Ltd.         
	The capital market regulator tried to stem the flight of capital by removing restrictions clamped last year on participatory notes  a derivative instrument floated by the FIIs and offered to rich clients who wish to avoid direct exposure to local bourses.         
	The Reserve Bank of India  the banking regulator  relaxed a reserve requirement for banks, pumping another Rs 20,000 crore into a financial system that is facing a massive cash shortage.         
	However, some market analysts felt stocks could rebound tomorrow. Sebis decision to relax regulations on FIIs will definitely see money flow into the Indian capital markets, said Hitesh Agrawal, head of research, at Angel Broking.         
	Others were less optimistic. A short-term spike cant be ruled out, but we could see the market bottoming out at about 9,000 to 10,000, Chakraborty said.         
	One reason for the gloomy outlook is the growing concern over prospects for the world economy.         
	The Cassandras have already fanned the flames by starting to speculate about a global recession. Last week, Morgan Stanley said global economic growth would plunge below 2.5 per cent. It also asserted that Indias growth this year would fall to 6.4 per cent  which is the most pessimistic forecast till date. The government believes it will close the year with at least an 8 per cent growth.

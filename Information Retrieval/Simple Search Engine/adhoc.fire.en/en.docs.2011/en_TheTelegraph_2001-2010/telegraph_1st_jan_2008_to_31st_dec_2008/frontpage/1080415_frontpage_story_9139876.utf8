	New York, April 14 (Reuters): A 15-minute film of Marilyn Monroe engaging in an oral sex act with an unidentified man will be kept from public view by a New York businessman who has bought it for $1.5 million, the broker of the deal said today.        
	Memorabilia collector Keya Morgan said he recently arranged the sale of the silent, black-and-white film from the son of a dead FBI informant who possessed it to a wealthy Manhattan businessman who wants to protect Monroes privacy.        
	The gentleman who bought it said out respect for Marilyn hes not going to make a joke of it and put it on the Internet and try to exploit her, said memorabilia collector Keya Morgan. Thats not his intention and I would never get my name involved if that were to happen. Monroe is clothed and the mans head remains out of the frame for the entire 15 minutes of the film, said Morgan, who viewed the film.        
	Monroe was rumoured to have had an affair with former President John F. Kennedy and Morgan said former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, a Kennedy rival, went to great lengths to try to prove it was Kennedy in the film.         
	One of Monroes ex-husbands, the late baseball great Joe DiMaggio, once tried to buy it from the collector for $25,000 but he would not part with it, according to declassified FBI files. Morgan is a well-known collector who owns memorabilia from the estates of Monroe and DiMaggio.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Where? In the new suburbia of migrants 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Where? In the new suburbia of migrants

	The first I heard of the blasts in Bangalore was a call from my sister, which came just after two in the afternoon. My mother had come through a minor operation, and wished now to go home from the hospital. Was it safe to drive through the streets, my sister asked? A little later, my daughter called, saying that along with other students she had been detained in school on the instructions of police.        
	Calls like these were being made in their thousands, as the residents of the city rang friends and family members who, for one reason or another, were out of their home or office. However, by 4pm, our mobiles had stopped making or receiving calls. It may have been that the pressure was so great that the networks collapsed. A website I consulted had another theory; that the police had engineered the jamming so as to stop rumours being circulated.        
	The first reports of the blasts suggested that they were relatively low-powered. As with other such incidents, the questions that came to ones lips were Why and By Whom? The answers are, at this early stage, elusive. So let us consider instead another relevant question, Where? In which parts of the city did the explosions take place?        
	I live just off Mahatma Gandhi (MG) Road, which is to this town what Chowringhee is to Calcutta, the main road in the heart of the city. The blasts apparently all took place to the west and south of MG Road. There was an explosion at Madiwala, which lies en route to Electronics City, where one of the citys showpiece companies, Infosys, is headquartered. There was another off Sarjapur Road, which is not far from where the other software giant, Wipro, has its main offices.        
	Todays blasts are the second terrorist incident in Bangalore. The first took place in December 2005 when one scientist was killed and another seriously wounded at an international conference being held at the Indian Institute of Science.        
	The areas where the explosions occurred are not part of old, historic, Bangalore. They have been incorporated into the city in the last two or three decades as the population of the city has massively expanded. To accommodate these new migrants, lakes and farmland have been taken over and converted into apartments and offices and markets.        
	The reports now coming in suggest that there were no blasts in the old city, in the traditional Kannada-speaking localities such as Basavangudi or Gandhi Bazaar. Nor were there any blasts in areas of the Cantonment where Hindus and Muslims have lived cheek-by-jowl for the past two centuries. Munnireddipalya, Shivaji Nagar, Mosque Road, Wheeler Road  these localities north of MG Road are characterised by narrow streets and small homes, and a mixed population of Hindus, Muslims, and Christians.        
	That there were no blasts in these areas might suggest that the provocateurs did not really want to instigate a communal riot. That some explosions took place on the road to the software companies could indicate a wish to disrupt the economic success that sections of Bangalore have recently enjoyed. On the other hand, it just might be that in these new suburbs, with their floating and ever-changing population of migrants, it was easier to place the devices and detonate them without being detected.        
	Among the major metropolitan cities of India, Bangalore has an enviable reputation for cultural harmony. Unlike in Mumbai, the speakers of the local language have not mounted a vicious campaign against outsiders.         
	Unlike in Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, there have been no major Hindu-Muslim riots in the recent past. Unlike in Delhi or Calcutta, there have been no major riots in earlier decades either.        
	Given this citys history, people come in and out, work and play, more or less as they please. In the late evening I walked on to MG Road. The traffic was less than what it would normally be, but it was still pretty intense. Scooters and cars and buses jostled for space.        
	Meanwhile, on the pavement, a golgappa seller was hawking his wares. Among the customers tucking into the snacks were two uniformed policemen. Where some might see this as dereliction of duty, I saw it as a sign of a city that shall refuse to be intimidated.

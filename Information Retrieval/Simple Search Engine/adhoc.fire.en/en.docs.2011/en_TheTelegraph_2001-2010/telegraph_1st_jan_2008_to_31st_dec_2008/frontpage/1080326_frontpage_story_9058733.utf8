The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Outsiders to probe riots
                                                                                                           Outsiders to probe riots
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	March 25: The Supreme Court today decided that the Godhra fire and nine 2002 riot cases should be probed further, and included two officials from outside Gujarat in the five-member investigation team over the states protests.        
	We want at least two officers who are from outside Gujarat, the court told state government counsel Mukul Rohatgi who had demanded that only serving Gujarat officers be picked.        
	Organisations such as the National Human Rights Commission and the Mumbai-based NGO, Citizens for Justice and Peace, had petitioned the court in 2003 for reinvestigation and the transfer of the trials outside Gujarat.        
	On November 21, 2003, the apex court stayed the trials in these cases after several victims alleged the government was shielding the guilty and framing innocent people.        
	Today, the court announced a special investigation team (SIT) and named former CBI director R.K. Raghavan and former Uttar Pradesh-cadre IPS officer, C.B. Satapathy, as the members from outside Gujarat.        
	Rohatgi was allowed to name the other three: Gujarat IPS officers Geeta Johri, Shivanand Jha and Ashish Bhatia. Justice Arijit Pasayat, who heads the bench, said the team members would handpick officers from the state police to help them.         
	The SIT will finish the probe in three months. The decision on transferring the trials will be taken after the apex court goes through its report.        
	The apex court had earlier transferred the Best Bakery and Bilkis Bano riot cases to Mumbai and accused the Gujarat administration of behaving like modern-day Neros during the pogrom.        
	Riot victims had alleged that in several of the 10 cases, the public prosecutors were biased or the police had ignored eyewitness accounts. Speaking on their behalf today, amicus curiae Harish N. Salve pointed to the huge cleavage between the states version and the victims.        
	He suggested a probe by the CBI or a special team of officers of unimpeachable integrity. Rohatgi protested against any outside agency conducting the probe and later objected mildly to retired officers being picked.         
	The state government, however, said it would replace the public prosecutors if the victims thought they were biased. It assured the victims their statements would be recorded.        
	The Gujarat BJP did not comment on the court decision but the Congress and social activists welcomed it.        
	We welcome the initiative of the Supreme Court to give justice to riot-affected people, the leader of the Opposition in the Gujarat Assembly, Shaktisinh Gohil, said.

	Ranchi, Nov. 3: ArcelorMittals proposed 12MT steel plant in West Singhbhum has run into yet another hitch with the Centre sending back the states recommendations on granting iron-ore licences in the Karampada reserve forest area at a time when the worlds largest steel maker is grappling local resistance.        
	In the last week of October, the Centre sent back the states proposal wherein the entire 1087.75 hectare of forest land was recommended for granting iron ore prospecting licences to the company. But now the recommendation has to be sent again in two parts, keeping in mind the status notified and non-notified  of the forest land in the Karampada forest area.         
	We have to send two separate letters, one for the notified portion and another for non-notified areas, West Singhbhum district mining officer R.N. Prasad told The Telegraph. Earlier, the entire 1,087 hectare was recommended in favour of ArcelorMittal.         
	According to the provisions of the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulations Act 1957, the Centre is keen that the distinction is maintained. While areas within the forest for which the state government has already invited proposals from those wishing to apply for prospective mining licences are designated notified, the areas with untapped mining reserves are designated non-notified.         
	Industry secretary K.K. Khandelwal, who also holds the mines portfolio, refused to comment on the bungling and couldnt specify how long it would take for the state to send a fresh proposal to the Centre. A decision will be taken only after going through the matter in detail, he said.         
	However, the Centre has already given its consent for a mining lease in another portion  spread over 500 acre  of the Karampada reserve forests for ArcelorMittal provided it gets the much-needed clearances from the Union ministry of environment and forests.        
	But this 500 acre, with an expected reserve of only 65 MT, would prove insufficient for the mega project being planned at an investment of over Rs 40,000 crore. ArcelorMittal requires about 600 MT of iron ore over the next 30 years (from the start of the project) to operate its plant to optimum capacity.         
	ArcelorMittal signed an MoU with the state government in 2005. Barring the Centres consent for mining leases in sections of the Karampada area and Seregarha in Latehar district, nothing much has moved for it in Jharkhand.         
	Even though the state government has begun the process of encouraging open dialogue with local residents on the question of land in the Torpa-Kamdara area, there is an atmosphere of mistrust among villagers who for historical reasons, are suspicious of both big industry as well as the state government.

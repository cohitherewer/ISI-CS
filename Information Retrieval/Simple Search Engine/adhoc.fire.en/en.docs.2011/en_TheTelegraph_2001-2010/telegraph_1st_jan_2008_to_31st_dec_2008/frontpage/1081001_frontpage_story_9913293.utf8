	Bangalore, Sept. 30: Police are on the lookout for two managers of Nokia, the telecom company, to investigate allegations that they drove a young engineer to death.        
	Soni Jagadish, a 25-year-old Nokia employee, had left behind a suicide note that accused Teja and Suchin of mistreating her in office. The note, which did not mention the full names of the two, said they should be brought to book.         
	The woman was found dead on Saturday in the Jayanagar house where she stayed as a paying guest. Her parents, who live in Mysore, had called her landlady and asked her to check if their daughter was all right as she was not answering the phone. The police broke open the door to find her hanging from a ceiling fan.         
	Sonis note alleged that the two managers, whom she reported to, had labelled her unfit to work at Nokia and allegedly harassed her by assigning her to different desks over the last few weeks.         
	The police said Soni had also left behind notes for her father, mother, brother and a friend, whom she called Venkat, saying how she had been harassed and that she would commit suicide.         
	Her father, a BSNL employee, had filed an FIR, after which the police yesterday registered a case of abetment to suicide against Teja and Suchin.        
	Bangalore additional commissioner of police M.R. Pujar told reporters the two were absconding and had switched off their mobile phones. We will arrest them if the charges are proved true. We are still investigating, he said.         
	The police have sealed the shelf and office computer assigned to Soni at Nokias research and development facility in Marath Halli.        
	Nokia issued a statement today after the Karnataka unit of the National Commission for Women threatened to file a case against the company.         
	The statement said Nokia had a stringent company policy in place against harassment at the workplace. This policy aims to ensure fair treatment and dignity of women and men at work. It prohibits all forms of harassment, whether amounting to unlawful, racial, disability or sexual discrimination.         
	It added that anyone subject or witness to any form of harassment has access to a proper system and channels through which complaints can be raised and addressed.        
	Several organisations today staged a demonstration against harassment at work.

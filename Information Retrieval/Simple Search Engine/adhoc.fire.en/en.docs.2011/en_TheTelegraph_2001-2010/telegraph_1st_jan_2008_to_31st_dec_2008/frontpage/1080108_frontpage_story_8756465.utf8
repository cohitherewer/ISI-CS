                British actress Gemma Arterton at a promotional for her film St. Trinians in Cannes
              
	Los Angeles, Jan. 7 (Reuters): British newcomer Gemma Arterton has been cast as the Bond girl for the latest instalment of the 007 franchise, currently shooting in London, the films producer said.
    
	The movie, which has the working title of Bond 22, marks Daniel Craigs second turn as James Bond. Swiss-raised filmmaker Marc Forster (The Kite Runner) is directing the Columbia Pictures/MGM production.
    
	Details of Artertons character, known as Fields, were not available, but a representative for the films Los Angeles-based producer, Danjaq Productions, said its a nice-sized role.
    
	Talk of Artertons casting had been swirling around the blogosphere and in British tabloids since mid-December. Arterton plays a schoolgirl in the comedy St. Trinians, which was recently released in Britain.

 - General claims top guns based outside will lay down arms
     A STAFF REPORTER 
                     
	Tamulpur, Jan. 24: A batch of 38 Ulfa militants of various ranks surrendered today at the armys Tamulpur base, but the chief of the Tezpur-headquartered 4 Corps seemed more excited about the prospect of some very senior leaders coming aboard soon. 
    
	Lt Gen. B.S. Jaswal did not reveal the identities of the militants who were in the queue, citing security reasons. The names of those who surrendered today were not announced either.
    
	The general said the militants who had sent feelers about their willingness to surrender were mostly based outside, though he did not specify which country.
    
	As on previous occasions, Lt Gen. Jaswal did not miss the opportunity to say that Ulfas mass base was no longer what it was. When there is disillusionment among cadres within the outfit, the struggle for so-called freedom will fizzle out on its own. It is just a matter of time.
    
	The 38 militants who laid down arms today were from Ulfas 709, 109 and 27 battalions. The group included a woman.
    
	The militants, including a sergeant major, deposited 26 pistols and revolvers, 30kg of explosives, 18 grenades and assorted ammunition. 
    
	It was the third largest parade of surrendered militants in recent months. A group of 33 militants laid down arms on October 23 at the same army base and 66 more did so at the 4th Assam Police Battalion headquarters in Kahilipara, Guwahati, on November 1. 
    
	Lt Gen. Jaswal said the Adivasi National Liberation Army, which has lately been involved in attacks such as the one on the Rajdhani Express in Golaghat district, was trying to garner support from Maoist rebels outside the state, especially Jharkhand.
    
	Director-general of police R.N. Mathur and home commissioner Rajib Bora were also present at todays surrender ceremony.

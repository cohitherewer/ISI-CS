The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Blow to Haldia waiver hope

          SAMBIT SAHA                                              
	Calcutta, April 29: The Centre today passed up a golden opportunity to ease the pain of Haldia Petrochemicals, ignoring an appeal by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for duty relief on a key raw material.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram announced several amendments to the budget in Parliament today but made no mention of waiving the 5 per cent import duty imposed on naphtha.        
	The duty will hit Haldia Petro, Bengals showpiece project, the hardest because it is the only big player in the segment that depends on imports for the raw material used to make polymer. The levy has the potential to wipe out the profit of the company.        
	The Finance Bill was later passed in the House, which means the simplest avenue for making changes no longer exists. Little prevents the Centre from changing or scrapping the duty outside Parliament but such alterations usually require extraordinary lobbying prowess.        
	The Bengal government this evening reacted with dismay.         
	We are extremely disappointed to learn that our request for reversal of the reimposition of import duty on naphtha has not been granted. I had taken up the matter with Union finance minister. Our chief minister had also been pursuing the issue with the Centre, industries minister Nirupam Sen said in a statement.        
	He added that we will continue our efforts with the finance ministry for reversal of their decision.        
	However, with the Prime Minister changing the rules of engagement with the Left and an element of frostiness creeping on the ties between the CPM and the Congress, the odds seem to be stacked against the Bengal government.        
	It is very sad. I dont know why it has not been done, Sen told The Telegraph before the statement was issued. I will speak to finance minister Chidambaram.         
	Sen had written to the finance minister. Bhattacharjee had spoken to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	Chidambaram did not reply to his letter, Sen said. He has not told me why it (duty imposed) was done or why it could not be undone, the Bengal minister added.

     OUR BUREAU
             
	Jan. 18: The Bengal government today woke up to the gravity of the bird flu threat and ramped up efforts to contain it, deciding on instant payment for farmers who bring poultry for culling.
    
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee described the situation as worrisome and directed officials to ensure that compensation was paid on the spot, hoping culling would now pick up.
    
	Yesterday, the World Health Organisation and independent experts had warned that the outbreak in Bengal was the most threatening the country had witnessed, and could mirror the prolonged crises in Bangladesh, Thailand and Vietnam.

 on Friday?

 Nandigram Block 
   How many birds were culled on Friday?

 Around 30,000, according to officials
   What was the day rsquo;s target?

 40,000
   How many remain to 
 be culled?

 Out of 4 lakh (revised target), 3.44 lakh remain to be culled
  
	Culling has been extremely slow in Bengal because whole villages often resisted the rapid response teams (RRTs). The incentive of immediate compensation would speed up the process, Union animal husbandry secretary Pradeep Kumar hoped in Delhi.
    
	Till now, farmers were being handed tokens at culling sites and asked to contact their panchayat offices for the money: Rs 40 for a country chicken, Rs 30 for a broiler and Rs 10 for a chick.
    
	A survey of the operations today revealed a second reason for the tardiness  lack of sync between the state animal resource department (ARD), which is carrying out the culling, and local administrations.
    
	Bazarpara in Birbhums Margram had watched 80 per cent of its birds fall sick and die and the villagers were eager for the rest to be culled, instant payment or not. The district authorities had announced over loudspeakers that an ARD team was on its way and residents waited impatiently for hours  but in vain.
    
	Yet Bazarpara is just half a kilometre from the Margram block development office, the control room for culling operations in the district. We dont know what to do. The control room has been informed time and again, said Anuj Dutta, a villager.
    
	The route chart prep- ared by the ARD is not communicated to the block administration, a senior district official complained.
    
	Chicken deaths spread to East Midnapore today but Birbhum, South Dinajpur and Murshidabad stayed the only three districts confirmed with bird flu. Tissue samples from Burdwan and South 24-Parganas are being investigated but Cooch Bihar, Purulia and Nadia tested negative.
    
	Another relief was that a house-to-house survey of 35,000 people in Birbhum detected no suspected human patient of avian influenza, health officials said.
    
	Tomorrow, a five-member team from the Union health ministry will visit several villages. They will also advise health department staff on how to spread awareness, senior Birbhum health official S.K. Bhowmick said.
    
	Suicide
    
	A culling team member in South Dinajpur, veterinary doctor Rajib Patra, 30, was found hanging in his Balurghat guesthouse room tonight. The resident of Bankuras Satrai, posted at Patiram, 16km from Balurghat, had married eight months ago. No suicide note has been found.
    
	Two RRT members  Hiranmoy Bhattacharya, 42, and Dipak Mondal, 38  fell ill in Margram and were admitted to hospital with chest pain and uneasiness. Colleagues said Bhattacharya was not comfortable killing so many birds.

	Shimla, Aug. 3: A temple stampede triggered by landslide rumours killed at least 123 people, mostly women and children, this morning at the hilltop Naina Devi temple, 160km from here.        
	More than 250 others were injured as thousands of panicky devotees, including mothers clutching children, rushed down a steep staircase and then a narrow hill path guarded by railings, while thousands of others were climbing up amid pouring rain.        
	Some of the men clambered up the railings, causing the wall below to collapse under their weight and they fell on the women and children below, said Vickey Kumar, a shopkeeper and eyewitness.        
	The dead include more than 40 children and 45 women, Reuters said quoting senior police officer Daljit Singh Manhas, who gave the full toll as 145.        
	The stampede took place between 10.15 and 10.30. It was raining heavily and some of the pilgrims were in a rain shelter near the top while many others were still climbing, when a single person started the rumour about a landslide, Vickey said.        
	There were a lot of people inside and we were trying to fight for space when everyone started falling over, a worshipper, Bimala, said.        
	But Sewak Ram, who lost at least five family members, blamed police. Everything was going smoothly but when the police caned the pilgrims (as the rush began) the situation turned ugly, he said.                  
	Temple authorities said one lakh pilgrims had gathered at the complex, a huge draw during the eight-day Shravana Ashtami Mela that began yesterday.        
	But only three or four policemen were present, said Onkar, the man running the free community kitchen at the shrine. Even after the stampede, police officers and district officials took two hours to arrive. Injured children were limping around but there was nobody to look after them.        
	The path to the temple was strewn with motionless bodies, some clutching the offerings they had brought, their clothes smeared in slush. Sweaters and wind-cheaters lay all over the road and the surrounding slopes of the Shivalik range while distraught people searched for familiar faces among the dead.        
	With the rain continuing, temple staff and local residents found it difficult to help the injured. Phone networks were jammed and not even first aid was available till teams of doctors and police arrived from many parts of Himachal Pradesh and neighbouring Punjab.        
	Most of the injured are from Punjab, inspector-general S.R. Mardi said.        
	More than 70 bodies reached the Anandpur Sahib hospital in Punjab, where a man searched for his three missing children. Hospitals in district headquarters Bilaspur, 60km from the temple, were crammed with injured pilgrims.        
	Tens of thousands gather at the 1,300-year-old Naina Devi temple, one of the 51 Shakti Peeths, every year on Navratri and Shravana. They trek 2km uphill for an hour or take a 20-minute ropeway ride.        
	The government has ordered a probe and announced Rs 1 lakh each for the families of the dead, Rs 50,000 for the seriously injured and Rs 25,000 for those with minor injuries.        
	In 1980, a stampede had killed 36 pilgrims at the shrine. Three years ago, 265 people were trampled to death near a temple in Maharashtra. Six people died in a stampede last month during the rath yatra in Puri, Orissa, and four at the seaside towns Jagannath temple in November 2006.

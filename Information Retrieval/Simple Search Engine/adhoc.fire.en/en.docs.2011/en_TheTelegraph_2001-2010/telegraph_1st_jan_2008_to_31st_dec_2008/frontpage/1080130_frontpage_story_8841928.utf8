	Adelaide, Jan. 29: The Mahendra Singh Dhonis leave for Melbourne tomorrow afternoon but, around the same time, Indias ODI and Twenty20 squad couldve been preparing to head home. 
    
	On a chartered flight, if needed.
    
	With the International Cricket Council (ICC)-appointed appeals commissioner, Justice John Hansen, accepting a joint plea that Harbhajan Singhs conduct at the SCG be deemed a Level 2.8 offence and not Level 3.3, the remainder of the tour goes ahead as scheduled. However, it was close to being called off.
    
	That the charge against Harbhajan could be downgraded or scaled down was first reported in these columns on January 11.
    
	Now, instead of a three-Test ban slapped by match referee Mike Procter, Harbhajan will only have to cough up 50 per cent of his match fee. More important, the racist slur is off the ICCs records.
    
	Justice Hansen said he was convinced that, on all the evidence submitted before him, the charge of a Level 3.3 offence was not proven, but that Harbhajan be charged with a Level 2.8 offence, explained a press release from the ICC.
    
	That even the transcript of the stump microphone didnt have anything incriminating helped Harbhajan in no small manner at the re-hearing.
    
	Hes been fined for having admitted to using a four-letter word. Its a mystery why the Indians didnt levy a counter-charge against Symonds.
    
	The biggest loser has, of course, been Procter. Not only did he give a flawed judgement, he couldnt even record evidence properly during his January 6 hearing in Sydney. 
    
	His days seem numbered. 
    
	According to sources, Dhoni and Co. wouldnt have remained in Australia had the stigma of a racist not been removed from Harbhajans head.
    
	That, one learns, was reinforced during a meeting at the Hyatt this morning and made Cricket Australia (CA) chairman Creagh Connor rush to meet former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Inderjit Singh Bindra.
    
	Bindra, who is on excellent terms with Connor, had been deputed by BCCI president Sharad Pawar to help resolve a very sensitive issue. He did an excellent job.
    
	Connor and Bindra met for close to an hour and, towards the end, were joined by Sachin Tendulkar, seen as representing the players. The smiles, as they left the hotels Regency Club, left little unsaid.
    
	Nobody may go on record, but Bindra made it clear that CA should do its utmost to get Andrew Symonds and the others  captain Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden and Michael Clarke  involved in the matter to sign the joint statement of facts.
    
	Gilchrist, whod told Procter he hadnt heard Harbhajan call Symonds a monkey/big monkey, didnt appear before Justice Hansen.
    
	The joint statement was drafted by lawyers on both sides and the final document was handed over to John Jordon, whod been assigned to assist Justice Hansen, well past midnight last night.
    
	Apparently, some of the Australians (Pontings name being at the top) were reluctant to call for a scaling down of the charge.
    
	It took much persuasion by CA to convince the players... That India had withdrawn the offensive-remark charge against Brad Hogg definitely helped, but the Australian players still had strong reservations, pointed out a well-placed source.
    
	The abandonment of the tour would have hurt Australia deeply  with no guarantee of any compensation from India, which would have raised hell at the ICCs executive board.
    
	Moreover, had the Pontings not softened their stand, its unlikely that they couldve actually played in the cash-rich IPL. The sentiment in India, after all, is heavily against the Australians.
    
	Its not confirmed, but the Australian Cricketers Association couldve had a hand in the players reluctance to abide by an informal agreement between CA and the BCCI.
    
	Test captain Anil Kumble, who returns home tomorrow, thanked those whod stood by Harbhajan and the team. Im happy and relieved. Its a fantastic result. It was important to move on and we have, he said.
    
	A joint statement by the BCCI and CA described the developments as a constructive conclusion.

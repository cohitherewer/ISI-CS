          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, July 21: Three MPs from the Northeast have kept everyone guessing in the run-up to tomorrows trust vote despite the Assam Congresss best efforts to drum up support for the first Prime Minister from the region.         
	Manmohan Singh is a Rajya Sabha MP from Assam.        
	Assam PCC president Bhubaneswar Kalita today said in New Delhi that he had personally met several MPs from the region and appealed to them to back the Prime Minister. I appealed to all the Northeast MPs to rally behind Singh who is the first Prime Minister representing the region. Since he is an MP from the Northeast, he has always given top priority to the development of the region. It is, therefore, in the interest of the region that he completes his full term.         
	The plea, however, failed to cut much ice with non-Congress parliamentarians from the region with the CPM, the BJP and the AGP making it clear that their MPs from the region would vote against the government.         
	The CPM and the AGP have two MPs each while BJP has four MPs from the region.         
	The trio at the centre of the guessing game are Independent MP from Outer Manipur Lok Sabha seat, Mani Charenamei, Mizo National Front (MNF) MP Vanlalzawma and Nagaland Peoples Front (NPF) MP W. Konyak.         
	The MNF, in its political affairs committee meeting, entrusted party president and Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga to take a final call on the partys stand on the nuclear issue. Our leader is yet to take a decision. Once thats done, he will convey it to our MP, senior MNF leader Lalchhandana said over phone.         
	A late night PTI report said Vanlalzawma will abstain from voting tomorrow.        
	Though Charenamei could not be contacted, sources close to him said the Independent MP would take a decision tomorrow before voting.         
	The NPF MP, too, is still said to be bargaining with both sides, as he is the lone MP from the state and will not fall in any anti-defection law even if he switches sides defying the party decision.         
	Efforts to woo him to the Congress fold were being done through Nagaland Congress leaders. Former Lok Sabha Speaker and NCP leader P.A. Sangma said his daughter Agatha would vote for the UPA government.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            The Maruti Omni. Picture by S.S. Sundaram                                   
	Mumbai, Jan. 28: Five children, all between six and nine, were burnt alive today when the pool car that would have taken them home from school burst into flames the moment the driver switched on the ignition.        
	Police said a short circuit sparked the fire in the LPG-fitted Maruti Omni and no gas leak from the cylinder could be established.        
	Additional commissioner (west) Archana Tyagi confirmed there was no explosion. The accident happened because of a short circuit. The damage would have been much more had the cylinder exploded.        
	The officer added that petrol kept in a bottle in the vehicle probably fed the flames.        
	Witnesses said the white Omni, which had six other children, was parked inside the main gate of the seven-storey Millat High School in suburban Jogeshwari.        
	The children came down around 12.30 and sat in the van. As soon as the driver started the car, the fire started, said Ibrahim Bhai, a member of the school trust.        
	Two petrol pump attendants who man a CNG station next to the school compound were the first to rush to the help of the trapped children.         
	We saw smoke coming out of the car. We used three to four fire extinguisher cans. The damage would have been much more had the LPG cylinder exploded, said Subhash Ambekar, who reached the spot with colleague Chandrakant K. We managed to rescue eight children, but three died in front of our eyes, said Ibrahim.        
	Two of the children later died in hospital. The others were admitted with 35 to 90 per cent burns.        
	Additional commissioner Tyagi, however, said the toll stands at three while eight were injured.        
	Near the closed school gates, an acrid stench hung around the burnt car. The seats broke into two as a policeman fiddled with them before covering the vehicle with a white sheet.        
	Forensic experts were on the spot examining the car with officers from Jogeshwari police station.        
	Earlier, angry residents had laid siege to the school after initial reports on news channels hinted that a CNG cylinder had triggered the explosion. The crowd drove away reporters and even beat up a photographer who was trying to click the burnt car.        
	Millat trustee Ibrahim said his school had no contract with the Maruti vans owner. The parents had engaged the van on their own, he said.        
	Senior teacher Arif Qasim said the school, which has 3,500 children, had hired 14 buses and all of them had clearance from the regional transport office to operate.        
	Asked if the van had valid papers, Tyagi said the owner had documents indicating that he was allowed to refit an LPG cylinder in the car.        
	The driver, Rafiq Qureshi, has been detained, the police officer added. He hasnt been arrested yet as a probe is on.

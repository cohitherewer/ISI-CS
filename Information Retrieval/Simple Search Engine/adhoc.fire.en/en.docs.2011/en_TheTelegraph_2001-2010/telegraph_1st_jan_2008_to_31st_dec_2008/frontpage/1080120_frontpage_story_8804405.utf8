     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Patna, Jan. 19: Three persons died after police fired on power protesters on consecutive days in Bihars Kahalgaon, triggering further public rage that prompted all senior officials to flee the simmering subdivision town.
    
	College student Sumit Kumar, 18, and an identified man died of their bullet injuries late last night, and Mohammed Khedu was allegedly forced out of his home and shot this morning.
    
	The incident provoked a mob of over 1,000 in the town, 275km from Patna, to attack government property. The crowd torched an ambulance and a jeep belonging to the Sadar Hospital and then attempted to set the hospital on fire.
    
	At least 10 people were injured in clashes with the police, residents said.
    
	Deputy superintendent of police S.N. Sinha and sub-divisional officer B.N. Jha have been suspended for dereliction of duty.
    
	We have asked all senior officers  including the superintendent of police (who had gone to the town) and administrative officials  to move out of Kahalgaon because of the public fury, an official in Patna said.
    
	As senior officials monitored the situation from the district headquarters of Bhagalpur, law and order in the town was solely in the hands of some 400 policemen  including Rapid Action Force and State Auxiliary Force jawans  and their immediate superiors tonight.
    
	Officers denied that the police had flushed people out of their homes and beaten or shot at them.
    
	Bhagalpur SP Jitendra Singh Gangwar confirmed the three deaths but said: Its not fair to say at this stage that they were killed in police firing. Lets wait for the post-mortem reports, which will explain the nature of the bullet injuries.
    
	The National Thermal Power Corporation has a production unit in Kahalgaon, yet the town suffers from chronic power shortage. Some 500 people were protesting under the banner of a citizens committee yesterday when the police fired around 4.30pm.
    
	We were forced to fire as the situation got out of hand and there was a threat to government property, Gangwar said.
    
	Residents said Sumit, a student of SSB College, was from Jharkhand. Yesterdays other victim had papers on him that carried the name B. Kumar.
    
	Khedu was killed while 700-odd people were demonstrating against last nights deaths.
    
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar has ordered a judicial probe and asked state energy minister Bijayendra Yadav to try and resolve the power crisis in the area. The families of the dead will receive Rs 1 lakh each.
    
	The authorities said this evening they would release the 60-odd people arrested during the protests and get the injured treated at government expense.
    
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad is likely to visit Kahalgaon. Shops, offices, schools and colleges were closed in the town today.

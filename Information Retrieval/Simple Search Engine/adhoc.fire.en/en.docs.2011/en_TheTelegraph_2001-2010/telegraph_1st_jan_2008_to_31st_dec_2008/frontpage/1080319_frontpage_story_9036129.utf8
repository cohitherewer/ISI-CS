          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, March 18: What began as a turf war over who gets to control cricket in the state has now ended with the removal of chief secretary P.P. Sharma.        
	Bowing to Opposition pressure-tactics, chief minister Madhu Koda transferred Sharma to the Administrative Training Institute (ATI) as director-general today and appointed Lokayukta Lakshman Uraon to probe charges of irregularities against him in the affairs of the Jharkhand Health Society (JHS).        
	Koda said: I removed Sharma for a fair inquiry into the allegations.        
	A.K. Basu, who has been officiating as chief secretary ever since Sharma went on leave, has now replaced him. He will be holding additional charge of science and technology, and drinking water and sanitation, departments.         
	Sharma, who was also holding additional charge as development commissioner, will have to give up that post to A.K. Singh, member of the board of revenue.        
	Kodas decision comes after the Opposition embarrassed the government thrice during the ongoing budget session. Sharmas letter to former chief minister Arjun Munda and his prompt reply proved to be the flashpoint.        
	In his letter to Munda  made public by former chief minister Babulal Marandi Sharma said his decisions as health secretary and chairman of the Jharkhand Health Society had his (Mundas) approval as he was also looking after the health ministry.        
	Training his guns at Munda, Marandi asked the former chief minister to come clean.         
	Munda said: It was a belated action.        
	Both Sharma and Amitabh Chaudhary, the JSCA president, refused to comment.

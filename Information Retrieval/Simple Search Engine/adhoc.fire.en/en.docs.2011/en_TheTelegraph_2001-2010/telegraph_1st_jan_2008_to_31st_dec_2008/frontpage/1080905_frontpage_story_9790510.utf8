          AMIT GUPTA                             Soren Stuck                                  
	Ranchi, Sept. 4: The Jharkhand government has decided to act tough on secretariat employees, who did not report to work today, the deadline set by the government.         
	We will take disciplinary action against erring employees, who did not report to work today, personnel secretary R.S. Sharma told The Telegraph today.         
	Office-bearers of Jharkhand Sachiwalaya Seva Sangh conceded that barring a few, all employees abstained from the work. Less than 10 workers who joined today are on the verge of retirement.        
	We are not going to cease our strike without any logical end to the long-pending demands. The government should either reject our demands or consider the recommendations of past committees and better our service conditions, said G.S. Sharma, an executive committee member of the sangh. Some 2,000 secretariat workers have been on a strike since July 22 demanding secretariat service, based on a central pattern, to ensure promotions from assistants to section officers, under secretaries, deputy-secretaries and joint-secretaries.         
	Since the past 44 days, government work has been hit, even while former the chief minister, Madhu Koda, was in power.         
	Employees posted at the Nepal House, Project Building, chief ministers residence, five commissionary headquarters, five offices of deputy inspector-generals of police and a few chief engineers offices have been on a strike.        
	The Shibu Soren government did constitute a three-member committee chaired by deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi to work out a solution to the problem, but the committee failed to resolve the crisis. Instead it suggested yet another committee be constituted, headed by a member of the board of revenue, to solve the problem.         
	Other members of the previous committee included HRD minister Bandhu Tirkey and health minister Bhanu Pratap Sahi.        
	A senior official in the science and technology department conceded that not a single secretariat assistant resumed duty today, halting government work.

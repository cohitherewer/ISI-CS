          K.P. NAYAR                            Mukherjee with Rice in Washington on Monday. Picture by Jay Mandal                                  
	Washington, March 24: The nuclear deal remained stalemated by the compulsions of Indias domestic politics after an initial 25-minute meeting between high-level Indian and US delegations here today.        
	When US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice emerged with external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee into the state departments elegant Benjamin Franklin Room to brief the media, it was clear that American expectations from Mukherjees visit at least on the nuclear deal had been belied.        
	Rice junked a lengthy, two-page statement that her aides had prepared for her after intense discussions in the state department last week. That statement was to have been a paean to the achievements of Indo-US relations.         
	Instead, Rice made a correct but cryptic statement on the meeting that lasted a little over a minute. If the Americans had expected more from Mukherjees visit and did not know what to make of its outcome so far, the Indian minister was at his opaque best.        
	Undeterred by what the Americans thought of his exposition of the state of the nuclear deal at the delegation-level talks, he read out a long, prepared statement that was in marked contrast to Rices brevity. But although Mukherjee was long on words, he gave away nothing as usual.        
	Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon, Indian ambassador Ronen Sen and other officials, who anxiously watched the media conference from the sidelines, appeared relieved that 24 hours after the ministers arrival in America, things had gone well so far considering that the US is now a hot potato in Indian politics.        
	Contrary to their expectations, however, Tibet, not the nuclear deal, dominated the news conference. Rice began her opening statement with a reference to her discussions on Tibet with Mukherjee, underlining the importance of the issue for the US. I have spoken with my (Indian) counterpart about the current situation in which there needs to be restraint in which violence is not acceptable, she said.        
	Mukherjee was patently uncomfortable with a question about why India was not doing anything about the Dalai Lama allowing the Americans to fire at China from Indias shoulders. This was a reference to the meeting between Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, and the Tibetan leader last week, which India facilitated.        
	Mukherjee did not answer the question, seeking refuge, instead, in an earlier answer to a question on Tibet. We have expressed our concern, he said about the latest developments inside Tibet. We do hope it will be possible to resolve the issue through peaceful dialogue between the parties concerned.         
	Mukherjee stressed Indias opposition to political activities by Tibetan refugees, but added that the highly respected Dalai Lama is fully free to carry on his spiritual and religious activities in India.        
	China has been severely critical of Pelosis activities in Dharamsala, but Rice today defended the US House Speaker. To have contact with him (the Dalai Lama), I think, is a good thing, not a bad thing, Rice said.         
	Answering another question on the nuclear deal, Rice merely said that the Indians are now in a process of working with the International Atomic Energy Agency and we will follow that progress.        
	Mukherjee will have more discussions with US President George W. Bush this afternoon and possibly explore a way out of the present stalemate privately with Rice at a dinner without even note-takers tonight.        
	For the present, he said: We are interested in implementing the landmark agreement reached. But now we have some political problem. Currently we are engaged in the process of resolving them.

                                (Top) Aishwarya and Lata                           
	Islamabad, March 26 (PTI) : Pakistans new Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani is a big fan of Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai and melody queen Lata Mangeshkar.        
	 While in prison, I used to watch all of Aishwaryas movies on my laptop besides listening to Latajis songs. And let me admit that I am a great fan of Aishwarya Rai now, Gilani, a die hard romantic, told a private news channel.        
	 Gilani, who is a descendent of Moosa Pak Shaheed, a Sufi saint of Multan, became a Lata fan when he was jailed in 2001 after being arrested by President Musharrafs regime on charges of misusing his position as Speaker of the National Assembly to make irregular appointments.        
	 The former minister chose prison over offers from Musharrafs regime to be freed in exchange for cutting off ties with the Pakistan Peoples Party.        
	With the new Prime Ministers fondness for Bollywood actresses and musicians, Pakistanis hope to see more Indian films making their way to their entertainment-starved country.

          RAKHEE ROY TALUKAR                            Manji Yamada, the 14-day-old child, in the incubator                                   
	Jaipur, Aug. 7: Manji Yamada doesnt know what she has kicked off.        
	She cant really, being in an incubator and just 14 days old.        
	But the birth of the Japanese baby, delivered by a surrogate mother and being breast-fed by another woman, has spawned a host of questions on the need for clear-cut surrogacy laws in India.        
	Manjis parents, Ikofusi Yamada and Yuki, divorced after she was conceived. Now mother Yuki doesnt want to take responsibility for the baby and father Ikofusi cant take his daughter back to Japan because Indian adoption laws dont allow a single man to adopt a girl child.        
	Supreme Court lawyer Indira Jaisingh, who has taken up Manjis case, however, pointed out that a father couldnt adopt his own child.        
	There is another problem. As she was born in India, Manji is Indian but her parents are Japanese  which means problems in issuing a birth certificate and a passport.        
	Jaisingh, however, said she hoped the baby would be issued a birth certificate bearing her fathers name by tomorrow so she can travel to Japan soon with her dad and grandmother Emiko.        
	Jaisingh said under the International Convention of the Rights of the Child, a newborn has to be registered immediately after birth and has the right to a name and a nationality.        
	She said as both India and Japan were signatories to the UN convention, there shouldnt be any difficulty in getting a birth certificate for Manji. Only the fathers name on the certificate would be enough to issue her travel documents which, she said, hold the same value as a passport.        
	Dr Nayna H. Patel of Akanksha Infertility and IVF hospital, Gujarat, said the couple had come to her nine months back, but Yuki did not provide her eggs, which came from an anonymous Indian donor.        
	Manji, however, isnt short of motherly affection. Shweta, the wife of a friend of Ikofusi, who gave birth to a daughter on Tuesday, is breast-feeding her own child and Manji.

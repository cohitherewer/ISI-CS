          E.M. JOSE                                    
	Tura, Feb. 14: Purno Agitok Sangma is back home, fed up of the national stage but raring to wrest back his place in the murkier world of Meghalaya politics.        
	 Enough is enough, I am here to stay, the Tura MP and former Lok Sabha Speaker said today, moments before filing his nomination for the March 3 Assembly elections.        
	Its been 22 years since the Garo veteran left Meghalaya to make a mark in national politics, after a two-year stint as chief minister ended with the B.B. Lyngdoh-led Hill Peoples Union toppling the government. The irony is that he is returning in much the same manner, not defeated but clearly frustrated at a promising career losing steam after his exit from the Congress in 1999 along with Sharad Pawar and Tariq Anwar.         
	The Northeast had once looked at Sangma as a potential Prime Minister, but his feisty opposition to the idea of a foreigner - Sonia Gandhi - becoming one proved counter-productive. While Pawar maintained his position in national politics despite being out of the Congress, Sangma started to fade away despite remaining an MP.         
	The March 3 election will be Sangmas 11th from Tura and he is confident the electorate will stand by him yet again.         
	I have already created a record of sorts by being elected from Tura, the biggest constituency in the state, nine times to Parliament and once to the Assembly, he said.         
	The Nationalist Congress Party leader said he decided to return to state politics at the request of his party, NGOs in the Garo Hills and the intelligentsia.        
	 I have done whatever I could for the country...now the people in Meghalaya and the Northeast have a lot of expectations from me, he said.         
	Sangma said the Congress-led Meghalaya Democratic Alliance failed to live up to the expectations of the people in the past five years. I want to see that for the next 10 years Meghalaya is taken forward on the path of progress as the state figures very low on the progress graph, he added, interrupted by shouts of Long live Sangma reverberating through the hills.         
	His sons Conrad and James also filed nomination papers today for the Selsella and Rongchugiri constituencies in West Garo Hills. Father and sons - accompanied by Sangmas wife Sarojini and daughter Agatha - went to the office of Tura additional deputy commissioner Ambrose Marak, about 6km from the family home at Walbakgri, together to file nominations.         
	The convoy stopped at the NCP office for a while, where party leaders and a sizeable gathering cheered the Sangmas and prayed for their victory. If the little big man of Meghalaya politics had any doubt that he still belonged, it was dispelled immediately.

Must be unhappy
  - Study by researchers in US says happy people socialise more        G.S. MUDUR                       Short-run pleasure, long-term malaise                                
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: Unhappy people watch significantly more television in their spare time than happy people, according to a new study in the US which analysed data on activity patterns of adults for over three decades.         
	Happy people socialise more with friends and relatives, and engage in more sex, although not that much more frequently than less happy people, the study by two sociologists at the University of Maryland has suggested.         
	The researchers said their findings, to be published next month in the journal Social Indicators Research, could not be used to determine whether happiness leads to lower television viewing, or more viewing leads to unhappiness.         
	John Robinson and Steven Martin, who analysed social activity patterns of nearly 30,000 adults through surveys conducted in the US from the 1970s to 2006, found that unhappy people spent 30 per cent more time with TV than happy people.         
	The pattern for daily TV use is particularly dramatic, the researchers said in their report. The findings raise questions about recent studies in the US which suggested that TV represents a highly enjoyable activity that improves the quality of lives.         
	The conflicting (findings) suggests that TV may provide viewers with short-run pleasure, but at the expense of long-term malaise, Robinson, professor of sociology and former director of a project to study how Americans use time.         
	The researchers believe there are certain attractions associated with TV viewing in relation to other leisure-time activities  viewers dont have to go anywhere, dont have to plan ahead, dont have to expend energy, or pay anything.         
	Robinson and Martin said their findings pointed to two possible interpretations.         
	TV viewing may be a pleasurable enough activity with no lasting benefit that takes people away from other activities that may be less pleasurable, but do provide long-term benefits. So TV may cause people to be less happy.         
	The other possibility is TV is a refuge for people who are already unhappy.         
	Chronic unhappiness can be socially or personally debilitating and can interfere with ... most social and personal activities, they wrote in their report, but even the unhappiest people can click a remote and be passively entertained by a TV.         
	The study found little difference in Internet usage patterns between happy and unhappy people.

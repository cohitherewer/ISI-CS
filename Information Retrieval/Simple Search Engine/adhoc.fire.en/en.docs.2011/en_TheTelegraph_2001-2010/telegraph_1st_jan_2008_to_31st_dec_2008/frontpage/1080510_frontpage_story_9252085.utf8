	New Delhi, May 9: The CPM had a bad hair day at the cinema on Friday. If Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees movie experience had a bumpy start, his party boss Prakash Karat missed a film altogether.        
	Karat and CPI leader D. Raja turned up at the Films Division auditorium in Delhi to watch a movie on a pet theme: anti-Americanism. But officials refused permission to screen the film, Raman, saying it was uncensored.        
	The film portrays the adverse impact of US colonialism. I will watch it sometime later. I have been told that the film is about American invasion of Iraq and a theme from Kerala is woven into it, said Karat, who hails from the southern state.        
	The Films Division relented around 7pm, but Karat and Raja had left by then.

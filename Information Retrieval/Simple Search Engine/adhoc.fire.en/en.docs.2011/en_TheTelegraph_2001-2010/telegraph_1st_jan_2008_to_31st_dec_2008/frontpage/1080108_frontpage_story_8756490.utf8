	Palace-hopping can be gruelling business. So, Madonna chose to pamper herself in five-star comfort on Monday.
    
	Sitting by a banyan tree, the pop star got an oil massage at the spa of the Udaipur hotel where she has put up with her husband and two children.
    
	Madonna has been soaking in the lush green hills, lakes, palaces and temples that dot the Rajasthan city since her arrival on Sunday (picture on top by Tuklak Bhanawal shows the pop star at the Shrinathji temple with her husband).
    
	Soon after checking in to the hotel, Madonna took a boat ride on the Pichola Lake, making a stop at Jag Mandir in the middle of the lake (in picture with her daughter and husband)
    
	Madonna then went to the City Palace, where she found the crystal section outstanding, sources said. 
    
	Holiday, of course, is no reason to take it easy. The 49-year-old Queen of Pop spent an hour at the hotels gymnasium before the massage, the sources said.
    
	Madonnas mother-in-law would be happy to know that the she also visited the Saas-Bahu ki Mandir.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Extortion note in hand, 2 in car 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, July 19: With all this talk of crores being strewn about ahead of the July 22 trust vote, it was a matter of time before someone tried to make a killing.        
	The plot they wove, though, may strike some as a bit overdone, replete with Northeast militants zipping across the capitals high-security zone in Tata Indicas and extortion demands to two of the countrys highest-profile politicians.An alleged Ulfa militant, Ramen Baruah, was arrested today from an Assam MPs official residence here with extortion letters addressed to a senior Congress minister and a Samajwadi Party general secretary. The general secretary was wrongly described as Samajwadi president.        
	Baruah had apparently left the letters behind in his car as he walked into the residence of Congress MP from Dhubri, Anwar Hussain, to extort money from him. Police found the letters in his Tata Indica car, the MP told The Telegraph.        
	Hussain said Baruah had been threatening him for the past four months and demanding money. He had introduced himself as a member of Ulfas dreaded 709 battalion, led by Hira Sarania.        
	This was to be our fourth meeting. When he arrived today, I told my personal assistant to tell him I was not at home. I slipped out through the backdoor and informed the commissioner of police, Y.S. Dadwal, Hussain said.        
	Baruah, who apparently arrived at the MPs residence at 3pm, was arrested at 5.45pm.        
	Hussain said Baruah had given him two notes seeking money, which he had handed over to Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi. These letters had been sent to forensic laboratories, the MP claimed, although he could not reveal the results.        
	Hussain said he had given Baruah Rs 25,000 in April but the man had turned up again in May with a demand for Rs 25 lakh.        
	Perhaps his latest letters were inspired by CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhans claim  among the many unsubstantiated allegations flying around  on Monday that the UPA was offering Rs 25 crore to MPs to vote for the trust motion.        
	Sources tonight said police and Intelligence Bureau interrogators now thought that Baruah could be an Ulfa agent, a sort of courier rather than a hard-core militant. It is, however, not certain if he has any Ulfa links at all.        
	Police officers reached Hussains residence in the evening to get his statement.        
	Congress spokespersons Jayanthi Natarajan and Manish Tewari said they would react only after the full details were known. Samajwadi leaders could not be contacted for comment.        
	Unsubstantiated speculation in Assam has linked Ulfa to one of the sides in the trust vote tug-of-war.

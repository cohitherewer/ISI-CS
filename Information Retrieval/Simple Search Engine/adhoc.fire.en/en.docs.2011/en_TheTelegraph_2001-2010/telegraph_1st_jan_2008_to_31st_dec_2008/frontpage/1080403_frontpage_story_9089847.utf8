The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Season of farewell sets in at PMO
                                                                                                           Season of farewell sets in at PMO
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             Manmohan Singh                                  
	New Delhi, April 2: Sharad Pawar may be backing Manmohan Singh as UPA mascot for the next election campaign but the Prime Ministers own aides appear uncertain about his political future.        
	Close on the heels of media adviser Sanjaya Barus decision to leave the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) in August to take up an academic assignment in Singapore comes the revelation that another senior aide is set to depart.        
	B.V.R Subrahmanyam, private secretary to Manmohan Singh, is moving to the World Bank headquarters in Washington in a months time.         
	An IAS officer of the 1987 batch, Subrahmanyam was handpicked by Manmohan Singh and has been with him since the start of his South Block term in May 2004.        
	He is the fourth senior officer in the PMO to opt out in the last four months. The other two were Sujata Mehta, who was posted as ambassador to Spain, and Javed Usmani, currently at the World Bank.        
	Sources in the PMO are allaying suggestions, though, that the exit of key officials is any indication of Manmohan Singhs departure rituals. It is an unspoken convention for Prime Ministers to place officers that have served them well in plum jobs before the end of their term.         
	But the sources denied this was happening and said there was no pattern of exodus. Baru, they said, had decided to leave for entirely personal reasons and the PMO had no role in arranging his placement at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore.        
	They confirmed, though, that Subrahmanyam had requested another posting. Although Subrahmanyam did not state it as a reason, the sources said the job of PS to the Prime Minister can get extremely strenuous beyond a point.        
	Speculation has ascribed Barus decision to his increasing weariness with nagging criticism from Congress party circles over the manner in which he has handled the media advisers job.         
	Those who know Baru closely say the decision was entirely personal. The truth may lie somewhere in between. Baru was, at least in his initial months in the job, targeted by Congress factional leaders who coveted the PMO assignment. Back in 2005, there were at least a couple of occasions when the media reported (wrongly) that his days in the PMO were numbered because Congress bosses were unhappy with him.        
	The charge oft levelled by Barus detractors has been that he never used his position to amplify the position of the Congress. Barus backers have argued back that Congress Prime Ministers have had an established tradition of party-neutral spokespersons.        
	Quoting the examples of H.Y. Sharada Prasad (Indira Gandhi) and Suman Dubey (Rajiv Gandhi) and others, they said the Prime Ministers media adviser has never been expected to speak for the party.        
	Atal Bihari Vajpayee brought in people like Ashok Tandon and Sudheendra Kulkarni to the PMO who were politically committed to the BJP and, therefore, more active on the partys behalf. Congress Prime Ministers have eschewed that practice, they said.        
	It is clear that Baru retained the PMs trust through the years and weathered attempts to unseat him. His decision to leave several months in advance of fresh elections was prompted by a combination of other factors, the sources said.         
	Baru has been in negotiations with the Singapore World University for a while now, and the fact that his daughter got a placement at the Lasalle School of Art swung him, they said, arguing things have come well timed for Baru.         
	The last few months of a Prime Ministers tenure are more political in nature, the government takes a back seat, the party takes over, there isnt much for a media adviser to do, the sources said.         
	But given the widely coveted nature of the job, it could well be that once Baru packs up from the PMO in August, jockeying resumes for the post, short though it will be on term.

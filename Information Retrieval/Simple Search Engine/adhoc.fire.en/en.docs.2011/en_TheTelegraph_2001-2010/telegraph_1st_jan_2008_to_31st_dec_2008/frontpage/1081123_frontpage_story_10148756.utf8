          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jamshedpur, Nov. 22: A Maoist transit camp atop the Dalma hills was destroyed after an hour-long gun battle this morning, claimed East Singhbhum police.        
	Firing continued from both sides for about an hour before the Naxalites fled the spot near Konkadosa, the top-most village at the Dalma hills. No casualty was reported from either side.         
	The police later seized a detonator, flashguns, pittus (carriers), mines, uniforms and Naxalite literature from the camp, 3km north of Konkadasa, about 40km from here, and later destroyed them as it was difficult to carry them downhill. The Maoists also exchanged fire with another police team at Koira near Konkadasa.        
	According to East Singhbhum superintendent of police Navin Kumar Singh, they had information that the Naxalites had set up a transit camp on top of Dalma hills for the past two-three days. We organised a combing operation with the help of CRPF, Special Task Force (STF) and Jharkhand Armed Police. The police team was led by a deputy superintendent of police, he added.        
	Navin said the police fired 66 rounds and used three rifle grenades as well as a couple of mortars against the Naxalites who hid themselves in strategic positions around the hilly terrain.         
	The encounter started around 7.45am and lasted four an hour. The rebels also fired indiscriminately before fleeing the area.        
	Later, the police found the transit camp near a waterfall. We destroyed the items found there because it was not possible to carry them keeping in mind the height  Dalma is about 3,600ft high  as well as the hilly terrain. The police team is still combing the hills in search of Naxalites, Singh said.        
	According to police sources, Maoists belonging to the Bhola Singh platoon were suspected to be camping in the Dalma hills for some days.

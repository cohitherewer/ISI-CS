          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bagdogra, March 7: Bimal Gurung today assured the people of the Darjeeling hills that his party would not resort to any activity that might affect the tourism industry.         
	The indefinite bandh and fast launched by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha had crippled the hills for more than a week, although Gurung claimed that it was off-season then.         
	In the hills, the tourist season starts from the end of February.         
	The hills will soon witness a steady flow of tourists. We will not resort to any activity that might affect the sector on which thousands of people depend for their livelihood, he said, adding that the Gorkhaland movement would be democratic in nature.         
	Gurung, who came back from Delhi today, also said Ghisinghs entry to the hills after he resigns as caretaker administrator of the DGHC would be decided by the people. The Morcha has nothing to do with it. He labelled the GNLF chief a daydreamer, taking a dig at Ghisinghs announcement yesterday that he was ready to spearhead the Gorkhaland movement once more.         
	The Morcha president said the rejection from the hill people has shocked Ghisingh. The dismal support base of the GNLF is enough indication that his hope of launching a movement for Gorkhaland would remain limited to his dreams. He is being impractical.        
	While it is true that the Morcha alone cannot attain statehood and is willing to take the help of other like-minded parties, the GNLF is unwelcome in the forum that will be formed for the purpose, said Gurung.        
	Ghisinghs condition is so pathetic that even if he raises the demand for a country, he would hardly find any takers, Gurung said. He added that the Morcha has been formed to spearhead the statehood movement and not to contest elections.         
	The Morcha chief had yesterday in an interview to The Telegraph said if the cry for Gorkhaland was ignored, it might spiral into something beyond statehood.

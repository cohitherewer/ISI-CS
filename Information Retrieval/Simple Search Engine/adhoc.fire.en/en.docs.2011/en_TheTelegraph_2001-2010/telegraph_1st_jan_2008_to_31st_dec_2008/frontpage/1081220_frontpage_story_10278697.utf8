  - Court halves Ansals terms, citing age, education and clean record          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                            Neelam Krishnamurthy, who lost two of her children in the Uphaar fire, in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: Delhi High Court today halved the two-year jail terms of the owners of Uphaar cinema, where 59 people burnt to death in 1997, citing their advanced age, social standing and clean record.        
	Reducing the Ansal brothers sentence to a year, a single-judge bench said they were educated, respectable members of society with no previous criminal records.        
	Sushil Ansal, 71, and Gopal Ansal, 62, were sentenced last year for criminal negligence of safety measures but immediately given bail  till the Supreme Court cancelled it last September because they had tampered with court records.        
	Today, Justice Ravinder Bhatt rejected as unreasonable the plea by the Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (Avut) to increase the Ansals original jail term.        
	The decision angered Avut, which had earlier been disappointed to see the Ansals get two years while four of their employees and three electricity officials got seven years.        
	If old age is an argument, why are not all aged people in jails set free, asked Avut head Neelam Krishnamurthy, who lost two of her children in the fire.        
	This is definitely not what we had bargained for at the end of a 12-year fight. This is the value of a common man on the street. The trial court had given 12 days to the duo in prison for each of the dead, the high court has further reduced it to six days per dead person, she said, breaking down before TV cameras.        
	She added: How could the high court ignore the fact that the Supreme Court had cancelled their bail for tampering with case records and that they had been threatening the victims families fighting the case?        
	Pranab Ansal, son of Sushil, was unhappy too. We were expecting a complete acquittal, he said. This is not acceptable. I want to wipe the stigma off my fathers and chachas foreheads. We will appeal to the Supreme Court.        
	The high court also reduced the jail terms of three electricity and fire department officials and an Uphaar gatekeeper while acquitting five other accused.        
	Justice Bhatt said the investigators had ignored glaring lapses in the functioning of the civic bodys licensing department and the Delhi Vidyut Board.        
	About the Ansals, he said: Imposition of maximum sentence (two years) is not justified. (The) ends of justice would be served if the sentence is modified to rigorous imprisonment for one year.        
	The multi-millionaire Ansals were also fined Rs 6,000 each.        
	The mitigating factors urged by them (the Ansals) are that they are both of advanced age, have no previous criminal records, and are educated and respectable members of society, the high court said in a 538-page judgment.        
	Krishnamurthy said the court should have taken into account that the halls emergency exits had been blocked by the owners to make a special viewing box for the family, and that even the normal exits were not functioning.        
	None of the staff helped the people trapped in the fire, she said. We will now move the Supreme Court.        
	Pranab said: They (the Ansals) are absolutely innocent. They had nothing to do with the running of the theatre. Even the managers who had some role in maintaining the theatre have been acquitted.        
	It was an accident, he claimed. We did not set the theatre on fire and burn it down. We are being victimised and being made scapegoats for who we are.        
	He claimed the Ansals had deposited Rs 6 crore with the high court in 2005 for compensating the victims.

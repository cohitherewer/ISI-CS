        End of a way of life 
   
	Paris, Jan. 1 (AP): Smokers were savouring their last cigarettes over morning coffee in cafes across France today, and cafe personnel were predicting financial ruin as a smoking ban took effect.
 
	In neighbouring Germany, eight states launched partial smoking bans in restaurants and bars, though the restrictions were more flexible than the French measure and other near-total bans already adopted across Europe.
 
	French officials said they would not enforce the new measure mdash; aimed at clearing the air in the countrys notoriously hazy cafes, bars, restaurants and night clubs mdash; until tomorrow.
 
	Smokers at Pariss Cafe Au Depart were taking advantage of the 24-hour reprieve to keep the air there as thick as usual, although the mood was notably downbeat. Its really a shame, said David Fossey, 32. Its the end of a way of life, he said as he stubbed out what he said would be his last mdash; or perhaps second-to-last mdash; cigarette ever.
 
	I had intended to quit for a while now, but this seals the deal, Fossey said. Others were more defiant.
 
	Jean-Pierre Aiglement, 55, drinking coffee before starting work as a waiter at the Au Depart, said he wouldnt be chased out onto the pavement, adding: Ill smoke where I please.
 
	Under the measure, those caught lighting up in inside face a euro63 fine, while owners who turn a blind eye to smoking in their establishments face a euro135 fine.
 
	Restaurateurs complain the ban forces them into the uncomfortable role of enforcers and insist it will cause a major decline in business. Smokers who light up with a countertop morning coffee, on the dance floor or after a meal make up a huge customer base.
 
	Once they start enforcing the ban, this place will be empty, Aiglement said.
 
	With the ban, France joins the swelling ranks of European countries mdash; including Italy, Belgium, Spain, Britain and Ireland mdash; which have already enacted broad anti-smoking laws.
 
	But in few nations is smoking as much a part of national identity as it is here: A dense haze shrouded the Left Bank cafes where celebrated thinkers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir once held court, and theres hardly a photograph of iconic singer Serge Gainsbourg without a cigarette. About a quarter of Frances 60 million people smoke.

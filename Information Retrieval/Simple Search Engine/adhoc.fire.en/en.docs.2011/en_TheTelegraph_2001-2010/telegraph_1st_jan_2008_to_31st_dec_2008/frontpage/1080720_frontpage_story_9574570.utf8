	Srinagar, July 19: Nine unarmed soldiers were blown to bits today when their army bus rolled over an IED concealed by militants on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad highway.        
	The attack is the biggest on security forces this year and comes a day after Indian and Pakistani officials met in Islamabad for talks to re-open the same road to trade.        
	The 3.50pm blast was triggered at Narbal, 14km from here, as the bus was returning in a convoy from Chowkibal in Kupwara district. Its impact was so huge that the bus was flung to one side of the road and a huge crater appeared, strewn with mangled limbs and army equipment.        
	Brigadier K. Muthanna of 15 sector Rashtriya Rifles said 26 jawans, all unarmed, were in the bus. About 14 of them were wounded in the blast.        
	The IED was planted on the roadside and it appears to have been triggered off by a remote-controlled device. All the injured have been shifted to Badami Bagh cantonment hospital, he said.        
	The brigadier said the soldiers were from the 28 infantry brigade based in Kupwara and were travelling to Srinagar after finishing their duty on the Line of Control.        
	Police sources said the IED was hidden under construction material that was meant for widening the Srinagar-Baramulla highway.        
	There was a massive explosion and for 10 minutes we could see nothing but dust and smoke from the spot. When the dust settled, the bus had turned towards the right side, said a policeman posted on an adjoining bridge.        
	There are no residential houses near the blast site. But several houses hundreds of metres away reported damage.        
	The Hizb-ul Mujahideen has taken responsibility for the blast. Spokesperson Ehsan-ul Haq called up a local news agency from Muzaffarabad and intimated the officials.        
	Defence spokesperson Lt Col A.K. Mathur said the area was generally combed by the armys road-opening party and other security forces before a convoy was allowed to pass.        
	How much time does it take militants to plant an IED? There is no laxity on the part of the forces, he said.        
	The area has been sealed off and an operation launched to nab the militants, who may have detonated the blast from the adjoining paddy fields.        
	Traffic on the Srinagar-Baramulla highway remained suspended for several hours and hundreds of vehicles were stranded.        
	At Gulab post in the Kupwara sector, five militants were killed during a foiled infiltration bid. The operation was continuing till reports last came in.

  - Souravs team stares at bottom of IPL table after loss to Yuvrajs boys          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                    
	Mohali, May 3: This was as jubilant a burial as youd ever get to see. There was drumbeat and dancing, and the cheergirls gloried rapturously in their skimpy wares along the rippling fence as the Kings rode the Knights into the ground tonight.        
	Yuvraj Singhs men have been on a roll, three of their last three matches won. Tonight they steamrolled. Sourav Gangulys team has been in a hole. Tonight, under the creamy, moth-infested lights of Mohali, they dug themselves a little deeper into it.        
	The Knight Riders lost the better part of their batting for 29, Sourav Ganguly included  a foolhardy caress to a rising Sreesanth ball outside the off stump and Irfan Pathan at third man gobbled it with glee as if it were a K.C. Das offering.        
	At the 15-over mark, their task was an impossible 17 runs an over and climbing. David Hussey and Wriddhiman Sahas cavalier late-innings surge did flicker with the prospect of miracle which Twenty20 cricket forever promises.        
	But it was only a flicker; the chase died in the desperation of the final over that demanded 19 and fetched a painfully gotten nine. The Hussey-Saha tandem worked a blistering 104 off 55 but in the end it was clear the early setbacks had put a fatal drag on their effort.         
	Korbo, lorbo, jeetbo re has been a fading theme all week; tonight it began to ring hollow, even farcical. Where are you, Shah Rukh Khan, your anthems turning into a dirge; Preity Zinta is on song.        
	These werent the golden gladiators whod begun so triumphantly in Bangalore only a fortnight ago. They arrived here already a bedraggled platoon, harried by defeat upon defeat, minus big guns like Brendon McCullum and Ricky Ponting, minus, even more pertinently, Patron-General Shah Rukh.        
	Within minutes of their reply to the Kings 178, they looked resigned to yet another loss. Ganguly and Debabrata Das gone for five, Mohammed Hafeez for 13, Brad Hodge for one. All in the space of two overs, no more. But for Hussey and Saha, it seemed as if the teams pre-match resolution had been to retreat early to bed in their Chandigarh hotel.        
	Last night was a late one for many of the Riders; they held the team bus back to go see Tashan at a local multiplex. The movie didnt inspire much in them, it would appear  as a team they lacked all attitude and style tonight. The Knight Riders are kissing the bottom of the IPL table now; there isnt much else there but the debris of defeat.                                
	The Kings, on the contrary, have risen from two early knocks to power their way in the championship stakes. Theyve lost Brett Lee, but dont seem at any loss.        
	They began cruising early in the evening. They were at nearly 10 an over with just a wicket gone in the ninth over when Yuvrajs clumsy run-out opened a cascade of wickets.        
	Sean Marsh, whod got to 40, all ease and elegance in his second IPL outing, was stumped by Wriddhiman Saha in David Husseys first over: 98 for three. Then Ganguly brought on Umar Gul for the first time. Ball two -- Mahela Jayawardene lobs it to Ganguly at short mid-on: 102 for four.        
	In the very next over, Karan Goel falls short of the crease, trying to steal a single off a misfield. Bowler Hussey joyously ripped off the bails at his end as Goel fell in an ungainly heap: 106 for five.        
	The Knight Riders were revelling midfield, the drums in the lower stands had suddenly gone dumb, the whistling had all been sucked in. Was this going to be the night of the Riders after all? For a stunned half-hour, Mohali went circumspect.        
	But then a partnership began to sputter between Irfan Pathan and Kumar Sangakkara, who ended his temporary retirement to the dugout to return and hurt -- four fours in his quickfire 28 and he had put up 49 with Pathan before being bowled by Gul. Six down for 155 with barely an over left.        
	But what an over. A fancied bowler tonked for 21 by an unfancied bat; Ishant Sharma hasnt bowled such a poor Twenty20 over, Piyush Chawla hasnt batted out a better one. Three fours and a six and the Kings had suddenly hoisted the target higher at 178. Thats where the Knight Riders began to lose the game, perhaps, much before theyd even begun their attempt on not an outrageously lofty summit.

	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 3: Union home minister Shivraj Patil, who visited Khandhamal today, described the situation at the district as something in between.        
	I wouldnt say that it (situation) is volatile, neither is it normal, because villages are still deserted. Its something in between, said Patil while taking to reporters at the Biju Patnaik airport before returning to New Delhi.        
	The minister visited Tiangia village, where four persons were killed.         
	The village was deserted, shops were closed and homes were locked up, he said.        
	At Udaygiri, another village that he visited, businesses were closed and roads were deserted. We could not find any people there and at the relief camp, the people said they were afraid to go back, he said.        
	These are unfortunate incidents and they divide the society in the name of religion and caste. Probably everybody has realised the futility of such violence, said the Union home minister.         
	Condemning the violence, the minister, however, evaded questions regarding the agency responsible for the clashes. Naming one party or group would be indulging in a blame game. I am also not accusing anybody at this point. Let the investigation into the case begin. Instead of apportioning blame, lets shoulder the responsibility to provide security, peace and full protection to the people, Patil said. Asked if he was happy with the performance of the state government post-clashes, he said: I am not here to give judgement or to give clean chit to anybody. The central minister left the matter to the media to judge the governments performance. He also evaded queries on the possibility of hitches and miscommunication between the central paramilitary forces and police. I think CRPF and the state police co-operated fully with each other, he said.        
	Patil said the Centre had provided 33 companies of paramilitary forces and one helicopter to deal with the situation. I have promised another helicopter for rescue operations, he said.        
	The home minister announced a central assistance of Rs 3 lakh to the family of each of the 16 victims of the violence. The Centre would also grant assistance to the state government for further aid. The chief minister has been asked to prepare a plan to support the people who have suffered in the recent clashed.        
	The governments primary task is to provide relief to those affected. Then homes have to be rebuild with the institutions, too, said Patil.

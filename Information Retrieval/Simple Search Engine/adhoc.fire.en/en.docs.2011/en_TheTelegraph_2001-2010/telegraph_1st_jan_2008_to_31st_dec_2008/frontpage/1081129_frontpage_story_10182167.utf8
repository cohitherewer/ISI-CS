The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Next door to Nariman House 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Next door to Nariman House 
                            
	Ananya Sengupta of The Telegraph sneaked into a building barely 20-25 metres away from Nariman House on Friday evening from where she got a ringside view of the commando operation to free the centre of Jewish education and culture. By the end of the day, the men in black had neutralised the terrorists, but could not save the hostages who were killed by their captors.               
	The narrow lanes leading to Nariman House in a congested residential locality of upmarket Colaba were taken over by gun-toting commandos of the National Security Guard.         
	Newspersons had been kept at least a few kilometres away from the building where the terrorists had been holed up for nearly 48 hours with at least five hostages. Everyone tried to get close to the action, but indiscriminate firing and flying grenades pushed us further back.        
	As I moved from one lane to the other looking for an open space with a view of the action, I spotted a five-storied building, Mazda Mansion, a stones throw away from Nariman House in an unmanned narrow bylane.        
	But there was a problem.        
	At one end stood the under-siege Nariman House. If I tried to cross amid the indiscriminate firing, I could be hit. Yesterday, an onlooker was shot dead by a terrorist at the very spot which I had pass to go to the other side and reach Mazda Mansion.        
	Even then, it was too good a chance to let go.        
	I just ran, perhaps the longest stretch of my life, and reached the mansions door. Immediately I heard heavy exchange of fire and I knew I was where I should be.        
	I tiptoed up to the terrace, which had a clear view of one side of the six-storied Nariman House, barely 20-25 metres away. The terrorists were hurling grenades and firing from the windows.        
	Two commandos were crouched on the terrace where I now was, and were video-taping the operation while sipping fruit juice and munching biscuits. Their calm belied the action going on around us.        
	Crouching low, I saw commandos firing continuous shots, from the rooftop of the house into the fourth floor window. With each grenade attack, Mazda Mansion shook. Bullets came raining from all directions, one hit the terrace, just metres away from where I was standing with two freelance video journalists.        
	Suddenly, amid all the firing I saw a man in a white shirt on the fourth floor of Nariman House with something in his hand, probably a gun. He was firing from the front of the building and the commandos were blazing away at him from all directions. A grenade explosion ripped through the fourth floor as I looked on, too stunned to even realise I was that close.        
	Within seconds some 10 commandos appeared on the terrace of Nariman. One of them threw a bag tied to a rope towards an adjacent building, diagonally across to my right,where his colleagues were waiting. The bag was returned some time later and it looked as if they were replenishing their supply of grenades.        
	As soon as they got ammunition, fresh launcher-propelled grenade attacks started. Sparks of light emanating from the third and fourth floors of the house meant the terrorists hadnt given up yet  they were shooting continuously at the commandos. There was also an explosion on the first floor of the building.        
	Then for some minutes there was a lull, only intermittent firing, as commandos slowly entered different floors of the house, from the terrace and the ground floor. I decided to take a break as it was becoming difficult to stay crouched for so long.        
	Five minutes was all I got.        
	There was a huge explosion that ripped apart the fourth floor window of Nariman House. The ground beneath my feet shook. Panic-stricken, at first I thought the terrorists had lobbed a grenade at the mansion.        
	Just then I saw one of the commandos, who was climbing down the floors all the while firing at the terrorists, suddenly go down. (Later I learnt it was Gajinder Singh, an NSG havildar, who was killed). This was followed by another explosion and some rounds of heavy firing and yet another blast.        
	It was becoming clear that the terrorists were either dead or had been caught, because there was hardly any return fire from the house. I grew in confidence and, along with the others, dared to stand up straight and look out.        
	I could see commandos on the fourth floor of the building, they had torches in their hands, and were bending down to inspect something. Later I realised they had found hostages dead on the floor of the room, along with two dead terrorists. The much-loved Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his charming wife Rivka were dead, leaving behind their two-year-old son Moshe.        
	At 9.15pm, NSG chief JK Dutt declared that the operation was over.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 3000 docs resign in protest
                                                                                                           3000 docs resign in protest
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 19: More than 3,000 government doctors in Orissa submitted their resignations to protest against the governments apathy and neglect towards them.         
	The doctors have been demanding Class-I status for those belonging to the Orissa medical service cadre, a hike in pay scale, provision of specialist allowances for post-mortem procedures and medico-legal allowances for long.        
	Today, they handed over the resignation letters through the Orissa Medical Service Association, which passed them on to the health department. The doctors have threatened to cease work from March 19 if their demands were not met with.         
	In Orissa, government doctors serve approximately 4 crore people in 1,700 peripheral health institutions.         
	Tension between the doctors and the government had been brewing for long. In an interview with The Telegraph earlier, the states medical association president had complained that the state doctors were feeling increasingly alienated. We feel that we are no longer required, as our grievances are neither heard nor are our problems addressed in a democratic set up, said M.S. Mishra.        
	Sensing an impending crisis in the medicare system, health minister Sanatan Bisi convened an emergency meeting. However, the government was not able to arrive at a final decision.        
	We will hold discussions and then take action. Health is a priority for a poverty-prone state like ours and all of us have to work together, and proactively to gain best results, said Bisi.         
	The medical officers list of complaints also includes negligence of doctors needs. The association alleges it has not been consulted for solving problems of government doctors. Earlier, the medical association had met two health ministers but to no avail.         
	The chief minister had granted an appointment on August 19, 2006, to discuss doctors grievances. But later, he postponed the date.         
	In such a state, we believe there is no other alternative left for us than to resign en masse from the government service, said an association member. The mass resignation would be effective from March 19, added Singh.

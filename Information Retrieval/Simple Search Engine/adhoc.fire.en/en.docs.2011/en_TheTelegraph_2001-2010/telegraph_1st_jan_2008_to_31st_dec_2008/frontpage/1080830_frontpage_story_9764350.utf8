          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Rahul Gandhi(top), Amar Singh				                                 
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: The Congress does not rule out friendly fights with the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, where the two parties had decided to form an alliance.        
	Rahul Gandhi, general secretary in charge of the state Digvijay Singh and state party president Rita Bahuguna Joshi will meet Amar Singh and Ram Gopal Yadav of the Samajwadi Party on Sunday or Monday to start seat-sharing talks for the Lok Sabha polls.         
	The Congress is likely to peg its demand at 30 or 35 of the 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, which a Samajwadi source dismissed as unrealistic given the party had won only nine seats and came second in six in 2004.         
	The Samajwadi source said they were ready to yield 12 or 15 seats and that, too, on the condition that the Congress would concede a few seats in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. The Samajwadis claim they have more than a presence in these states.        
	But the Congress is worried that if it undersells itself, its workers would get disheartened. Sources admitted that after the four-year slugfest with Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar, party workers were just about coming to terms with the alliance. On top of that, if we are restricted to less than 20 seats, their morale will plummet, a source said.        
	Therefore, the option of friendly fights in 25 or 30 constituencies was being considered. In the cut-and-thrust of heartland politics, though, fights can be anything but friendly.         
	The Congresss point is that the 2004 elections  in which the Samajwadis won 39 seats  cannot be used as the sole benchmark because delimitation has redrawn the map. The caste profile of several constituencies has changed, often to the Samajwadis disadvantage, Congress sources argued.         
	They would hold joint campaigns with the Samajwadis but would not have a common minimum programme, the sources added.

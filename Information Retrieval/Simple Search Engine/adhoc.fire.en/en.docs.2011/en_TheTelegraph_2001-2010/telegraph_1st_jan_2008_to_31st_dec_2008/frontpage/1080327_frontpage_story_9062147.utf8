	Rongpoh, March 26: Driven by his inner voice, a Shillong youth of Tibetan origin today attempted self-immolation on the Sikkim-Bengal border.        
	Kalsang Damdul, 31, was on his way to Tibet to join the anti-China protests there, but his journey was cut short at Rongpoh three days ago.         
	He and 100-odd Tibetan marchers have been held up here because the Sikkim government has denied them passage to Nathu-la, en route to Tibet.         
	This morning, Damdul, who runs a small restaurant at Barabazar in Shillong, poured kerosene on the lower half of his torso and tried to immolate himself. The other marchers stopped him in the nick of time.         
	I picked up kerosene from a nearby tea stall and poured it over myself, but others started pouring water over me before I could light up, he said.        
	Asked what made him consider this drastic step, Damdul said he became very emotional on seeing pictures of Chinese brutality in Lhasa. I got to know about the march from Salugarah to Tibet and readily agreed to be a part of it. However, on reaching here, I was getting frustrated by the Sikkim governments refusal to let us in. Today, at the diktat of my inner voice, I tried to set myself ablaze.         
	Damdul, the father of a two-year-old son, denied that his attempt was pre-planned. I have a wife and kid back home. I would not have contemplated such a step in normal circumstances, but emotions have been running high here since the first day and I got caught up in it.         
	His fellow protesters lit candles as Damdul was speaking.               
	Some people here are telling us to call off our march, but I do not agree with them at all. We must continue with our protest, he said.

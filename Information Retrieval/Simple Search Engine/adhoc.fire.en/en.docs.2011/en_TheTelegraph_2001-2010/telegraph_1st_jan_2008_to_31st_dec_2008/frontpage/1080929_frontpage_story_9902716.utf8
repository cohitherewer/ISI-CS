          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, Sept. 28: A 20-year-old German woman has alleged that she was abducted from the parking lot of the Taj hotel in Chandigarh late last night by six men in an SUV who tried to rape her.        
	Police have registered a case of molestation, abduction and attempt to rape, and taken the woman to a city hospital for a medical examination.         
	There was an attempt to rape her, SSP S.S. Srivastava said.        
	However, a PTI report that did not quote anyone said she had been gangraped.        
	The woman, in Chandigarh for a friends wedding, told the police she had come out of the hotel in high-security Sector 16 for a smoke when the men pulled her into the vehicle and drove off.        
	She was molested in the vehicle, which was driven around the city for a few hours, the police said. Then the men took her to a room where they tried to rape her, they added.         
	The woman said she was dropped off near the Sector 20 home of her friend this evening with the warning that she should not go to the police.        
	We have listened to her thoroughly despite the fact that she cannot converse in English properly, an officer connected with the investigation said.        
	The police have identified the SUV from the register of vehicles entering the Taj complex and raids were on to trace the culprits. Sources said some youths had already been detained for questioning.        
	A PTI report, however, said the vehicle registration number the woman gave was that of an autorickshaw.        
	The alleged incident took place on World Tourism Day, hours after the administration introduced Tourist Police, a dedicated force to help visitors to the city.        
	Apart from the security provided by the police at the hotel that is frequented by VIPs, Taj has its own private guards.

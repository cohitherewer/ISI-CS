The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Castro opts for VRS championed by Basu

  - Bowout binds Cuba and Bengal           MANINI CHATTERJEE                            Castro (left) with Basu (right) in Calcutta in 1973                                        
	New Delhi, Feb.19: Old soldiers, it is said, never die; they only fade away. Communist rulers, by contrast, seldom retire. They are either purged or stay in power till their dying day.        
	That is why todays announcement by Fidel Castro that he was stepping down as President has taken the world by surprise.        
	The charismatic Cuban leader who came to power after his revolutionary army overthrew the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in January 1959 has held the record of being the longest serving ruler in the world without royal lineage.        
	He may have transferred effective power to the First Vice-President (who also happens to be his younger brother), Raul Castro, on July 31, 2006. But Castro was still king and set to be re-elected to the top post five days from now.         
	But in a letter that appeared in Granma, the official paper of the Communist Party of Cuba, Castro declared that I will not aspire nor accept  I repeat I will not aspire or accept  the post of President of the Council of State and Commander in Chief.         
	Cubas President  perhaps the greatest living revolutionary of our times  was also quoted as saying that it would betray my conscience to take up a responsibility that requires mobility and total devotion that I am not in a physical condition to offer.        
	Castro, unbeknownst to himself, was echoing the sentiment of only one other communist patriarch (other than post-Mao Chinese leaders) in the history of world communism. And his name is Jyoti Basu.        
	Basu, it is true, came to power through the far more genteel power of the ballot and isnt quite in the same pantheon of revolutionary leaders that Castro belongs to.                        Mao, Stalin      
	Yet, what Castro did today, Basu had done over seven years ago. On November 6, 2000, Basu  the longest-serving elected chief minister in the country  decided to step down from office and hand over power to a younger leader unrelated to him by blood.        
	And Basu too, far more laconic than Castro, had cited ill-health as the main reason behind his decision.                    
	Communist party general secretaries have stepped down from leadership in the past, too. E.M.S. Namboodiripad, for instance, retired a good few years before his death. His predecessor P. Sundarayya also chose to step down, albeit because of differences with the partys line. But neither exercised state power at the time of retirement.        
	In fact, ideological differences are usually the only reason for a leader to be purged from a position of power. The undivided Communist Party of India saw a series of such forcible retirements -- P.C. Joshi was expelled for his revisionist line at the partys second congress in 1948; his expeller B.T.Ranadive met the same fate a few years later, and when differences at the top could not be resolved with individual purges, the party itself split in 1964.        
	But unless a communist party supremo  who is seen as the chief executor of the party line  steps out of line, there are usually no provisions for retirement. Unlike the US presidency which cannot go beyond two terms or prime ministerships which are entirely dependent on electoral victories, revolutionary leaders invariably continue in office till their last breath.        
	Leninist organisation principles laid inordinate emphasis on a stable leadership and notions of fixed tenures was alien to a revolutionary party. But long after revolutionary ardour was replaced by the stodgy rule of apparatchiks, the Soviet Union stuck to the no-retirement policy.        
	Josef Stalin set the trend. He remained the general secretary of the CPSU  and the effective ruler of the Soviet Union  till his death on March 15, 1983.         
	The de-Stalinisation process was carried out by his successor Nikita Khrushchev only after Stalin was safely dead. But Khruschev made history by becoming the only Soviet leader to be ousted from office.        
	On October 14, 1964, when Khrushchev was away on holiday, the politburo voted to remove him from office and appointed Leonid Brezhnev as the boss.        
	The bushy-eyebrowed Brezhnev wasnt the most dynamic of leaders and was mostly ill for the last few years of his life. But retirement did not cross his mind. After his death on November 10, 1982, the Soviet Union had two faceless bosses in quick succession  Yuri Andropov (Nov 12, 1982Feb.9, 1984) and Constantin Chernenko (Feb. 13, 1984  March 10, 1985). Both suffered from ailments that kept them bed-ridden but neither took the initiative  or, indeed, would have been allowed to take the initiative -- to step down from office voluntarily        
	Even an ailing general secretary was more important for stability than a sudden vacancy caused not by deviation or death. And the decision of the politburo was proved right in later years. The dynamic Mikhail Gorbachev took over in 1985. He did lose his job as CPSU general secretary on December 25, 1991  but then there was neither any CP nor SU left.        
	The other great Red leaders -- Mao Zedong and Ho Chi Minh  also followed the norm. Despite power struggles that started long before his death, Mao was the supreme leader of the Peoples Republic of China until his death in 1976. Like de-Stalinisation, the dismantling of the Great Helmsman from the pedestal he stood on began only after his death.         
	True, Deng Xiaoping also retired before he died. But then, post-Mao china has done away with the practice of long-serving supreme leaders in favour of fixed-term party bureaucrats.        
	Ho Chi Minh died as President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) on September 2, 1969. It was only six years after his death that Vietnam defeated the US. That is why, perhaps, Uncle Ho, remains an undying hero, escaping the fate of Mao and Stalin.        
	Castro  and Basu  have followed another route. By giving up power before power gives up on them, both have achieved the stature of grand patriarchs. Basu remains the CPMs sage counsel in all matters big and small. Castro too will be revered as the man who stood up against Uncle Sam and is still standing -- never mind the hospital bed.

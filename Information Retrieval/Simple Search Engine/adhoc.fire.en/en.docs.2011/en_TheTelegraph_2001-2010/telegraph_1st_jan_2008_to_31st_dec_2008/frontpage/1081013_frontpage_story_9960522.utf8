          OUR BUREAU                               
	Mangaldoi/Kokrajhar, Oct. 12: Just when Darrang and Udalguri seemed to be limping back to normality, a group today broke the lull by setting ablaze two abandoned houses amid fiery protests at relief camps against the hoisting of a Pakistani flag at Sonaripara village last week.         
	The owners of the torched houses had shifted to relief camps in Darrang just after the ethnic clashes in the two districts began.        
	At a camp in Udalguris Rowta College, refugees burst in protest against the alleged hoisting of a Pakistani flag by fundamentalists at Sonaripara village on October 4.         
	Some help aloft the Tricolour while others shouted slogans against illegal Bangladeshi migrants and did not spare chief minister Tarun Gogoi and health and family welfare minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.        
	Deboram Boro, an inmate who hails from Botabari village, said had the state government taken pre-emptive measures, the violence could have been averted.        
	While Deboram fumed over how indigenous people like him were being forced to live in relief camps in their own state, Bimal Boro, another inmate, could not still believe that his own neighbours had burnt down his home.        
	Bimal said he could recognise the people who had attacked his village and burnt down houses of 145 Bodo families on October 3, since most of the attackers were his neighbours.         
	While inmates of the relief camps grappled to come to terms with the bitter reality, the Centre today promised all help to restore peace in the two districts.        
	A three-member AICC delegation today surveyed the relief camps, which have become temporary homes for nearly 90,000 villagers.         
	Shakeel Ahmed, Union minister of state for home, who was part of the delegation, announced an ex gratia of Rs 1 lakh each on behalf of the Centre to the families of those killed in the ethnic violence. Ahmed was accompanied by Rajya Sabha MP from Arunachal Pradesh Mukut Mithi and Congress MP from Malda N.A. Ganikhan Choudhury. He asked chief minister Tarun Gogoi to visit the affected areas and assured additional paramilitary forces for the state whenever Dispur asked for it.         
	We have received several complaints from the victims, which we will examine and submit a report to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi by October 14, Ahmed said.         
	Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh, who too visited the affected areas, blamed the state government for the carnage.         
	Meghalaya power minister Conrad Sangma, too, visited Udalguri today.         
	Sangma had led the delegation of legislators and officials to Udalguri following reports of Garos being caught in the carnage.         
	There are around 12,000 Garos in Udalguri, of which 5,000 are now living in relief camps at Bandergewaneja.         
	BTC chief Hagrama Mohilary, on the other hand, today welcomed the state governments decision to hand over the inquiry into the violence to the CBI.

          OUR BUREAU                                              
	New Delhi, April 22: The Centre today forecast a bumper foodgrain crop this year but experts questioned the declared figure of 227.32 million tonnes.        
	Analysts said the claim, which comes at a time the government is under attack for spiralling food prices, was inflated and cautioned that India might have to import grain.        
	Some argued that even if the figures were correct, it would not bring prices down since the country needed about 250 million tonnes of grain.        
	T. Haque, who chaired the governments committee on farm prices till last month, said: The figures are inflated. The figures we had with us showed that foodgrain production was likely to be 218 million tonnes during 2007-2008, a million tonnes less than earlier estimated.        
	Many experts saw todays announcement as a bid to talk down the inflation, which has been fuelled by rising food and metal prices.         
	The market has already factored in its own production estimates, said D. Joshi, chief economist of credit rating agency Crisil.        
	Rice has grown costlier by over 24 per cent in the past three months, and wheat by about 17 per cent, on expectations of a crop shortfall relative to demand.        
	The government tried to prove these expectations wrong. Agriculture secretary P.K. Mishra said grain production would rise by 4.6 per cent to 227.3 million tonnes this crop year (from July 2007 to June 2008).        
	Wheat output may climb to 76.8 million tonnes, more than the 74.8 million tonnes estimated in February and up from last years 75.8 million tonnes, he said. Rice may notch a record 95.7 million tonnes  a 2.5 per cent rise from last years 93.6 million tonnes.        
	This will be a record (wheat) production (the current record being the 76.37 million tonnes in 2000). Well-distributed rain, distribution of better seeds under the national food security mission and good temperatures have contributed to this, Mishra said.        
	Haque disputed this: We have yet to start implementing the mission. Crop area and productivity rates have not changed much. When we do implement the food mission, the farm story will certainly be different.        
	Devinder Sharma, an independent food expert, said: The country needs about 250 million tonnes of grain a year.        
	He, too, questioned todays figures. Within two months the government has come out with two sets of estimates without any dramatic change in the ground situation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | In transfer rush, coalition pangs get to Soren 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In transfer rush, coalition pangs get to Soren 
  - Guruji in a hurry to beat poll panel deadline; 13 IAS officers, 6 DCs, 20 SDOs, 63 BDOs shuffled           SUMAN K. SRIVASTAVA                      Shibu Soren                                
	Ranchi, Nov. 12: The Shibu Soren government, it seems, has gone into poll mode, even though dates for the Lok Sabha elections are yet to be announced.        
	In the past fortnight, Soren has transferred 13 senior IAS officers, including six deputy commissioners, along with 20 sub-divisional officers (SDOs) and 63 block development officers (BDOs) all of whom play a crucial role during elections.         
	Now, it is being rumoured that transfer of IPS officers is also on the pipeline.        
	Deputy commissioners and sub-divisional and block development officers double up as returning officers and assistant returning officers, respectively, for parliamentary and Assembly polls. The transfers are apparently aimed at beating the Election Commission deadline that put a ban on such transfers for the next two months (till January 10, 2009) in view of the electoral poll revision.         
	Sorens transfers contradict expectations that he, unlike his predecessor, would stand up to pressures exerted on him by UPA MPs, MLAs and ministers to get them district officers of their choice. According to sources, at the first UPA meeting, it was decided that MPs would select officials of their choice keeping in mind the February-March 2009 polls.         
	Thus, before the Election Commission diktat, Soren made his move to apparently appease ministers, MLAs and MPs, who were not ready to forego their claim.         
	By doing this, Soren has proved himself to be more vulnerable to coalition pressures, pointed out BJP MLA Sarayu Roy.        
	Ajit Kumar, the political advisor to Soren, however, denied that he was buckling under pressure. Its important to respect the suggestion of coalition partners to run a government, he explained.         
	As a result of the transfers and counter-transfers, Puja Singhal Purwar, a 2000-batch IAS officer, who has been waiting for a post for the past two months was transferred thrice in the past fortnight.         
	Puja was recently short-listed among four IAS officers in the country for receiving the Public Administration Award. Posted as joint secretary in the planning department, Puja was first transferred as DC to Gumla, then to Lohardaga and finally, Godda. But, she was finally asked to continue in the planning department.        
	The transfer of S.S. Prasad, Sarvendu Tathagat, M.P. Sinha, Rahul Sharma and Himani Pandey were also rolled back.        
	Even transfers of at least five out of the 18 SDOs were rolled back a day after they were notified. The transfer of Hazaribag SDO Ravindra Kumar Singh to the personnel department was stayed a day after.        
	Interestingly, transfer of Chatra DC Abu Bakr Siddiqui to Simdega within three months has raised heckles of Chatra RJD MP Dhirendra Agrawal. The MP has pleaded that premature transfer of a Muslim and an honest officer has sent mixed signals among the minority electorate of the RJD.        
	RJD MLA Uday Shankar Singh had walked out of a UPA meeting held last Saturday protesting his ignorance in the posting of an SDO in Deoghar. Water resources minister Kamlesh Singh is also apparently cut up with Soren for shifting Hussainabad SDO Pramod Singh without his consent. The minister, however, denied this.         
	I never interfere in matters of transfer or posting, he claimed.

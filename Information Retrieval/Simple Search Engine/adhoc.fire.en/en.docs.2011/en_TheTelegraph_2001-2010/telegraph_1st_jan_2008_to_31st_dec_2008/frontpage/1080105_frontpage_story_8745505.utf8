          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 4: Delhi today defended its decision to impose Presidents rule in Nagaland, saying it was not taken with mala fide intent but on the basis of reports sent by Governor K.Sankaranarayanan.        
	A Union home ministry statement said political instability in the state for several months climaxed in the developments in the Assembly on December 13, when a no-confidence motion was put to vote. The voting pattern clearly demonstrated that the government of the day had lost the majority support, the statement said.        
	The BJP said the UPA government seemed to have applied different laws under the same Constitution when there was political instability in Goa, where former Nagaland chief minister S.C. Jamir is the governor.         
	BJP leader Rajiv Pratap Rudy said if the Nagaland Speakers decision to disallow three legislators from voting on the no-confidence motion and the disqualification of the votes cast by nine members were the basis of imposing central rule, the Congress government in Goa should have been dismissed, too.        
	Rudy said former Goa Speaker Pratap Singh Rane had acted similarly and disqualified three members in the vote of confidence faced by the Digambar Kamat government on July 30 last year. Had the trio been allowed to vote, the Kamat government would not have survived, he added.

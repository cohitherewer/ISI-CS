	Patna, April 8: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today executed a complete overhaul at the top rung of IPS officers, replacing director-general of police and shuffling 17 other senior officers.        
	Director-general (homeguards) S.C. Jha, a 1969-batch IPS officer, replaced A.R. Sinha as the new DGP. But Jhas tenure in the top spot would be short-lived, as he is scheduled to retire from service on July 31.         
	The government also replaced additional director-general (headquarters), inspector-general (headquarters) and IG (security-special branch) through a home department notification this evening. D.N. Gautam, the ADG (training and modernisation), has taken over as the ADG (headquarters) replacing Abhayanand who has been made the IG (provisions).        
	Patna zone IG, Rajyawardhan Sharma, has been appointed IG (headquarters). Three 1987 batch IPS officers  Gupteshwar Pandey, Sunil Kumar and Shatrughan Prasad  were promoted from DIG rank to IG. Pandey will be the IG (security-special branch) while Sunil Kumar will become IG (Patna zone).

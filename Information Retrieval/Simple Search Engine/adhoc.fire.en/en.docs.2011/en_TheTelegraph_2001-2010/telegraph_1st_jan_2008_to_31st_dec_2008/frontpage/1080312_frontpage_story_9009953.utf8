The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Freeze on tongues in sub-zero Vienna
                                                                                                           Freeze on tongues in sub-zero Vienna
  - All quiet on nuclear front
                                  Saurabh Kumar                                  
	This could have been the hottest dateline at home today, headquarters to the IAEA, stage to negotiations that could yet bring down the curtains on Manmohan Singhs government.         
	Vienna, alas, is a blustery sub-zero chill and there is a frustrating freeze on tongues.         
	Nobodys saying anything on the fifth, and probably final, round of nuclear safeguards talks that concluded here between the Indians and the IAEA. If they at all are, it is merely to say that they have nothing to say, not even whether Vienna is done with its role in the most engrossing ideological battle India has witnessed in recent years.         
	What a pity youve taken the trouble to come all the way here, kidded one diplomat, offering a hello on the phone line, no more, the negotiations have just taken a flight to Delhi.         
	Ambassador Saurabh Kumar, The Telegraph was told, is in back-to-back meetings running on to the weekend. Much the same with his deputy Anup Mudgal. So the embassy really hadnt time for probably the only Indian in Vienna who might have been seeking it today. But it is more likely there is an unstated bar at the moment on them seeing journalists.         
	They are not short on offering unsolicited consolations, though. The Indians are recommending the vaunted Tutenkhamen exhibition that has just opened in the southern wing of the magnificent Hofburg Imperial Palace. The Austrians at the IAEA are urging a treat of, what else, Schnitzel Wien and Sacher torte in the timeless beer halls of Karlsplatz.         
	Engaging ideas, both, on a day there was no opportunity to trouble pen or notebook. But neither would give you the remotest sense why Vienna will have played a role if the worlds largest democracy goes prematurely to the polls.         
	But there are clues to the seriousness and determination with which the Manmohan Singh government is pursuing the safeguards negotiations with the IAEA and, consequently the 123 Agreement with Washington.         
	They dont end with the off-limits boards that have been erected at every possible information gateway, in Vienna or in New Delhi. Neither is Ronen Sens eleventh-hour extension as envoy to Washington the most revealing of the governments game plan on the future of the nuclear deal.         
	Perhaps equally telling is the arrival in Vienna barely two months ago of Saurabh Kumar as Indian ambassador. He almost immediately became a core member of the Indian negotiating team and is believed to have played a key role in ironing the creases and nudging talks with the IAEA to speedy conclusion.         
	Kumar is known to be a man with deep personal and professional commitment to the nuclear energy sector, and may have been handpicked for the Vienna job at a politically and diplomatically critical juncture in the negotiations.         
	A gold medallist in Physics from Delhi University, Kumar has earlier served as deputy chief of Indias permanent mission at the IAEA. One of his better-known works is an exhaustive advocacy of nuclear energy titled Nuclear Energy as Mahayana of International Cooperation: A World Waiting to be Born.         
	At the time he was appointed a key negotiator with the IAEA, the Left sat consoled with the impression that the government will take an honourable exit out of the deal by citing delays or failure with the IAEA safeguards negotiations. The decision to send Kumar to Vienna probably indicates the government was working to plans and deadlines inimical to its Left allies.         
	Over to New Delhi, which is where the negotiations, quite really, are.                    SANKARSHAN THAKUR IN VIENNA

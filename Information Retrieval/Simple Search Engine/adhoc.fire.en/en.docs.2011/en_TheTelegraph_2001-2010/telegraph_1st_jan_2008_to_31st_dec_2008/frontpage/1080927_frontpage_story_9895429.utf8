          OUR BUREAU                                                
	Calcutta, Sept. 26: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has bypassed the Forward Bloc and ordered an agri-marketing committee to issue a key licence to German wholesaler Metro Cash amp; Carry within four days, taking by far the most aggressive investor-friendly stride in his career and risking a revolt within the Left Front in the middle of the Singur crisis.        
	An enraged Bloc, the second-largest partner in the front after the CPM and the unquestioned master of the farm marketing system in the state, decided to keep its four ministers away from Writers Buildings.        
	Asked if the ministers would resign, Forward Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh said: We are opposed to the renewal of licence of Metro Cash amp; Carry because it will affect poor farmers. If the directive concerning the renewal of licence is not withdrawn, our ministers will resign.         
	The chief ministers decision came a day after the German envoy in Calcutta cited the Metro case to warn of dire consequences for investments in Bengal if the licence was not renewed. Metro officials had also met the chief minister this week after a public statement that the company was evaluating all options.        
	The licence allows companies to buy farm produce directly from farmers. Indian laws allow 100 per cent foreign investment in wholesale projects such as the Metro store off EM Bypass.        
	On a day all eyes were peeled on the Singur crisis, the chief minister set in motion a stunning series of events by using his discretionary powers to direct the secretary of the South 24-Parganas Regulated Market Committee to renew or issue the licence to the German wholesaler by September 30 positively.        
	The directive was issued to the secretary, a gazetted officer attached to the Bloc-controlled committee, by the chief secretary through the district magistrate. Copies of the letter have been forwarded to Metro and the secretary of the state agricultural marketing department. Bhattacharjee, under pressure to re-establish the industrialisation credentials of the state after the Singur controversy, invoked special powers rarely activated  veterans claimed the last to use them was Siddhartha Shankar Ray  to issue the directive.        
	A rule of business of the government  25(4)(b) in para III  confers special powers on the chief minister that allow him to overrule a ministerial order.        
	Since the marketing committee secretary is a government official, he will have to comply with the directive, sources said. The secretary of the South 24-Parganas committee, to whom the directive has been issued, is Rabin Haldar.        
	If the chief minister wanted to blunt the Singur curse and burnish Bengals image, he seems to have reaped some dividends by taking on the Bloc, rather than Mamata Banerjee. Whatever bad name Bengal had earned from Singur will be undone by this action of the chief minister, Venugopal Dhoot, the chairman of Videocon Group, said.        
	The Bloc leadership tonight convened an emergency meeting of its state secretariat. Our party secretariat decided that no minister would attend office from Monday as a mark of protest, Ghosh said.         
	The Bloc and the CPM were scheduled to discuss the issue on Sunday. But the chief minister appears to have decided to act after feelers to the Bloc were rebuffed.        
	Metro, which has already invested Rs 140 crore in the wholesale store in Calcutta and plans to put in another Rs 420 crore, was issued the licence by the agri-marketing committee in 2005. The licence was subsequently renewed twice in 2006 and 2007 with validity till March 2008. However, in June 2007, the licence was withdrawn, which The Telegraph first reported.        
	The marketing committee cited halt to construction which the company was compelled to do because of a stay related to a dispute between the government and the former landowners.         
	Metro said the board had stated that the company could apply again for the licence as soon as construction resumed. When the court stay was revoked, the company approached the licensing authority in November 2007, December 2007 and in March 2008.        
	But the licence was not renewed, clouding Metros plans to open the store by this Puja season  two days away. Metro officials were not available for comment after the chief ministers directive but the store can open within weeks of getting the licence.        
	The store can sell other goods without the committees licence but food and allied products are expected to account for 45 per cent of the wholesale business.

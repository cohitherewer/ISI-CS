     UTTAM DUTTA AND ANASUYA BASU
                    
	Singur/New Delhi, Jan. 10: Two places, one emotion.
    
	Villagers who sold their land for Tata Motors Singur plant sat before TV sets and watched the Nano unveiled in Delhi with excitement today, many of them saying they would buy the car.
    
	Most of those who thronged Delhis Pragati Maidan to watch the miracle of a Rs 1-lakh car  some having come from places as far away as Guwahati or Andhra Pradesh  felt the same.
    
	Homoeopath Barun Barui, 50, watched the unveiling from his home at Beraberi, Singur, about 45km from Calcutta. His mind went back to September 2006, when he became one of the first residents to give up land, receiving Rs 21 lakh for his seven bighas.
    
	As I watched the car, I became very emotional. I want to buy the first one that rolls out of the factory, he said.
    
	Barun has two more reasons to be happy: cousin Himangshu, 28, has got a job at the factory and left for Pune for training while nephew Shankar, 23, has also been promised a job.
    
	Kripasindhu Saha, 48, got Rs 3 lakh for his one bigha but bagged contracts to supply building material. 
    
	I am very happy that the car has finally been made. I am prepared to offer puja to Ratan Tata. I will buy the car, he said.
    
	Some said selling their land changed their lives. Homemaker Sabita Mal, 30, said the Rs 9.5 lakh she and her husband, who was a farmer, received had given them financial security.
    
	Besides, I and 19 other housewives have set up a catering agency to supply lunch to officials at the factory site. We now have a steady income as well as enough money in the bank for our old age, she said.
    
	Some, like Tapan Koley of Bajemelia and Mayarani Koley of Gopalnagar, however, were crestfallen. They had opposed the acquisition and held on to their land.
    
	Today is a black day. We did not watch the unveiling of the car on TV. The factory has snatched plots from many villagers who were dependent on their land, said Tapan, 28, a farmer.
    
	At Hall 11 in Delhis Pragati Maidan, where the Nano sat on a podium guarded by its creators, the crowd included professionals, entrepreneurs, retired citizens, NRIs, investment consultants, auto dealers, army jawans, college kids  people from all walks of life.
    
	For Delhi chartered accountant S.C. Mullick, 48, who drives a Baleno, the Nano is a lovely post-retirement car.
    
	Given its price and low maintenance cost, I think I will buy it after I retire.
    
	But for Sikh Regiment soldier Balwinder Singh, 32, of Bhatinda, its a car of our level, perfect for his family of four, including his wife and two young daughters.
    
	A large team of Tata Motors dealers made sure they had a thorough look-over to answer customer queries back home.
    
	The experts were not fully impressed. The tall and wiry Johnk Benno, a Volkswagen employee who had flown down from Germany, was disappointed with the cars look.
    
	The proportions are a little awry. Its too tall given its length. Indians dont need so much space above their heads.
    
	Hari Tash, an NRI who works for a US auto company, was impressed by the price and looks but not the safety features. The car has very few rush zones (parts designed to bend or crush in a collision).
    
	While Tata dreamt of putting the scooterist inside the Nano, its cool hip look might just make it the second car for the middle classes.
    
	Biswajit Basu, a PSU employee living in Delhi, said: At last, my wifes dream of a second car seems a reality.

          EMMA THELWELL                            Bizarre                                  
	London, Sept. 5: Microsoft has kicked off its long-awaited $300 million advertising campaign featuring the unlikely comedy duo of the software giants geeky founder Bill Gates and deadpan sitcom star Jerry Seinfeld.        
	The bizarre Bill and Jerry show  which is aimed at boosting the image of Microsofts Windows Vista system, and hitting back at Apples popular Im a Mac, Im a PC ads  has been met with a baffled response.        
	The advert  which shows Seinfeld helping Gates pick out a pair of shoes in a discount shoe store  has nothing to do with software, Microsoft has readily admitted.         
	The new campaign has been criticised across the globe, with the Silicon Valley blog Valleywag deeming it nonsensical with loopy narrative touches.         
	Microsoft said the odd-ball randomness of the advert is classic Seinfeld, but pointed out that it is the first and most visible sign of an ambitious effort by Microsofts Windows business to reconnect with consumers around the world.

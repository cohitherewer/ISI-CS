          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 4: Keventer, which has shoe-horned Reliances entry into Bengals retail sector, has decided to approach the courts tomorrow after the state marketing board chairman today termed its move illegal.        
	The company will seek protection against possible violence at the three Reliance Fresh stores opened on Friday, where it is selling imported fruits from its own Keventer Fresh counters.        
	Two upcoming Reliance stores were vandalised last year, allegedly by Forward Bloc and Trinamul Congress activists, forcing the company to put off its Bengal launch.        
	We will approach Calcutta High Court for adequate protection to carry out business, said Keventers counsel Debanjan Mandal.        
	Earlier this morning, Naren Chatterjee, chairman of the Bloc-controlled state marketing board, had called a news conference to claim Keventers farm products business was illegal. They do not have the licence. This is illegal. The board will write to agri-marketing minister Mortaza Hossain to take action, he said.        
	Chatterjee, however, appeared to tone down his attack in the evening after Mandal and Keventer chairman M.K. Jalan challenged his claim.        
	Mandal asserted that Keventer had a valid licence and Jalan said from Delhi: I will give him (Chatterjee) 10 days to prove what he said. If he cant, I will take legal action against him.        
	Under the pact with Reliance, still waiting for the licence, Keventer is to sell fruits and vegetables at the newly opened stores while Reliance sells other stuff such as cosmetics.        
	After Jalans challenge, Chatterjee told The Telegraph: Reliance has got no licence but Im not too sure about Keventer. I have told the regulated market committee of North 24-Parganas to check.        
	In the morning, he had said all retail chains selling fruits and vegetables were doing so illegally, without a licence. Asked why no action had been taken, he had replied: Its the governments responsibility to close them.        
	Keventer said it got its licence in 2004 and last year renewed it till 2010. The licence allows the company to buy and sell farm products in North 24-Parganas where it has a processing centre, at Barasat.        
	Keventer, however, argued that a licence is necessary only if one buys or sells wholesale and not retail. It said big retailers need a licence because they must buy wholesale. This means, it argued, that as long as it bought farm products from North 24-Parganas, it could sell them anywhere.

          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                            Shibu Soren comes out of 10 Janpath after meeting Sonia Gandhi. Telegraph picture                                  
	Ranchi, July 20: After days of suspense, JMM chief Shibu Soren today finally declared he would support the UPA in the trust vote.        
	Soren, according to sources, has been assured of a cabinet berth and three ministerial berths for his MPs. But he hasnt yet given up hope of getting the Jharkhand crown. He is even, sources said, eyeing the deputy chief ministers post for one of his sons.        
	The members of chief minister Madhu Kodas cabinet are apprehending that one of them might have to make room for Sorens son, as the state cannot have more than 12 ministers.         
	One of the two deputy chief ministers, Sudhir Mahto, is from the JMM. The other, Stephen Marandi, is an Independent leading a pressure group of three ministers  Bandhu Tirkey, Bhanu Pratap Sahi and Joba Manjhi. Against this backdrop, rural development minister Anosh Ekka or his urban development counterpart Hari Narayan Rai, both accused of encouraging corruption, might be axed.        
	Koda and all his cabinet colleagues, barring welfare minister Joba Manjhi, have been camping in Delhi for the last four days apparently to safeguard their berths even as the Independent ministers claimed that Sorens demand for his son was to blackmail Koda and keep him under a leash.         
	None of his three sons is a legislator and the state already has two deputy chief ministers, they reasoned.         
	But a state minister camping in New Delhi said: Let us see what happens after July 22. The elements of the deal are not yet final.         
	Lest it seems Soren was only interested in personal gains, he put forth an election manifesto of various demands in Delhi and got the Congress to at least take a sympathetic look at it.         
	In a 13-point charter of demands submitted to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi as well as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Soren wanted the Centre to create Greater Jharkhand by including three districts each of Orissa and Bengal. He has sought a package of Rs 5,000 crore to fight extremism and Rs 500 crore to fight floods in Sahebganj. The JMM has also demanded shifting of the headquarters of DVC and CIL to Jharkhand from Bengal.

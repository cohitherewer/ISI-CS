The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Race begins for lone berth
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Race begins for lone berth
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Aug. 22: Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi today triggered a rat race among the ruling legislators to secure a ministerial berth by announcing a reshuffle of his council of ministers within a fortnight.         
	The much-awaited announcement sparked hectic backroom lobbying by the aspirants as well as those already in his cabinet to either retain their berths or secure important portfolios.         
	As you all know, a seat is vacant in my ministry. I will be filling it up soon and effecting a minor reshuffle within the next 10 to 15 days, Gogoi told journalists.         
	The berth fell vacant with the axing of former education minister Ripun Bora after he was arrested by the CBI for trying to bribe an official to influence the outcome of a murder case.         
	The ceiling on ministerial berths in the state after downsizing of the government is 19. After Boras exit, the strength of Gogois ministry is 18.         
	Though Gogoi has distributed the education portfolio among three ministers, there has been constant pressure on him to fill up the vacant slot.         
	Those in the race include first time MLA and president of the PCCs frontal organisations  Bhupen Bora of Bihpuria and parliamentary secretary Dildar Rezza of Baghbar constituency.         
	Rezza was in the reckoning for the ministerial job because a section of the Congress think tank believes that it would be to soothe minority sentiments which have become strained of late because of alleged harassment of some people of the community in the name of detecting foreigners.         
	But Bora has the edge because after Ripun Bora he is the lone representative of caste-Assamese in the Congress Legislature Party from the north bank.         
	According to the Congress sources, apart from filling the vacant slot, Gogoi was also under pressure to effect a minor reshuffle of his government by replacing non-performing ministers with new faces.         
	While the heads of Khorsing Engti, D.P. Goala, Pranab Gogoi and Nurzamal Sarkar are on the chopping block, the new recommended faces are Sarat Borkotoki, Ajit Singh and Bidya Singh Englang.         
	The party has sent a list to the chief minister who will take a decision in consultation with the high command, a Congress leader said.

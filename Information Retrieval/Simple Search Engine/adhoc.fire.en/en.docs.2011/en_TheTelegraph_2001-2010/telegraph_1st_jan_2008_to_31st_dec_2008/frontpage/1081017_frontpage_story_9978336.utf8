          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Oct. 16: Chhattisgarh police have cracked down on senior officers refusing to take up assignments in Naxalite-hit areas of the state.         
	In two separate orders issued by the state police headquarters, 18 police officers were placed under suspension after they failed to join their new postings in rebel pockets, a police spokesperson said today.        
	The officers include four deputy superintendents of police, six inspectors and eight sub-inspectors. The four deputy superintendents include S.L. Maravi, D.S. Negi, R.D. Mourya and Rajesh Kukreja. The officers were transferred to Bastar, the worst rebel-hit among all district areas, a month ago. But, they did not report for duty, citing several excuses, police sources said.         
	The state government on October 10 revised the transfer order of Rajesh Kukreja and posted him in Bhilai.         
	But, even Kukreja could not escape from the stringent action taken by the police headquarters.        
	This is the first time when the Chhattisgarh police headquarters has suspended four officers of the rank of deputy superintendent in one go for administrative lapses.         
	A senior police officer said such strict action could continue for others.        
	Many police officers give health excuses to evade posting in red areas, he said, adding that they were verifying all cases before taking adequate action.

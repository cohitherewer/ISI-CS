          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Mar 7: India is attempting to plug a leak of women scientists out of research streams despite successful studies and regain some of the lost talent through a new package of incentives likely to finalised over the weekend.         
	Women scientists with children below three years of age may be offered flexible working hours and the opportunity to work out of their homes, under a new initiative from the department of science and technology (DST), sources told The Telegraph.         
	The department will provide loans to such women to buy computers and work from home, the sources said. The initiatives are likely to apply to women scientists working in research institutions under the DST located across India.         
	The sources said the ministry of science and technology is expected to disclose the package at some point during a two-day conference of women in science to be inaugurated by President Pratibha Patil here tomorrow  International Womens Day.         
	The initiative caps a two-year effort by a government task force to examine issues relating to women in science and prescribe policies to promote the practice of science by Indian women.         
	We now have a green signal for action, a source said.         
	One survey indicated that while 37 per cent of PhD scholars in the sciences in India are women, the proportion of women scientists in research institutions or faculty is on average below 20 per cent.         
	We have a major leak of women exiting science after their post-doctoral research. Many never come back, said Vineeta Bal, a scientist at the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi.         
	This is a dropout phase, and it coincides with marriage and child-bearing age, said Bal, a task force member.         
	Scientists estimate it costs the government at least Rs five lakh to support a PhD student.         
	When a promising young woman scientist goes away  its not just her personal loss, its a national loss, Bal told The Telegraph.         
	At the NII itself, about 50 per cent of PhD students are women, but women make up only 25 per cent of its faculty.         
	Across research institutions, women make up on average 20 per cent of faculty or researchers. The task force has asked the government to work towards increasing this proportion to 30 per cent.         
	Were not asking for reservations, said Mahtab Bamji, chairperson of the task force, formerly with the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad. Only affirmative action, infrastructure and policies to reduce the burden on women due to dual responsibilities  those at the workplace and those at home, she said.         
	The DST may also establish on-campus residential quarters in scientific institutions with more than 20 women scientists on its staff. Not all institutions today have campus accommodation. All institutions will also have creches with appropriate infrastructure and staff, the sources said.         
	Under the new initiative, the DST is also likely to offer grants of Rs 10 lakh a year for a period of five years to young women scientists selected by the Indian National Science Academy, sources said.

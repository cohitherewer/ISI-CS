          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Raj, Amitabh                          
	Mumbai, Sept. 8: Raj Thackeray today threatened to stop the release of films by Amitabh Bachchan and his family and boycott products they endorse, prompting party workers to tear off posters of The Last Lear and Drona.        
	The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief was angered by a remark from Jaya Bachchan, whom he abused as a buddhi (old woman) without brains.        
	Yesterday, at the music launch for Goldie Behls Drona which stars Abhishek Bachchan, Jaya had said she preferred to speak Hindi since she was from Uttar Pradesh, and that Maharashtrians should forgive her.        
	It shows that guddi (little girl, a take on the actresss film by that name) has turned into a buddhi, but she has no brains. This is an insult to the Marathi people, Raj said.        
	Unless Jaya apologised, he added, his party would not allow any film featuring any of the Bachchans to release. Hoardings and advertisements of products they endorse will be blackened. Even if she apologises Marathis should boycott the products, he said.        
	MNS workers tore posters of Rituparno Ghoshs Amitabh-starrer The Last Lear, due to release next Friday, in Mumbai and Drona, to release next month, in Nashik. Amitabhs effigies were burnt in Amravati.        
	The two films distributors were not available for comment. Pahlaj Nihalani, representing film and TV producers, said: No political party can stop a film from releasing. Its the state governments responsibility to ensure safe release and the safety of producers and crew.        
	However, other parties too criticised Jaya. Im sure even Amitabh Bachchan will not like his wifes statement, said Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut.

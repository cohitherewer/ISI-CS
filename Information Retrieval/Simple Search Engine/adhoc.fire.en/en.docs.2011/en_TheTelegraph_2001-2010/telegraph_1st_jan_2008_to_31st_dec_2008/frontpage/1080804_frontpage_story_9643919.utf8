The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | When the lunch digests, babus cant shut eyes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   When the lunch digests, babus cant shut eyes
  - Union education ministry asks officials to stay vigilant during break to prevent theft of office gadgets          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: Till now, the only thing in office government babus needed to guard jealously was their tiffin boxes. And that too only until the arrival of lunch hour, the eagerly anticipated free time to chomp, chat or doze.        
	No longer. The human resource development ministry has read the riot act to its officials after a string of thefts of toner powder and cartridges of printers and photocopiers, other computer accessories and telephone handsets from its offices.        
	The babus must now keep a sharp eye on all equipment not only throughout the working hours but also during the lunch break.        
	Which means they can still chew on a leisurely meal, but squeezing in a siesta or hopping across the corridor to meet friends in other rooms is definitely out. On pain of a rap on the knuckles or even a fine.        
	Officers/staff should not leave their rooms unattended even during lunch hour, the ministry directive says.        
	Predictably, it has left the babus sulking at the additional work trespassing into their favourite hour. The lunch hour, the only time we are spared the tension of work, will no longer be a time to relax, a section officer rued.        
	The July 8 circular, titled tightening of security arrangements, says those holding ranks of section officer or above are personally responsible for the security of equipment in their rooms.         
	The loss of any of these equipment, including toners and cartridges used in these systems, due to any reason will be tantamount to a loss to the department due to negligence on their part, it adds.        
	Usually, officials held accountable by the ministry for any loss are not made to reimburse the government financially. But that practice too may go for a toss.        
	A series of thefts from a particular officials room will not be tolerated, and action can be taken. This may include deducting a part of his salary, an official from the ministrys administration wing said.        
	He explained that merely locking the empty offices during lunch hour would not be enough, since the helpers hired to carry files or maintain accessories often have access to the room keys.        
	The ministry circular goes on to say: An inventory of expensive items/equipment kept in the section/room is to be maintained by all sections/units, etc, which may be periodically verified with reference to the availability of such items.        
	The circular technically covers IAS officers too. But except for the computers, most of the equipment and accessories in the offices are operated by junior staff.        
	There are enough escape clauses in the circular for us if something goes missing. But the junior officials may suffer, a senior bureaucrat in the ministry said, adding his sympathies are with them.        
	Absolutely. We are the ones who will suffer, a section officer agreed.

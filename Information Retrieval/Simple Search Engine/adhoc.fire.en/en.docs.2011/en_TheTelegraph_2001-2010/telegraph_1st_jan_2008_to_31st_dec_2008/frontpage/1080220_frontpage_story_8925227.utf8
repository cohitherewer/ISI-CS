The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Friendly IPL bids in the air 
                                                                                                           Friendly IPL bids in the air

	Mumbai, Feb. 19: Tomorrows forecast for cricketers: it will be raining money but it may not pour.        
	At the Indian Premier League player auction, the bids for even the biggest stars may fall short of spectacular because of a pact among some team owners, an IPL source said.        
	This is a war of titans. Top industrialists and Bollywood stars are involved. If two parties set their hearts on a particular player, the price tag can go up anywhere. To prevent this, a sort of understanding has been reached between some franchisees on the teams of their choice. In general, there will be friendly bidding, the official said.        
	Another league source added: With the floor price of a team set at $3.3 million and capped at $5 million, a fair playing ground has already been ensured. If the franchisees come to a further understanding among themselves to keep the spends low, there is not much the IPL can do.        
	Team owners believe they have reason to be cautious.        
	Many of the stars are retired or close to retirement. Putting too much money on them is a gamble in the long run, said an official of GMR Holdings, owner of the Delhi team, with the three-year contract period in mind.        
	Despite being retired, Glen McGrath, Shane Warne and Stephen Fleming are expected to command some of the best price tags, though.        
	Another category, called marquee players, will be hot. It includes the likes of Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Chris Gayle.        
	None of the teams expects to break even before 2-3 years; so everyone is cautious about the spends. It does not affect the IPL, which has already made its money from the team auctions. Those likely to be short-changed are the players, one of the officials said.        
	The player contracts are divided into two categories. Under a basic contract, a player gets the entire sum for which he is sold off at the auction; under a firm contract, he gets the reserve price with the rest going to the IPL.        
	Calcutta team icon Sourav Ganguly met franchisee Shah Rukh Khan at the actors home here today, presumably to plan for the auction.        
	A team can buy up to eight foreigners but not play more than four together. Cricket Australia has said not more than two Australians can be in the same playing XI, so the team owners must look at other foreigners whose appeal may not match the Aussies.        
	IPL chairman Lalit Modi does not agree that team owners may be concerned about the returns from the league. The league was modelled to finance the teams. You got a billion dollars coming in and out of that, $800-900 million will go to the franchises over a 10-year period through ticket sales, sponsorships and broadcast revenues, he told news agencies.        
	League bosses claim that some industrialists are offering $130 million for a team but nobody is selling because they are sitting on cash cows.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, June 30: Two back-to-back blasts rudely brought the Tarun Gogoi government back to earth after six days of euphoria triggered by the ceasefire call by two companies of Ulfas most deadly battalion.         
	After two blasts yesterday in Baksa and Nagaon districts that left five persons dead and over 70 injured, another bomb explosion rocked Diphu town in Karbi Anglong today. The blast was triggered inside the district agriculture office around 1.30pm today but no one was injured.         
	The government, wary of lowering its guard in the wake of the ceasefire call, quickly put security forces on high alert mostly in central and lower Assam  the new target areas  controlled by Ulfas 27 and 709 battalions which are yet to respond to the truce call by the Upper Assam-based 28 battalion.         
	We hope the others will see the futility of this going-nowhere armed struggle and return to the mainstream but we will not lower our guard to give them a free run. We have put our security personnel on high alert, an official said today.         
	That Dispur would not be a mute witness to the ongoing bloodshed despite the truce called by the Alpha and Charlie companies of the 28 battalion was clear from Tarun Gogois reaction to the violence which has claimed seven lives and left 90 injured since June 26.         
	I strongly condemn such acts of cowardice. Ulfa has once again started killing innocents and the unarmed. Is Ulfa or Paresh Barua serving the interests of the people of Assam or the ISI? He (Barua) is fighting from Bangladesh with help of foreign forces inimical to the interests of Assam. Assam is part and parcel of India and will remain so, the chief minister said.         
	Gogoi also asked the AGP and writer Mamoni Raisom Goswami to clarify their stand on sovereignty. They are saying that discussions should be held on sovereignty as sought by Ulfa. I want them to spell out their stand on the issue or they should not insist on discussing sovereignty with Ulfa, he said.         
	Though Gogoi today welcomed the initiative of the two companies of Ulfa for peace, he declined to spell out the governments stand on the unilateral ceasefire. I have not received anything formally. First we will have to see the contents and then we will spell out our stand. But overall it is a good step and others should also join the mainstream.         
	Explaining the governments position, an official associated with the Unified Command said Dispur would not rush into declaring a ceasefire with any group unless it got everything in black and white.         
	There cannot be room for ambiguity. The government has clearly stated its policy  deposit arms, live in designated camps, no extortion and talks will be within the framework of the Constitution. Those willing to sit for talks have to accept and adhere to these points. On our part, we will do everything possible to help them lead a normal life, the official said.

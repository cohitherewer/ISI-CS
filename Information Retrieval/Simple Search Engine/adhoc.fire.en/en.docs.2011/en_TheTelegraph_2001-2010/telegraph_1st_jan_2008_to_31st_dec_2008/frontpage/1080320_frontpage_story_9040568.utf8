The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Centre settles scores with Bengal job data
                                                                                                           Centre settles scores with Bengal job data
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                                        
	New Delhi, March 19: The Congress-led Centre has revealed figures the Left would rather hide: Bengal could provide each rural household only 18 days of work on average so far this financial year against a target of 100.        
	Together with another Left-ruled state  Kerala  Bengal has emerged among the worst performers under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the UPAs welfare trophy that the communists like to claim as their own.        
	The dismal performance, despite a year-end rally, in itself is not surprising but the manner in which the information has been disclosed suggests the Centre will not lose any opportunity to make the Left blush.        
	The numbers were made public in a media release issued by the Union rural development ministry on Saturday. But the bland statement stood out for one reason: it gave the break-up related only to Bengal.         
	No other state, including Congress-ruled Maharashtra whose position is worse than that of Bengal, was mentioned. Government websites provide the full data but they are not usually updated fast.         
	Sources later said Kerala made up the bottom of the list, offering only nine days of work. Maharashtra was second from bottom, with 14 days a household. Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have fared better than Bengal.         
	The seeds of the selective disclosure might lie in a trip made by a Left MP last year to the constituency of a senior minister in the Manmohan Singh government. The MP returned to the capital and wrote a stinging letter to the minister on the implementation of the job scheme in his seat.        
	With the Left and the government locked in a tussle over the nuclear deal and the Prime Minister reportedly rewriting the rules of engagement with the outside supporters, the minister has fired from the shoulder of a sister ministry to settle the scores, the sources said.        
	Out of the Rs 1,235 crore allotted for the programme for 2007-08, Bengal had spent only Rs 688 crore till February 15, the rural development ministry has revealed. As much as 44 per cent of the funds remain unspent.        
	In 2006-07, Bengal had spent around 59 per cent of the funds allotted.        
	The Left, which claims that the rural job scheme is the result of its policy intervention, would find the figures embarrassing.         
	The figures look better than they did in November, though. A Planning Commission note had revealed that Bengal had spent only about Rs 264 crore during April-November 2007. The improvement could be because the state has been transferring funds from the worst-performing districts to those that have spent more.        
	According to the rural development ministry, there was demand for work from 40,45,887 households in Bengal. Of these, 39,84,711 got work.         
	Activist Anuradha Talwar of the Right to Food Network said Bengal was just not interested in the scheme. She rubbished the states excuse that there was no demand.         
	In the month of February 2008 alone, more than 3,800 households in South 24-Parganas applied for employment under the scheme. Only 1,600 got it. And this when February is supposed to be a better month for employment since it is just before harvest, she said.        
	If the state fails to provide employment to a household, it is expected to give the applicant a subsistence allowance. Talwar said Bengal had failed to do so in most cases.         
	Citing the example of South 24-Parganas again, she said 4,373 people had applied for unemployment allowance and only seven had got it. That too after activists and unions had intervened.

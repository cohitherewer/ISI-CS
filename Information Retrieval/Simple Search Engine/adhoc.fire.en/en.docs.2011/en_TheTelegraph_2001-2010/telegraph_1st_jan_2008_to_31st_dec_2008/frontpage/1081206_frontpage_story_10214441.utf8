	Agartala, Dec. 5: Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar today gave wings to his states IT dreams, asserting that it was ready for a smooth take-off in an era of information technology.        
	Tripura is ready for a smooth take-off as far as investment in the IT sector is concerned. You can begin in a small way with medium or small projects and then proceed; we will act as the facilitator, Sarkar told the countrys top IT bosses at NICT 2008 today.         
	The daylong Northeast Information and Communication Technology conference is the biggest IT meet of the region, held in the state for the first time.        
	Sarkar was speaking during the Tripura CMs Interactive session this afternoon at the Pragna Bhaban, which hosted the conclave, organised by The Telegraph.        
	The chief minister, who inaugurated a web portal, www.itcareerslive.com, claimed not to have much knowledge on IT but described it as the most sophisticated and modern manifestation of technology.        
	We have already achieved more than 80 per cent literacy which will reach 100 per cent in a few years. We have also built a sound infrastructure for quality education because human resource is the sheet anchor for growth and development of IT sector, the chief minister said.        
	He also batted for improved relations with Bangladesh for higher volumes of trade and commerce.         
	Later, the chief minister replied to queries from the audience in an interactive session, clarifying his governments policies and complications over land.        
	Earlier, four state ministers, Anil Sarkar, Tapan Chakraborty, Manik Dey and Jiten Chowdhury, inaugurated the conference by lighting the ceremonial lamp.         
	D.D. Purkayastha, the managing director and CEO of ABP Pvt. Ltd and chairman of the organising committee, NICT 2008, Tripura in his welcome address, declared the state as the logical choice because of its high literacy rate and abundance of skilled manpower.        
	Describing the conference as the largest gathering of IT professionals and policymakers, Purkayastha said, The conference is an integral part of our efforts to drive the IT movement in the region as well as to live up to our motto  Enabling the Northeast .        
	Jiten Chowdhury, minister for forest and industries, hailed NICT 2008 as an epoch-making event and highlighted the natural advantages enjoyed by Tripura, required for emerging as an IT hub.        
	In his speech, power minister Manik Dey asserted that the state was on course to emerge as a power hub in the Northeast. Uninterrupted power supply will be guaranteed and with upcoming projects launched by the ONGC and Neepco, we will be power-surplus and in a position to sell power to other states.         
	Health minister Tapan Chakraborty said acting upon the IT policy-2000, the state government has made considerable progress in e-governance. Our government offices are also being networked and Agartala City Area Network has been set up to link different offices here.        
	Anil Sarkar, the minister for higher education, focussed mainly on the backwardness of the region and the state and held successive central governments responsible for it.        
	Captains of IT industry and state government officials spoke during the theme session titled Enabling the Northeast, a panel discussion on Building an Ecosystem for Sustaining a Constant Flow of Skilled Workforce and another session titled Leveraging ICT for Improving Healthcare.

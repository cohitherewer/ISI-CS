 - Judge dismisses circumstantial evidence as inadequate 
   OUR CORRESPONDENT
   
	Cuttack, Jan. 9: Orissa High Court today waived a death sentence ordered by a trial court, by dismissing the circumstantial evidence as inadequate and acquitted a man of charges of beating his wife to death.
 
	Six months ago, the Malkangiri additional sessions judge court had decided that the witness statements against Sunadhar Khilla, who had allegedly kicked and punched his wife to death, proved his guilt in the murder of his wife in 2002. Khilla was sentenced to death by hanging. 
 
	Today a bench of Justices Laxmikanta Mohapatra and Bimal Prasad Das gave their verdict on the sentence and acquitted Khilla, concluding that circumstantial evidence alone cannot be sustained for conviction, said Khillas counsel Gourishankar Pani, while talking to The Telegraph. Some 10 people had given evidence.
 
	The operative part of the order was announced today. A copy of the full judgment, however, has not been issued so far, said Pani. 
 
	Khilla (40) was jailed for five years and five months for the murder of his wife Gurubari Khilla (30). Since the advocate generals office gave no indication of pursuing the case further, Khilla would be released as soon as the trial court judge receives and signs the order. 
 
	Tribal couple Sunadhar and Gurubari Khilla lived in Manyamkonda under Motu police station in Malkangiri. Reports stated that on the evening of August 22, 2002, the two allegedly quarrelled over who should cook the meals for the night. Later, Gurubari went to sleep without cooking. Subsequently, an angry Sunadhar kicked and boxed her on the stomach till she started bleeding. Eventually, she died on the spot, the report added. The village sabha took up the incident and decided to hand over Sunadhar to police. 
 
	Malkangiri additional sessions judge Sukumar Sahu convicted Sunadhar on June 23, 2007, taking cognisance of the circumstantial evidence and statements of 10 witnesses, and awarded him death.
 
	The high court, however, observed that there were loopholes in the investigation and the prosecutions case was weak. While the statement of the investigating officer was not recorded, statement of the doctor, who had conducted the post-mortem, had even been glossed over, the high court observed.

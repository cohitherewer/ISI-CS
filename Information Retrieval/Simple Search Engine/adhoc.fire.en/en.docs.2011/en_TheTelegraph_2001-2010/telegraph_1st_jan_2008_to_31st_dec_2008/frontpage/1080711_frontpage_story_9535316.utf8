          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                               
	New Delhi, July 10: In the week gone, it has become apparent that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his chief political point man and external affairs minister, Pranab Mukherjee, havent been on the same page over the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	The swift turn of events last week would suggest that the Prime Minister has chosen to keep Mukherjee in the dark about when and how he planned to fast-track the deal in order to jump domestic obstacles and meet international deadlines.        
	Twice over the last few days, Mukherjee has been left red-faced with embarrassment by the Prime Ministers establishment, buttressing speculation in political circles that there exists a trust gap between Singh and his seniormost cabinet colleague.        
	Barely hours after the external affairs minister had sent out an invite  triple-wrapped and embossed with a secrecy seal  to Left leaders for a final meeting on the deal, Manmohan Singh consigned it to irrelevance by announcing, mid-air to Hokkaido, that his government would be going to the IAEA very soon. Mukherjees invitation went into the bin along with the UPA-Left alliance.        
	Late last night, once again, Mukherjee had reason to feel upstaged by events that he seemed to have no part in. The decision to circulate the nuclear safeguards agreement to IAEA board members  a turning point in operationalising the deal, as IAEA spokesperson Melissa Fleming put it  flew like a rap in the face of Mukherjees emphatic undertaking that the government would face a trust vote before going to the IAEA.        
	Congress media managers went into overdrive today playing down suggestions of any discord or misunderstanding between the two over how the nuclear deal was being piloted, but their explanations appeared to weigh light; the burden of instances that suggest the contrary is considerable.        
	As one Congress leader put it: Pranab Mukherjee was picked to negotiate with the Left because of his experience, knowledge of precedence and proven record of backroom political negotiation but that does not mean he enjoyed the trust of the Prime Minister. The sense we get is that he trusted him less and less and eventually cut him off from what was happening on the deal, he may not have been aware the government had decided to send the draft agreement to the IAEA board.        
	The corridors of South Block  office to both the Prime Minister and the external affairs minister  have long buzzed with tales, plain and embellished, of antagonism between the two. Its roots are not far to seek. Mukherjee is Singhs senior by far and may think it unfair that he wasnt given the top job by Sonia Gandhi.        
	But then, Sonia herself is believed to nurse a deep trust deficiency where Mukherjee is concerned; that goes back to the day of Indira Gandhis assassination in October 1984. Rajiv Gandhi was led to believe that Mukherjee had claimed succession as seniormost minister in the cabinet.        
	Often, in the early months of Singhs premiership, Mukherjee (and Arjun Singh, the other senior chafing under the grievance of being denied) tried to dominate their Prime Minister, especially in political matters. But Sonia is never known to have played along with or even encouraged such classically Congress intrigue.        
	Sources close to the Prime Minister have been hinting for a while at Singhs displeasure with the manner in which Mukherjee was steering the UPA-Left talks. There are those that credit Mukherjee with adroitly stringing along the Left for close to a year, but clearly the Prime Minister is not among them.        
	In fact, in what could indicate his dwindling faith in Mukherjee, he is believed to have insisted towards the end that defence minister A.K. Antony accompany Mukherjee to all UPA-Left committee meetings.        
	In particular, the Prime Minister is believed to have been unhappy with three things: that Mukherjee stated, several times, that if the deal couldnt be pursed if the government was reduced to a minority; that he did not espouse the deals salience with the Left; and, as was evident from his remark after the last UPA-Left meeting on the eve of the Prime Ministers departure for the G8 summit, he did not proceed with any urgency.        
	He was often behaving like an independent broker between the government and the Left and not like the governments chief interlocutor is how one official source put it last fortnight. He appeared happy just dragging his feet. That is what forced the Prime Minister to put his foot down and ask the party for a clear resolution before he departed for the G8 summit.        
	That is probably also the time the Prime Minister decided to shut his external affairs minister out on key moves that unshackled the deal from the domestic mire and put it in international orbit.        
	In stating that Mukherjees position in the government had become untenable, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan may only have voiced what his Prime Minister may have desperately been hinting at these past days.

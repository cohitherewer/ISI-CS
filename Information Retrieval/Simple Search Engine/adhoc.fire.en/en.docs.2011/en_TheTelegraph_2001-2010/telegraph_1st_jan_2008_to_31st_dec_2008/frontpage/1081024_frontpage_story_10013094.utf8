  - VICTIMS TO BE EXAMINED BY AIIMS DOCTORS          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Mangaldoi, Oct. 23: The two rape victims identified three CRPF jawans during an identification parade at the Rowta police outpost in Udalguri district last night.         
	Udalguri superintendent of police A.K. Tiwari said the three jawans as well as the persons who claimed to have witnessed the crime were being interrogated.         
	The Udalguri district administration yesterday assured a womens forum that the guilty would be arrested by noon today. To that, Tiwari said action was being taken.        
	Altogether eight CRPF personnel were detained in connection with the alleged rape of two middle-aged women at Bhalukmari village under Rowta police outpost in Udalguri district.         
	However, a medical examination conducted at Mangaldoi Civil Hospital ruled out any recent sexual act though both the victims claimed that they were raped by the CRPF personnel.         
	While one woman was allegedly raped when she had gone out to fetch her goat from a paddy field, the other was raped inside her house after her husband was forced out at gunpoint by the jawans.         
	Government spokesman Himanta Biswa Sarma this evening said the Centre has cleared the state governments request to get the alleged rape victims of Rowta examined by doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). We have been informed by Delhi that experts from AIIMS would be reaching Mangaldoi by Saturday to examine the alleged victims, Sarma said.         
	Karendra Basumatary, Bodoland Peoples Front MLA from Majbat, today said he would move the National Human Rights Commission not only over the rape issue but also take up the death of a pregnant woman in a relief camp at Doipharm Lal Bahadur Shastri High School.         
	Basumatary demanded that the CRPF camp at Rowtabagan be shifted immediately since the people of the area have lost confidence in the paramilitary force after the incident.         
	Highway bandh: Six vehicles were damaged when All Koch Rajbongshi Students Union activists threw stones on National Highway 52 in the Banglagarh area in Darrang district early this morning. The stones injured four persons, labourers of a mobile theatre party, who were travelling in a truck.         
	Schools and business establishments were closed while attendance at government offices was minimal. Security forces provided escorts to vehicles plying on the highway. The All Assam Minority Students Union blamed the government for the attack on a family at Rowtabagan yesterday.         
	The injured have been admitted to Mangaldoi Civil Hospital. Tiwari denied any such attack took place.         
	The unions Darrang unit president, Ainuddian Ahmed, said Bilaluddin Ahmeds house was attacked in the presence of security forces. It is very unfortunate.

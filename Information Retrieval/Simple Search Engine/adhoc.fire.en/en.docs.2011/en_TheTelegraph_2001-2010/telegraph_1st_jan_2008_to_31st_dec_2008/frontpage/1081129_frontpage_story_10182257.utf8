  - Terror rats tease with steady burst           SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 28: These are mountain rats possessed with Rambo resilience that Mumbai  and verily the nation  is up against.        
	For three nights now, they have tormented, and embarrassed, a combined Indian offensive, and riveted the worlds focus on the horrific theatre they have made of the Gateway of India piazza.        
	Twenty-four hours after the army had declared the Taj clean and cleared, deadly menace was still at large in the gutted maze, teasing his harried adversary with alarming aplomb  crossing corridors, jumping floors, changing embattlements, weaving rings round army platoons, NSG commandos and all their assorted comrades in arms.        
	The embarrassing daylong stand-off at the Taj left the twin successes at the Oberoi-Trident complex and Nariman House stained. Theyd got the gunmen holding down the two locations as the afternoon progressed  killing all four terrorists, though not before they had killed a mounting count currently at 36  but at the Taj, the heart of this stunning raid, closure was dogged by all manner of confusion.        
	For a start, nobody even seemed sure how many gunmen there were inside: One? Two? More? Nobody had so much as a firm hint. Resounding, and regular, gun and grenade fire from within mocked at the armys claims that they had taken out the terrorists all day today.        
	The only real clues we had seemed to have come from the raiders themselves  that they had enough staying power and ammunition and that they had neither been taken out, nor immobilised through injury. They also seemed to reveal a wicked sense of humour; every time the securitymen thought they had the terrorists cornered, they fell silent, let them exhaust their fire and then sounded a diabolical all well rat-a-tat from some other corner or floor of the depths.         
	The frustrating cat-and-mouse probably ensured that two of the Tajs much-vaunted first floor facilities  the Crystal Ball Room and Wasabi, the fashionable Japanese restaurant  were left ravaged. Wasabi, according to unconfirmed accounts, was the scene of a heavy exchange of fire around dusk and was in flames. The Crystal Room suffered worse.        
	Probably acting on instinct, NSG commandos began pounding the Ball Room with rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) late afternoon  they sent off a dozen in all from two directions, the first salvo fired at a little past four. Half of them missed their mark and merely powdered the Tajs ornate faade. The ones that blew through the windows seemed not to have anything other than the dcor. Puffs of smoke and then silence. And then, mocking bursts from inside saying they were still alive and firing.         
	As dusk fell, and the prospect of another long night vigil stared at the securitymen, more grim news emerged from within  bodies of those killed in the unrelieved mayhem that troops had managed to extricate. It wasnt clear how many bodies they managed to evacuate, nor was anybody offering a firm figure of how many the Tajs tragedy has already claimed.        
	The authorities are also lost on how many hostages there might still be inside the Taj. But yesterdays claim that they had all been taken to safety is probably just a claim.         
	Mumbai police commissioner Hasan Ghafoor made it apparent to the media this evening that he wasnt clear on how many were holed up inside. Asked about earlier claims that they had been flushed out, Ghafoor cryptically said: I do not know what was said earlier, but we do not have a clear idea how many there still are.        
	Does anybody know whats happening? asked Nikhil Sehgal, brother of journalist Sabina Sehgal Saikia, who has been stuck inside without word for close to two days now.         
	So much media, muttered a journalist from some foreign network, and no a man to give us a word of whats going on.        
	Lack of clarity --- of information and of tactic --- best described the manner of approach at the Taj, and elsewhere, today. Wild rumours floated across town in the absence of composite information and created flutters of avoidable panic.        
	The media were, at the best of times, left guessing; probably their only solace was that the men in charge were mostly guessing, too.        
	During one phase of lull in the afternoon, they brought in six truckfuls of Rapid Action Force personnel. The trucks rolled up in formation, snorted nervously for about 10 minutes, generating anticipation of a big assault about to happen, then suddenly and tamely pulled out.         
	The Gateway square was a vast media bivouac --- print and electronic journalists from across the country and the world, crouched on their bellies for most of the time for fear of taking a shrapnel hit.        
	A lot many among them lay there merely exhausted out of having been here for more than 48 hours. The concrete deck of the Gateway, cordoned off at 250 metres from the Taj with a rope, had become a vast and crowded mess of what they had consumed --- plastic bottles, crushed lunchboxes, cigarette ends.        
	Behind the crouched journalists lay their humming armoury --- OB vans, portable generators, battalions of television cameras awaiting action. And right across stood a flotilla of armoured cars, troop trucks, ambulances and fire tenders --- they stood grounded most day, awaiting action they seemed to have no clue about.        
	Several times during the day --- as late evening, long after another night of darkness had enveloped the Taj, its western rooftop still spewing smoke --- gunfire or grenade blasts seemed to erupt almost accidentally: Was there a battle happening inside? Had confrontation finally begun? Is there a sense of how many there are and where?        
	Like all times during the day, nobody seemed to know.

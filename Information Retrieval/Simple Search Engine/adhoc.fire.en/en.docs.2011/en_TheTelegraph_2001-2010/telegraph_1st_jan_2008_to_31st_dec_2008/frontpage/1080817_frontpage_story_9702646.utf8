          SARAT SARMA                               
	Nagaon, Aug. 16: Two persons were killed and several injured as police opened fire on agitated villagers who tried to dismantle a police outpost in Mailo area of Hamren subdivision of Assams Karbi Anglong district around 5.30 this evening.        
	The villagers rose in protest after an armed homeguard stopped a civil court advocate, Ram Nath Chauhan, who was on a bike, in front of Mailo outpost for a routine check.        
	Chauhan hails from Belbari village and was coming to Mailo with another youth. Chauhan said the homeguard assaulted him and dragged him into the outpost. This angered the local people who subsequently gheraoed the outpost.        
	The agitated mob pelted stones and damaged the outpost in a few minutes. They were repeatedly directed to get out of the police station. Firing was ordered only when the situation went out of control, said additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Nityananda Goswami.         
	The two dead were identified as Ram Singh Chauhan of Mailo Belbari and Joy Singh Gour, a local tractor driver. Several persons were also injured in the confusion.         
	The villagers claimed that the homeguard was drunk and had assaulted the advocate.        
	The guard beat up the civilian and fled the outpost when the public attempted to nab him. The firing took place after the villagers rushed to the outpost seeking justice, said Khapattu Chauhan, a Bhojpuri student leader of Belbari.         
	Karbi Anglong deputy commissioner Mukesh Chand Sahu said the incident originated from an altercation between the police on duty and the civilian.         
	The picture will be clear once we get a detailed investigation report. Hamren subdivisional officer (civil) Rakesh Kumar has been directed to take stock of the situation tomorrow, Sahu said over telephone. No inquiry has been ordered so far.         
	This is the second such incident of alleged public harassment during a police check-up triggering a fatal mishap, sources said.         
	On July 1, police assaulted Morigaon district senior CPM leader Manoj Deka during a routine check. Deka was admitted at GNRC Hospitals in a critical condition, but died on July 4.         
	Ashok Chakra        
	NF Railway general manager Ashutosh Swami said on Friday that they had recommended the name of N.N. Bora, a railwayman who lost his life on duty during the militant attack on May 15 in the Lumding-Badarpur hill section, for the Ashok Chakra, the highest civilian award.        
	Ulfa rebel injured: One suspected Ulfa rebel was critically injured in an encounter with police at Azara in Guwahati on Saturday.         
	The militant, who is yet to be identified, has been admitted to the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital.

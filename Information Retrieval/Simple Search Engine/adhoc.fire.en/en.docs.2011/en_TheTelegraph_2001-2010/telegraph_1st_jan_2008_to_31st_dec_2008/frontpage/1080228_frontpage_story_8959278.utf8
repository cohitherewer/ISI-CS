The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Reed-thin rap for Hayden weed curse
                                                                                                           Reed-thin rap for Hayden weed curse
                                  
	Sydney, Feb. 27 (Agencies): Matthew Hayden was let off with a warning after he called Harbhajan Singh an obnoxious little weed.        
	The batsman, who was yesterday named Australias best one-day player for the past 12 months, had faced the possibility of a ban or a fine but escaped after saying his comments were not intended to be offensive.        
	I maintain my innocence, my intentions were never to denigrate cricket or anyone, Hayden said after a three-hour hearing in Melbourne found him guilty of breaching Cricket Australias code for publicly denigrating an opponent.        
	But the umpire has made his decision... and in the spirit of cricket, I respect and accept the decision.        
	Harbhajan hadnt been as lucky. Accused of calling Andrew Symonds a monkey last month  a charge he denied  the bowler was labelled a racist and handed a three-match ban. The racism charge and the suspension were dropped on appeal, but he had to pay a fine.         
	The charges against 36-year-old Hayden were laid after India lodged a formal complaint over his comments on Radio Brisbane, which included a challenge for teenage fast bowler Ishant Sharma to join him in the boxing ring.        
	Harbhajan today said he didnt want to get into a slanging match with Hayden and put his comments down to frustration.         
	Maybe they realise they no longer are the undisputed champions of the world. Maybe they feel the crown is slipping, he said. Otherwise, why would a cricket veteran ask a 19-year-old to join him in a ring?        
	The BCCI refused to comment on the hearing. That is CAs internal matter, secretary Niranjan Shah said.

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI AND ANANYA SENGUPTA                            The usual Sunday crowd gives India Gate a miss. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: Initial investigations into the Delhi chain blasts have thrown up a pattern similar to those that rocked Ahmedabad, Surat and Jaipur recently, cops in the capital said today.        
	Police sources said the nature of the blasts appeared similar as 1kg ammonium nitrate, gunpowder and light-emitting diodes had been used to make each bomb. Timer devices were also common, as confirmed by one recovered from Connaught Place, they said.        
	Two special teams of Delhi police have left for Gujarat and Rajasthan to explore the connection. The teams will try to piece together Saturdays blasts with the help of data gleaned from the earlier terror strikes.        
	The sources said the Delhi team planned to question Gujarat blasts mastermind Abdul Bashir, who has apparently confessed to visiting Delhi in recent months.        
	Common factor        
	One name  Tauqir alias Abdul Suban Qureshi  has cropped up in connection with the blasts in all three states, the cops said.        
	Tauqir was possibly Simis pointman tasked with setting off blasts and may have sent the email before yesterdays explosions, they said. Similar emails sent before the Ahmedabad and Jaipur blasts have also been attributed to him.        
	A software engineer who was associated with a big IT company but quit to devote time to religious activities, he is apparently a master bomb-maker who has passed his skills on to his colleagues.        
	The sources said he was allegedly a member of the Indian Mujahideen, a front of the Lashkar-Simi combine, and had been absconding from his Mumbai home since 2001. The police in four states  Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat  are looking for him.        
	Balloon boy        
	A 12-year-old boy who sells balloons on Barakhamba Road could provide vital clues to the identity of the Central Park terrorists, the sources said.        
	The boy has claimed that he saw two bearded men in black pyjama-kurta stuffing a black polythene packet inside a dustbin. They left minutes before the blast in a three-wheeler, he said.        
	The boy, whose mother is dead and father has deserted him, was today summoned by the police to help draw sketches of the suspects. Another father-and-son pair who sell junk food on Barakhamba Road was also sent for.        
	CCTV damper        
	Although the cops claimed they were close to cracking the case, sources said no fresh leads had emerged from closed-circuit television footage recovered from the Greater Kailash market. No footage could be found at the Karol Bagh blast site.        
	The police have, however, identified the owner of the cycle used in the Greater Kailash blast, the sources said. They have also got clues to the identity of the Gaffar Market bombers and are questioning an auto-driver who may have ferried the suspects from Paharganj to Patel Nagar.        
	The police today trawled slums and criminal hideouts in Delhi to sniff out suspects. Ten persons were apparently detained in overnight raids.        
	A spokesperson for Delhi police said several people had been rounded up. But he gave no details.        
	Official experience        
	Home minister Shivraj Patil chaired a high-level meeting today, after which home secretary Madhukar Gupta said a list of dos and donts on internal security would be drawn up and shared with every state and Union territory.        
	With every blast, we are gaining experience, Gupta told reporters. We have been observing that these kinds (of blasts) are happening in cities across (the country). In each incident you learn, gain experiences.        
	The comment initially raised eyebrows and some dubbed it insensitive but officials clarified that Gupta was speaking in the context of gaining experience to beef up security and put in place preventive measures.        
	More brainstorming        
	More top-level meetings were held, one by the police and the other by the Intelligence Bureau.        
	Delhi police commissioner Y.S. Dadwal said the possibility of making market areas pedestrian zones would be explored and a master security plan chalked up in three months.         
	Delhis lieutenant governor, who met police officials, stressed on alternate parking arrangements in such areas.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Plant stays shut at Singur 
          The Tatas have not resumed work at the Singur plant today. No employee of Tata Motors or any of its vendors entered the Singur factory today. A press release issued by the company said that it was distressed by the limited clarity of the deal. The Telegraph had already reported this morning that work was unlikely to resume until the Tatas went through the fine print of the deal and clarified all points.  The company's press release said that the group would review its position in the plant for the low-cost Nano car, where work was suspended last week, only if it was confident that the viability of the project was not impinged. It is apparent that Tata Motors has decided to harden its stand and let the politicians hammer out all the details before taking any decision on whether to pull out of Singur or not.  On Sunday, in a marathon meeting, West Bengal Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi had mediated a pact between the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the State Government over the disputed farmland acquired for the project. After the meeting, both Trinamool and the State Government had claimed that all issues were resolved. The State Government was to set up a committee to look into the affected farmer's demand, and report within seven days. Till the report, the construction of the ancillary units would be on hold.   Trinamool Congress leaders said that the Tatas decision not to resume work was not anything because of Trinamool but an internal problem of the Tatas.

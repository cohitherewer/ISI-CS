The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bihar Cong banks on Lalu, Rahul far away
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bihar Cong banks on Lalu, Rahul far away
          NALIN VERMA                            Not quite the prince                                  
	Patna, July 6: Rahul Gandhi may be winning hearts in Madhya Pradesh, but Bihar is a different ball game altogether.        
	It seems that the young leader has lost his space in Bihar, though Mulayam Singh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party (SP) has decided to back Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the nuclear deal, said a senior Congress leader.        
	The leaders remark is based on the fact that Rahul vociferously campaigned against SP in the last Assembly polls, but he failed to make much impression, that led to Mulayam describing him as a child in politics.        
	Given the present scenario of the faction-ridden Congress in Bihar, railway minister Lalu Prasad seems a more probable candidate to work in tandem with Mulayam and regain control over Yadavs and Muslims.         
	Our party has no option than playing a second fiddle to Lalu Prasad, said a Congress leader, adding it was too late for the Congress in the state.         
	He pointed out that the Congress should have disassociated itself from Lalu Prasad long ago. But the boat and the boatman cannot be changed mid-stream. One has to bank on Lalu Prasad who is UPAs boatman in Bihar, he added.        
	Lalu Prasad, on his part, made it obvious during RJDs two-day national executive party meet as to who he would like to join to spearhead UPAs campaign. The RJD boss was fulsome in his praise of Mulayam for choosing the nuclear deal over L.K. Advani.         
	But he did not mention Rahul Gandhi or for that matter any Congress leader  even once.         
	We (Samajwadi Party and RJD) will work together in the Hindi heartland to smother Advanis ambition of becoming the Prime Minister, he said.Bihar Congress, led by Sadanand Singh, who had invited Rahul Gandhi to visit the state after he became the general secretary, stands gripped in the worst ever bout of infighting.         
	A majority of Sadanands colleagues are demanding his removal, while the high command has just turned indifferent to the issue. Sadanand recently dropped Bihar Congress committee spokesman Premchand Mishra from his team. Then the AICC reinstated Premchand on the plea that the BPCC president had dropped the spokesman without the prior permission from the central body.         
	Party leader Umakant Singh openly demanded Sadanands replacement at a party meeting recently. Senior party leader and former BPCC treasurer Gajanand Shani alias Munna Shahi admitted that the Congresss situation would not change even if the BPCC president was changed.         
	Its too late for the party to take corrective measures, Shahi said, adding: The Congress cannot emerge stronger until it disassociates from Lalu and Mulayam.        
	The dilemma is also that the virtually non-existent Congress has three seats in the Lok Sabha and can ill-afford to think of life without Lalu Prasad and Mulayam in the run-up to the polls.

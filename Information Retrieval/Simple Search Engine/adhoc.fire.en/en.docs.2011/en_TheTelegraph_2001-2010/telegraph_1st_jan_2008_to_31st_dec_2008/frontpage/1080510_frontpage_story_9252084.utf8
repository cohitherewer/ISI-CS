	Calcutta: Always a gracious winner, the Kolkata Knight Riders owner Shah Rukh Khan, headed towards the Bangalore Royal Challengers dressing room at the Eden.        
	That was around 1.25am on Friday.        
	Shah Rukh knocked to offer much needed commiserations, but only found a couple of rather startled attendants feasting on the leftovers.        
	Lets chat here, Shah Rukh told The Telegraph and, about an hour after his team had won the battle on the field, he took control of the Royal Challengers dressing room.        
	A complete victory, really.         
	For the next 20-odd minutes, Shah Rukh (accompanied by son Aryan, who could turn out to be an amazing footballer) spoke about the Knight Riders having put a stop to their losing run in the Indian Premier League (IPL).        
	It was past 1.45am when Shah Rukh finished and, on the way out, picked up a banana. Of course, he didnt forget to ask guys, anybody else interested?        
	The following are excerpts from the one-on-one:              
	His top emotion after the five-run win over the (Vijay Mallya-owned) Royal Challengers        
	More than feeling relieved, Im feeling bad that the boys suffered four defeats on the trot.... We couldve had four wins instead of three in the first seven matches. Im feeling bad because weve had our run of ill luck. Chris Gayle got injured and couldnt play a single match. Then, we shouldve had Shoaib Akhtar from the start. These things havent helped. Were clear about not playing somebody for gains in the short term and getting him injured in the process. Its sad that what was planned by John (Buchanan, coach), Jeet (Banerjee, associate) and Joy (Bhattacharjya, team director), by way of fielding players, didnt work out. Its the run of bad luck which cost us one of the matches. Probably the one against the Mumbai Indians or the one versus Kings XI Punjab.                
	Whether the four defeats left him depressed        
	Not depressed, Im never depressed. But, yes, I did feel bad for the boys. I treat them as my kids and my response had been the way Id respond if my kids (Aryan, Suhana) didnt win a race or something.               
	Having been rather restrained during the match, except towards the end        
	(Grins) I was indeed very tired, yaar. Id been shooting for my TV show till 6.30 in the morning (Thursday). I then took one of the earlier flights because I wanted to spend some time with the team. At this point, believe me, Im absolutely exhausted.        
	The thrust of his interaction with the Sourav Gangulys        
	It wasnt a pep talk. Dont think I can give that. I dont have a role in the planning, thats taken care of by John and (assistant coach) Matthew Mott. The Knight Riders support staff is just fantastic. If I said anything to the players in the early days, it wouldve seemed as if the owner in me was speaking. Today, that stage has passed and when I say anything now, its as if Im talking like a team member. One needs time to come together. Initially, they mustve been suspicious of me. Wary of me. Ive won their trust by actually being a part of the team. I wish I could practise with them as well. Hopefully, Ill be able to do that next year. I want the wins as much as the players themselves and, like them, dont want the losses. An owner of a team would like a win for different reasons, but my reasons are the same as theirs. Im happy that Ive been able to win the teams confidence. My wife (Gauri) has been able to win that confidence too. (Co-owners) Juhi and Jay (Mehta) have been able to win that confidence as well.         
	The message he gave his team        
	That we should play like our first match and play it like our last match. To show the world and ourselves that we could take a hit and still get up and hit back. My father used to say the opposition wants to win as much as you do, so dont think youre the only one fighting. The opponents, too, fight. I believe the one who can take the harder hit is the one who is stronger. Weve taken the hardest hit and its time to come back stronger.        
	His one-on-one with Shoaib        
	I told him to do something to the opposition. He said hell do just that! Shoaib also promised me that even if he plays two matches in this years IPL, everybody would remember those matches. He needs to acclimatise and needs to be fully fit.         
	Whether hed been confident about the team defending 129         
	The experts said it was a good score, but the experts have been saying a lot of things a lot of times. I dont think this (Twenty20) game has anything to do with the experts, this game is run by passion. Defending or not defending that score was a different matter, but I liked the body language when the boys started the second session. Id seen them the same way in Bangalore (during the April 18 IPL opener). Unfortunately, the Royal Challengers had to face the worst times both times! I say unfortunate because I love Rahul (Dravid) and Anil (Kumble) and the others. Ive known them for years, done Pepsi shoots together. Im good friends with them and theyve come home. (After a pause) Even if we hadnt won, the body language suggested the coming together of heart and soul. The mind had been together, we needed the heart and soul to be together (after four defeats on the trot).         
	MoM Souravs spell (3-0-7-1)        
	It was awesome. Players like him need to be given breathing space. If he doesnt do well in one match then the question is what are you doing about Ganguly?. You cant write off players like Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav and some others whose names Ive missed out. Also, we shouldnt be praising one performance of theirs. After all, theyre expected to perform Theyre meant to win matches Its not about winning or losing as much as it is about the desire to play together and trying to get results. It may not happen this year, but next year. However, Id like this team to be remembered for its ideology. Thats important.         
	At the half-way stage in the IPL, the marks hed give the Knight Riders on a scale of 10        
	Well win this championship. I wake up in the morning thinking Im the best, when I know Im not. Im not the best, but I still believe that I am. If I dont believe that, then I dont even become good enough. I think the team wakes up with the thought that it can win the championship. Inshallah, it will. If we dont, we may not have been good enough on a particular day. May not have had the right breaks. But weve got to wake up with that belief. Right now, I do believe the Knight Riders will win the championship.         
	Regularly sending text messages to his players        
	(Laughs) I think Ive got SMS diarrhoea. Some probably dont understand the messages, but how else do I explain things to 18 and 19-year-olds. Ive lived life a little more than them. Ive lost in life, but have gained a lot too. My experience will probably sound a bit alien to an 18-year-old. So, I send Rudyard Kiplings verses. I send them Abraham Lincolns prayer for one of his sons. I send them some of the things my father used to tell me. I want to pass on to my kids what my father would tell me.         
	Having had to scrap the stage performance hed planned for Thursday        
	Look, Im through with trying to put up a show (on a match day). Ill come down to the Eden Gardens one day, after getting everybodys permission, and put up a show. It wont happen in this IPL because there are restrictions on time for the kind of show I want to put up. Only between 6.55 and 7.05 pm or only during the break.         
	Whether the King of Good Times, Mallya, had congratulated him        
	 Were friends outside the IPL. He was a very good host when we played in Bangalore and Ill be speaking to him.        
	Finally, if the Trinamul demonstrators actually had a word with him when they blocked his Eden-headed convoy        
	No. People can make claims, and they keep doing so, but nobody spoke to me.

  - Tongues wag after author shows up for film with athlete-turned-model          AMIT ROY                             Rushdie with Mullins at the premiere                                         
	London, April 13: Salman Rushdie has a new novel and apparently a new girlfriend as well.        
	The 60-year-old author, who spilt up from his fourth wife, Padma Lakshmi, 37, last year, was photographed recently at a film premiere party in Manhattan with Aimee Mullins, 32, a Paralympics athlete-turned-model.        
	There was no reference to Rushdies new historical romance, The Enchantress of Florence, in the New York Posts coverage of the post-premiere party of the Norah Jones-starrer, My Blueberry Nights, at the Soho Grand Hotel.         
	It merely recorded that Salman Rushdie showed up with gorgeous Aimee Mullins on his arm and was overheard saying that if he could vote in the US, hed vote for Barack Obama.         
	Aimee, who has been called an upmarket version of Heather Mills, Paul McCartneys temperamental ex-wife, is the daughter of a working-class Irish immigrant to the US.        
	According to the Daily Mail, which deployed no fewer than four reporters on uncovering the nitty-gritty of Rushdies alleged new romance, Aimee was born without any shin bones and her legs had to be amputated below the knee on her first birthday.         
	Like Mills, Aimee has overcome her handicap to make a career as a model.        
	For most of her life, she wore cheap, unsightly and clumsy artificial stumps yet she became a champion athlete and long jumper, setting world records at the 1996 Paralympics in the 100 metres, the 200 metres and the long jump, the Mail pointed out.         
	Aimee and Mills have met but there the resemblance ends, according to the Mail. It quoted one of Aimees friends as saying: Unlike Heather, Aimee has never been attracted to money. She doesnt have a manipulative bone in her. She has principles. Meaning Mills doesnt  which is the view taken by most of the British media.         
	Apart from Padma (2004-2007), he has been through three previous wives  Clarissa Luard (1976 to 1987), with whom he had a son, Zafar; Marianne Wiggins (1988-1993); and Elizabeth West (1997-2004), with whom he had a son, Milan.         
	Of all his women, Rushdie appeared keenest on Padma, who told him she wanted to separate by email.        
	Rushdie has not commented publicly on the split but speaking to TV therapist Pamela Stephenson  Scottish comedian Billy Connollys wife  for an episode of Shrink Rap, a TV programme, he confided: I have just come out of a very painful period, the end of a marriage that I did not want to end.         
	He told TatlerRushdie has not commented publicly on the split but speaking to TV therapist Pamela Stephenson  Scottish comedian Billy Connollys wife  for an episode of Shrink Rap, a TV programme, he confided: I have just come out of a very painful period, the end of a marriage that I did not want to end.         
	He told Tatler magazine that he was in an interregnum between wives.        
	Evidence that Rushdie and Aimee are an item is, as yet, a little circumstantial. According to an unidentified guest at the Manhattan party, Aimee said were good friends, we are close friends. They certainly looked like they were on a date. They arrived together, left together and were being touchy-feely. Salman would take her arm as they walked around the room and when he was talking to people, shed wait a step behind him. She said theyd been to another movie earlier that day and theyd been drinking together since the afternoon. Weve been hanging out together for the day. Im a little drunk, and were tired, she said.

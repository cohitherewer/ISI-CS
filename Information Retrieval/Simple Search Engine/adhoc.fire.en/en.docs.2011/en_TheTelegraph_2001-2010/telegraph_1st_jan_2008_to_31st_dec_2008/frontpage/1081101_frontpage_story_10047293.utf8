          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Manji in Jaipur on Friday. (AP)                                  
	Jaipur, Oct 31: Japanese baby Manji Yamada, born to an Indian surrogate mother, has been given a one-year visa to go to her native country.         
	Manji will be accompanied by grandmother Emiko, who has weathered three months of legal and diplomatic storms to get the little girl home. But the 70-year-old doesnt hold a grudge against India.        
	Except for the lengthy and tiresome legal tussles, I would definitely want my granddaughter to come back to India, her place of birth, and meet Indian people and get to know its rich and vibrant culture and its peoples welcoming and friendly nature, she said.        
	Kamal Vijayvargia, a friend of the family at whose house Manji has been staying, hopes the girl will now be able to stay in Japan. The Japanese embassy has issued Manji a one-year visa dated October 27, which we received yesterday. It is likely to be extended once Manji settles in Japan.        
	Emiko and Manji will take an Air India flight to Tokyo tomorrow.

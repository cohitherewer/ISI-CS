The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamata land feeler to lady
                                                                                                           Mamata land feeler to lady
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata                                  
	Calcutta, April 2: Mamata Banerjee today said she was willing to meet Lolita Lekha nee Majumdar, whose land has been grabbed by a club linked to Trinamul Congress supporters, and hear all her problems if she approaches me.        
	So far as I have gathered from party sources, the land on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road belongs to a local club and we have nothing to do with it, the Trinamul leader said. But, if she approaches me, I shall try my best to address her problem as I do in several other cases.        
	However, Lolitas lawyer Dolla Adhikari said tonight that they could not meet Mamata despite several attempts earlier. We have tried at least five times in the past to meet Mamata Banerjee but her secretary was unable to provide an appointment. Whenever we called, we were told that Mamata Banerjee was not available. But my client would be very happy to meet her if she agrees to give an audience, Adhikari said.        
	Mamata said she could not believe that a leader like Saugata Roy, an MLA of the party, had dismissed the lady on the plea that she is not our voter when she had gone to him for help.        
	We dont distinguish between them and us as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had done while justifying the armed recapture of Nandigram by CPM cadres. Unlike the CPM, we dont do petty politics. We always stand by those who are distressed and tortured. So, it is unbecoming of any of our party MLAs and functionaries to say that we wont help a person in distress simply because he or she is not our voter, she said.        
	The Trinamul chief said she had checked with Roy if he had said what had been attributed to him in todays edition of The Telegraph.         
	He denied having said so. I believe such an irresponsible statement from a senior party leader, if he said so, would definitely send a wrong message to our rank and file, Mamata said.         
	Contacted, Roy said he had explained to Mamata that he meant the woman was not a voter at all. I didnt say that she was not our voter, he said. What I meant was that she was not a voter in this country at all.        
	Lawyer Adhikari described Lolita, who shuttles between Calcutta and Mexico, as an NRI. Unlike Roy, neither the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, which has recognised her as the legal owner of the seven cottahs, nor the Alipore court, which asked police to ensure she can build a boundary wall without hindrance, made voting power a condition to uphold the law.        
	Last evening, The Telegraph had called back Roy and read out the comments attributed to him to reconfirm whether he stood by them. Roy did not raise any objection then.        
	Mamata said she would enquire how party MLA Arup Biswas got involved in club politics. Trinamul does not run the club. I will probe how Arup got involved.

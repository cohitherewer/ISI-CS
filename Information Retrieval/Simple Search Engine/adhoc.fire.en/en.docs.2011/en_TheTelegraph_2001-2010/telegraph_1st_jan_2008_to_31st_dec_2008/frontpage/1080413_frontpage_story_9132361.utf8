	Calcutta, April 12: The Mullickghat market fire has halted flower export from the city, with government horticulture specialists saying the world market will miss the scent of Bengals rajanigandha.        
	No flower consignment flew out of Calcutta airport today, a week before the spring flower rush in the global market, and Mullickghat sources said it would take about seven days for normal business to resume.        
	Theres a heavy demand for Bengals rajanigandhas (tuberoses) in the worlds biggest flower auction markets, such as Aalsmeer, Auckland and Dubai. Kenya is our only rival in exporting the flower, a senior official of the West Bengal State Food Processing and Horticulture Development Corporation said.        
	Last nights blaze, which destroyed 240 of the 263 stalls in eastern Indias biggest flower market, forced many export agents to cancel bookings today and others to make last-ditch efforts to procure flowers from other states.        
	During the peak season, cargo planes fly out of the city with about one tonne flowers a day. Market sources said export from Bengal had picked up in the past few years with a rise in demand for its rajanigandhas, goldenrods, chrysanthemums and gerberas.        
	We had a 250kg consignment booked for Amsterdam on Tuesdays freighter, but the agent cancelled it today, said Amin Khan, manager (eastern India), Singapore Airlines cargo. The airline has a 200kg booking on Wednesday, for Auckland, but it looks uncertain.        
	The agent told us he is unable to procure cut flowers from Mullickghat. He is trying to get some from Bangalore so he doesnt lose goodwill at the auction market, Khan said.        
	Airline sources said the cancellation of a 200-250kg consignment causes a carrier a loss of Rs 60,000-70,000.        
	Emirates, too, fears cancellations. Agents email us or send text messages every day to book space for flower consignments. Today we did not receive a single query or request, an official of the airline said.        
	The main season for flowers starts next week and big consignments are scheduled to be sent to Dubai, Auckland, Amsterdam and other places. We are worried.        
	Restoration work is on at Mullickghat and we hope to bring things back to normal in a week, the horticulture official said. The state food processing and horticulture development corporation, which manages the Mullickghat market, is the biggest exporter of flowers from Bengal.        
	Most of the flowers are taken from Mullickghat and the rest from nurseries and farmers, the official said.        
	Although flowers are produced every day, the processing and packaging done at the market is crucial for export, he explained.        
	For instance, a rajanigandha must have a 80-100cm stalk if it is to be exported because the flower is mainly kept in vases worldwide. The right kind of flowers, answering all specifications, are sorted out and packaged at the market before being sent to the airport.        
	Airport authorities recently installed a Rs 7-crore cold storage unit to store flowers among other perishable goods.        
	Not a single flower consignment came today, an official said at the airports international cargo division.

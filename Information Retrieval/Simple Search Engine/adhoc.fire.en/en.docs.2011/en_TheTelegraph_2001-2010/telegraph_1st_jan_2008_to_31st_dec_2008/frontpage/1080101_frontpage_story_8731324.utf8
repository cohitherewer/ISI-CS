	New Delhi, Dec. 31: Poor quality of sleep even with no change in its duration can increase the risk of diabetes, medical researchers said today, adding fresh evidence to the link between sleep deprivation and adult diabetes.
    
	The researchers at the University of Chicago Medical Centre have found that lack of the deepest part of sleep in young, healthy adults decreases their ability to regulate blood sugar and increases the risk of type-2 diabetes. 
    
	After only three days of suppression of deep sleep  also called slow-wave sleep  the study participants displayed reduced insulin sensitivity, a state in which more insulin is needed to tackle sugar in the body, and which is sometimes an early warning sign of impending diabetes. 
    
	Over the past eight years, a number of studies have shown that reduced number of sleeping hours may raise the risk of diabetes. The new findings, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, are the first to link poor sleep quality with diabetes. 
    
	A profound decrease in slow-wave sleep had an immediate and significant adverse effect on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, said Esra Tasili, assistant professor of medicine at the university. 
    
	Scientists have long suspected that slow-wave sleep is crucial for human well-being. The demonstration that reduction in slow-wave sleep raises the risk of diabetes is significant, said Birendra Mallik, a sleep scientist at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. 
    
	Slow-wave sleep is the deepest stage of sleep when the brain is in its least active state, said Mallik, whose own research has been aimed at understanding the origins of the other stage of sleep called REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, usually associated with dreaming. 
    
	The findings raise the possibility that changes in sleep quality as humans age might be contributing to the development of diabetes. Young adults spend 80 to 100 minutes per night in slow-wave sleep, but people over age 60 generally have less than 20 minutes, Tasili said.

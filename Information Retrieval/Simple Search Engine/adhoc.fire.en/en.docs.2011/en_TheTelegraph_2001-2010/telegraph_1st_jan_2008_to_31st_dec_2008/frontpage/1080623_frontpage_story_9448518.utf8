	Bhubaneswar, June 22: Tension in villages in and around the proposed Posco plant site eased today with the arrest of 26 people held hostage since Friday for killing the first martyr in the struggle.        
	However, several villagers near Paradip in Jagatsinghpur district started observing of black week today coinciding with the completion of three years of the MoU signed between the South Korean company and the state government.        
	The area had witnessed tense situation for the past couple of days following the death of Tapan alias Dula Mandal, an anti-Posco activist, in a bomb attack by the plant supporters in Govindpur on Friday evening. The anti-Posco protesters had held 59 supporters hostage in a school building demanding arrest of the culprits on charges of murder and compensation to the kin of the victim.        
	Last night, police rescued the 59 hostages from the school and arrested 26 of them on charges of their involvement in the bomb attack leading Dulas death, Jagatsinghpur superintendent of police R.K. Sharma said.         
	Sharma said the situation in the villages remained normal, even as the anti-Posco protesters held a meeting in the area opposing the Posco plant site and protesting Fridays violence. We are keeping close watch on the situation, he added.        
	Abhay Sahu, the president of Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, the organisation which has been spearheading the anti-Posco agitation in the area since the past three years, said they would continue their struggle despite the frequent attacks by the goons, hired by Posco. The association members today reaffirmed their pledge to carry on the agitation against the Posco plant in exchange of their life, said Sahu.        
	Wearing black headbands, the protesters, including a large number of women, formed a human chain and shouted slogans against the South Korean company.         
	In Bhubaneswar, leaders of Left and Congress reiterated their opposition to the plant. CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan alleged that the government and Posco celebrated the anniversary by dipping their hands in blood and indulging in violence. He described Dula as the first martyr in anti-Posco struggle.        
	Posco signed an MoU with the government to set up a Rs 52,000-crore steel plant.

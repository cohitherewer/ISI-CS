          JESSICA SALTER                            English actress and model Kelly Brook                                  
	London, Aug. 1: Womens figures are gradually changing from a curvaceous hourglass shape to a more box-like appearance.         
	In half-a-century women have put on an average of a stone in weight and look set to put on a further 19 pounds in another fifty years.        
	And the average waist size  already up from 27.5 inches to 34 inches  has taken the brunt of this weight gain. In the future it could balloon up to 42 inches.        
	But while waists expand, busts and hips in the future would stay roughly the same size as today.        
	Marie Dahey, editor of Prima magazine, which commissioned the research, said: This is a wake-up call to all women who value their waist. If we carry on as we are the female shape will disappear completely and our lovely sexy curves will become straight up and down like a mans.        
	Its shocking that our waists are already on average seven inches fatter than our grandmothers  and were growing wider all the time. Its time to tighten our belts quite literally.        
	Curvy celebrities such as Myleene Klass, Kelly Brook and Charlotte Church are proud of their womanly figures, but the research shows their shapely assets could be a thing of the past.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            ROLE MODEL?                                  
	New Delhi, July 16: Hit them mild, hook them young.        
	Researchers from Harvard School of Public Health today reported that the tobacco industry altered menthol levels in cigarettes to create a mild experience for first-time smokers as part of attempts to hook young people.         
	The researchers who went through internal tobacco industry documents found that companies conducted studies on how sales of cigarette brands among specific groups of people could be increased by controlling menthol levels.        
	The tobacco industry has carefully manipulated menthol content not only to lure youth but also to lock in lifelong adult customers, said Howard Koh, professor and assistant dean for public health practice at the Harvard school and a co-author of a research paper published online today by the American Journal of Public Health.        
	Even low levels of menthol can mask what some first-time smokers might consider the harsh and irritating smell of cigarettes, and allow delivery of an effective dose of nicotine  the addictive substance in cigarettes.        
	The new study found the milder products were marketed to the youngest potential customers, the Harvard school said.         
	The study indicated that tobacco companies determined that milder brands with lower menthol levels appealed to younger smokers while higher menthol levels suited long-term smokers of menthol cigarettes.         
	Menthol cigarettes are also sold in India and accounts suggest they are more commonly used by new smokers.        
	A national survey in the US had shown that 44 per cent of smokers between 12 and 17, and 35 per cent between 18 and 24 used menthol brands. The figure was 30 per cent among smokers above 35.         
	This is no surprise, said K. Srinath Reddy, a cardiologist and president of the New Delhi-based Public Health Foundation of India.        
	It is consistent with earlier findings that the industry would do anything to increase the likelihood of addiction, added Reddy, who has been campaigning for stricter tobacco control laws in India.         
	The Harvard team found companies marketed milder menthol products to appeal primarily to new smokers.        
	This is another example of the cynical behaviour of the tobacco industry to hook teens to a deadly addiction, said Gregory Connolly, co-author of the study.

   Samajwadis play for 280          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                                    
	New Delhi, July 1: The Prime Minister today took the first step in public towards what could eventually lead him to the G8 summit and his government away from Prakash Karat.        
	As Manmohan Singh was heading towards Rashtrapati Bhavan apparently to brief the President about his visit next week to Japan for the summit, the capital was bristling with the heat and dust associated with old-fashioned heartland politics.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadav and his lieutenant Amar Singh met politician after politician, crunched numbers and kept adding to the chain of hints suggesting their 39 Samajwadi Party MPs could bail out the UPA government if the Left carries out its threat to pull the plug.        
	The political establishment also got a taste of the unseemly battle that lies ahead. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati said in Lucknow: All Muslims are opposed to the nuclear deal. Even then the Congress and the Samajwadi Party are reaching an agreement on it.        
	Mayavatis comment has the potential to add an ominous element into the nuclear debate and unsettle the Samajwadi rank and file as the minorities are perceived to be Mulayams bulwark in Uttar Pradesh.        
	 A CPM leader had earlier played the same minority card, but a similar comment from Mayavati carries far more punch, considering her forays in the heartland over the past few years. Mayavati also will be among those hit hard if the Samajwadis and the Congress come together in Uttar Pradesh.        
	However, a Samajwadi leader downplayed her statement. Why did her sympathy to Muslims vanish when she campaigned for Narendra Modi (in the 2002 elections)? The deal has nothing to do with Muslims or Islam, a party source said.        
	Sources said the Samajwadi chiefs main concern was to stave off an election for as long as possible since he believes that early polls would help the BJP nationally and Mayavatis BSP in Uttar Pradesh.         
	Mulayam is also said to be hoping that the strategic partnership with the Congress would bloom into a pact to fight elections together in Uttar Pradesh and other states.        
	What he mainly wants from the Congress is a guarantee that it can garner enough numbers to clear the halfway mark of 272 comfortably. The number the Samajwadi chief has in mind is 280.        
	Sources close to him explained his thinking. Mulayam fears he might be left high and dry if the Congress, after getting him to pledge his MPs, fails to rustle up the remaining seven for a majority or create a safety margin with another seven or eight.        
	Undeterred by Mulayams apprehensions, his former ally Lalu Prasad declared on TV that the Samajwadi leader was with the UPA. Asked if the Samajwadis would join the government, a source said: This comes later. Let us take the first step.        
	Sonia Gandhis aides are working on parties like the Janata Dal (Secular), Rashtriya Lok Dal, Telengana Rashtra Samiti and the National Conference to make up the shortfall. Mulayam wants an assurance that these parties would shore up the government for the rest of its tenure and not pull the plug midway.        
	Congress sources said they were equally, if not more, keen to draw such a commitment because the governments priority was to push the nuclear deal in the limited time it had.        
	The Congress is aware of the pulls and pressures it would face, different from the ones the Left subjected us to, party sources said. But its a price we have to pay.        
	Sources close to Mulayam said the July 3 meeting of the United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA), the third front-like coalition he formed last year, was now a formality.        
	On his part, Manmohan signalled he was indeed going to the G8 summit  a trip the Left will interpret as the trigger for the breach. A Rashtrapati Bhavan communique said the Prime Minister and the President discussed national and international developments for 50 minutes.

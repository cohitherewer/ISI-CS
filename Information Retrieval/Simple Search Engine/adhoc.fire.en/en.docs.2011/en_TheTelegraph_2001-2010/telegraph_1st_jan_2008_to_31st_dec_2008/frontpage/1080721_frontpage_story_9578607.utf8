  - Singer Amit Paul picked up from a Guwahati pub          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Guwahati/Shillong, July 20: Singer Amit Paul of the Indian Idol fame was picked up by police along with five others from a city pub late last night after residents of the area complained of a brawl.        
	The high-voltage Saturday night party at Kaves in Rajgarh, which went berserk on the local celebritys arrival, was cut short by the police team around 1.30am.         
	They then bundled the six to Chandmari police station.         
	Paul, who was released this morning, denied any wrong-doing, saying he had merely gone there for dinner.         
	Since I know the owner, I had gone there. When I reached the place, the youngsters present there sought my autograph and others clicked photographs. Suddenly, a brawl broke out between a few boys and the situation turned very unpleasant, he told The Telegraph this evening.        
	The owner, Kaustav Baruah, stands charged with violation of the pubs permit, which stipulates that the joint should close by midnight.        
	A case has been registered at Chandmari police station under Sections 143,323, 325, 294, 290, 114, 188 IPC, which include charges of a brawl, creating public nuisance and wrongful assembly.         
	Additional superintendent of police (city) Debojit Deori said the policemen intervened after residents informed them of the brawl, which woke up the neighbourhood.        
	When the policemen entered the pub around 1.30am, there was a drunken brawl, while around 40 to 50 boys and girls were dancing in an indecent manner. Many of the girls were indecently dressed, said a police source.                                             
	The raid sent a wave of panic among the revellers. While most fled in the melee, the police picked up six.         
	Both the police and detainees were tight-lipped about whether they were put in the lock-up.        
	Deori quoted Paul as saying he would not have come to the discotheque if I knew about the situation.        
	Paul, who reached the discotheque around 11pm, said he was waiting for the situation to normalise, when the police arrived.         
	I explained my position to the police who were very co-operative. Later in the morning, I was asked to go, said Paul, the brand ambassador of Meghalaya.         
	Ranjan Chatterjee, the Meghalaya chief secretary, said in Shillong that the state government had no information about any incident involving Paul. But we will help him anyway if he needs it, he added.        
	J.L. Das, the president of the Shillong Music Lovers Forum, which was instrumental in drumming up public support during the Indian Idol 3 contest, said: The police should not harass him if he is innocent. But of course, if he is guilty, the law should take its own course.        
	Pauls parents arrived in Guwahati this evening though the singers uncle, Pradeep Paul, said their visit had nothing to do with the incident. We are not aware of any such incident. Amit is a decent boy and he will not involve himself in anything unlawful, Pradeep said from Shillong.        
	The other youths picked up from Kaves have been identified as Kangkanjit Nath, Ranjit Phukan, Adil Haque, Najma Begum and Mayuri Sonowal, all between 20 and 30 years of age.        
	These youths were handed over to their guardians this morning, an officer said.        
	Two business establishments  Maneja Inc. and Dvantage Promotions  which are located at the same building complex that houses Kaves have also lodged separate complaints at Chandmari police station stating that unknown persons broke their window panes and caused damage to their property late last night.         
	The Kaves management decided to keep the joint closed today.         
	The owner was not available for comment.

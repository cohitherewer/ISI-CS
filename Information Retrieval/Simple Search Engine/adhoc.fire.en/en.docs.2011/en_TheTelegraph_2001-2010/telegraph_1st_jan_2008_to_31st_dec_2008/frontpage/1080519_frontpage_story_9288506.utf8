          SHASHANK SHEKHAR AMP; VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR                            Pramod Mishra is taken to court after his arrest in Dhanbad. File picture                                  
	Dhanbad/Bokaro/Hazaribagh, May 18: A huge cache of arms and ammunition was found from Jhumra hills this morning even as information of spreading red terror to five north Indian states came to the fore.        
	A joint team of the 26th CRPF battalion and Bokaro police recovered 25 detonators, 17 electronic detonators, two hand grenades, cartridges of .303 rifle ignition sets, dozens of charger clips and safety fuses, wires and other equipment from Suarkatwa on the Jhumra hills.         
	Top CRPF sources said more stuff, including a stove, foreign literature on how to attack military camps, police and military uniforms, were also found indicating that an assault on security forces may have been on the cards.         
	Maoists, the sources added, must have left the arms and ammunition after their high-level meeting convened last Thursday-Friday in the wake of Naxalite top gun Pramod Mishras arrest.        
	The commandant of the 26th battalion, V.S. Sharma, told The Telegraph over phone from Jhumra that had action been initiated earlier, more arms could have been found. CRPF has been camping in the hills for the past couple of years which became a problem for the Maoists determined to get Jhumra back.        
	In yet another development, after four days of grilling in Bokaro, Dhanbad and Ranchi, Naxalite leader Mishra was sent back by the Dhanbad police to jail custody.         
	One of the interrogating officers said on condition of anonymity that Mishra had revealed that Maoists were expanding their organisation to Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan.        
	Mishra, the officer said, added that the Maoists had expanded their influence in unprecedented measure. And         
	even if the police were to kill him, he would not spill the beans as he was a dedicated red soldier.         
	Mishra was sent to prison immediately after the police presented him at the residence of Dhanbad chief judicial magistrate Deepak Kumar this morning.         
	Still out of reach         
	Seven days after the Charhi police station officer-in-charge and a CRPF jawan was killed in a Hazaribagh forest, rebel leader Krishna Yadav still eluded the police.        
	A self-styled sub-zonal commander of Maoists, Krishna has been giving men in khaki the slip for the past few months.        
	 In September last year, the police raided Keredari village  on the border of Chatra and Hazaribagh  but failed to nab the action squad leader.        
	Even joint police teams from the two districts have so far failed to arrest Krishna, who unleashed a reign of terror in the districts by disrupting several construction projects, including railway work to link Hazaribagh with Ranchi and Koderma.         
	In January, he set ablaze a cellphone tower in Katkamsandi, also on the Chatra-Hazaribagh border.        
	Police officers, however, said they had been working on his arrest day and night.         
	We were getting information about his movements and we made lots of effort to arrest him. But it was his luck that he didnt fall into our net, said Hazaribagh deputy superintendent of police Naushad Alam.

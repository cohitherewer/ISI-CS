The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 1000-hour blockade from today
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1000-hour blockade from today
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, July 19: The All Koch Rajbongshi Students Union (Biswajit Roy faction) today rejected Dispurs initiative to form a committee that will make a strong case to secure Scheduled Tribe status for six communities of Assam.        
	It also decided to go ahead with its 1000-hour economic blockade starting at 5am tomorrow.        
	Dubbing the constitution of the three-member committee for each of the six communities as another way of delaying the communitys demand, Roy said the blockade would mainly target inter-state trucks and tourist buses.         
	Security has been beefed up along the route, sources in Dispur said.         
	The blockade will affect movement of vehicles on National Highway 31, which cuts through the Koch Rajbongshi-dominated Kokrajhar, Bongaigaon and Darrang districts. National Highway 31c, which passes through Dhubri and Bongaigaon and National Highway 37, which crosses Bongaigaon and Goalpara, are likely to be paralysed.        
	Dhubri police said they would provide armed escorts to truckers on vulnerable stretches. Since there has been no separate arrangement for tourist buses, the same escort would accompany passenger buses. Hinting that the aim of the blockade was to force the governments of Assam and Bengal to take notice of their plight, Roy said the Srirampur-Chagolia-Dhubri-Baxirhat route would be worst hit.

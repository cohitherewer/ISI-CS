          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, July 3: The state government has allocated Ankua iron ore reserves to JSW Steel Ltd, which proposes to set up a 10 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) capacity steel plant in Jharkhand.        
	A recommendation to this effect has been sent to the Centre after completing the survey work at Ankua reserve forests spread over 999.9 hectares in Saranda, West Singhbhum.        
	The estimated deposits at Ankua, sharing its boundary with Asias richest iron ore mine at Chiria, is over 200 million tonnes as confirmed by the Indian Bureau of Mines.        
	It would be enough for the Sajjan Jindal flagship company to source its requirements for 12 years from 2011 when the plant is expected to be commissioned.         
	JSW Steel Ltd chief executive officer R.P. Singh welcomed the development and said the company would now expedite work on acquiring or buying land. For a plant of 10MTPA capacity, we would require about 17MT iron ore a year. This means the reserve at Ankua would feed the proposed plant for at least 12 years. In due course, the company will apply prospecting mining lease for other ore reserves, he said.        
	State mines and geology department deputy secretary Gaurishankar Prasad told The Telegraph that the state government had sent its recommendations of Ankua for in favour of JSW Steel to the Centre.        
	Highly placed company sources said they had already submitted a mining plan of the area to the concerned divisional forest officer to initiate the process of compensatory afforestation after a clearance from the Union ministry of environment and forests.         
	The Ankua allocation to JSW Steel was the second major development within a fortnight concerning big investors in the steel sector. Recently, Arcelor Mittal, which has proposed a greenfield project of 12MTPA with an investment of Rs 40,000 crore in the Torpa-Kamdara areas in Khunti and Gumla districts, was allotted a coal block at Sregada near Latehar. But there has been no headway on land acquistion or purchase.        
	JSW Steel recently shifted its proposed plant site to Sonahatu (in Ranchi district) from the earlier proposed site at Ichhagarh-Nimdih block in Seraikela-Kharsawan district.         
	Singh said that the company would now spend over Rs 15 crore to procure CMPDILs geological report of the already allotted coal block at Rohne in North Karnpura coalfields (Ramgarh district) with expected deposits of 250MT. The geological report would form the basis of preparing a mining plan for the Centres perusal, he added.

          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 1: The construction for the proposed 6MTPA steel plant of Tata Steel in Kalinga Nagar would start in a month, its managing director B. Muthuraman said.        
	The Rs 21,000-crore project has been in limbo for more than two years after 14 tribal villagers died in a clash with police while resisting the construction of a boundary wall by the Tatas on January 2, 2006.        
	Muthuraman met chief minister Naveen Patnaik here today to discuss the project. Sources said Muthuraman had requested Naveen to provide security to facilitate resumption of construction at the site. He apparently told Naveen that all groundwork had been complete and the company was ready to start construction. But it could not be possible because of frequent law and order problems, caused by a section of displaced families. According to the sources, Naveen assured to look into the matter.        
	The construction will start in a month, a visibly happy Muthuraman told reporters after the meet. He, however, refused to answer further queries.        
	In January 2006, the tribals blocked the Daitari-Paradip expressway, considered as the lifeline for the mineral-rich Keonjhar and Jajpur districts, for more than 14 months. The blockade was lifted on March 9 last year following a high court directive. However, the construction could not be started because of resistance by a few hundred displaced families under the banner of the Visthapan Virodhi Janmanch even as 700 displaced families had been shifted to rehabilitation colonies built by Tata Steel.        
	Company sources said orders had been placed for machines worth Rs 5,500 crore and fabrication yard had already been operational. The construction of incoming material section was in advanced stage of completion. Out of 3,400 acres allotted to the company, more than 3,000 acres were registered in its name. According to the MoU signed with the government on November 17, 2004, Tata Steel was committed for allotment of 250 million tonnes of iron ore reserve for the plant.

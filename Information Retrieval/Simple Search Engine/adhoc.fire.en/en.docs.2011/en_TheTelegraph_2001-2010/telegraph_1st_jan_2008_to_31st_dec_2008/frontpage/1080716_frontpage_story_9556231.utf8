          AISLINN SIMPSON                             Madonna with Guy Ritchie                                  
	London, July 15: Madonna and husband Guy Ritchie have given themselves a year to save their marriage with the help of a five-point action plan, friends of the couple have claimed.         
	The decision is said to have followed crisis talks between the pair in New York, where Madonna is rehearsing for a world tour starting later this year.         
	Rumours of a possible divorce have been swirling ever since a report that Madonna had lined up Paul McCartneys divorce lawyer Fiona Shackleton to represent her.         
	The 49-year-old star has also been linked to the break-up of New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguezs marriage  although she insists they are just friends.        
	At the weekend, Madonna and Ritchie, 39, together with their children Rocco, 7, and Lourdes, 11, put on a show of family unity with a stroll through the New York streets and a cinema visit.         
	Friends say the couple have made a series of pledges to each other in a bid to shore up their seven-year marriage.         
	One of them is that they spend no more than a week apart at a time, and reduce their work schedules.                             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	London, June 21 (Reuters): British Airways rejected claims of racism today after supermodel Naomi Campbell, who pleaded guilty to assault in a foul-mouthed air rage incident, said she was likened to a black Golliwog doll during the flight.        
	BA said it did not accept the accusation made by Campbell, who was convicted of assault yesterday and sentenced to 200 hours of unpaid community work, that someone on the flight called her a Golliwog supermodel.        
	British Airways does not accept any allegations of racism, the airline said in a statement. We are proud of our diversity.         
	We have strict policies concerning dignity at work and have long-standing training programmes on diversity and inclusion.        
	Campbell, 38, told Sky News in an interview that her flash of air rage, in which she assaulted two police officers, swore repeatedly and screamed abuse at the captain of the Los Angeles-bound BA flight, was partly prompted by racist comments.        
	I was called a racial name on that flight and that was part of my reaction, she said. I was called a Golliwog supermodel  I dont think thats really fair, do you?        
	Asked who had used the term, which refers to a black rag doll from childrens literature, Campbell said: Someone on the flight, not the passengers.        
	During Campbells court case, prosecutors said Campbell ordered the airline captain to find her missing luggage and became violent when police tried to escort her off the aircraft.        
	The model pleaded guilty to assaulting two police officers and to a public order offence. Neither she nor her lawyers mentioned racist comments during her court case.

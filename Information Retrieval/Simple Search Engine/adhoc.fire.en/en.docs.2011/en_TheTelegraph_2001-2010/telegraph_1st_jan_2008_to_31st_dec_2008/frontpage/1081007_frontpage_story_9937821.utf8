                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Taxpayers Singur bill: 300cr
          INDRANIL GHOSH                                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 6: The price of Mamata Banerjees agitation isnt just future jobs for Bengals youth but also Rs 300 crore out of their taxpayer parents pockets.        
	Thats the sum the state government had invested in Singur to facilitate the Nano project, whose departure means its all money down the drain.        
	Nobody seems to have taken note of how Mamata has forced the taxpayer to pay a price though her mindless movement, Ashok Ghosh, the Forward Bloc state secretary, told The Telegraph. The Tatas have left, so has Mamata, but who will recover the losses?        
	Senior bureaucrats today confirmed that the losses ran to nearly Rs 300 crore (see box). A secretary said the government was now assessing how much of this it could salvage. With the Tatas out of Singur, there is no justification for the government to still have these projects in the area, he said. Well have to start mopping up things.        
	However, unlike Ratan Tata who can move his plants and machinery out, saving perhaps the bulk of his Rs 1,500-crore worth of investment, the government can neither take away the bridges and roads it has built in Singur nor undo the dredging. It may, however, abandon the Rs 50-crore power substation project on which, according to Power Development Corporation chairman Moloy De, it has already spent Rs 30 crore.        
	The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), which has spent Rs 60 crore, could shut its training centre for workers and dump the market complex project for the poorest landlosers. Building contracts have already been given out for the market complex, officials said.        
	Going by official figures, the government has spent Rs 125 crore under the first phase of a Rs 170-crore drainage scheme covering a 20sqkm area so that the Nano site wouldnt be flooded during the rains.        
	It dredged and widened several canals and built bridges, roads and culverts near the project site and planned to build several more.        
	The chief secretary is to meet departmental secretaries soon to decide what the government should do about the facilities already created or under execution.        
	The government has other worries. For instance: the Supreme Court case on the land acquisition, which could get complicated with the Tata pullout.         
	Two, the vendors forced to leave Singur could well sue the government to recover costs.        
	Three, Mamatas threat to restart the agitation after the pujas to get the unwilling farmers back their land.        
	If the Centre doesnt put pressure on the state to return the forcibly acquired plots, we shall start a movement across Bengal after the pujas, Mamata today said.

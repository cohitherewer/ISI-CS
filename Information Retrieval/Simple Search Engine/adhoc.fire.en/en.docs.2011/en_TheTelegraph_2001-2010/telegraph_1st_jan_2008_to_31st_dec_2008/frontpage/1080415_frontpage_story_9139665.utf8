  - Ammo in Americans bag          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            The Bonds and the bullets. Telegraph pictures                                       
	Bagdogra, April 14: Eleven bullets were found in the check-in baggage of an American woman and her daughter in Bagdogra, their version leaving investigators scratching heads on how the clip of ammunition could have passed through several international and national airports.        
	The Americans  Monica Bond, 57, and her daughter Heather K. Bond, 37, from Santa Barbara in California  have been detained but till late tonight, officials had not decided how to proceed.        
	The Bonds were supposed to board Deccans Flight 619 to Delhi via Guwahati, leaving at 11.45am from Bagdogra airport.         
	They were registering (checking in) two rucksacks around 10.30am. When the rucksacks passed through the scanner, our staff saw the bullets in a pistol clip in a large pouch in one of the rucksacks. They asked the Bonds to unpack the luggage, took out the ammunition and immediately informed me, Rajkumar Rai, Deccans security superintendent, said.        
	Rai said the two were escorted into the Deccan office and asked whether they had papers that authorise them to carry the bullets. They were both surprised at the discovery and said the bullets were an oversight while they packed back home. I then informed police and the Central Industrial Security Force and lodged an FIR with Bagdogra police, Rai said.        
	The police took them to an investigation centre, 4km from the airport. Both said that they had brought the 9mm pistol ammunition by mistake and failed to furnish any document allowing them to carry the ammunition, Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of police, Darjeeling, said.        
	Monica is a retired nurse, while Heather is an employee of Californias forest and fire protection department.         
	Heather acknowledged that she and her husband, who could not accompany them because of some respiratory problems, possess handguns and other firearms back home. She said they carry the firearms while travelling within US like other residents and unknowingly brought these bullets to India, an official said.        
	We travel regularly and the cartridges were in our travel bag and we brought them to India by mistake. There is thus no question of carrying any documents linked to them, she said.        
	US citizens are allowed to carry firearms with permits in their registered baggage in domestic flights, the police said. In India, too, firearms can be carried as registered baggage but the licence has to be produced at the airport.         
	But the officials said they could not figure out how international airports and the Delhi airport the two had passed through earlier missed the ammunition if the Bonds version was true.        
	The Bonds boarded a flight from Los Angeles, switched at Taipei and landed in Delhi on March 24. They toured north India and returned to Delhi. About a week ago, they reached Bagdogra by flight from Delhi and went to Darjeeling. They were returning to Delhi today, the district police chief said.         
	Officials from various intelligence agencies have reached the centre to garner more information. Apparently, there is no problem with their visas and passports. The ammunition also seems to be of US-make. In case their statements are true, it is strange that they travelled through prominent international and national airports without being detected even once, an official said.         
	We are also checking whether the US-made ammunition was procured in Darjeeling, the official added.

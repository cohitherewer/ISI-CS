	Srinagar, Nov. 11: The BJP, which led the Amarnath campaign pitting Hindus against Muslims in Jammu and Kashmir not long ago, appears to be eyeing a secular image now. The party has picked Muslim candidates for 27 of the 65 seats it will contest in the state.        
	We are contesting 65 seats and 27 candidates are Muslims, and most of them have got tickets from Kashmir, BJP state general secretary Shamsher Singh said.        
	The BJP had fielded about the same number in the last Assembly elections, when it did not win any seat in Kashmir and only one in Jammu. But in the bitter Amarnath land campaign that the BJP led this year, the party had taken a pro-Hindu stand and also betrayed a bias against Kashmir vis--vis Jammu.         
	All that is past now and the BJP appears to prefer Kashmiri Muslims to Pandits as candidates. Of the 46 seats in Kashmir, the BJP will contest 27 and only field six Kashmiri Pandits.         
	There is clearly a bias in favour of Muslims and Kashmiri Pandits deserved a couple of more tickets. But as a Kashmiri Pandit I wont mind it. They (BJP) are trying to prove their secular credentials, said Veer Saraf, leader of Roots in Kashmir, a Jammu-based political group campaigning for the return of Pandits to the Kashmir Valley.         
	But a BJP leader who asked not to be named said the Pandits had got a raw deal. When the BJP issued the first list, there was no Kashmiri Pandit but six men from my community were given tickets after we pressed hard for it. We still feel betrayed, he said.         
	BJP provincial president Sofi Muhammad Yousuf said his party was secular with a national outlook and had taken more pro-Kashmir steps than any other group.         
	We are banking on Atal Bihari Vajpayees peace initiatives, which helped improve the situation here. It was the NDA government led by him which started a dialogue with the Hurriyat, and relations with Pakistan also improved. It was also our initiative to open the cross-LoC roads but other parties are taking credit for that, said Sofi, who is contesting from Pahalgam. We have had roadshows and the biggest rallies in different parts of the Valley. In Pahalgam, around 4,000 people attended our rally.         
	The party is planning to bring over senior central leaders, including Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, to campaign.         
	Kashmir has 72,000 Pandit voters out of a total of 34 lakh. But with the separatists calling for a boycott of the polls, they can play a decisive role in several seats if they come out to vote in large numbers.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 9: A World Health Organisation employee has accused the agencys Delhi office of trying to protect a colleague against sexual harassment charges she levelled against him, and has now turned to the Indian government for help.        
	She has asked women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury for help, expressing fears she would be victimised by the UNs public health arm for her repeated complaints. The WHOs South East Asia Regional Office in Delhi did not respond to queries on the charges.        
	Ministry sources said the complainant met Chowdhury yesterday, two days after handing in a written complaint. They added that Chowdhury had assured the woman of support, and the ministry may ask the National Commission for Women to help her.        
	The ministry does not usually take up individual grievances, but the sources said Chowdhury was shocked at the documentary evidence the woman came up with.        
	This newspaper has seen transcripts of some text messages the accused allegedly sent the complainant. They carry expletives in Hindi and English and suggest the sender had physically assaulted the complainant. The sender says he is happy the complainant is hurt.        
	In one message, the sender says he is aware of the complaint against him while in another he warns her against pursuing the case.        
	Officials of the WHOs regional office did not act against the accused despite repeated petitions over the past six months, the woman has complained. She has suggested the WHO is protecting the accused because he has a powerful relative.        
	This is the second sexual harassment complaint relating to UN agencies in India to have landed at the governments door in a year.        
	A Unicef official, Archana Pandey, had last year accused her boss Cecilio Adorno, the agencys representative in India, of sexually harassing her. Adorno denied the charges. Pandey has alleged a cover-up by the organisation which, she says, sacked her after she went public.        
	Officials from UN agencies often enjoy immunity from the laws of the country where they work. But since the WHO accused is an Indian, he may have to answer to the countrys laws against sexual harassment, the sources said.        
	Pandey is trying to sue Adorno, a Filipino, in Delhi High Court.        
	UN agencies hire employees on contract, some for as short as three months. Pandey said the uncertainty of future employment made women particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment.        
	Im a single mother with children and I need a job. If a senior who is going to assess an employees future opportunities harasses her, it isnt easy to risk losing the job, she said.

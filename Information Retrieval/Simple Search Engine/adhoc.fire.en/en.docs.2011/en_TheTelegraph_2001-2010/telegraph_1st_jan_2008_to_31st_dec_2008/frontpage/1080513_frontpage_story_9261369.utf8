          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Barobisha (Alipurduar), May 12: A truck driver was killed and three persons were injured when a bomb kept in a plastic container hanging from the handlebar of a bicycle exploded near a tin shade alongside NH31C here this morning.        
	Govind Sharma, 35, from Birpara, was sitting under the shade adjacent to a checkpost of the motor vehicles department when the bomb exploded at 10.05am. His helper, Suresh Sau, 35, Sudam Barman, 22, a college student, and Ranjit Saha, 25, an octroi agent, were badly injured.        
	The spot is 3km from the Bengal-Assam border.        
	The tin roof of the shade was blown off and a telephone pole against which the bicycle carrying the bomb had been left was badly damaged. The handlebar of the bicycle was flung about 75 metres away.         
	We were working when we heard the explosion. We saw a badly injured Sudam (Barman) trying to run towards our office. Two others were lying on the road. The truck driver lay crumpled under the shade, said Shantanu Pal, the additional regional transport officer.         
	The injured were taken to local hospitals. Barman and Sau were later shifted to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri.        
	Sukumar Sarkar, a tea stall owner, said he had noticed the bicycle leaning against the telephone pole.        
	Alipurduar additional police superintendent S.R. Mishra said an extremist group, which is yet to be identified, had planted the bomb. It was kept in a plastic container hanging from the handle of the bicycle. We suspect that a timer was used to set it off.

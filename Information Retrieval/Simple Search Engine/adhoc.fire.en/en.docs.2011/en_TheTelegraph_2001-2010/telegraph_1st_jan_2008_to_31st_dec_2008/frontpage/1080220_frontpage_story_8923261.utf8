          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Ghisingh out on a walk at Pintail. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Dagapur (Siliguri), Feb. 19: Subash Ghisingh continued to be holed up in Pintail for the second day today, although in the afternoon, after two rounds of negotiations, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha withdrew its blockade at Dagapur, a stones throw from the bungalow of the GNLF chief.         
	For the past 24 hours, more than 3,000 Morcha supporters had been on vigil at different points across Darjeeling district, determined to stop Ghisingh, who arrived from Delhi yesterday, from sneaking back into the hills.         
	The Morcha has called an indefinite bandh in the hills starting tomorrow to demand that Ghisingh be removed from the post of caretaker administrator of the DGHC and protest against the imposition of the Sixth Schedule status. Essential services have been exempted from the shutdown.        
	A few metres from Pintail, on NH55, around 700 Morcha supporters demonstrated for close to five-and-a-half hours, continuously hurling abuses at the GNLF chief for duping the people of the hills. Led by the partys central committee leaders like Roshan Giri and K.S. Ramudamu, the protesters blocked the highway. Police cordoned off the area at 11.20am to stop the crowd from progressing further.        
	We want Ghisingh to hear the peoples protests, said Giri. People in the hills do not want him for his autocracy, dormancy and corruption. He will not be allowed to enter the hills.        
	The protesters missed giving the message to the GNLF chief in person. Fifteen minutes before they arrived around 11am, the GNLF chief had come out of the bungalow to inspect the DGHC-owned plots.        
	The inspector-general of police (north Bengal), R.J.S. Nalwa, arrived at the spot around 12.45pm, after which the road link was restored.        
	At 1.20pm, the first round of negotiations began. At 2pm, Nalwa invited the Morcha for a second round of talks. This time the party leaders relented and the blockade was lifted around 3.30pm. Two companies of extra force would be sent to the hills for the bandh, said Nalwa.        
	About Ghisinghs moving to Darjeeling, Nalwa said: It is up to him to decide.         
	Around 4km away, in Sukna, the protesters pledged to continue with the night vigil. We had kept watch on the Siliguri-Sukna road last night. A similar vigil will continue tonight, said Sanjita Dorjee, a protester.         
	The Morcha had ensured that its supporters did not go hungry at night. We served khichdi, said Lalit Thapa, a Morcha leader from Sukna.

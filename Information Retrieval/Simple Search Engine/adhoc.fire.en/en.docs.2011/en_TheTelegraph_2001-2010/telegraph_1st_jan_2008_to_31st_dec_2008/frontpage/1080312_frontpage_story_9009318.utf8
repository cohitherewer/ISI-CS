  - Polish engineers unhurt in second explosion          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                             
	Dibrugarh, March 11: Two persons died and three Polish oil engineers had a narrow escape in explosions in Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts of Assam today.        
	 Both casualties were in the blast in Doomdooma town of Tinsukia district around 4.15pm. One of the dead was rickshaw-puller Joginder Choudhury, who ferried the suspected bomb carrier  a woman with a bag  to the marketplace where it exploded.        
	Witnesses said the woman alighted from the rickshaw, leaving her bag behind, moments before the big bang.         
	One of the 14 injured, Firoze Hussain, died at the Assam Medical College and Hospital in Dibrugarh later. The condition of five of them  Phuleswar Gohain, Robindra Das, Harikishore Misar, Guddu Singh and Ragunath Prasad Shah  is stated to be critical.         
	The incident involving the engineers from Polish company Geofizyka Torun occurred two-and-a-half hours earlier at Madhupur Deori village, near Barbaruah in Dibrugarh district.         
	Part of a team conducting a seismic survey for Oil India Ltd, the trio were in a specially-equipped vehicle that is used for such work when the bomb exploded perilously close to it.         
	The driver had minor injuries and the vehicle was partially damaged, but the visiting engineers were unhurt, the police said.        
	We are investigating the incident. We cannot immediately say what caused the blast. It could be militant activity or an accident, the officer-in-charge of Barbaruah police station, R.Bora, told The Telegraph.        
	Superintendent of police Anurag Agarwal too said explosives used for seismic surveys might have accidentally caused the blast. Lapses, if any, on the part of OIL, are being investigated.        
	The blast left a large crater on the road.         
	Col D.K.Singh of the 11 Guards Regiment of the army, which began a separate investigation into the incident, said it appeared to be an accident rather than a militant attack. The OIL spokesman, Phanindra Kumar Deva Choudhury, too ruled out a militant-triggered blast.         
	In Tinsukia district, shopkeepers hurriedly downed shutters and vehicles went off the road immediately after the Doomdooma market blast. District police chief Prasanta Bhuyan said contingents of security forces, including the army and other central forces, moved in from nearby locations to secure Doomdooma and Tinsukia towns.        
	On Sunday, three Hindi-speaking workers of a brick kiln at Tengakhat in Dibrugarh district died in an attack by suspected Ulfa militants.

	Bokaro, Sept. 3: Jharkhand has joined the group of states willing to roll out the red carpet for Ratan Tata and group, as uncertainty looms large over the Singur small car plant in Bengal.        
	Talking to The Telegraph today from his Sector-IC residence, the chief minister, Shibu Soren, found some free time between his impromptu gardening, to talk about the Tata Group and the states rebel problems.         
	He stated that he has send a clear signal to Ratan Tata to establish the prestigious Nano plant in the state, if the group was in a mood to shift from Singur (Bengal). The chief minister stated that the state was ever ready to negotiate and parley with open arms and an open mind.         
	Soren branded Tata as the original Jharkhandi, with a 100-year history in the state. The Tata Group is always welcome to establish their car plant in any part of this state. The group has and can play a positive role in the industrial development of Jharkhand and as the chief minister I would try my best to get in the better offers for my state.         
	We are keeping an eye on all developments that are taking place in Singur and if the final shutdown decision is taken, Jharkhands doors, for the Nano project, would be always open, said the Jharkhand chief minister.        
	Soren assured that a talk with the Tatas was not his only priority, but negotiations with Naxalites also featured in the list of agenda. Bloodshed will not and cannot solve problems. Police have been directed to pass on our request for parley and hopefully there would be positive results in the coming days he said. I would arrange for the best facility for the reformed rebels, he promised.        
	In Bengal the opposition Trinamul Congress today stuck to its protest path and said it would continue to strike till the 400 acres was returned to the farmers, notwithstanding Tata Motors pull-out threat. Whether they shift their product to other facilities or not is an internal matter of the Tatas. We dont want to comment on that. We strongly want the 400 acres to be given back to those who have lost land and for that our movement will continue, said a senior Trinamul leader, Madan Mitra.         
	Mitra also alleged that supporters of the ruling CPM were trying to provoke Trinamul activists. It seems that Guruji hopes Bengals loss would be Jharkhands gain.         
	In his morning tte--tte Soren added that as the chief minister he was looking into the states all-round development and emphasised on factories, better agriculture and electrical facility in the state and development of the lowest rung of the society.         
	The chief minister also seemed ready to help out Bihar in its tough time.         
	The chief ministers office sent off a truck filled with relief materials to Bihar in the morning.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 28: A group of MPs from West Bengal and Assam, led by CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury, today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, seeking speedy implementation of the national waterway on the Brahmaputra from Sadiya to Dhubri and development of Dhubri port.         
	Dhubri has become a hub of economic transactions in the Northeast, said Yechury. Unfortunately, the Brahmputra Inland Water Transport became a victim after the 1965 war (with Pakistan), he added.         
	The people of both Assam and West Bengal, under the banner of Brahmaputra Waterways Demand Committee, have been demanding implementation of Brahmaputra Waterways 2.         
	We urged the Prime Minister for the speedy implementation of this waterway project. But nothing happened so far on the ground level, Yechury told reporters.         
	He said the project would ensure better connectivity for Assam and the surrounding region.

  - Huge lead for Obama        K.P. NAYAR                            Palin: Ill-timed excess                                        
	Washington, Oct. 23: If John McCain loses the White House on November 4, he will reflect on the moment when he chose Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential running mate as the turning point which decisively wrecked his lifes ambition.         
	A victory for Obama in the US presidential election is now being taken for granted here. The latest opinion poll released today gives the Democrat a 12-point lead over McCain. Obama is now leading over his Republican rival in every group that is being questioned in every poll on a daily basis.         
	Although Democrats regularly underplay in public their expectations for November 4, so confident is Obama of victory that he is leaving the campaign today for two days to visit his ailing grandmother in Hawaii. Independents were McCains biggest hope. He had hoped to win them over with his self-styled and well-advertised maverick image among uncommitted voters.         
	The latest Reuters/ C-SPAN/Zogby poll released today, however, gives Obama a huge 30-point lead  59 per cent to 29 per cent  over McCain among independent voters. When former secretary of state Colin Powell declared his support for Obama last Sunday on national television, he cited McCains ill-considered choice of Palin as one his reasons for endorsing Obama.         
	Neither Powell nor Americas electorate then knew about the $150,000 shopping spree on her wardrobe. All of yesterday, this excess was the staple not only of television news channels, but also on entertainment networks.         
	McCains main reason for choosing Palin was the expectation that she would attract white women voters who were disappointed that Hillary Clinton had not only lost in the Demcoratic parimaries, but also that Obama had bypassed her in choosing his vice-presidential running mate.         
	But todays poll showed Obamas lead among women increase to 18 points from 16 points overnight after the wardrobe story became the talking point at kitchen tables across America yesterday.         
	Obamas wife, Michelle, is admired for the way she dresses, but anchors on non-news programmes, popular among women, stressed yesterday that a black-and-white patterned dress of Michelles, that was widely acclaimed, recently was bought for just $148 from a discount store.         
	In marked contrast, the Republican National Committee, for instance, spent $75,062 at Neiman Marcus and $49,425 at Saks Fifth Avenue last month on clothes for Palin and her family. The money came from campaign contributions that are, by convention, not spent on clothing for candidates.         
	Yesterday, as Palins new wardrobe was making headlines, it was revealed that she had charged Alaska state, where she is governor, for her children to travel with her while she was on official business.         
	The children not only went with her to functions to which they were not invited, but Palin later amended expense reports to falsify the records of their travel. These included hotel and flights for her three daughters to watch their father in a snowmobile race and a trip to New York, where Palin stayed with her controversial 17-year-old unmarried daughter, now pregnant, for five days and four nights in a luxury hotel, according to an in-depth investigation by the Associated Press.         
	AP reported that Palin had charged Alaska state for 64 one-way and 12 round-trip commercial flights for her three daughters since she took office nearly two years ago. In addition, she has charged the state for hotel rooms for the girls in violation of state laws.         
	To make matters worse, it turned out during an interview yesterday that Palin had no clue about the duties of the US vice president, the post for which she is running.         
	Palin still draws big crowds, much more than Mccain, but the conclusion is that her campaign events have more entertainment value than any significant electoral benefit for the Republicans.         
	A CNN poll this week showed that a majority of women  55 percent  think Palin is not qualified to be vice president.         
	The same poll revealed that 70 per cent of all respondents think her Democratic opponent, Joe Biden is qualified.

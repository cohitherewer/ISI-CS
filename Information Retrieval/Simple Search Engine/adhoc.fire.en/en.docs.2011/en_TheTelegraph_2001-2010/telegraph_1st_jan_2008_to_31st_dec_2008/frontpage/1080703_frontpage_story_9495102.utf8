	Patna, July 2: In two simultaneous blasts this morning, Maoists blew up railway tracks in two north Bihar districts during a nationwide bandh called by the outfit to protest against police atrocities on them.        
	According to railway officials, a large group of uniformed guerrillas blasted the tracks (the down line) between Bara Gopal and Awatar Nagar stations  about 60km from here  in Sonepur division of East Central Railway in Chapra Lok Sabha constituency represented by railway minister Lalu Prasad.        
	The two bombs planted by the Naxalites on the tracks  linking Delhi with Guwahati  exploded at 6.30am disrupting train movement for hours. A third bomb planted on the track (the up line) did not explode. The police recovered the unexploded bomb and defused it, East Central Railway chief public relations officer A.K. Chandra said.        
	In another incident, the engine of the Muzaffarpur-Narkatiaganj Passenger was derailed after Naxalites blew up about 2 metres of the track between Mehsi and Mahwal stations, about 80km from here in Muzaffarpur district.        
	Luckily, no casualties were reported in either of the two incidents.        
	The Maoists strike came on a day when Lalu Prasad flagged off the Saharsa-Amritsar Jansadharan Express at Saharsa and inaugurated a halt at Supaul, about 300km from the first blast site.        
	The twin blasts disrupted railway traffic between Delhi and Guwahati with several trains, including the Muzaffarpur-Delhi Lichchwi Express, Darbhanga-Delhi Sadbhavna Express, New Delhi-Guwahati Avadh Assam Express and Gorakhpur-Muzaffarpur Intercity Express being stranded at various places.        
	Chapra superintendent of police Sanjay Singh said he had launched a massive man hunt for the rebels involved in the attack.         
	The Maoist-sponsored bandh evoked partial response in rural and urban areas, but there were less passengers than usual in trains and buses. The rebels distributed leaflets in the villages of Chapra and Muzaffarpur districts asking villagers to support their movement for the empowerment of poor people and the end of bourgeoisie rule.

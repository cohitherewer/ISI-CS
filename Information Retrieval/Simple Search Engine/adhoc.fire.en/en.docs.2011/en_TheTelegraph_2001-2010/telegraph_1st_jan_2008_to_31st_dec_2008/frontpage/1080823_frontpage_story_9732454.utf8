          GAJINDER SINGH                            Boxer Vijender Kumars house in Bhiwani                                  
	Kaluwas (Bhiwani), Aug. 22: Packets of laddoos were brought in before Vijender Kumars Beijing bout. Even after he lost to Cuban Emilio Correa Bayeaux, not a laddoo was left.        
	No tears were shed over the defeat. Only a determination to send a stronger Vijender to the 2012 Olympics.        
	I will serve him more kheer so he can perform better next time. He has not disappointed us. He has won a medal (bronze) and I am proud to have a son like him, said mother Krishna Devi, who had been praying during the bout with daughters Sangeeta and Poonam.         
	The family hinted at a long celebration ahead  till he wins gold. This is the beginning. His bronze medal will give birth to many Vijenders from Bhiwani. He is a true hero and his close defeat (8-5) is proof, Poonam said.        
	People, mostly strangers, had trekked into the house here since early this morning, hoping Vijender would play the magical alchemist and turn his bronze to gold.        
	Many had arrived with toddlers in their arms. Others, from schoolchildren to grandfathers, had clambered up the walls, on the gate and on trees to root for the boxer.        
	Some held up Vijender as an example. Did you know that even after winning so many medals, he (Vijender) still travelled in buses. Become like Vijender when you grow up, a farmer was heard whispering into the ears of his seven-year-old. The kid could only nod.        
	By 11.45, an hour before the bout was to begin, not a toehold could be found under the tent erected on the small lawn inside the house. A huge screen had been put up.        
	For the first few minutes, cries of gold, gold, Vijender rent the air, followed by a hushed silence when he lost the first three points. The cheers werent muted until the last minute, when the Cuban had taken a five-point lead. After the loss, which cost Vijender the silver, the cheering was on, only less shrill.        
	Vijender has shown this village and Bhiwani that everything can be achieved with devotion. He wanted to win gold. But he has shown us the path, gushed Ravi, a young boxer being trained by Vijenders coach Jagdish Singh.        
	Unlike Vijenders packed home, Bhiwani seemed a ghost town. Traders downed shutters so they could watch in action Indias first pugilist to win an Olympic medal.        
	These moments are rare and I want to tell people what I was doing when our own son was making history. I am going home for an hour to watch the bout. I have no choice but to close my shop, said Vishnu, who owns a garment shop in Bhiwanis Rohtak Gate area.         
	The Haryana government, too, seemed to have mounted a midnight mission, levelling the slush-soaked road from the highway to Vijenders home. This lane had been in a mess until last evening because of the recent rain.        
	The improved road could prove a big help for another, keenly awaited, event: Vijenders wedding procession. The date might be unknown but father Mahipal knew exactly the kind of bride he would like to usher in.        
	Videshi nahin, desi bahu layenge uske (Vijender) liye (We wont get a foreigner but an Indian bride), Mahipal, a Haryana Roadways driver, said. He had been asked if his son would prefer a foreigner after his Olympic feat.

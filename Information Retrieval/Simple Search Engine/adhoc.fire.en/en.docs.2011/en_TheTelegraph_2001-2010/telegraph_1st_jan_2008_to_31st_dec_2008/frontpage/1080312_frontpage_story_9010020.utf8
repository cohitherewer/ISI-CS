The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Airport spoiler-strike starts 
                                                                                                           Airport spoiler-strike starts 
  - Bengal drags feet on Esma, shadow on services          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	March 11: Delhi has declared illegal an indefinite strike by airport employees but Bengal has not, leaving passengers in Calcutta to fend for themselves.        
	If the strike, which began this midnight, drags on, Calcutta airport will be the worst affected because of high unionisation  the undeclared reason why the Left Front government is shying away from invoking the Essential Services Maintenance Act (Esma).        
	As many as 14,000 employees of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) have gone on strike to press their demand to keep open the existing airports in Hyderabad and Bangalore even after two new facilities start operating in the two cities this month. Officials in Delhi said the new Bangalore airport could be delayed by a month but sources in the southern city denied this.        
	Passengers taking a flight from Calcutta airport or arriving in the city could face problems, though all airlines said they would operate their flights.        
	With all cleaning, electricity and other maintenance staff taking part in the strike, there would be dirty toilets and terminal buildings, power supply could be sabotaged and air conditioning systems will not work. Drinking water supply will stop within a few hours after the agitation starts and this becomes a major problem, an airport official said.        
	With no one to pull the trolleys out of the terminal buildings, passengers carrying luggage will be inconvenienced.        
	Runway inspection will be difficult without drivers, and maintenance of the communication, surveillance and navigation equipment will also be affected. If runway inspection is not done, it is unsafe for flight operations. Also, if any piece of equipment malfunctions, there will be delays, an official said.        
	The Indian Air Forces fire service personnel have been deployed at Calcutta airport but officials fear delays and lack of basic passenger facilities. In Calcutta, 30 IAF specialists in aircraft fire safety have reached the airport.        
	Air Traffic Control will function but runway and communication, navigation and surveillance equipment maintenance can run into hurdles. The drivers of the vehicles will not work. They take away the keys of the vehicles and also puncture tyres, an official said.        
	The radar, instrument landing system and other communication equipment are placed away from the control building. Some are located more than 12 km, making a survey impossible without vehicles.         
	We are taking all contingency measures to keep the flight operations normal, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said from New Delhi.         
	But the unions contested this. More than 2,000 employees at Calcutta airport will take part in the non-co-operation movement and services will be disrupted, said Dipankar Ghosh, the secretary of the CPM-backed AAEU, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport.         
	Asked whether Bengal would follow Delhi, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said tonight: The government has not taken any view on the imposition of Esma in the airport.         
	Esma allows police to arrest trouble-makers without warrant and those found guilty can be imprisoned.        
	Those spearheading the strike tried to seek cover behind semantics. We are on a non-co-operation movement, it is not a strike. Then, how can the government impose Esma? asked M.K. Ghoshal, a spokesperson for the Airport Authority Employees Joint Forum. However, he added all AAI employees would stop working.         
	Bengal home secretary A.M. Chakraborty said the government has strengthened security outside the airport. So far as security and internal affairs of the airport are concerned, we cannot intervene until the airport authorities seek our help, he added.        
	The airports in Delhi and Mumbai are unlikely to be affected by the strike for at least a week as they have been privatised. We have resources to handle the strike for at least a week, said a spokesperson for Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL). Housekeeping will be outsourced, and for emergency services, we have a reserve team.

          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              
	Bangalore, April 17: The badshah, Shah Rukh Khan, will himself perform in the 20-minute break between innings at the Eden on Sunday night. Among those applauding will be Priyanka Vadra and, in all probability, brother Rahul Gandhi, too.        
	Priyanka has accepted Shah Rukhs invitation, but Rahuls presence isnt confirmed. Its possible, of course, that both will turn up at the Eden, a well-placed source said.        
	Even if Rahuls appearance isnt guaranteed, the stage is set for possibly the biggest-ever turnout at the Eden. As the entertainment tax issue has been settled in a reasonable manner, Shah Rukhs decided to lead the cast of performers in the Kolkata Knight Riders first match at home (against Hyderabads Deccan Chargers), an associate said.        
	Apparently, owner Shah Rukh will dance to the Knight Riders theme song  Korbo, lorbo, jeetbo re  and also take centre-stage when a clutch of other stars join him for the chart-topping Dard-e-Disco from Om Shanti Om.

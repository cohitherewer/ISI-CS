	Washington, Feb. 26: Barack Obama has accused Hillary Clinton of using shameful smear tactics after a picture of him wearing tribal robes and headgear in a Muslim region of Kenya was circulated on the Internet.
    
	The photograph of the Illinois senator, which was taken in 2006 during an official trip to Wajir, a majority ethnic Somali area in Kenya, appeared on the front page of www.drudgereport.com, where rival campaigns typically try to place damaging material.
    
	Clintons campaign team declined to deny that it had sent the photo to Drudge, whose report said the campaign was responsible for circulating the email.
    
	The row came the day after the New York senator launched a stinging verbal attack on her young rival, who has overtaken her in the race for the Democratic nomination with a campaign that has stunned the former First Lady and the party establishment.With potentially decisive primaries being held next week in Texas and Ohio, Clinton has decided to go on the offensive to rescue her candidacy.
    
	Obamas campaign felt the photo was another attempt to tar their candidate by associating him with a faith that evokes powerful emotions in America.
    
	His campaign manager, David Plouffe, said: On the very day that Senator Clinton is giving a speech about restoring respect for America in the world, her campaign has engaged in the most shameful, offensive fear-mongering weve seen from either party in this election.
    
	Maggie Williams, Clintons new campaign boss, argued that it was the Obama camp that was causing offence.

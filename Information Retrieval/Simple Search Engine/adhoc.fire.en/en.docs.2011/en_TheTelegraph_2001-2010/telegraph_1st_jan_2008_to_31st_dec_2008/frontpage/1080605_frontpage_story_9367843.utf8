The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Barack breaks the barrier
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Barack breaks the barrier
  - First Black wins nomination for President          K.P. NAYAR                                                    
	Washington, June 4: Americas campaign to elect its 44th President began in earnest last night, minutes after Barack Obama crossed the threshold of 2118 Democratic Party delegates needed to claim the nomination.        
	Obamas historic claim as the first Black presidential candidate from either US political party immediately eclipsed his Republican rival-to-be in the November general election from drawing rooms across America, even as John McCain was delivering a nationally televised prime time speech in Louisiana that was carefully planned to set in motion the next stage in what promises to be a gruelling, if exciting, five-month campaign.        
	Every TV channel in America with the exception of conservative Fox News cut into McCains address to announce that Obama had secured the magic number to be the Democratic candidate with the last trickle of the partys kingmakers moving to his side and enabling him to cross the 50 per cent mark of delegates who will gather in Denver in August for the partys nominating convention.        
	Polling booths in South Dakota and Montana, the last two American states to take part in the Democratic primaries, were still open when Obama crossed the threshold for his partys presidential nomination.        
	But it no longer mattered who won those states. Obama and his tenacious rival Hillary Clinton shared victories in the two states when results came in later last night.        
	Tonight, I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States, Obama, declared shortly thereafter before a wildly cheering 17,000-strong crowd in St. Paul, Minnesota.        
	By going to the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul to lay claim to his partys nomination, Obama dared the Republicans and took his fight for the White House right into the symbolic epicentre of McCains campaign.        
	The Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul is to be the venue in September where McCain will formally accept his partys presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention.        
	America, this is our moment. This is our time. Our time to turn the page on the policies of the past. Our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face. Our time to offer a new direction for the country we love, Obama told the crowd that had to be repeatedly stopped from cheering in order for the Illinois Senator to speak.        
	The address was nationally televised and immediately electrified drawing rooms from coast to coast in America with Obamas now familiar mix of Kennedyesque charisma and Martin Luther King style of oratory.        
	It was an indication of how the Obama phenomenon has mesmerised America that people had started queueing up at the Xcel Energy Center from early morning to hear Obama at night. Even so, 15,000 people had to be turned away by 8 pm.        
	Between McCains eclipsed speech and Obamas claim to victory, Clinton spoke in New York --- also televised across the US --- and reluctantly acknowledged that her rival had, indeed, gained the numbers to claim their partys nomination.        
	But she did not concede defeat, suspend her campaign or endorse Obama.        
	Opinion continued to consolidate among Democrats this morning in favour of making Clinton the Vice-Presidential running mate for Obama in the campaign for the White House.        
	Clintons campaign chairperson Terry McAuliffe appeared inclined to favour such an eventuality when he said: I think a lot of her supporters would like to see her on the ticket.        
	Obama spokesperson Robert Gibbs dampened speculation on this score, asserting that the two campaigns had not worked out any deal.        
	Gibbs left open the possibility of what many believe would be a dream ticket when he said Clinton had accumulated a lot of votes throughout this country in the primaries. We want to make sure that we are appealing to her voters.        
	Obama and Clinton spoke on telephone last night. Obama has said he is willing to meet Clinton wherever she wants, whenever she chooses.

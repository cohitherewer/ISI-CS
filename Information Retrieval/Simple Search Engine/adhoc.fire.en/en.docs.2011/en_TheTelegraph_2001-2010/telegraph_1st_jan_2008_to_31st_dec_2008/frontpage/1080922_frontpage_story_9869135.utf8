The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Day after: You name it, the cops know it 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Day after: You name it, the cops know it 
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: The 13 school friends who allegedly pulled off serial blasts across the country ribbed one another about how many kills each had made and revelled in Indias vulnerability, police claimed today.        
	Pictures in a laptop seized from shootout site Batla House showed the youths posing with the banner Indias Most Wanted behind them, joint commissioner (special cell) Karnal Singh said as he painted the group as a playful bunch of boys, almost planting bombs for fun.        
	Singh claimed the laptop also had a picture of an explosive with Ahmedabad written over it. The police allegedly found in the rented Jamianagar flat a copy of a Hindi magazine that had a picture of a militant on its cover with Bebas Bharat (Vulnerable India) written across it.        
	Three alleged module members  Zia-ur Rahman, Mohammed Shakeel and Shakir Nissar  were arrested from Jamianagar early today and, like Zeeshan Ahmad and Md Saif who were nabbed on Friday, were sent to 14 days judicial remand. Their interrogation revealed many details, officers said.        
	Group leader Mohammed Atif Amin, killed in Fridays gunfight along with Sajid, had allegedly told Saif he later planned to explode 20 bombs in Delhis Nehru Place area. Saif said Atif would get agitated if there was a long interval between terror attacks in the country, Singh told reporters.        
	Saif told us Atif would say bada soona pada hai yahan (its getting too quiet here). Saif has revealed how they returned after planting the bombs and watched their outcome on TV and celebrated.        
	Deputy commissioner (west) H.G.S. Dhaliwal described a players dressing-room atmosphere: They used to flip channels to compare whose bombs caused how much casualty. Those whose bombs caused lesser casualties would be teased by the others.        
	Shakeel, he said, stopped to have ice cream on his way to plant a bomb at Gaffar Market. At Connaught Place, the youths allegedly covered the bombs with banana peels after placing them in garbage cans.        
	A few inconsistencies, however, cropped up in the police version. Saif was said to have known Atif for four years despite the police claiming yesterday that all 13 were school friends in Azamgarh.        
	Worse, Zia turned out to be the son of Batla House caretaker Abdul Rahman and even the police admitted he carried luggage for the module members. Officers, however, insisted in the same breath that Zia was part of the module and that both father and son were linked to Azamgarh.        
	The address on the driving licence Atif had given the caretaker as ID proof has turned out to be genuine, setting off a media rush to his Azamgarh address. This raises the question why a terrorist described as a master of disguise would so casually reveal his identity.        
	Besides, the caretaker and Zia had travelled to a TV channels office shortly after Fridays shootout to show off the documents given by Atif. The same day they had walked into Jamianagar police station with the papers, where they were seen by journalists.        
	Why would Zia do that if he were guilty? Police sources who cannot be named said both father and son were held on Friday after their TV interview and not today. The caretaker has been held apparently for forging the landlords signature on the rent agreement with Atif.        
	Officers continued their flippant dressing-room parallels, with Dhaliwal saying the handsome Nissar spent his time on the Internet and had many online girlfriends. He was the all-rounder in the group.

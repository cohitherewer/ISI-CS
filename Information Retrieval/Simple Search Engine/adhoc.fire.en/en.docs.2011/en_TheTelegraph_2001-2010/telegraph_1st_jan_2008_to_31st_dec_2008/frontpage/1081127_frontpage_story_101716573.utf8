(REUTERS)      New Delhi, Nov 27 (Reuters); 02.20 PM(IST): Maharashtra state police chief A.N. Roy said that the hostage situation had ended at the Taj Hotel in Mumbai, but that there were still apparently hostages in the Trident/Oberoi.  rdquo;People who were held up there, they have all been rescued, rdquo; Roy told the NDTV news channel. ldquo;But there are guests in the rooms, we don't know how many. rdquo;
  Roy said some people were still apparently being held hostage at the Trident/Oberoi Hotel.  rdquo;That is why the operation is being conducted more sensitively to ensure there are no casualties of innocent people.  Government sources say that there are about nine foreigners among the 101 dead so far in the terror attacks.

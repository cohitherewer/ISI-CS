The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Headmaster shot dead in front of students
                                                                                                           Headmaster shot dead in front of students
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Belpahari, Feb. 22: Suspected Maoists today walked into a primary school and shot dead the headmaster, a CPM leader, before his pupils in a West Midnapore village.        
	The three attackers dragged Karamchand Singh, 45, off his chair, shot him four times and smashed his head with a stone while terrified students dashed out of the school.        
	The murder mirrors that of Anil Mahato, teacher and CPM local committee member, who was gunned down at the Amjore Primary School in Salboni six years ago.        
	Singh was taking a class on the veranda around noon when three men in shirts and trousers arrived at the school at Machkandna village, Belpahari, about 250km from Calcutta.        
	The headmaster, a member of the CPMs Belpahari local committee, asked them who they were. Without replying, one of them climbed on the veranda and pulled him off his seat by the collar.        
	Our head sir was a fearless man. He punched the man on the face. Then all three pounced on him, said Class III student Bablu (name changed).        
	Two of them caught his hands and the third whipped out a pistol and shot him twice. The students ran helter-skelter.        
	In one last burst, Singh, bleeding from the head and near his left ear, jerked himself free and began running.        
	He had barely made 20 feet when two more bullets from the 9mm pistol hit him in the back and neck. He collapsed. The attackers broke his skull with a large piece of stone, an officer at Belpahari police station said.        
	With the school about half a kilometre from the village, the fleeing students were the only witnesses, he added. We found seven live 9mm cartridges and four spent ones.        
	The daring attack bears the stamp of a Maoist operation. Yet, the gunmen did not shout slogans or leave behind posters. Nor was Singh known to be on the rebels hit list, a district police officer said.        
	We are not ruling out a Maoist attack, but we are keeping in mind that Singh had been named in an FIR after the murder of a woman Jharkhand Party supporter in 2003, said N. Ramesh Babu, deputy inspector-general of police, Midnapore range.        
	The Jharkhand Party hired Maoists to kill Karamchand, CPM district secretariat member Dahareswar Sen alleged.        
	Villagers who saw the three men on their way in or out said they were strangers.        
	Singhs wife Paramoni, 38, kept passing out though the evening. The couples daughter Jayshree, 15, and sons Rudrapratap, 14, and Ranapratap, 5, are in boarding school.        
	The CPM has called a 12-hour bandh across the Binpur Assembly segment on Sunday.

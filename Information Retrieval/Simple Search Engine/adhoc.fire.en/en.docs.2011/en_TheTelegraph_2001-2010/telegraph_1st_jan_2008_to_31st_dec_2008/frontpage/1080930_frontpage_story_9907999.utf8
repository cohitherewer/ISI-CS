	Calcutta, Sept. 29: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is learnt to have informed the CPM that Ratan Tata could visit Calcutta on Friday.        
	Bhattacharjee had said on Saturday that Tata had agreed to a meeting on Singur. The CPM state committee today asked the government why it was not being firm in tackling protesters and why it appeared apologetic while dealing with them.         
	The government has called an all-party meeting on Singur tomorrow but Mamata Banerjee left for Delhi, saying she would meet Sonia Gandhi.

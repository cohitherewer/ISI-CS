  Best Games as fringe India flexes muscle          JAYDEEP BASU               vijender: medal sure            Vijender Kumar after winning the mens 75kg middleweight boxing quarterfinal in Beijing. (AP)                                       
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: India has three medals for the first time ever at any Olympics, and Abhinav Bindra has competition.        
	He is a super eligible bachelor, gushed Kamala Devi, after her son Sushil Kumar won the bronze in 66kg freestyle wrestling, Indias second medal in Beijing after Bindras gold.        
	Two medals in one Games  that would have been the countrys best performance since 1952.         
	Till Vijender Kumar decided to make it the best ever, fighting his way into the semi-final of 75kg middleweight boxing. A bronze is assured, but gold is what he wants.         
	How can I stop till I win the gold? he asked after winning the quarters, Abhinav Bindra showed us the way. The six-footer who could be a model will take on Emilio Correa of Cuba in the semi-final on Friday.        
	Vijender, 22, is from Bhiwani, in Haryana, and Sushil, 25, from rural Delhi  not too far from Chandigarh where Indias first individual gold-medallist lives in his familys palatial farmhouse. But their lives couldnt be further apart.        
	I dont pursue a fashionable sport and I am also not very highly educated, said Sushil, whose father is a telephone department driver.         
	He could be speaking also for Vijender, the son of a bus conductor who took to boxing at 14 to emulate his brother who is now in the army.            SUSHIL: CHISELLED IN BRONZE            Sushil Kumar after winning the bronze medal in the men rsquo;s   66kg freestyle wrestling. (AFP)      
	The two are the face of Bharat, flexing its muscle. An Internet forward doing the rounds said 20.08.2008 is a double date, something that comes only once in a lifetime. That was true for Indias billion-plus population today.         
	The last time the country won more than a medal at the Olympics was in 1952  wrestler Khasaba Jadhav added a bronze to Indias tally at Helsinki after K.D. Singh Babus hockey team dutifully delivered the gold.         
	Vijender, like Bindra, was knocked out early in Athens 2004, his first Games. Its a dream-come-true moment for me. I was shown the door in the first round four years ago at Athens, this was my redemption, he beamed.         
	But bronze is not what he wants to add to Indias 2008 tally. The medal is ensured, but it will be foolish to relax, he said after knocking out Ecuadors Carlos Gongora 9-4. Those days of settling for second or third spot are long over. We only settle for the best.                  
	The Bhiwani Boxing Club run by Dronacharya awardee Jagdish Singh, where Vijender trained alongside other Olympic hopefuls Akhil Kumar and Jitender Kumar, would be celebrating. As was Delhis Najafgarh, which found a new hero in Sushil after Virender Sehwag.         
	But as he chased an Olympic medal, the three-storey house in Najafgarh was home to Sushil for only a few days in a year. The rest of his time was spent in a small hostel room 20 km away at Chatrasal Stadium.         
	He didnt want fancy food or glamorous clothes or trips to theatres. All he wanted was that nobody stop him from practising, laughed mother Kamala Devi who like Bindras mother is bride-hunting. The practice resumes tomorrow.         
	The bronze medal is a great honour but my world does not come to an end here, Sushil told The Telegraph minutes after winning, speaking in chaste Hindi. I came to Beijing in search of a gold medal. I fell short of the gold. Preparations for the London Olympics start tomorrow.         
	That should please his father. He promised us gold we are a little disappointed, Diwan Singh said, after his son made Indias day.

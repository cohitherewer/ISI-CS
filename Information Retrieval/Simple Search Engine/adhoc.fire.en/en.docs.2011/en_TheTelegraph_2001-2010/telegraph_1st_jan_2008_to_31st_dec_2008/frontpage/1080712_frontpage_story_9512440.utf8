                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Koda admits to state failure
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, July 11: Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda believes his states intelligence network has collapsed, even though he refused to acknowledge it in public on Wednesday when MLA Ramesh Singh Munda was gunned by Maoists barely 45 km from the capital.        
	Most of the rebel (Maoist-related) incidents in the recent past are the outcome of a collapsed intelligence system. Be it construction of rural roads or highways or any other development work, all are victims of rebel threats, rued Koda in an exclusive interview to The Telegraph, days before the gruesome killing of the former welfare minister in Bundu.        
	Usually, contractors dance to the tune of ultra-Left gunmen and at times the police use the rebels mask to skip their responsibilities. How far can we pull on like this? he said.        
	Therefore, strengthening the state intelligence set-up would be his top priority, he added. Madhu Koda said he had decided to hold a meeting with the home secretary and the director-general of police soon to work out modalities for reviving the intelligence system.         
	Koda accepted that the Jharkhand government never received vital information on time and a section of corrupt officials were hand in glove with rebel outfits. Their identification, too, was very difficult because of a non-functioning vigilance bureau.        
	On the self-immolation bid by NREGS worker Tapas Soren in Churchu block of Hazaribagh district _ he was denied payment _ Koda said he was well aware that the suspension of the BDO and other officials did not mean that such incidents would stop.         
	Why didnt anyone inform the local police or the district administration when Tapan was attempting self-immolation? What was the administration doing when he was narrating his woes on the busy national highway before setting himself on fire? This proves how insensitive the state administration has become. The responsibilities of the deputy commissioners and the deputy development commissioners too need to be fixed.         
	The law has adequate provisions to fix erring officials, but a working system needs to be evolved, he admitted.

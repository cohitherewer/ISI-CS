          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Aarushi and Krishna, the Talwars rsquo; compounder                          
	New Delhi, June 10: CBI sleuths probing the Aarushi and Hemraj murder case today put arrested dentist Rajesh Talwars compounder Krishna through a second lie-detector test after taking him to the crime spot late last night.        
	The polygraph test on Krishna, who sources said could soon be formally arrested, came on a day a designated CBI court dismissed the doctors bail plea on technical grounds.        
	A CBI team, led by joint director Arun Kumar, visited Talwars Noida home last night to re-create the sequence that led to the murders.        
	Sources said most of the evidence had been destroyed but the team, which included forensic experts from AIIMS, apparently found something to link Krishna, a relative of Hemraj, with the murders on May 15 night.        
	The sources said there was some evidence pointing to Krishnas presence in Hemrajs room on the night of the murders. Moreover, Aarushis phone records had revealed that she spoke to Krishna late that night.         
	The second lie test came after the sleuths found discrepancies in Krishnas replies yesterday. The sources, however, said the second lie test on Krishna didnt imply Talwar was off the hook.        
	Talwar continues to be a suspect. Its just that the CBI has not found any concrete evidence against him and also the agency has not been able to pinpoint a motive for him to kill his daughter, an officer disclosed.        
	Officials said a separate CBI team was focusing on missing links in the data retrieved from Aarushis computer and her fathers laptop. They were also trying to retrieve pictures deleted from the slain teenagers new digital camera, the officials added.        
	A PTI report quoted CBI sources as saying that the murders had been planned well in advance.        
	Noida police had claimed that Talwar, who was arrested on May 23, murdered his daughter and domestic help after allegedly finding them in an objectionable position.        
	Talwar has to remain in prison for some more time as the designated CBI court today dismissed his bail plea, saying it was not competent to take up the matter. His fresh bail plea will be heard in a Ghaziabad court on June 26.        
	STAR assurance        
	STAR Plus, which screens Ekta Kapoors Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii, has assured the Centre it will not air any episode with content based on Aarushis murder, top officials said today.        
	Sources said I amp;B minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi spoke to the channel.

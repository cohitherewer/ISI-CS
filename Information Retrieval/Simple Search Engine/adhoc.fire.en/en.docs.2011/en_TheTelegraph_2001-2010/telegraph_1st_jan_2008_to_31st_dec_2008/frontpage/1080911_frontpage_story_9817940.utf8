          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                            A memorial service on an anniversary of the tragedy                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: The Supreme Court today took a stern view of allegations that court records relating to the 1997 Uphaar fire tragedy had been tampered with and cancelled the bail Delhi High Court had granted to the Ansal brothers.         
	Tampering with court records is worse than murder and dacoity a bench of Justices B.N. Agarwal and G.S. Singhvi said.        
	We do not agree with the high court that bail should be granted as a matter of course when the conduct of the accused has been reprehensible, the judges added, cancelling the bail Sushil and Gopal Ansal, the owners, had been granted this January.         
	We do not think that this is a case in which the high court should have granted bail as a matter of course. Ordinarily yes, but not when allegations of tampering with court records have been made, the bench said.        
	The judges rapped the high court for ignoring an investigation report that had prima facie revealed the defence had tampered with court documents.         
	Investigators probing the fire that killed 59 people found that some important documents relating to the role of the Ansals in managing the theatre were missing.        
	Defence lawyers said though an inquiry had been ordered, charges regarding tampering with the records were yet to be framed against the brothers. They should not be held guilty even before trial, one of them argued.        
	Justice Agarwal then said: If it (bail) cant be cancelled, it cannot be cancelled in any other case.         
	The defence also argued that the brothers had no direct link with the person who had tampered with the records.         
	How can any other citizen do it? the court shot back. You are the beneficiaries. You are the kingpins. You are responsible.        
	The court directed that the brothers be taken into custody immediately but later, at the request of senior counsel Fali S. Nariman who represented Sushil, permitted them to surrender by 4pm tomorrow.        
	The trial court had in 2007 jailed the brothers for two years for negligence but the high court gave them bail. The Association of Victims of the Uphaar Tragedy then moved the apex court.        
	The Supreme Court, however, said the observations it made today would not be held against the duo when their appeal against their conviction came up in the high court.        
	The judges requested the chief justice of the high court to conduct a day-to-day hearing by a bench dedicated to the case.         
	The apex court bench also cancelled bail of Uphaar managers Ajit Chowdhury and N.S. Chopra, who were in charge of running the theatre on the day of the fire.         
	The two had been jailed for seven years by the trial court on November 20, 2007, on the charge of committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder.         
	Two others, Manmohan Unniyal, the gatekeeper, and Brij Mohan Satija, a Delhi Vidyut Board official  both sentenced to two years in jail  were also denied bail.        
	Municipal officials S.S. Sharma and N.D. Tiwari and H.S. Panwar, of the Delhi fire brigade  all three jailed for negligence  are already out on bail.

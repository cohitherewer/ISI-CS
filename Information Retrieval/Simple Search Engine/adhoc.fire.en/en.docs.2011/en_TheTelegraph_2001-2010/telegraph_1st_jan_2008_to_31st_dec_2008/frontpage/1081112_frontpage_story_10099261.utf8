	Chief minister Sheila Dikshits worth has doubled to Rs 1.2 crore from Rs 56 lakh five years ago. An apartment in Nizamuddin East is the reason  priced at Rs 21 lakh in 2003, it is now worth Rs 64 lakh.        
	Dikshit owns silver, gemstones and gold worth around Rs 3.5 lakh, has Rs 4 lakh in public sector banks and Rs 1 lakh in private banks. The rest of her investments are in public provident fund, senior citizens savings scheme and the post office. She owns shares worth only Rs 30,000.        
	So, the 696-point fall in the sensex today or the gloom that has ruled Dalal Street, where the Bombay Stock Exchange is located, for weeks now would not be giving her nightmares.        
	BJPs V.K. Malhotra, whos eyeing Dikshits chair, has done even better. His assets have increased five-fold since 2004 to Rs 5 crore. He and his wife have two houses worth Rs 2.5 crore, Rs 1.62 crore in NSS, LIC, postal savings and policies and Rs 10.5 lakh in gold.         
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, who updated his assets list in 2008, also invests the good old-fashioned way. He has a flat each in Delhi and Calcutta, and land in Birbhum, and wife Suvra has a house in Greater Kailash and four properties in Bengal. They have Rs 35 lakh in fixed deposits, bonds and bank balances.         
	Prudence is not the hallmark of the older politicians alone. Nakul Bhardwaj, a 28-year-old BSP candidate, is worth Rs 2.13 crore, out of which Rs 2 crore is invested in farmland.         
	Rahul Gandhi said in 2006 he has invested Rs 1.34 crore in two shops in a Saket mall.

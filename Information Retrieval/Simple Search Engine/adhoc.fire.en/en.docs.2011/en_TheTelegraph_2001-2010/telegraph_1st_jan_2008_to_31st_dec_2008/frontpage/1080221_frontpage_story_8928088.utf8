                                                                                                           Preity cant stop dimpling
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                              Ness Wadia, Gauri Khan at the auction. (Reuters, PTI)				                                 
	Feb. 20: You couldnt miss the dimples.        
	Not with Preity Zinta around.        
	Brett the express Lee in the bag, the actress couldnt stop smiling as her Team Mohali picked up one star after another at todays premier league auction in Mumbai.        
	And while it needed the dimpled star to calm the excited media, she herself was one excited lady.        
	After all, Yuvi had come back to form.        
	The southpaw had struggled throughout the Aussie Test tour but powered India to victory over the Lankans yesterday to keep Indias hopes alive for the tri-series final.        
	It meant good news for Preity and her partners  Ness Wadia, Karan Apeejay Paul and Mohit Dabur Burman.        
	The sun goes down, the sun comes up now he is back in form, a spokesperson for Preitys team told The Telegraph.        
	He is an artist and we see Yuvraj leading from the front in the Indian Premier League.        
	Besides Lee, who cost a cool US $ 900,000, the Mohali team snapped up Sri Lankans Kumar Sangakkara ($700,000) and Mahela Jayawardene ($ 475,000), and then went big on Indian cricketers  Irfan Pathan ($925,000), Sreesanth ($ 625,000), Piyush Chawla ($400,000) and Ramesh Powar ($170,000).        
	They are not only Indian, they are also the best in the world, the spokesperson added. The point was to give Mohali, Punjab and other catchment areas the best team possible. We want to be one of the two top teams in the league.        
	Preity said the league would enhance the standard of competition at the domestic level.        
	We are happy that we are taking part in the event. I am satisfied with the team.        
	The plan, revealed a source in the Mohali team, was to have a balanced side. We wanted to have a wicketkeeper batsman and who better than Sangakkara, she said.        
	Everybody came to the bidding with a strategy. Some have worked, some have not worked. We are very happy with our team.        
	If Preitys presence had raised fears that the Mohali team would be more fun and less cricket, the clarification came from the team itself.        
	You can go to the moon and say that it (IPL) is going to be about entertainment, but at the end of the day the whole thing is going to be about cricket, the spokesperson chided.        
	In fact, this is going to be about cricket and nothing else. If you do not perform on the field, you can have the best entertainment and its not worth anything.

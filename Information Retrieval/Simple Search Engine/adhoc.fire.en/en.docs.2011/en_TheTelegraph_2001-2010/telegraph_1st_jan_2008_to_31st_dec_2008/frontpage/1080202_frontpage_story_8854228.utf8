     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES 
               
	New Delhi, Feb. 1: The Supreme Court today dismissed a batch of petitions filed by legislators from Nagaland, challenging the Speakers decision to bar three Independent members from voting and declaring nine votes as invalid during the no-confidence motion against Neiphiu Rio on December 13. 
    
	The apex courts decision has raised questions about Presidents rule in Nagaland, imposed on January 4 ostensibly to uphold constitutional propriety. The rationale for the decision was that Speaker Kiyanilie Peseyie violated the spirit of the Constitution. 
    
	Going by the Speakers decision, the ruling Democratic Alliance of Nagaland government could not be legitimately dismissed. 
    
	The Assembly is in suspended animation and powers of governance have been vested on the governor, who is aided by two advisors. 
    
	The Supreme Court did not make any elaborate observation while dismissing the batch of petitions. This case has no significance now, we are not entertaining it, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said. 
    
	The court also declined to interfere with the decision of the Speaker, saying that elections had been announced in the state and it would not be worthwhile to make any observation on the merits of the case. Elections are slated for March 5. 
    
	The DAN government survived the controversial no-confidence motion on December 13 because Peseyie barred Independents P. Chuba, Jongshilemba and Khutovi from voting and held that the votes of nine dissident Nagaland Peoples Front (NPF) members were invalid. The NPF is the head of the coalition. 
    
	Senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi, who represented the 12 legislators, termed the Speakers decision illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional and asked for it to be quashed. 
    
	Imposition of Presidents rule has also been challenged in Gauhati High Court, which issued a notice to Delhi on January 9. Some NPF legislators and the outgoing parliamentary secretary, Yitachu, filed the petition on behalf of the erstwhile DAN government. 
    
	The NPF was jubilant at the Supreme Courts decision. For the DAN alliance, this is a big victory which justifies that the Speakers action was according to the rules of the Constitution and also proves the fact that the DAN government was in the majority. It is a big slap on the face of the government of India, which imposed Presidents Rule against the wishes of the people, Rios press secretary, Abu Metha, said. 
       
	The Congress was despondent. The leader of the Congress Legislature Party, I. Imkong, said the party would wait for the high courts judgment.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Nov. 19: The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) has asked the state government for a detailed report on the alleged hunger deaths of around 20 members of several primitive tribes.        
	We have sought a detailed report, including the exact number of deaths of the members of primitive tribes, and the reasons behind it from the Jharkhand government, NCST director R.C. Durge told The Telegraph over telphone from New Delhi.         
	The commission has also sought to know what measures the government had taken to rehabilitate family members of the deceased, besides steps taken to stop the recurrence of such incidents.        
	A three-member committee constituted by chief minister Shibu Soren to inquire into the deaths of primitive tribals in the districts of Chatra, Ranchi, Koderma and Dumka, found they died due to food poisoning.         
	However, Balram, a social activist who is also an advisor to a commissioner appointed by the Supreme Court to supervise food security schemes in the state, alleged the tribals died of malnutrition.         
	Questioning the report of the committee  comprising welfare secretary U.K. Sangma, rural development secretary S.K. Satpathy and health secretary Pradeep Kumar  Balram pointed out the tribals survived on rice, pulses and locally grown saag (leaves) of bathua, gandhari and kanteela, none of which was poisonous.        
	Balram added that had there been unnatural deaths due to food poisoning.         
	The government should have lodged an FIR, he added.        
	Moreover, if they had consumed poisonous leaves, it becomes the duty of the government to find out the circumstances under which these tribals were forced to consume such food, he maintained.

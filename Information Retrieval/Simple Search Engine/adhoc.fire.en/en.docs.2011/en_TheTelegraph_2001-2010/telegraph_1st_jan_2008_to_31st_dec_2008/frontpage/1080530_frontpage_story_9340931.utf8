          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 29: Sonia Gandhi spent the day discussing the fuel crisis, with the Congress signalling that any price rise had to be a political and not just a government decision in an election year.        
	Sonia and her political secretary, Ahmed Patel, spoke to ministers Pranab Mukherjee and A.K. Antony.        
	Sources said she stressed that whatever the solution  raising fuel prices, compensating oil companies revenue losses  the common mans interests should be protected. Certainly not the Rs 10 and Rs 5 hikes that were being talked about, a source said.        
	Sonia later called on the Prime Minister to discuss the matter. Petroleum minister Murli Deora was present.        
	The issue is expected to figure prominently at Saturday afternoons Congress Working Committee meeting, which will also discuss the nuclear deal, Karnataka poll results and the Gujjar agitation.        
	The Congresss main worry is that a fuel price hike would turn food and other essentials costlier, negating the governments anti-inflation steps.        
	A decision cannot be purely ministry-centred, not when we have another lot of elections this year. It will be a political call, a party source said. Although we are yet to analyse it, our recent defeat in Bangalore city has been attributed to inflation.        
	The Congress feels that instead of fixing a price unacceptable to the party and then rolling it back under political duress, the government could mull over the issue for a while. It could go through the motions of consulting the party, the UPA allies and the Left before taking a decision.        
	The Congress has suggested that instead of adopting a single measure, such as a price hike, the government could opt for a package that includes elements of the various proposals on its table, the sources said.        
	These include a cess, lower customs duty on crude oil and lower excise duty on petroleum products based on quantity and not value (which means it doesnt rise with the rising crude prices), a small price hike and oil bonds for the companies.        
	Murli Deoras suggestion for a cess has not been accepted by the finance ministry but the sources insisted it had not been junked either.

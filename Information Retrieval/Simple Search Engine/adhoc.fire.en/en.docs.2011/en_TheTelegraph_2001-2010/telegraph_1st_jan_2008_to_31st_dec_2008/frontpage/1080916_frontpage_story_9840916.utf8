  - CM and Sen stay off roadshow, keep talks door open           INDRANIL GHOSH AND BISWAJIT ROY                            Biman Bose with unwilling landloser Anarbanu Begum in Singur. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Calcutta/Singur, Sept. 15: Three principal players in the Singur tussle stayed away from the battlefield today, fuelling hopes that doors were being kept open for discussions.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee did not attend the Left Fronts show of strength at Singur this afternoon because he was busy with official work in Calcutta. The same reason held back industries minister Nirupam Sen, too.        
	At the other end of the spectrum, Mamata Banerjee cried off a gathering of state government employees who had assembled in Calcutta to seek benefits and protest a government directive against holding demonstrations at will at Writers.        
	In Singur, Biman Bose and other Left Front leaders defended the industrialisation drive but refrained from attacking Mamata. They also urged Mamata, who had yesterday skipped a Save Farmland Committee meeting but not before ensuring no war cry would be sounded, to forsake opposition and resume discussions.        
	How you would like to read what you think are certain signs is your problem, said Partha Chatterjee, the Trinamul legislature wing leader, asked whether the absence could be seen as a conciliatory gesture from all sides.        
	But we are very clear: we are not going to turn our face away from the movement which is a way of life for us. Our netri will not negotiate her principal demand (land-based rehabilitation within the project site), but she is open to talks, Chatterjee added.        
	In Singur, a CPM state secretariat member said: Buddhada decided not to address the Singur rally as he wanted to keep the door open for talks.        
	Sources said the government, the Left parties and the Trinamul Congress are already holding informal talks, using absence and silence to set the stage for another face-to-face between Bhattacharjee and Mamata. Another meeting is very much possible, said a CPM leader.        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, although in Delhi, is helping the government and Mamata in bringing down the political temperature.         
	Tata Motors, a day after welcoming the governments initiative to restore normality, has apparently begun to examine the governments suggestion that construction be resumed this week itself.         
	We think the Tatas would like to wait and see what Mamata springs tomorrow, a government official said, referring to Trinamuls Singur rally on Tuesday. But Nirupam Sen said: Not heard from them yet.        
	Mamata is said to be waiting for the governor to return later this week before firming up her mind. Till then, she is unlikely to scale down in public her demand for 300-400 acres. We are expecting her to rattle the sabre at tomorrows rally, a CPM minister said.         
	The administration has withheld permission to the Trinamul event as it will be staged at the site of the dharna that had disrupted traffic on Durgapur Expressway. But the party is expected to go ahead with the meeting.        
	The CPM rally was held 2km from the expressway but thr road was choked by buses that ferried, according to party estimates, 2 lakh participants.        
	Anarbanu Begum, a middle-aged woman from a family of unwilling landlosers, walked up to the podium and spoke to Bose who quoted her as saying she would take the compensation after talking to her sons.         
	CPM leaders announced the presence of other unwilling landlosers but no one turned up on the stage.        
	I know some of the unwilling farmers who have not taken the compensation are here in the meeting. Please accept the cheques by September 22 along with the additional 50 per cent compensation and 10 per cent extra above the land value as consent award. You can buy farmland with that money if you want, Bose told the rally.

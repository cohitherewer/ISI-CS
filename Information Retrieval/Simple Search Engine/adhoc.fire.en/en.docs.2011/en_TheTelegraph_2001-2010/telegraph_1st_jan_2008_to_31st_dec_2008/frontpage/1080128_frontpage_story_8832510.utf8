The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Coal, Koda on Soren plate

	Ranchi, Jan. 27: The grand old man of Jharkhand politics, Shibu Soren, is in a dilemma. With a cabinet reshuffle on the cards at the Centre, the JMM MP from Dumka has to choose between the Union coal ministry and the Koda government.         
	If insiders of the JMM are to be believed, Soren is in a fix on whether to lobby for a Union cabinet berth or rescue the Koda government that is showing signs of collapse.         
	The UPA leaders of the state have entrusted Soren with the responsibility of convincing the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, about the need to support Madhu Koda.         
	The JMM chief is presently camping in Delhi to meet Sonia Gandhi. But so far Soren has not received any call from 10 Janpath.         
	The state HRD minister Bandhu Tirkey, who is also in Delhi, claimed that there is a possibility of Soren meeting Sonia tomorrow. She was too busy and hence she could not give time to us. Soren is expected to meet her tomorrow, the HRD minister said.         
	The JMMs chief predicament is what he would seek when he calls on Sonia  his re-induction in the Union cabinet or soft stand towards the Koda government.         
	We have suggested Soren to lobby for a cabinet berth since we are apprehensive about the future of the Koda-led government in the state. In case of a Presidents rule in the state, he can have some say in affairs of the state as a cabinet minister, said a top functionary in the JMM camp.         
	According to a Congress MP from the state, the party leadership is peeved with the manner in which the present government under Koda was performing. The party is going to take a stand on Jharkhand after the Simaria by-election slated to take place on February 4. There could be Presidents rule or change of guard in the state, a Congress leader hinted.         
	Soren had to tender his resignation as the Union coal minister in November 2006 after a Delhi court convicted him in the murder case of his personal secretary Sashinath Jha. Delhi High Court, however, acquitted Soren in the case in August last year.

  Cases on cricket czars for misleading court          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                                      
	Calcutta, Nov. 12: Calcutta High Court has directed the registration of criminal cases against Union minister Sharad Pawar and the virtual whos who of the countrys cricket establishment for perjury.        
	The order came on a petition filed by Jagmohan Dalmiya that accused the then six key office-bearers of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) of filing a false affidavit in court to justify his expulsion from the cricket board in 2006.         
	The directive means that unless a higher court allows a stay, the case will be labelled Calcutta High Court vs BCCI office-bearers. The high court administrator will appoint a lawyer who will fight the case on its behalf.        
	Justice Nadira Patheriya directed a registrar of the court to initiate criminal proceedings against Pawar, the former BCCI president and current vice-president of the ICC; Shashank Manohar, the BCCI president; Ratnakar Shetty, the chief administrative officer; N. Srinivasan, the secretary; Chirayu Amin, the vice-president and the junior cricket committee chairman; and Niranjan Shah, the former secretary.        
	I am happy that my stand has been vindicated. I have faith in the legal process and I believe in honesty, said Dalmiya, who has fought his way back to the helm of the Cricket Association of Bengal.        
	Agriculture minister Pawar, who had won the BCCI crown after a bitter battle with Dalmiya and then moved on to the ICC, told PTI in Delhi: I dont know what is the exact decision. Just now I am hearing that such a decision is given by the court. So, unless and until I see the papers, consult our lawyers, I will not be able to answer.        
	The affidavit was filed on behalf of the BCCI in 2007 when Pawar was the board chief. Asked if the affidavit was wrong, Pawar said: How can I tell you? Its not my affidavit, I dont know what affidavit you are referring to.        
	The registrar will now have to lodge a criminal complaint against the accused before the Calcutta Metropolitan Magistrates court under Section 195 of the CrPC (perjury).        
	The high court primarily held that the then BCCI office-bearers had falsely stated before it that an amendment which had empowered them to expel Dalmiya was registered on time with the Chennai Registrar of Societies under the Registration of Societies Act.                  Dalmiya in Calcutta on Wednesday. (PTI)       
	Todays order followed a petition by Dalmiya on April 2, demanding punitive action against Pawar and the five others for misleading the court. The fresh petition was filed after another judge, Indira Banerjee, of the high court had set aside Dalmiyas expulsion from the BCCI.        
	In the case heard by Justice Banerjee, Dalmiya had challenged the BCCIs claim that the amended Clause V of Rule 38 of the board had empowered it to expel him. This amended rule has not been registered with any registrar of the societies, Dalmiyas counsel, S.B. Mukherjee, had said.        
	BCCIs lawyers had then placed a document before the court. However, after going through the document, Justice Banerjee found that the amended rule was not registered within three months of adopting the resolution. According to the act, the amended rule has to be registered within three months.        
	On this ground, Justice Banerjee said the rule was not duly registered and set aside Dalmiyas expulsion.        
	The observation made by Justice Banerjee had prompted Dalmiya to file the new case that was decided today.

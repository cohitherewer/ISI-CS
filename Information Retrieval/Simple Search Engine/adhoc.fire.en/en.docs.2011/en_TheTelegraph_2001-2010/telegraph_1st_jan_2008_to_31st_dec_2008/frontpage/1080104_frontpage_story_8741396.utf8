     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 3: The BJP-backed Neiphiu Rio government in Nagaland fell just two months short of completing a full term in office when President Pratibha Patil gave her assent today to central rule in the state till elections are held next month.
    
	The Union cabinet recommended central rule in Nagaland after a meeting on Tuesday evening, but Patil took her time consulting experts on the Constitution before finally putting her seal of approval in Hyderabad this afternoon. 
    
	A senior home ministry official said the President wanted to be sure about the legitimacy of the cabinets recommendation, much like her predecessor A.P.J. Abdul Kalams style of functioning. 
    
	By holding on to the file for a day, she surely sent the signal that she was not willing to be a mere rubber stamp of the government, the official said. 
    
	The Union home ministry notified the imposition of central rule almost immediately after receiving Patils consent. 
    
	The Democratic Alliance of Nagaland, a coalition led by Rios Nagaland Peoples Front, had been shaky despite surviving a controversial no-confidence motion on December 13. It survived only because Speaker Kiyanielie Peseyie barred three Independent MLAs from voting on the motion and declared invalid the votes of nine dissident NPF legislators for defying a party whip. 
    
	As many as 31 members from the House of 60 met Patil after the no-confidence drama to seek central rule.
    
	Till yesterday, the NPF seemed confident about weathering the storm, going so far as to challenge reports about a recommendation for Presidents rule pending approval. The chief ministers office said it was a rumour floated by the Congress. Abu Metha, the press secretary to the chief minister, said Rio had not even convened a meeting of his ministers to discuss the issue.
    
	The BJP-backed coalition had ended 10 years of Congress rule in Nagaland with a comprehensive victory in the 2003 elections. Rio, home minister in the erstwhile S.C. Jamir cabinet, was the unanimous choice for the chief ministership.
    
	Reactions
    
	Rio said the imposition of Presidents rule might jeopardise the ongoing peace process with Naga militant groups, adds our bureau from Guwahati and Kohima.
    
	The chief minister said he had repeatedly warned Delhi of the serious consequences. 
    
	How can they do this? A similar situation had arisen in Goa too sometime back, but the Congress government there is functioning smoothly. How can they apply different yardsticks in the same country? he asked.
    
	 Rio said the people of Nagaland would give a befitting reply to the Congress in the elections for conspiring to dismiss a democratically elected government.
    
	Congress Legislature Party leader I. Imkong sounded jubilant. He said the President had upheld the Constitution and dispensed justice to the people of Nagaland despite the Rio-led coalitions efforts to shamelessly hang on to power after the no-confidence motion against it. 
    
	He allayed fears about the development affecting the progress of the peace process. 
    
	Former Lok Sabha Speaker and Nationalist Congress Party leader Purno A. Sangma said it was a shame that Delhi had orchestrated the dismissal of an elected government. He said none of the constituents of the United Progressive Alliance was consulted by the Congress before taking this undemocratic decision.
    
	Sangma warned of a spell of political instability in the entire region since Delhis decision could encourage defections. The Congress should now scrap the anti-defection law after making a mockery of it, he said. 
    
	He also claimed that the motive for clamping central rule when elections were round the corner was to rig the polls by utilising the state machinery. 
    
	The state unit of the BJP described central rule in Nagaland as an insult to the peoples mandate. 
    
	State BJP president Ato Yepthomi said Nagas were never tolerant of army rule and that the Congress would have to pay a heavy price for this when elections are finally held.

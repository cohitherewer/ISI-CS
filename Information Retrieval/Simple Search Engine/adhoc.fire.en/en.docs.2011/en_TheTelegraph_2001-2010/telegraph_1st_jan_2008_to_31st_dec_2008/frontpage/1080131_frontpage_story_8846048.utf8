               (Top) The Central Reference Library at the CMC headquarters. The notice reads: If the door is closed, come to the fourth floor  Librarian. On the three-and-a-half floor (as referred to by CMC employees), a rundown and desolate room (below) greets book-lovers and others. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta				 
                
	Calcutta, Jan. 30: The Book Fair in disarray, the chief minister is smelling a war and the mayor is willing to protect Calcuttas honour with blood. 
    
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may have little choice but to take up arms and Bikash Bhattacharyya to shed blood, if the two book-lovers go hunting for reading material in the mayors lair.
    
	Tucked away on the third floor of the crimson headquarters of the CPM-ruled Calcutta Municipal Corporation is a 15-foot-by-15-foot room that passes off as the corporations Central Reference Library.
    
	You dont have to read between the lines to figure out the sad story: the supposed repository of the documented history of Calcutta screams neglect. 
    
	All Calcuttans  not just CMC employees  can use the library after seeking permission from the office of the mayor or the commissioner but its a big secret.
    
	People hardly know about the library. We are trying to do something about it, said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, member, mayor-in-council (park and gardens).
    
	CMC gazettes, periodicals and old maps, dating back to the 1930s, used to draw researchers and some historians to the library. But now it is in a pathetic situation, the CPM leader said. Several books which were borrowed by former mayor-in-council members and others are yet to be returned to the librarys shelves.
    
	But few have seen the shelves after the library was shifted from the fourth floor (three-and-a-half in CMC parlance) to the third floor eight months ago. 
    
	One of the few employees who seem to be familiar with the library rued the space crunch at the new address. The Telegraph is withholding the name to protect the officials identity.
    
	Earlier, we had a reading room-cum-library on the three-and-a-half floor. There was enough space and research scholars used to frequent the library for references, the employee said. But now the number of visitors has dwindled.
    
	We even have documents written by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who became mayor in 1930, the employee added, stealing a moment of pride that fled fast from the forlorn room.
    
	When the librarys doors close, a notice directs to the fourth floor those who dare to go in search of books. The floor is being used as office space for other departments, the official said. 
    
	On the fourth floor, three almirahs stashed with books and CMC gazettes in a corridor leading to a urinal are the only reminders of the original library. 
    
	Published materials  their nature or content could not be established because by then officials were getting restive about the questions  were dumped on the damp floor. 
    
	The CMC is in the process of shifting the library to Town Hall. But as no cataloguing system is in place, no one has a clue to the transfer timetable. 
    
	We used to have over 10,000 books and a sizeable number of gazettes, periodicals and rare manuscripts. A part of the stock has been shifted to Town Hall. But I dont know when the shifting will be completed, the employee said.
    
	Other than paying the salaries of three employees, the civic body does not spend any money on the library. 
    
	We do not have any budgetary allocation as such for the library and there has also not been any new addition of books. We are trying to channel some funds to the library from allocations for information and public relations, mayor Bhattacharyya said.
    
	A few hours earlier, the mayor had said at a token book fair on the Maidan: We have to protect the honour of Calcutta with our blood. 
    
	The mayor was putting across his case to bring the fair back to the Maidan, speaking in the same vein as the chief minister who had yesterday wondered whether a war had been declared against books.

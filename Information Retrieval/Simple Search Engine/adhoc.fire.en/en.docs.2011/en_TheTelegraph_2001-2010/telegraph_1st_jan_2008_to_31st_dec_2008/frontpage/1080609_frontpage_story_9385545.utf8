          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Bagdogra, June 8: Siliguri residents opposed to Gorkhaland rained stones on picketing Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters this afternoon, turning the highway to Bagdogra airport into a battlefield and prompting the state home secretary to change the travel plan usually followed by top officials.        
	Supporters of the Jana Chetana, an apolitical organisation formed to combat the Morchas statehood demand, also attacked police who fought back with tear gas. At least 16 people were injured.        
	Home secretary Asoke Mohan Chakrabarti, who was on his way back to Calcutta from Kalimpong, took the Darjeeling Mail in the evening, police sources confirmed.        
	Other sources said senior officials from Calcutta usually travel to Siliguri by night train but return by flight.        
	Officially, the police didnt confirm any change of plan. Why do you want to know how the home secretary will travel, we have made many alternative arrangements for him, said K.L. Tamta, inspector-general of police, north Bengal. Most air passengers took an alternative route to the airport.        
	The Morcha has called a 24-hour hills bandh from 6am tomorrow but spared transport and tea gardens.        
	The bandh has been called to protest todays attack on our members and the state home secretarys irresponsible statement last week that the Gorkhaland demand would not be considered, Morcha secretary Roshan Giri said.        
	About 1,000 Morcha members had blocked NH31 near the airport at Bihar More, about 14km from Siliguri town, demanding the party be allowed to hold a rally on Adivasi Maidan in Naxalbari.        
	As the police tried to persuade the Morcha leadership to clear the road, Jana Chetana supporters gathered at the spot and urged officers to remove the blockade by force.        
	The administration has to take steps against such moves that are aimed at disrupting life, said Shankar Das, a Jana Chetana leader, while his supporters milled around waving flags.        
	Suddenly, the mob began throwing stones at the Morcha gathering, injuring five persons, and then at the police, who fired tear-gas shells to break up the crowd.         
	Later, Morcha supporters allegedly stoned and ransacked a few houses and shops in upper Bagdogra.

          BASANT RAWAT                                               
	Ahmedabad, Oct. 7: Forced out of Singur, the Nano has travelled at lightening speed to Sanand in the land of Na-mo.         
	Competing with other states to get the project that was forced out of Bengal last Friday, the Gujarat government of Narendra Modi, known as Na-mo, had readied at least four sites for the Tatas to choose from.         
	Sanand in Ahmedabad district and Mundra in Kutch were the favourites. Khambat and Dahej were the other sites.        
	The Tatas found Sanand, 35km west of Ahmedabad, ideal for relocating the plant because of its advantages  in terms of location and logistics.         
	Unlike Singur, where some farmers were unwilling to give land, the Gujarat government has no such problem in Sanand.        
	It has located 1,100 acres for Tata Motors to set up the mother plant and ancillary units. The tract serves as a cattle farm for Anand Agriculture University, which falls in the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat of BJP leader L.K. Advani.        
	The university has been informed about the decision to transfer the land to the Tatas.         
	For building roads, the government has the backing of the farmers who are willing to give up their land, primarily because of the attractive compensation on offer. On Saturday, the revenue department issued a notification to acquire 60 acres in Chharodi and Vasna villages for building broad approach roads to the site.         
	Although the notification did not mention the Nano project, it was clear that the land was being acquired for a new industrial park and for the specific purpose of building a one-kilometre approach road connecting the plant to National Highway 8.        
	Yesterday, officials at the collectorate worked at lightening speed with six land owners of Chharodi to conclude a deal for 50.88 acres for approximately Rs 22.65 crore. The farmers were offered Rs 44.5 lakh an acre, nearly double the market rate of Rs 24.2 lakh.        
	Nazir Khan, the sarpanch of Chharodi village, who owns two bighas close to the site, said: We are happy to sell the land for construction of an approach road for the Nano project that will generate huge employment opportunities for the state and will transform our village life.         
	Hassle-free land transfer was possible because the government owns the land where the main plant is to come up. The land was gifted by the British in 1899 for setting up a cattle farm when most of India, including Gujarat, was reeling from famine. The then governor of Bombay state entered into an agreement with the farmers as well as rulers of the princely state of Sanand-Koth to acquire land for cattle grazing and conservation.         
	After Independence, the land was taken over by the state.         
	Sanand is near the proposed Dholera port, part of the Delhi-Mumbai freight corridor, and will help the Tatas in exporting the car.

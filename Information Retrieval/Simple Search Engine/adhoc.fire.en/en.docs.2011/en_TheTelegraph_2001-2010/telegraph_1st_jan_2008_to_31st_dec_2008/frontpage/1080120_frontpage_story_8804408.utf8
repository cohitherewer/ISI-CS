     OUR BUREAU
               
	Bangalore/Mumbai, Jan. 19: At Chandrakanth Sharmas two-storey rented home, the only signs of life are Rocky and Roxy, barking without end and incessantly running up and down the porch, sometimes chasing a crumpled ball of newspaper.
    
	A day after Sharma, his wife and son were arrested on charges of strangling their landlord, Bangalore police have decided to take the man who claimed he had murdered 20 others to Mumbai, Pune, Nashik and Aurangabad for investigations.
    
	We have released information on the 20 other murders based on what Sharma told us. We will try and find corroborative evidence, a police officer said today.
    
	The team that will take Sharma around on the fact-finding mission is scheduled to set out tonight itself.
    
	We also plan to question his three sisters and family members in Nashik about his criminal background while he was in his teens. Based on the investigation, we will put him through polygraph and narco-analysis tests, too, the officer said.
    
	Sharma had yesterday told the police he murdered 20 people between 1978 and 1981 in the four Maharashtra cities for gain or to avoid settling debts while being involved in illegal businesses.
    
	He was being questioned after his landlord Raghavans body was found in a gutter 180km from Bangalore. He and his family are believed to have ferried the disfigured body in the boot of their car on January 10 and dumped it.
    
	The police said the Raghavan murder would be their first priority. Forensic teams have found Raghavans hair follicles in the Sharmas car boot and at their home.
    
	The police also have the statements of the owner of a garage where the car was given a wash and two petrol pump attendants who remember having filled five litres in a can brought by the family. Petrol was used to burn Raghavans body.
    
	Today, we called the person who paid Rs 50 lakh advance to buy the house from Sharma. Our line of investigation is that Sharma was forcing Raghavan to sell the house for a pittance and had already struck a deal to sell it for Rs 1.5 crore. When he refused to sign on some forged documents, he was killed, an officer said.
    
	The Sharmas immediate neighbour, S. Raju, said the day Raghavan was possibly murdered he had heard their TV set to an unusually loud volume. Their son used to turn up the volume sometimes. That was nothing out of the ordinary. But after some time, we heard their car back out of the gate. I am not aware when they returned.
    
	Another neighbour said the family had been staying at HBR Layout IV block for only four months but had rented some rooms to students. For some strange reason, none stayed more than a few weeks, Srinivas said.
    
	Area corporator K.P. Sridhar, who is constructing an apartment complex opposite the Sharma home, recalled him as a smooth-talker with an opinion on everything.
    
	We used to talk about real estate, films, traffic congestion and other things outside his gate at least thrice a week. I could never imagine he would commit a murder, let alone boast of 20 others.
    
	A Mumbai police team will leave for Bangalore tonight. We havent heard from Bangalore police yet, but looking at news reports, we are despatching a crime branch team on our own, joint commissioner (crime) Rakesh Maria said.

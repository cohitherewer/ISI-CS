                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Clenched-fist exit   Musharraf accepts Saudi package

	Islamabad, Aug. 18: President Pervez Musharraf paused, blinked, looked straight into the TV camera and announced: I have decided to resign today.        
	Cars honked in celebration on the streets outside the presidential compound but the embattled 65-year-old former military ruler, now dressed in a grey suit and tie, spoke on grimly. He ended with a defiant gesture, raising a clenched fist to chest height and saying: Finally, goodbye to Pakistan. Long live Pakistan!        
	The camera stayed on him for a long, awkward moment as he stacked his note cards, glanced to one side and pushed his chair back, half rising.        
	As the one-hour afternoon speech ended, the Dawn TV network came back to its news anchor, who still looked a little stunned. Pervez Musharraf, he said. The former President of Pakistan.        
	Musharraf, threatened with impeachment by the coalition government, said he had consulted his aides before deciding to quit office, ending nine years in power  many of them as Americas most important ally in the war on terror.        
	Sources suggested Saudi Arabia had brokered a deal with the government to grant Musharraf legal indemnity over his actions as President, including imposition of emergency and the sacking of judges, and safe passage to a country of his choice. For the moment, though, he seems likely to stay in Pakistan.        
	The ruling coalition had drawn up impeachment charges yesterday, after a nine-day standoff with Musharraf, and threatened to start proceedings this week if he did not resign.        
	Rumours swirled that the President might use todays speech to dissolve the parliament. But Musharraf said he was putting national interest above personal bravado. Whether I win or lose the impeachment, the nation will lose, he said, adding that he was not prepared to put the presidency through the impeachment process.        
	He spelt out his legacy: On the map of the world, Pakistan is now an important country, by the grace of Allah.        
	The resignation comes two days after the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Muqrin bin Abdul Aziz, secretly visited Pakistan. The purpose of the visit was to meet Musharraf, his aides and other officials and to convince them about an amicable solution, including safe exit, an official told The Telegraph.        
	Even the army, which stayed neutral during the political crisis and tipped the scales against Musharraf, wanted an honourable exit for its former chief. Neither did the US want him dragged to the courts.        
	President Bush appreciates President Musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of Pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al Qaida and extremist groups, a White House spokesman today said.        
	A sombre Musharraf received a farewell guard of honour from a tri-services contingent on the presidential compound, shook hands with staff and left the building for the last time this afternoon.        
	He drove to Rawalpindis Army House, which he was using as a presidential camp office since quitting as army chief last November, and is expected to soon move to his farmhouse in Chak Shehzad, Islamabad. Some analysts suggested he might even try to revive his political career after the dust settles.        
	In case he decides to leave Pakistan with his family, his likeliest destination could be Saudi Arabia or Turkey. Analysts believe Muqrins package includes temporary residence in Saudi Arabia, which also sheltered Nawaz Sharif for seven years after he was deposed as Prime Minister by Musharrafs 1999 coup.        
	Sources said the Turkish envoy too had discussed asylum for Musharraf, who has childhood ties with the European country, where his father was posted as a diplomat.        
	Pakistans Speaker accepted Musharrafs resignation, and Senate (Upper House) chairman Mohammadmian Soomro, a Musharraf supporter, took charge as acting President. The ruling coalition  led by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Asif Ali Zardari and Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) chief Sharif  must now pick a new President within 30 days.        
	Zardari, widower of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, would like to be President but Sharif is unlikely to accept that. A ruling alliance source mentioned four likely candidates.        
	The PPP has proposed the names of its leaders Aftab Shaban Mirani and Shagufta Jumani, both from Sindh. Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto, Benazirs 19-year-old son, said the next President would be from the PPP.        
	Mehmud Khan Achakzai, a leader from Balochistan, is also under consideration, the source said. Sharif is backing Asfandyar Wali Khan, a Pashtun from the northwest, but may accept Mirani.                    WITH REPORTS FROM NYTNS AND LAT-WP

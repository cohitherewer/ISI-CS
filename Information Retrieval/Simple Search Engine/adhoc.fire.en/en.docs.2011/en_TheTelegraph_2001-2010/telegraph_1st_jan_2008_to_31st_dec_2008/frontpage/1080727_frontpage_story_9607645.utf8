	New Delhi, July 26: The low-intensity blasts in Bangalore yesterday and in Ahmedabad today  on the anniversary to mark Indias victory in the 1999 Kargil war  bear remarkable similarity to a scare scenario wargamed in the security establishment.        
	In city after city, in the wargamed scenario, terrorist attacks cause panic, forcing the political leadership into adopting sweeping administrative and military measures.        
	Bangalore has been the target of serial blasts earlier largely because, Indian security experts believe, there are vested interests at work to undermine Indias newer symbols of economic clout. In Jaipur, the blasts were feared to have targeted the Rajasthan capital that is a major attraction for domestic and foreign tourists.        
	In Ahmedabad, where riots in 2002 were largely a pogrom against Muslims, there has been suspicion of a terrorist backlash but it cannot be definitely said without an investigation by authorities that todays attacks are a sign of it.        
	The blasts come at a time Indias relations with Pakistan are in danger of getting into a tailspin, as foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said earlier this week after talks with his Pakistani counterpart.        
	Last month, just before the attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul  which foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee yesterday described as an attack on Indias sovereignty  there were at least three violations of the ceasefire along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.        
	This morning, too, a violation of ceasefire in Mendhar, a sensitive sector on the Line of Control, was reported. The difference this time is that the allegation of ceasefire violation was made first by the Pakistani side.        
	The Indian Army has said there was an exchange of fire but it has denied that it was responsible for the incident.        
	But the steady increase in violations of the ceasefire, that has held good for nearly five years, threatens to unravel the tenuous truce.        
	Terrorist attacks within the country add greater tension to relations between India and Pakistan just as they are beginning to slip back to the discomfort zone. Pressure has mounted within Pakistan, too, for Islamabad to give evidence of action against fundamentalist forces.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs government will now have a torrid time deciding what demonstrative action to take, with the BJP mounting a campaign in which it alleges that the UPA has dismantled the counter-terrorist apparatus that Atal Bihari Vajpayees NDA government had set up.

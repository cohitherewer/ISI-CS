                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Migrants return to post-backlash Mumbai
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Bachchan                                  
	Mumbai, April 8: Amitabh Bachchan will not leave Mumbai, and many who had left Maharashtra have returned.         
	Bachchan has evoked three Cs  courts, Constitution and conscience  to say he would never leave Mumbai even if his detractors resort to violent protests.        
	The actors comments came against the backdrop of Raj Thackerays campaign against north Indians, which prompted many migrants to leave Mumbai.        
	The three Cs appear to have come to the aid of the migrants who fled as well. Most of them have begun returning to the Satpur and Ambad industrial zones in Nashik with the government promising security.        
	More than 10,000 north Indian workers had left Nashiks industrial areas before Raj was arrested on February 13 for his partys anti-north Indian campaign.        
	We had pegged the figure between 12,000 and 15,000 workers. Nearly 70 per cent of them have returned to Nashik after Holi, said Dhananjay Bele, the president of the Ambad Industries and Manufacturers Association (AIMA) that represents 1,400 small, medium and large scale industries in the area.        
	Bele said nearly 25 per cent of the workers had returned after normality returned to the area, and Nashik police stepped up security. The numbers started swelling after Holi last month.        
	The Nashik police set up 22 temporary posts in the Satpur-Ambad industrial areas for round-the-clock surveillance. Additional forces were deployed, and a daily review of the security situation was conducted. Even now, reviews are conducted every Wednesday and Sunday. This has had a positive effect, Bele said.        
	Prashant Sathe, general secretary of Nasik Industries and Manufacturers Association (NIMA), said: Normality has been restored. We tried to get an approximate estimate of how many workers have returned, but it is difficult to put a figure. But yes, workers have started returning after Holi.         
	Nashik city has a migrant population of about 35,000, largely concentrated in industrial areas which boast big manufacturers like Mahindra and Mahindra, Schneider Electric, Jindal Steel, Crompton Greaves, ABB and Kirloskar Engineering.        
	Bachchans assertions came a day after friend Bal Thackeray called him a mahanayak (superstar) and warned that he should not be dragged into regionalism issues.        
	Every individual in a free society has the freedom of expression and speech, and I honour and respect that. But those who question me and my deeds or non-deeds need to know a simple fact: I am a public figure, not a public official. I am not a democratically elected representative of the people, neither do I hold a public office. I am answerable only to three Cs  courts, Constitution and conscience, the actor said in a media interview.        
	Bachchan, under attack from Rajs Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, said he had made Mumbai his home for the last 40 years and he was not an outsider by any stretch of imagination.        
	Bachchan had maintained silence for nearly two months after Raj first accused him of doing more for his native Uttar Pradesh than for Maharashtra.        
	But he lost his trademark cool last Saturday when a news report in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna criticised him. Sena chief Bal Thackeray had to hastily issue a statement distancing himself from the report and reiterate that Bachchan was a family friend.         
	Bal Thackeray went a step ahead and wrote an editorial yesterday describing Bachchan as a superhero of the entire country who should not be dragged into the regionalism controversy.        
	In the interview, Bachchan said: I am not leaving this city and going anywhere. Let them chuck a thousand bottles. Let them burn my effigies and conduct morchas in front of my house.         
	Let them blacken my film posters and stop screening of my films. Let them attack me with stones and laathis or whatever else is there in their arsenal. Let them abuse me in the print and electronic media. Let them implicate me in false cases. I am not budging.

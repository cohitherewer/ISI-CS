          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, Aug. 18: In a last ditch attempt to prove a point, the Madhu Koda government got into a flurry of activity much to the chagrin of JMM and BJP leaders.         
	The cabinet today approved the creation of nearly three dozen blocks and sub-divisions in the state  to expedite government services.         
	The decision is likely to benefit Kodas Assembly constituency, Jagannathpur, the most. Jagannathpur and Ranka have been made sub-divisions and Hatgamharia has been turned into a block.         
	The government approved the creation of 35 new blocks in the state and agreed in principle to create 11 more. Officials have been directed to complete necessary formalities at the earliest.         
	Independents supporting Madhu Koda in the crisis hour are slated to receive shots in their arms. While Jagannathpur is represented by Koda in the Assembly, Ranka belongs to Girinath Singh of the RJD. However, health minister Bhanu Pratap Shahi, who represents the adjoining Bhavnathpur, may grab credit for administering justice to Ranka. Hatgamharia happens to be the nerve centre of Kodas politics.         
	The much-awaited reservation quota for extremely backward and backward communities, popularly known as Annexures 1 and 2, were outlined with extremely backward communities receiving 8 per cent reservation and backward communities bagging 6 per cent reservation. Gopes and Gwalas of East and West Singhbum and Seraikela entered the reservation list to be identified with Gauds and Magdagauds, but with different surnames.         
	The Koda cabinet also gave its nod to family courts in Chatra, West Singhbhum, Palamau, Garhwa, Godda, Gumla, Latehar, Pakur and Sahebganj, with district welfare offices in Ramgarh and Khunti. For this the cabinet approved Rs 22.93 crore and sanctioned 12 new official posts.         
	The apart, the cabinet approved the release of Rs 30.25 crore for building 12 new ITIs and another Rs 23.82 crore for setting up new ITIs at places that do not have one at present.         
	The moves, however, invited rebuke from JMM chief Shibu Soren and the BJP. A minority government has no right to take such decisions, said a BJP member.

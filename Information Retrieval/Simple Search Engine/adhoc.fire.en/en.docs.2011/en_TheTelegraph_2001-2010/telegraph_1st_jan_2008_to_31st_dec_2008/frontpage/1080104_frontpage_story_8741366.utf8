	Washington, Jan. 3: Students at Bowling Green State University in Ohio are mourning the death of a 25-year-old Calcutta girl, Sweety Mazumdar, and another student, who met with a fatal road accident in the early hours of yesterday while returning from an extended New Year celebration in Chicago.
    
	Another student from Calcutta, Mridutpal Nag, 25, Puran De, 22, of Bakhrabad in Bengals West Midnapore district, and Rahul Mukherjee, 24, of Ranchi, were injured when the rented mini van in which they were travelling overturned on an icy toll road in Indiana.
    
	The mishap killed Apsana Giri, a 26-year-old biology student from Kathmandu, with whom Mazumdar shared an apartment outside the university campus. 
    
	Twenty-four-year-old Nigel DSouza from Pune was also injured in the accident, according to a media release from the university.
    
	Mohammad Chowdhury, a 25-year-old physics student from Bangladesh, who was driving the van, was treated along with the other students at a nearby hospital. 
    
	Except Chowdhury, all the other students involved in the accident were new to the US and had completed just about four months at the university. 
    
	University president Sidney Ribeau said: The Bowling Green State University community extends its deepest condolences to the families of two international students killed in the tragic accident. Our thoughts and prayers are with them, with the five other students involved in the accident, and with our international community in this time of sadness.
    
	Giri died on the spot because she was pinned underneath the van after it overturned twice and landed on its roof, Rodney Snyder, a paramedic, who was the first on the scene, told the local media.
    
	Both Giri and Mazumdar were thrown out of the vehicle from the impact when it hit the highways median before overturning.
    
	According to conclusions by police, Mazumdar was thrown into the opposite side of the toll road, where a passing vehicle may have ploughed into her.
    
	An air ambulance despatched by local authorities to rescue the victims and fly them to a hospital could not land because of the snow and strong winds in the area where the accident occurred, Snyder said.
    
	Mazumdar was taken to a hospital in Angola, from where she was transferred to a bigger facility in Fort Wayne by ambulance, but she died at 5.25am, about five hours after the accident.
    
	State trooper Erick Gilliam was quoted as telling Ohio newspapers that roads in the area where the accident occurred were slippery and that the wind was blowing pretty heavy up there.
    
	He said the police were investigating the accident to determine what part the weather played in the mishap.
    
	The university sent a bus and personnel to bring the injured students to the campus, where they will be temporarily housed, though they live in apartments outside the university.
    
	The state-assisted university, founded in 1910, has a 1,338-acre main campus in Bowling Green and a second 216-acre campus in Huron, both in Ohio.
    
	The university, which charges $23,546 per foreign undergraduate student a year towards fees, room and meals, has 20,684 students.
    
	During the current academic year, 687 of them were foreigners. A substantial number of students appear to be Bengali-speaking from West Bengal and the eastern region or from Bangladesh.
    
	Mahesh Pillai, who is listed as vice-president of the universitys Indian Student Association on the organisations website, told local reporters that the students were just getting to know one another because they were mostly new to the campus.
    
	Mazumdar was pursuing a Masters degree in geology and De a PhD in photochemicals. Nag and Mukherjee were both Masters students in applied statistics and communications, respectively, while DSouza was doing his doctorate in biology. 
    
	A press release by the university said the five students received minor injuries.

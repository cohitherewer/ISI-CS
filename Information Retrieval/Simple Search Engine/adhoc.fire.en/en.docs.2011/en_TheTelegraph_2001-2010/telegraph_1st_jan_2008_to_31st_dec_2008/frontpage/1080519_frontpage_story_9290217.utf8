  - Counter-insurgency remark irks villagers        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Imphal, May 18: A stray comment by the Manipur director-general of police about plans to use special police officers recruited from Heirok a fortnight ago for counter-insurgency operations has put the arms-seeking villagers on the back foot.        
	The Joint Action Committee of Heirok, which had been instrumental in the governments decision to arm villagers for self-defence by opening SPO units in this Thoubal hamlet, now wants the specific guidelines on which the units will be run.        
	We demanded weapons for self-defence and not to take part in counter-insurgency operations of the security forces. We will not accept any SPO units if they are going to be used in counter-insurgency operations, L. Mandir, the secretary of the Heirok action committee, said today.         
	Residents of Heirok had demanded weapons for self-defence after three youths were killed by a group of militants during a Yaoshang (Holi) celebration on March 24.         
	The recruitment drive began on May 5 at Heirok, where 300 SPOs were recruited.        
	Mandir today said the final decision on SPOs would be taken by the people of Heirok after studying the guidelines on the functioning of the units.         
	Though DGP Yumnam Joykumar Singhs reported comment could not be undone, a senior minister rushed to explain that the government would discuss the mode of operation of the SPOs after it puts together its own report on the units.        
	The Okram Ibobi Singh government, in fact, had sent two police officers to Kashmir to study the working of SPOs in the state.         
	Thoubal superintendent of police Clay Khongsai and Imphal West sub-divisional police officer Jhaljit Singh returned to Imphal on Friday from Kashmir and submitted a report to the director-general of police.         
	The chief minister is in New Delhi. We are waiting for his return. We will hold a meeting on the report submitted by the two police officers and then discuss the matter with the people of Heirok, said a minister, who did not wish to be named.         
	He, however, clarified that the state government would not use the SPO units in counter-insurgency operations.         
	There is a misunderstanding between the government and the people of Heirok. Things will be clarified, he said.         
	Heiroks misgivings have cropped up at a time when various citizens organisations have been rallying against the governments move to arm civilians, saying it would only cause more bloodshed.        
	A group of women today tried to hold a demonstration outside the gate of Ibobi Singhs official residence demanding release of Sapamcha Kangleipal, who was arrested and detained under the National Security Act for criticising the governments decision to arm civilians.         
	Police managed to disperse the protesters without any use of force.

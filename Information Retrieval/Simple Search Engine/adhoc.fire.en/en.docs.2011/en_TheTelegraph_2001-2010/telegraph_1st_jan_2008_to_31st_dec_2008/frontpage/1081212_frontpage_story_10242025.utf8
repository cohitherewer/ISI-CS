          NASIR JAFFRY IN ISLAMABAD                               
	Dec. 11: Pakistan has put under house arrest the founder of the Lashkar-e-Toiba and banned his charity, seizing on a UN blacklist it hopes will help answer charges at home that it acted under Indian pressure.        
	The Lahore house of Lashkar founder Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, whose name was added to the UN blacklist, has been surrounded by Pakistani security forces. A source said the house arrest would be in force for three months.        
	Police have encircled the house and told him he cannot go out of home, a spokesperson for Saeed said.        
	Saeed officially quit the leadership of the Lashkar in 2001 to become the head of the charity, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, that was declared a terrorist organisation by the UN earlier in the day.         
	Pakistan, which had promised yesterday to toe the UN line, formally proscribed the Dawa  a step viewed with deep scepticism by India as militants are adept at renaming their organisations and bouncing back with renewed ferocity as had happened in the case of the Lashkar.        
	Dozens of offices of the Dawa are being sealed in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Peshawar but the members have gone underground, the source said. Schools and hospitals run by the outfit are being allowed to function, he added.        
	Besides Saeed, the names of three other Lashkar leaders have been added to the UN terrorist list. They are Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, the suspected Mumbai attack mastermind, Haji Muhammad Ashraf, the chief of finance, and Zaki-ur-Bahaziq, an India-born Saudi national who is one of the prime financiers of the outfit.        
	The names of the Dawa and the four have been included under UN Resolution 1267, also known as the Al Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee. Under this, all member states are obliged to freeze assets of listed individuals and entities, ban their travel and forbid any support from within and outside their country. Pakistans central bank said this evening that all banks in the country had been ordered to freeze the Dawas assets.        
	The UN announcement came hours before US deputy secretary of state John D. Negroponte came calling on Yousaf Raza Gilani in Islamabad.        
	Dawa founder Saeed criticised the UN for clamping sanctions on a charitable organisation. The UNs decision to impose a ban on us is an attack on Islam, Pakistan and all religious forces, he said before the house arrest. If India or the US has any proof against the Dawa, we are ready to stand in any court. We do not beg, we demand justice.         
	Pakistan, too, had been complaining that India had not shared evidence.        
	Officials in India wondered how much impact the terrorist tag would have because similar designations in the past have had little effect. The Lashkar has been on the terrorist list of the US since 2001, was banned by Pakistan the following year and included in the UN terrorist outfit list in 2005. Yet, its leaders enrolled in the Dawa, operated with impunity, organised jihadi camps and carried out terror strikes in India.         
	The Jaish-e-Mohammad, banned since 2002, reopened its offices across Pakistan and operated under a new name  Khadam-e-Islam.         
	Every militant group operating in Kashmir has been proscribed but they have used shadowy organisations to carry out strikes. Some of the outfits that stake claim to the attacks include the Save Kashmir Front, Al Nasireen, Al Mansorain and Al Madina.         
	Inputs from Muzaffar Raina in Srinagar and Ananya Sengupta in New Delhi

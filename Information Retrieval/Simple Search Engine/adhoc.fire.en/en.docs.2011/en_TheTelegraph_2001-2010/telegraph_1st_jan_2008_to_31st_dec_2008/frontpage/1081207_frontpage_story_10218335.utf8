          A STAFF REPORTER                                                
	Calcutta, Dec. 6: The Mumbai carnage has thrown up a Calcutta link, with the first two Indians arrested being a Beniapukur youth and a Kashmiri shawl seller who turned auto driver here before returning home three years ago.        
	A city police team nabbed Tausif Rehman, 21, apparently outside Howrah station yesterday while another flew to Delhi to lay a trap for his friend Mukhtar Ahmed, 37 (see graphic).        
	Mumbai police had told the Calcutta special task force (STF) they had found a SIM card bought from the Bengal capital tucked into a pouch attached to a belt worn by slain terrorist Abu Ismail.        
	It was one of 22 pre-activated cards that transport worker Tausif bought from shops in Beniapukur, Park Circus and Phears Lane and handed over to Mukhtar when he came here in October, officers said.        
	They said Mukhtar, who was flown to Calcutta last night, could be a Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami conduit with links to the Lashkar-e-Toiba. A Mumbai police team arrived tonight to question the duo, remanded till December 19.        
	Tausif, resident of Ostagar Lane, bought 12 SIMs against the voter ID card of his deceased uncle Ashraf Numan, said STF officer Rajeev Kumar. Tausif confessed to buying 10 more SIMs without showing any identity proof.        
	When the STF found that Numan was dead they began monitoring call details of Tausif and his younger brother, a kitchen worker at a five-star hotel, who turned out to be clean. Questioned about the calls from a Srinagar number in September-October, Tausif confessed how Mukhtar put him up to the job, an officer said. Tausifs family cast doubt on the date of arrest, saying he had been missing since Tuesday.         
	Two officers had left for Srinagar on Wednesday after tracing Mukhtars number from call statements, but he wasnt home. From Mukhtars call records, we traced a man who had made several calls to him, an officer said. He told us Mukhtar had left for Delhi. We asked him to call Mukhtar, tell him he was coming to Delhi and ask for his address so they could meet.        
	At his Delhi hotel, Mukhtar claimed he was a J amp;K police constable, an officer said. He screamed, How can you do this to me, I too am a policeman.        
	The duo have been booked not for terror but for cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy. Our probe focused on the SIMs, an officer said. Tausif said he was only looking to make a quick buck.

          SHAHNAWAZ AKHTAR                              
	Giridih, June 8: In a rerun of the Lalit Mehta murder case, Kameshwar Yadav, an NREGA activist, was killed by unidentified gunmen near Gaadi village about nine last night.        
	Kameshwar was returning to his Khatori residence  about 75km from here  after taking part in a CPI-ML bandh over the fuel price rise in block headquarters Deori.        
	Rajkumar Yadav, a CPI-ML state committee member, said being a morally upright person, Kameshwar had questioned  under the Right to Information Act  the nexus flourishing among officers, leaders, contractors and middlemen regarding minor irrigation work in Deori.         
	Kameshwar was also a block committee member of the party. CPI-ML leaders, including MLA Vinod Singh, blocked the Jamua-Koderma road for around six hours today demanding the arrest of criminals. Giridih SP Murari Lal Meena said that the killers would be arrested within June 13.

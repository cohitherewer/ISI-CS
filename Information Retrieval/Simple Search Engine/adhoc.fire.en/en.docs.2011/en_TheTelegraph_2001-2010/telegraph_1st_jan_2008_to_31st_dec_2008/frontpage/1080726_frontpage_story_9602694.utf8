          SIMON JOHNSON                             Brown                                  
	London, July 25: In a stunning coup, the Scottish National Party overturned a huge 13,507 majority in Glasgow East and clinched the former Labour stronghold by 365 votes.        
	The result followed a call by Alex Salmond, the SNP leader, for voters to deliver a political earthquake and punish Gordon Brown and his government.        
	Before the disastrous result, Downing Street had taken the pragmatic view that any win will do to give Brown breathing space. But the Prime Minister now faces three months of growing speculation and unrest about his leadership, in the run-up to the September party conference.        
	The defeat sends a chilling message about Labours electoral prospects to already dissatisfied party backbenchers, the majority of whom enjoy much smaller majorities.        
	More of the partys MPs will start questioning whether he can lead the party to even respectability at the next election. Many fear a wipe-out by a resurgent Tory party.        
	Some MPs will urge the men in grey suits  a delegation of Labour grandees  to tell Brown that his time is up. Labours collapse in a working class area also suggests that the partys traditional support is joining the middle classes in turning their backs on the party.        
	Brown has already seen a safe Labour seat lost in May when a 7,000 majority in Crewe and Nantwich was reversed by the Tories.         
	But for half a century, Labour has enjoyed political supremacy in the east end of Glasgow  the partys 25th safest seat in the country and its third most secure in Browns Scottish heartland.        
	John Mason, the successful SNP candidate, polled 11,277 votes (43 per cent) and Labours Margaret Curran 10,912 (42 per cent). The SNPs vote increased 26 percentage points on the 2005 general election, while Labours fell 19 points.        
	The confirmed result was greeted with wild celebrations by the Nationalists when it was announced at Glasgows Tollcross Leisure Centre.         
	Delivering his victory speech before ecstatic activists, Mason said: Three weeks ago the SNP predicted a political earthquake. This SNP victory is not just a political earthquake, it is off the Richter scale. It is an epic win.

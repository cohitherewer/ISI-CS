          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, May 22: An associate of the Salim group, many of whose infrastructure projects fall in the rural belt captured by the Trinamul Congress, has said the consortium was investing in the state and expressed confidence of getting the support of the new zilla parishad.        
	We know India is not China. It is a democracy. And democracy is not a risk for us. The projects would develop the area. I am confident of getting support from the new zilla parishad, Prasoon Mukherjee, the director of New Kolkata International Development (NKID), told The Telegraph from Indonesia today. The Salim group is one of the investors in NKID.        
	We are investing in the state, Mukherjee added, suggesting that the change in political equations need not come in the way of development projects.        
	The groups proposed projects include a six-lane highway connecting Barasat in North 24-Parganas to Raichak in South 24-Parganas, a host of industrial clusters and housing projects, two SEZs and two bridges. Some of these projects are slated to come up in South 24-Parganas, where the zilla parishad will be formed by Trinamul.        
	Industry minister Nirupam Sen also sought to reassure potential investors, saying there is no question of a review or rollback of the industrial policy.        
	Sen, however, admitted that people had differences with the governments style of functioning. We will have to take a lesson, but that does not mean they have voted against industrialisation in Bengal, he added.        
	Responding to a question on the Trinamul leaderships threat of halting construction of the Tata Motors factory at Singur, Sen said: The question does not arise. The Tata project will be completed in due course.        
	But many projects on paper face an uphill task. The state cabinet has the power to overrule zilla parishads and acquire land but it will be difficult to execute projects on the ground if the local administration does not cooperate.        
	NKID will need around 16,000 acres, excluding the SEZs, in South 24-Parganas and nearby East Midnapore whose zilla parishad has also gone to Trinamul.        
	South 24-Parganas and East Midnapore are crucial for industry because of their proximity to the sea. The seafront and both sides of the Hooghly river estuary will now be controlled by Trinamul.        
	One of the immediate casualties could be a ship-building yard proposed by the Apeejay Group at Mahishadal.

	Despite having virtually everything that a great city must have, there are still some things  in matters culinary  that Calcutta lacks. One is affordable restaurants that are open all night, legally, without some understanding with the authorities. The few options we do have offer extremely limited selections, no ambience to talk about and most of the time you end up putting your food on the bonnet of your car and eating standing up.  
	How nice it would be to walk into an air-conditioned well-appointed restaurant at 3am and have some hot soup and a plateful of chow  filling and light  just what the doc would order at that hour. You can, of course, do that at any of the five-star hotel coffee shops, but how many people can do that on a regular basis.  
	Another thing, we lack  or lacked, till recently  is top-quality Oriental cuisine, including in terms of selection, home delivered. Although more than half the restaurants in the city  from hole-in-the-wall places to bigger establishments in the city  offer home delivery, whatever their cuisine, most of it is pretty non-descript. Don Giovannis, who started pizza delivery in Calcutta about a decade ago, delivers good Oriental food (around the clock, in some areas), but the new place which is todays story, Orient Express, has the edge, in my opinion, on three counts.  
	The first, and most important for home delivery, is a simple matter of technology. The boxes in which Orient Express sends their food are microwave-friendly. Even if you dont eat as soon as the food arrives, you can just pop the boxes into the micro whenever youre ready; the boxes open up shaped somewhat like bowls, so you can eat out of the box. If its got noodles in it, just add accompaniments and go for it. Whats not finished can go in the fridge, and when required again, just micro.   
	All that needs washing is chopsticks or cutlery. Theres no mess. When something finishes, just bin it. The lady of the house can relax. Peace reigns.  
	The second count is the selection. It is an imaginative and knowledgeable choice thats probably because its all purely Oriental, so enough thought can be given to variety. Ten or 12 appetisers (veg and non-veg), salads, soups and main course items. Fourteen main course items listed under veg and the non-veg includes chicken, lamb and seafood (fish, prawn and crab).  
	For starters, I have tried their Suimai with a seafood stuffing which has been marinated with oyster sauce and wine. A kind of dim sum, these open dumplings are steamed and served with sauces; their filling is ample, and the dough wrappers are nice and thin.  
	The Japanese Grilled Chicken Salad is a light and delicate item. Grilled chicken is shredded and tossed with Kikkoman soya sauce, sesame oil, chilli flakes, coloured peppers and bean sprouts.  
	Wild Mushrooms Chiang Mai Style is a fine vegetarian dish. Several varieties of mushroom including oyster, shiitake and button are used. Garlic is sauteed with black pepper and green chillies, vegetable stock is added and the mushrooms are cooked in this. Some adjustment in the seasoning and the dish is finished with coconut milk.  
	The non-veg main course item I tried was Sliced Lamb Pineapple in Green Chilli Sauce. Garlic and green chillies are sauteed in oil and then green chilli sauce is added. Thinly sliced lamb, green peppers and pineapple go in next and this is stir fried till the lamb is almost done. The dish is finished with a dash of white vinegar.  
	Manila Crab Curry and Pot Roasted Chilli Crabs are there for crab lovers and there are dishes from Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, not to mention the Thai curries which have become regular Calcutta fare, and the intriguing Lamb Jungle Curry that I have not tried. While Orient Express is a new operation, the tie-up for the food is with the Oriental section of Tangerine, a tried and tested restaurant which has survived well. Orient Express has its own kitchen, but the know-how and the savvy comes from Tangerine.  
	Finally, a word about the prices. Orient Express gives value for money. Starters, salads and soups go from Rs 55 to Rs 125 and main course dishes are a shade more. Only prawn items cross the Rs 220 mark; combo meals are also reasonable. The phone nos are 32944545/2020.

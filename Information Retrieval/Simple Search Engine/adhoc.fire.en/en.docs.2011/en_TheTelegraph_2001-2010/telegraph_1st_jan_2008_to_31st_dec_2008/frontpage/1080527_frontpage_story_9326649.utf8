                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Angry RIMS staff shut down clinic
  - OPD to stay closed for three days          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Imphal, May 26: The Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) today plunged into a deep crisis as angry doctors and students closed down the out-patient and casualty departments for three days from this morning following last nights bomb blast inside the hospital.        
	Though no one was injured in the explosion  which took place around 10pm  doctors and nurses today refused to work in the OPD as a mark of protest.        
	The decision to shut down the OPD and casualty departments was taken around noon today by a joint meeting of heads of departments, doctors, nurses and students. The employees also staged a sit-in near the OPD block from 1pm.        
	Sources at RIMS said the closure would seriously affect patients. There is a lot of anger at present among the RIMS staff. This could turn into a prolonged agitation if the government failed to give a firm assurance on protecting the staff, a senior doctor said.        
	An IED planted by members of the Kangleipak Communist Party (Military Council) in front of the pathology and microbiology departments shook the institute last night. The IED was exploded by a timer device.         
	The blast did not cause any casualty, but damaged windowpanes of the department and the office of director L. Fimate. The site is also close to the directors office.        
	A spokesman for the group claimed responsibility for the attack, but did not give any reason. Fimate, too, could not offer any explanation nor any motive.        
	Sources at RIMS, however, said about one week back a caller from the group made monetary demands over phone.        
	This is the same group that exploded a powerful IED inside Imphals VIP colony on April 24, injuring four civilians.        
	The Okram Ibobi Singh government was yet to make any official reaction to last nights last. Several employees today skipped work even before the shutdown was declared.         
	Medical superintendent Y. Mohen Singh said the doctors and nurses would attend to in-house patients, but would not admit fresh patients during the strike. Only emergency life-saving operations would be performed. Classes would be suspended.        
	The attack comes at a time when the Union health ministry is trying to turn the institute into a centre of excellence.                                
	On May 14, Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss laid the foundation stone of a nursing college and a dental college during his two-day visit. He also announced opening of a 300-bed super-speciality hospital.        
	These bomb attacks may seriously hamper development projects, Fimate said.        
	The director today sent a report to the health ministry. He also requested the state government to set up a police outpost inside the complex and intensify patrolling.        
	Camp busted        
	A joint team of police and Assam Rifles this afternoon busted a camp of the Kangleipak Communist Party (Military Council) after killing one of its members in an encounter in Sadar Hills of Senapati district.         
	The forces also rescued a hostage from the militant camp and seized a 9mm pistol. Police said the camp belonged to KCP (Military Council). The troops destroyed the camp by setting it on fire. They also detained two girls from near the camp for verification.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             While the NDA sales tax slash pleased most citizens, political parties continued their protests.

(PTI )                                
	Patna, June 5: Bihar today promulgated an ordinance bringing down the sales tax on petrol and diesel from 27 per cent to 24.5 per cent and from 20 per cent to 18.36 per cent, respectively.         
	The move is believed to have enabled Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar to score a point over the UPA chairperson and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, as Nitish has acted quicker than the Congress or UPA chief ministers ruling in about six Indian states.         
	Commercial tax commissioner Shubhkirti Mazumdar told The Telegraph: The ordinance stands effective with immediate effect and brings down the sales tax on petrol to 2.5 per cent and on diesel to 1.64 per cent.         
	Bihar Governor R.S. Gavai may be away in New Delhi, but, sources in commercial tax department said, Nitish was so eager to promulgate the ordinance ahead of others that he asked officials concerned to acquire the governors signature through fax. The governor obliged the government by signing the faxed document in Delhi around 4pm today.                     An effigy of petrol minister Murli Deora. PTI and Telegraph pictures		    
	Mazumdar added that it was not possible for the government to bring down the sales tax on cooking gas, as the LPG was a declared commodity under central sales tax.         
	But the government has done whatever it could have done to provide relief to its people.         
	Though the move will marginally bring down the prices of petrol and diesel in the state, it is all set to send a strong message to the electorate that Nitish Kumar has turned out to be quite a saviour.         
	The chief minister strongly criticised the Congress and the Left in general and Lalu Prasad in particular for shedding crocodile tears on peoples plight after allowing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to raise the prices. Sensing the political repercussion Nitishs move may have, railway minister praised the Bihar chief minister.         
	The leaders (read Lalu) know that people will not forgive them at the polls. I need no praise from leaders who have lost face, Nitish said.

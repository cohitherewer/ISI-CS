  - Speaker election only after trust vote        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Shillong, March 17: In a departure from convention, Meghalaya chief minister D.D. Lapang will take his floor test before the Speakers election.         
	The last time acting governor S.S. Sidhu acceded to a request from Lapang  he gave the chief minister 10 days to prove his majority  the Purno A. Sangma-led Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA) went to court. Today, there was only mild protest from the Opposition when Lapang and pro tem Speaker H.S. Lyngdoh convinced Sidhu to allow the vote of confidence to be held first.        
	Sangma, whose Nationalist Congress Party is a constituent of the MPA, said he agreed to the break with tradition because it was not unconstitutional for a floor test to be held under the pro tem Speaker. I am agreeing to the decision, but I will bring it up for discussion if there is a debate on the confidence motion on Wednesday.        
	The Speakers election is slated for the next day.         
	The MPA  apart from the NCP, it includes the regional parties that were Lapangs allies in the previous government  is confident that the chief minister will have to step down. Sangma said Lapang should gracefully quit before he is humiliated in the floor test.         
	The constituents of the MPA met at United Democratic Party chief Donkupar Roys house this morning. Sources said the leadership decided to issue a common whip to the constituents of the alliance before the floor test.         
	In contrast, there was very little political activity at Lapangs residence.         
	On whether he suspected a motive behind Lapangs request for the Speakers election to be held only on Thursday, Sangma said it did not appear to be a tactical move. In any case, it does not matter to us. The pro tem Speaker and the proposed Speaker are on our side.        
	The Tura legislator said he was confident the MPA would not only oust Lapang and form the government, but also last at least two terms. He said Lapangs remark about the alliance not being strong to last even three months in office was, in fact, an admission of defeat before the actual floor test.        
	Roy echoed Sangma on Lapangs chances of emerging unscathed from the floor test. He said the UDP had made it clear to the chief minister that it would not switch sides to back him.        
	On whether Lapang was in touch with the UDP, he said there was no question of any negotiation after their relationship had reached the point of no return.         
	The UDP leader said his party believed in stability, mutual respect for allies, a corruption-free government and development through proper planning.         
	The chief whip of the Meghalaya United Alliance, Congress legislator Charles Pyngrope, said the MPA would become a divided house in the event of forming a government. He said Meghalaya would get a stable government only if either the UDP or the NCP teamed up with his party.        
	The NCP has 14 seats and the UDP 11. The Hill State Peoples Democratic Party has two and the Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement and the BJP one each. There are five Independents. The one seat that remains to be decided is Baghmara in the South Garo Hills. Polling was countermanded after the death of the sitting legislator and will be held on March 22.

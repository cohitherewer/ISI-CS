                                                                                                           Price fight with sugar, air fare up 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, April 1: The Centre today sought to pump sugar into the market and promised to procure more wheat but the price spike moved from the ground to the air.        
	Airlines said they were planning to raise ticket prices after the recent jump in the aviation turbine fuel (ATF) rates. Leading the way, Vijay Mallyas Kingfisher Airlines has raised charges by Rs 150- 350.         
	The food ministry has decided to unlock 2 million tonnes of sugar from the buffer stock, starting next month.        
	It also promised to increase procurement of wheat, demand for which has risen because of changing dietary habits in traditionally rice-consuming states.        
	We are going to take precautions. We have to procure maximum (quantity of wheat), agriculture and food minister Sharad Pawar said.

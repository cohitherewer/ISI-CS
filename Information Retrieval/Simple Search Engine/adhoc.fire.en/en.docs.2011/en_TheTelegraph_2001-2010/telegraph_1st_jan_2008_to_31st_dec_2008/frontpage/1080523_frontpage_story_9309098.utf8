  - Lowest bidder with manufacturing facilities chosen to fit budget          AMIT GUPTA                                    
	Ranchi, May 22: Often rapped by the Centre for tardy progress on development projects  read JNNURM  the state government came in for some unexpected praise from the Centre for the way it had handled purchases for its renewable energy programme.         
	Impressed with the Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agencys (JREDA) success in procuring solar powered gizmos at lower rates, the Union ministry of new and renewable energy has given a go-ahead in principle for adopting the purchase methodology adopted here.         
	The JREDAs feat came to light during a recent training programme on the implementation of renewable energy programmes. Nodal officials of all the states participated in the programme that was sponsored by the Union ministry and organised by JREDA.         
	Director P.C. Maithani and under secretary A.N. Narayanan applauded the JREDAs effort and said the system adopted by the state in procuring solar powered equipment would be followed in other states.        
	The ministry officials applauded JREDAs work in implementing solar energy programmes and its cost-effective mechanism. Officials agreed, in principle, to follow the system adopted by JREDA in tender processes, technical evaluation mechanisms and price evaluations in other states, said Arvind Kumar, the head of mechanical engineering department of BIT, Mesra, which provides technical assistance to JREDA.         
	JREDA bought each solar lantern for Rs 2,977 last year, approximately Rs 800 less than what other states paid. For solar home lighting systems, too, the state got a better deal with the JREDA buying them for about Rs 12,691.         
	For solar streetlights, JREDA bought a single unit for Rs 24,691 when other states shelled out a whopping Rs 30,000.        
	How did they do it? JREDA sources said they only considered lowest financial bids offered by companies involved in the manufacture of photo-voltaic solar modules, batteries and electronic circuits. If the lowest bidder conformed to the technical requirements and was able to supply the required numbers, JREDA accepted the proposal. If the lowest bidder fails to meet the JREDAs requirement, we approach other bidders to convince them to supply the units at the rate offered by the lowest bidder, said a senior JREDA official.

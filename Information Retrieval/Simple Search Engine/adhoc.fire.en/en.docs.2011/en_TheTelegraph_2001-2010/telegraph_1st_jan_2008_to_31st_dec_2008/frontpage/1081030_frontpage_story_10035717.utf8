  - SC ruling prompts Naveen to act        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 29: The state government will formulate a set of guidelines for providing assistance to reconstruct and repair religious institutions damaged during the Kandhamal riots as per Supreme Court guidelines.        
	A decision to this effect was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik here to review the situation in Kandhamal.        
	Home secretary T.K. Mishra said the revenue secretary was instructed by the chief minister to formulate the guidelines. On the basis of the guidelines, the Kandhamal district administration would assess the damage caused to religious institutions during the riots.        
	The government would consider providing reasonable assistance to the damaged institutions on the basis of the assessment report of the district collector, he said.         
	Mishra said Kandhamal collector Krishan Kumar had sought certain clarifications on the procedures of the assessment of damage caused to religious institutions. This has been necessitated since for the first time the government is going to provide financial assistance to religious institutions damaged during riots. The Orissa Relief Code has no provision for providing assistance in such case, he said.        
	Recently, the state government has decided to provide financial assistance for repair and reconstruction of riots-damaged religious institutions in compliance with the Supreme Court order.        
	Kumar sought to know the definition of religious institutions and enquired as to whether pastor training centre, nun hostel or a prayer hall associated with a church would be treated as a religious institution.         
	He also sought the clarification on the method to assess the immovable property of a church or temple and whether a religious institution built on a public, forest, private and tribal land would be considered for damage assessment.        
	Raphael Cheenath, archbishop of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese, in his writ petition filed in the Supreme Court had sought a compensation of Rs 3 crore for reconstruction of churches and prayer houses damaged in the riots.         
	The government, in its counter affidavit, had refused to provide any compensation to the damaged churches stating that it would go against its secular policy.        
	The apex court had left the matter with the state government asking it to consider the case generously. Complying with the court direction, the government decided to provide reasonable assistance to all religious institutions damaged during the riots.        
	Kumar told reporters that no incident of violence had been reported in the district since the past 20 days. Riot victims from Baliguda, Kotgarh and Phiringia blocks, who had taken shelter in relief camps, had gone back home. Now, only 10,500 riot victims were staying in relief camps.        
	Stating that the district administration had laid down certain principles for resettlement and rehabilitation, Kumar said the riot-hit people were required to go back to their villages, settle at their earlier places of stay. There would be no separate rehabilitation colony. The villagers had to adhere to their own religion and no conversion or re-conversion would be allowed. Rehabilitation works had already started and would be completed within three-four months, he said.        
	Quoting an estimate that about 3,600 houses were damaged during the recent riots, Kumar said the administration had started disbursing house building assistance of Rs 10,000 as first instalment.        
	Ex-gratia assistance of Rs 1 lakh was paid to the nearest kin of each 32 victims, he said, adding that payment had not been made in three cases in which bodies were not found.

                                                                                                           Opp. walks out on governor
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 13: The budget session of the Assembly started today with the boycott of governors customary address to the House by the Opposition alleging that his speech was far from reality and full of false promises.        
	As soon as Governor M.C. Bhandare started reading out his 40-page speech, leader of Opposition J.B. Patnaik stood up and started addressing the House. As Bhandare went on highlighting various achievements of the government and its plans and programmes, Patnaik requested him not to read out the speech written by the government.         
	Why do you waste your time reading a speech that is far from reality and full of false promises? he asked.        
	Flaying the NDA government for its anti-farmer attitude, the leader of Opposition asked: How can this government call itself a friend of farmers after depriving them of their rights to irrigation and forcing them to commit suicide for non-payment of loan while giving Rs 2,300 crore relief to an industrial house?        
	He also asked the governor if his speech had mention about the poor law and order situation in the state and a minister forcibly setting free an offender taking its advantage.        
	The veteran leader was referring to the recent incident in which state urban development minister K.V. Singhdeo allegedly forcibly released an accused from the lockup of Patnagarh police station under his home constituency.        
	Expressing concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state, the former chief minister said a notorious gangster was designing heinous crimes from jail.        
	He also mentioned about the multi-crore scams in the World Bank-funded Orissa Health System Development Project and the Centre-sponsored National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.        
	I know your speech conceals all the ghastly misdeeds of the government and eulogises the so-called successes, said Patnaik before staging a walkout as a mark of protest. Members of Congress, NCP, JMM, CPI, CPM and SUCI followed him.        
	However, unfazed by the Opposition walkout, Governor Bhandare went on reading out his speech for 80 minutes.                             
	Bhandare said the state government was giving priority to agriculture and irrigation. Emphasis was also being laid on establishment of various industrial projects, including steel, aluminium and thermal power plants.        
	He also stated that the state government could resolve the communal situation in Kandhamal district within four days and dreaded Maoists were surrendering.        
	Later, the chief whip of the ruling BJD-BJP combine, Kishore Mohanty, moved an official motion to thank the governor for addressing the House.

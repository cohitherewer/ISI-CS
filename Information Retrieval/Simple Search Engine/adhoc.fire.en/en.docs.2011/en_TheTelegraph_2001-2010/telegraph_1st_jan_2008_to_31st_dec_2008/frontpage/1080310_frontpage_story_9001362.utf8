The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | South war blows up on CPM Delhi base

	March 9: Suspected Sangh parivar supporters stoned senior CPM leaders and smashed cars at the party headquarters in Delhi this morning, bringing to the heart of the capital the politics of vendetta opponents often associate with the Left party.        
	The attack, possibly the first such on the nerve-centre of a party in Delhi, traces its roots to a deadly conflict over 3,000km away in Kerala, where a turf war between the BJP and the CPM have claimed seven lives since last week.        
	So stunning was the onslaught that the nuclear winter gave way to a brief thaw. Sonia Gandhi called up Prakash Karat, who was inside the CPM base when the missiles started raining down, to convey her concern  the first known contact between the two leaders in months.        
	Five members of the CPMs central committee  the second most important party forum after the politburo  were injured when a group of BJP-RSS workers laid siege to the Left partys A.K. Gopalan Bhavan headquarters in Gole Market.        
	The RSS-BJP activists, said to number around 200, were protesting against the spiral of violence in north Keralas Kannur which rhymes uncannily with Nanoor and Keshpur, once known as Bengals political killing fields. Among the seven murdered in Kannur, five were BJP supporters.        
	The CPM  which leads the ruling coalition in Kerala  has been accused by the Opposition of unleashing a reign of state-backed terror in the worst-affected Thalassery, represented by the home minister.         
	The BJP, which has never won an election in Kerala, had been reminding the CPM of the Sanghs clout in Delhi and the Left partys feeble muscle power there. Ever since the fresh bloodletting began last week, Sangh supporters have been raising slogans like come to Delhi, we will show you.        
	That warning was put in practice this morning while a central committee meeting was in progress at the CPM head office.         
	Sources said the Sangh protesters tried to barge in but were confronted by security personnel and some office staff. The protesters then threw stones at the office and a scuffle broke out as CPM workers retaliated.         
	The street fight lasted around 20 minutes before police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The five injured central committee members were treated at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. Joginder Sharma and Hari Singh Kang suffered head injuries.         
	The ground floor, which houses the office of party mouthpiece Peoples Democracy, suffered extensive damage. A concrete slab was dropped on the rear windshield of the Maruti Zen that politburo member Sitaram Yechury drives. An office Ambassador, which Karat uses sometimes, was also damaged.                  
	Karat said the attack was pre-meditated and led by known leaders.        
	BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra, however, said his party workers were stoned from inside the CPM office. RSS leader Ram Madhav said our members were peacefully demonstrating.        
	In a police complaint, the CPM named Jagadish Mukhi, leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, and mayor Aarti Mehra among others.        
	A steady stream of Congress leaders, such as Veerappa Moily, Ambika Soni and chief minister Sheila Dikshit, trickled in to the CPM office to express solidarity.        
	CPM Bengal chief Biman Bose admitted that the assault was a sequel to the violence in Kerala but said Marxists never targeted offices of rival parties to settle scores.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | nice knowing you, dada and nano   Sourav to quit after Aussie Tests
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Nice knowing you, DADA and NANO     Sourav to quit after Aussie Tests
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            The right time: Sourav Ganguly during a practice session in Bangalore on Tuesday. (AFP)                                      
	Oct.7: For much of his career, Sourav Ganguly has been hated by the Australians, chiefly because of his dont-mess-with-me attitude, which they believe is solely their preserve.        
	Over the next five weeks, the Australians have good reason to also fear Sourav.        
	Indeed, with one kind of pressure off, as he put it, the four-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy could well see the best of the iconic left-hander.         
	The series, which begins in Bangalore on Thursday and ends in Nagpur next month, is going to be Souravs last.        
	Actually, its a bad time for Bengal.         
	Nano moved out last week and, then, came the shocker from Sourav. Nano gelo, Dada- chole jachchhe, was a common refrain on the streets of Calcutta this evening.        
	Among crickets biggest performers, Sourav went public with his decision at the end of a media conference in Bangalore.        
	The drama was in what he said, not the manner.        
	I just want to say that this is going to be my last series. I have decided to quit and Ive told my teammates before I have come here (media conference). These four matches are going to be my last        
	Later, Sourav spoke to The Telegraph. I can understand the feelings of well-wishers, but I think Ive taken the right decision. At the right time too.        
	Again, there was little emotion in Souravs tone. With wife Dona and daughter Sana around, he sounded reasonably relaxed, though.         
	During the conversation, Sourav insisted that (a) his selection for the first two Tests and (b) todays announcement had nothing to do with a deal being struck with the board.        
	The first bit had been emphasised last week itself, when Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Co. picked the 15.         
	Sourav confirmed that hed begun thinking of quitting after being overlooked for the Irani Trophy, which had the status of a trial for the Australia series.        
	Despite being mentally very tough (a quality which allowed him to come back after the Kiran More-Greg Chappell blow), Sourav definitely cracked somewhat.        
	Almost always being on trial got to him. In fact, hed never quite recovered after being dropped from ODIs, in January. The constant scrutiny in sections of the media didnt make him comfortable either.        
	I couldnt have carried on like this I hope youll understand, Sourav said.         
	At 36, Sourav isnt getting younger and the Subramaniam Badrinaths, Rohit Sharmas and Virat Kohlis are snapping at the heels. Then, theres Yuvraj Singh, who got back to form the other day.        
	The pressure on an ageing senior pro, therefore, isnt insignificant. That too in a country where age is a factor, unless were talking of politicians.         
	Not long ago, Sourav told a confidant: Ive played 100 Tests. Thats something I wanted to. Having reached the milestone, every Test now is a bonus. I try to give of my best, I cant possibly do more.        
	Sourav had a poor series in Sri Lanka but while others in the middle order also failed, the pressure from all quarters was on him alone.        
	It hurt Sourav.        
	Given his talent, despite always having a 40-plus average, Sourav under-achieved in Tests. In ODIs, well, there was a time when he was the absolute Dada.         
	As captain, because of the remarkable changes he brought about, Sourav will be bracketed with Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi.         
	Back in 2003-04, the India-Australia face-off Down Under got to be remembered more as Steve Waughs farewell series. This is bound to be the Sourav one.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kohima, June 21: Twenty years after they split, the leaders of the two NSCN factions are going to sit face-to-face at the Naga reconciliation meet at Chiang Mai in Thailand next week to discuss peace and unification.        
	The chairman of the NSCN (I-M), Isak Chishi Swu, will sit across the table with the representatives from NSCN (K) and two factions of the Naga National Council/Federal Government of Nagaland to pave the way for the unification of various Naga factions.        
	Representatives from the Naga Hoho, tribal Hohos and several Naga mass-based organisations will also attend the six-day Naga reconciliation meet, which will begin tomorrow.        
	Since the NSCN split in April 30, 1988  leading to frequent fratricidal killings  there has not been a single meeting between the two archrivals.        
	The National Socialist Council of Nagaland (K) headed by S.S. Khaplang today said it has deputed deputy kilonser (minister) for home affairs Wangtin Konyak and deputy secretary Lhokuto Sumi to attend the meeting. Konyak and Sumi left for Chiang Mai yesterday.        
	Swu recently spoke to his old comrade Khaplang over telephone to push forward the Naga reconciliation process and unification. He also wrote a letter to Khole Konyak, commander-in-chief of the armed wing of NSCN (K), inviting him to come to Thailand.                    
	The NSCN (I-M) has been harping on integration of contiguous Naga-inhabited areas of Manipur, Nagaland, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh to carry forward the Naga peace talks.        
	groups, headed by S. Singyu and Senkha Ao, and the NSCN (I-M) attended the first conciliatory meeting at Chiang Mai last year but NSCN (K) and NNC/FGN of Adinno Phizos faction did not.        
	This time, too, the NNC/FGN (Adinno) has decided to give the meet a miss.        
	In 1997, North America Baptist church council had sponsored a similar meeting for the Naga outfits at Georgia, Atlanta, but Swu and Muivah did not attend the meeting.        
	NSCN (K) today also hinted at starting peace talks with the Centre. The emissary of the collective leadership of the NSCN (K), K Mulatonu, said the peace process between the NSCN (I-M) and the Centre has reached a deadlock and that NSCN (K) is prepared to start talks with the Centre. He, however, added that the outfit is not in a hurry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | UK to let students stay longer 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   UK to let students stay longer 
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, June 19: The period students from India will be allowed to stay on in the UK to gain work experience is being increased from one year to two under new visa rules, a British government minister announced today.        
	Liam Byrne, the home office minister of state with responsibility for borders and immigration, told a CII conference that the reform of Britains immigration laws would make it easier for businessmen, students and other legitimate travellers and tourists to enter the UK. Under the reform, an Australian-style points-based system is being introduced.        
	Byrne did not give details of the plans to allow Indian students to stay longer, though in the past there have been complaints about the exorbitant charges, running to hundreds of pounds, that have been levied by the home office for visa extensions.        
	However, Byrne did say that the changes were being made following Gordon Browns visit to India earlier this year when the British Prime Minister gave priority to bilateral collaboration in education.        
	It is possible that Britain, having realised it is losing Indian students to the US, is now trying to correct the imbalance. An estimated 18,000 Indians study in the UK, a quarter of the figure for America.        
	The minister stressed that the new immigration measures were being introduced following his own trip to India, adding that he was determined to strengthen business links between the two countries.        
	Byrne said inward investments by 70 Indian companies had created 5,000 new jobs in Britain. Tata Motors acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover had also safeguarded 13,000 jobs in the West Midlands where the minister has his own constituency.        
	Since 2005, Indian companies had created 1,000 new jobs in the West Midlands, Byrne pointed out. Such a perspective takes on added importance because of Britains worsening economic climate with the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, issuing a stark warning yesterday that there was little prospect of improvement in the next year or two.        
	In marked contrast, Indian captains of industry, led by new CII president K.V. Kamath, said that despite the rise in the prices of oil and basic foods, it was realistic to assume that the Indian economy would grow at a healthy pace.

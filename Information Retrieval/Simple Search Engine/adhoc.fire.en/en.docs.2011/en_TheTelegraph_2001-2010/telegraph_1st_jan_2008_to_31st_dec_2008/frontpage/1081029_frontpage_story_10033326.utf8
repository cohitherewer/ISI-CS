	London, Oct. 28: A Halloween decoration showing a mannequin dressed as vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin hanging by a noose from the roof of a Los Angeles house has sparked outrage among Republican supporters.         
	 The mannequin, which is dressed in brown wig, glasses and a red business suit, has been reported to police as a hate crime.         
	However, officers said the mannequin could not be considered a hate crime because it was part of a Halloween display.         
	Chad Michael Morisette, who lives in the house, defended the effigy, claiming it was art. Morisette admitted it would be out of bounds at any other time of year. He said: It should be seen as art, and as within the month of October. Its Halloween, its time to be scary its time to be spooky.        
	Sergeant Kristin Aloma of the sheriffs department said that since Sunday she had received five to 10 calls from residents offended by the display. Officials are monitoring the house to make sure the situation doesnt get out of hand, she said. Im not defending this; Im not criticising it. It doesnt rise to the level of hate crime, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles county sheriffs department, who said he went out to the house himself to look at the display this morning.

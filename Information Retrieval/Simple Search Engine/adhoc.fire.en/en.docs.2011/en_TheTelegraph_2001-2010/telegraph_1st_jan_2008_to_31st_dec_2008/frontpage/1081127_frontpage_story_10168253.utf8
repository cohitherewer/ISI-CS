                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Waiter on the web
       YOUR FAVOURITE DISH IS JUST A CLICK AWAY, SAYS NONDON BAGCHI.                     
	And now Calcutta has joined other metros in providing a service which will certainly spice up our lives. You have a craving to have a particularly favourite dish from a particularly favourite restaurant, but for any number of reasons you cant, or dont feel like, stepping out. The restaurant in question does not do home delivery and at the same time your wife has this intense craving for her favourite meal from her favourite restaurant which does not do any home delivery either, and starts hinting that maybe you should consider a shave and a shower What to do?  
	Just pick up the phone and call Dumb Waiter, Calcuttas version of Mumbais Meals on Wheels, a service that promises to deliver any item of your choice from the menu of any of (till now) about 40 of Calcuttas restaurants, from old haunts on Park Street (Mocambo, Peter Cat, Trincas) to newer establishments like Mezze and The Wall. The outfit is just about two months old and will obviously tie up with more eateries in course of time. They have a comprehensive booklet listing the restaurants in alphabetical order and their menus in detail.  
	Already, customers have access to enormous variety  from pure vegetarian snacks, chaats and combo meals a la Italy, Haldiram and Gangaur to full scale Oriental exotica from Soi 19 and The Wall to Mediterranean fare from Mezze or Starstruck to global cuisine, Taajas style. Randomly opening their menu booklet with eyes closed, I came upon the page listing the items available at Peter Cat. Hmm. what would I order from here?   
	Indian or Continental? Indian, I decided. For starters, I would order the Fried Chicken Liver; a vegetable dish is a must so I would go for Palak Cream and for the main course it would have to be their trademark Chelo Kebab, which is not an Indian dish, really, but an age-old preparation from Persia, which is now Iran, and it is so typical of their cuisine that it enjoys the status of being considered a national dish, available everywhere, though it originated in the north.  
	It is a simple but substantial item, a meal in itself consisting of steamed saffroned rice (chelo in Persian) and kebabs of which there are several distinct Persian varieties. It is served with grilled tomatoes and a healthy dose of butter on top of the rice. Traditionally, a raw egg yolk should be placed on top of the buttered rice, but this is optional, and most restaurants in Iran will not do this unless asked to. In the old bazaar tradition, the two most commonly served kebabs are Barg (fillet of lamb) and Koobideh (minced meat). Doogh, a sour yoghurt drink spiced with salt and mint, follows a Chelo Kebab meal.   
	In Calcutta, when the idea of Chelo Kebab was imported into the kitchens of Peter Cat (where it has now become their signature dish), it was actually registered as their protected regional product. Here, they serve a fried egg on top of the rice instead of the raw yolk, and the kebabs served are Chicken Shashlik and Mutton Sheekh Kebab.   
	For dessert, I would order a Tutti Frutti ice cream simply because it is also the name of one of the best rock n roll songs ever written.  
	An interesting aspect of Dumb Waiter is that not only do you get to choose from the restaurant menus, but they have a tie-up with Chickys, which has specialised in catering and hospitality services for over 40 years, so you can also order a set menu from a vast selection of Indian, Chinese and Continental items at a fixed price per head which would include crockery, cutlery and service.  
	www.dumbwaiter.co.in is their website and the phone numbers are 40017199/7250 and 9748046891. It is a fledging operation, and I hope it sustains and succeeds, because we need it. But in the words of Mark Knopfler in his song Money For Nothing let me tell you, these guys aint doin it for free.

	Ranchi, May 25: A small culvert on the NH-33 between Ranchi and Jamshedpur was blown up near Tamar early this morning in an abortive attempt to booby-trap police personnel patrolling the highway.        
	One bomb found from there was defused this afternoon while another went off in the presence of policemen. However, no casualty was reported.        
	About 10.30 tonight, suspected Maoists opened fire on a truck coming from Bengal near Jonha falls. Police rushed to the spot but are unable to give any details about the shooting at present. Among the three injured, one Md Halim has been admitted to RIMS.        
	A deafening sound of can bomb, fitted through a 200m wire to a timer, was much to break the sleep of residents of village Rugri and Roladih along the highway about 2.45am.         
	We waited till morning to know what happened and found that a bomb had exploded near the culvert destroying it partially, said Harmohan Mahto of village Rugri, about 55km from here.         
	The part of the highway  which was never targeted before today  was repaired this morning.        
	Sources said that the target was police vehicles which are active in Tamar police station area for combing operations after the loot of ICICI Banks Rs 5.7 crore and over a kg of gold coins from a transit van of a private security firm on May 21.        
	Ranchi senior superintendent of police M.S. Bhatia, at present camping in Tamar with sub-divisional police officer Sanjay Ranjan Singh, said the explosion was basically a booby trap. Two more can bombs were planted over the ground and had the police gone at the spot in the early morning hours itself, it could be dangerous for them, said Bhatia.        
	The sources said that the rebels intention was to divert attention of the police who have been conducting joint operations against the Naxalites.

	New Delhi, Feb. 13: Adult smokers in India lose six to 10 years of life, and smoking even as few as one to seven cigarettes a day nearly doubles the risk of death, the first results of Indias million-death study have revealed.        
	The study has also thrown up the first-ever nationally representative figure on the proportion of adults in India who have successfully quit smoking  just 2 per cent, among the lowest in the world.        
	In 2010, smoking will cause 935,000 deaths, among which 579,000 men and 93,000 women will die prematurely between the ages of 30 and 69, according to the study by doctors from India and Canada.        
	The risk of smoking is much bigger than perceived, said Prabhat Jha, a public health expert at the Centre for Global Health Research, Toronto, and principal investigator of the study to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine.        
	The risk for women is as large as for men, and even modest smoking kills, he said.        
	In the study, some 900 field workers organised by the Registrar General of India surveyed adult deaths during a two-year period (2001-03) in 1.1 million households across India, probing smoking patterns of 74,000 people who had died.        
	Previous studies have highlighted the risks of smoking in India, but the rigour and scale of the million-death study allowed scientists to find unexpected patterns of tobacco-related harm.        
	Although smoking is often associated with lung cancer, the study found the most common smoking-related cause of death was heart disease or stroke in urban areas and tuberculosis in rural India.        
	Men who smoke cigarettes are likely to die 10 years younger than non-smokers, and bidi-smoking men stand to lose six years of life. Women who smoke bidis lose eight years of life, the study has said.        
	There werent enough women smoking cigarettes in this sample for us to get a reliable measure of early death among female cigarette smokers, Jha said.        
	India has about 120 million smokers  one in three men and one in 20 women between the ages of 30 and 69 smoke either cigarettes or bidis .        
	The study showed that male and female smokers have a three-fold increase in the risk of dying from respiratory disease, and that there is no safe level of smoking.        
	Those who think theyre safe because they dont do a pack a day are deluding themselves, said Neeraj Dhingra, director of the Rural Health Training Centre, New Delhi, a research team member.        
	Smoking just one to seven cigarettes a day nearly doubled the risk of death, and eight or more cigarettes tripled the risk, the results showed.        
	The statutory warnings on cigarette packets have had little effect, said Prakash Gupta, director of the Healis Sekhsaria Institute of Public Health, Navi Mumbai, which took part in the study.        
	Only 2 per cent smokers have quit in India, compared with 40 per cent in the UK and 25 per cent in the US, Jha said. The quitting rate in China was 2 per cent in the mid-1990s, but has climbed to 9 per cent.        
	Public health experts are hoping the findings will be a wake-up call for the Indian government that has been dithering on proposals to place grisly picture warnings on tobacco products.        
	In an apparent effort to influence government action, the researchers shared key findings of the study with public health experts and economists. The empirical results presented in this study bring out forcefully the need for immediate public action in this much-neglected field, the researchers quoted Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen as saying.        
	Scientists caution that the study has some limitations. The verbal autopsy technique used in the million-death study can sometimes lead to misclassification of the underlying cause of death.        
	The first phase of the $1-million multi-centre study was funded by the Fogarty International Centre at the US National Institutes of Health and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

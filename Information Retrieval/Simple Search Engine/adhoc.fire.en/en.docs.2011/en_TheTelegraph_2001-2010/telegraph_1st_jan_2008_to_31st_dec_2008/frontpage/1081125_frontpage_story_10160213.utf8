                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   B-boys kidnap to cover stock loss 
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                             Arjun Verma                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: Two MBA students kidnapped a schoolboy for ransom, looking to recover the Rs 80 lakh they lost in the meltdown-hit stock market, police said today.        
	Rohit Chopra and Piyush Jain, both 24, apparently believed even an MBA degree would not land them good jobs, so they borrowed from friends and relatives and invested heavily in stocks.        
	The duo have been arrested with Bharat Jhamb, 21, a stockbroker and cousin of the victim, and three criminals they hired to kidnap Arjun Verma, 15, son of a wealthy businessman who died last year, officers said.        
	The student of Gyan Bharti School was abducted near his home in Saket, south Delhi, on his way to school on Thursday. After the police detained Jamb for questioning yesterday morning, the kidnappers panicked and released the boy.        
	A passer-by saw Arjun, his hands tied and mouth taped, roaming the streets of Okhla in south Delhi and took him home.        
	Officers said Chopra and Jain had paid the three goons Rs 1 lakh, and spent close to Rs 15,000 in renting the house where they held Arjun hostage. The money was allegedly provided by Chopra. A Hyundai car used in the crime has been seized. All six accused could get up to seven years if convicted.        
	The kidnappers had asked the child for directions and told him to hop into the car so he could show them the way, deputy commissioner of police (south Delhi) H.G.S. Dhaliwal said.        
	Jain, who is also a stock sub-broker, lost heavily in the market crash. Chopra lost his money both in the bourses and the property market in Gurgaon and other areas.        
	Jhamb, he claimed, bore Arjuns branch of the clan a grudge ever since their joint properties were divided up.        
	Arjuns widowed mother is a homemaker but owns considerable property in Saket, the police said.        
	The families of Chopra and Jain, who live in high-rise flats in Gurgaon, refused to speak about the incident but confirmed the youths were friends and had invested heavily in the market. Neither studied in a top-league management institute, an officer said.        
	They had been sceptical about their chances of getting good jobs and decided to make a quick buck from the market. But because of the meltdown, they lost all their money. Then they came in touch with Jhamb and hatched the plot.

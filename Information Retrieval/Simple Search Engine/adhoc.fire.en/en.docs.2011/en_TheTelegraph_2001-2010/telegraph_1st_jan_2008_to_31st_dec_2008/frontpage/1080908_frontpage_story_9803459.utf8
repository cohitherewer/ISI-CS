	A teacher reacts as a woman lies dead on a Rohtak street after a police lathi-charge during a demonstration on Sunday (picture left).         
	At least 40 temporary teachers were injured when they tried to proceed to the residence of Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, demanding regularisation of services.        
	After a rally, the teachers, including women, proceeded to Hoodas residence to submit a memorandum.        
	Deputy commissioner R.S. Doon and police superintendent Alok Mittal reportedly asked the teachers to give them the memorandum. They refused and allegedly tried to force their way past the police.         
	The police then caned the teachers, lobbed tear-gas shells and used water canons to disperse the demonstrators.        
	Police sources said the victim was not a teacher and that she died when someone fired from among the protesters.        
	Ajay Singh Chautala, the Indian National Lok Dal secretary-general and Rajya Sabha MP, has demanded the resignation of the chief minister.        
	Hooda has no moral ground to continue as the chief minister, Chautala said in a statement.        
	Chautala demanded registration of criminal cases against the concerned officers for firing on women protesters. (PTI)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Court axe on Manoj spoof scenes 
          SAMYABARATA RAY GOSWAMI                            A still from Om Shanti Om                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 8: Troubles from the past have returned in a rush to haunt Shah Rukh Khan with yesteryear star Manoj Kumar doing a Rocky Balboa on modern Bollywoods presiding deity.        
	Days after being dragged to a legal battle for alleged plagiarisation of the script of Om Shanti Om, SRK has now been ordered by a local court to delete scenes parodying Manoj Kumar in the film.         
	OSO, one of Bollywoods biggest money-earners, released last November and is slated for a global television premiere on Sony SET Max this Sunday.        
	The Mumbai sessions court, upholding Kumars petition, ordered that the film cannot be televised until SRKs Red Chillies Production edited out the scenes mimicking the veteran actor.        
	The court has also ordered that the objectionable scenes be deleted from all CDs and DVDs, the rights for which are with Eros International.         
	Neither Shah Rukh nor Red Chillies chief executive Bobby Chawla could be reached for comment.         
	SET Max said it would abide by the ruling. We will completely abide by the court order and delete the scenes , said Sneha Rajani, executive vice-president amp; business head of SET Max.        
	The court ruling is a big boost to Kumar, 71, who, like the boxer Rocky Balboa in the Sylvester Stallone film, took on and won against a mighty opponent 30 years his junior.         
	This is definitely a victory. My father does not bear a grudge against anyone. But he had been made a laughing stock and his image of 50 years was dragged to dust for no reason, said Vishal Goswami, Manoj Kumars son, speaking on behalf of his father, who, he said, was too tired to speak.        
	Kumars lawyer Ashok Saraogi said the actor is now in the process of filing a defamation case against SRK and OSO director Farah Khan.        
	We are not seeking any financial compensation as my client feels no amount of money can compensate for the disgrace he experienced due to the public mockery in the movie. So we are seeking a token compensation of Re 1. But we plan to file a case to get Shah Rukh and Farah prosecuted, Saraogi said.        
	Shah Rukh has of late been dogged by a series of court cases. Apart from two against OSO, he is staring at a PIL alleging illegal construction in and around his residence Mannat in Bandra.        
	Bollywood, which in the past was known to have closed ranks in support of King Khan, has been silent on the troubles dogging the actor.

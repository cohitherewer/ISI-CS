          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Fiona after being questioned in Panjim. (Reuters)                                  
	Mumbai/Panjim, March 15: Scarlett Keelings mother Fiona MacKeown today accused Goas home minister and police chief of trying to cover up the British teens rape and murder.        
	I have been informed (of) a nexus between the drug mafia, (home minister) Ravi Naik and director-general of police B.S. Brar, MacKeown said as she arrived for questioning by Panjim police this morning.        
	Scarlett, 15, was found dead on Goas Anjuna beach on February 18. The police have charged bartender Samson DSouza with the crime and drug dealer Placido Carvalho with helping him ply the girl with drugs.        
	MacKeown, who claims the police are protecting the drug mafia and politicians, has sought a CBI probe.        
	She has circulated a letter dated March 8, written by Goa tourism minister Francisco Pacheco, in which he mentions a conversation with Naik soon after the murder. Pacheco says he informed Naik that Anjuna villagers had spoken of foul play in Scarletts death and urged him to investigate the case.        
	The police initially registered a drowning case and changed it to murder only after a second autopsy cited 22 injury marks on the body.        
	If she was drugged, why the abrasions? MacKeowns lawyer Vikram Varma asked, arguing drugging could not be proved without a viscera report.        
	Officers said MacKeown was quizzed to understand her point of view but Varma said the line of questioning suggested she could be charged with neglecting Scarletts safety.        
	MacKeown has expressed fears that police could victimise her by arresting her under a Goa law that holds parents responsible for the safety of their children. She had travelled to Karnataka leaving Scarlett with the family of tour guide Julio Lobo.

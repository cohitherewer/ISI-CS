          OUR BUREAU                            One of the damaged vehicles. (Suman Tamang)                                  
	Darjeeling/Kurseong, April 7: The hills are on the boil again.        
	GNLF supporters returning to Kurseong after a meeting with party chief Subash Ghisingh in Darjeeling were attacked and their cars smashed, allegedly by Gorkha Janmukti Morcha members, near Jorebunglow this afternoon.        
	Police intervened to bring the situation under control. Ten GNLF supporters were injured, four vehicles damaged and a Maruti van was pushed down the hillside.        
	Around 100 GNLF supporters from Monteviot in Kurseong, Soureni and Rangbhang had come to meet Ghisingh today. They sported green tikas on their foreheads and GNLF flags fluttered atop their vehicles.         
	The trouble began when they were returning home.        
	The Kurseong branch committee president of the GNLF, I.N. Pradhan, was among those who came to Darjeeling.         
	On my way back, I saw a group of people on the road near Jorebunglow, about 10km from Darjeeling, and they were armed with sticks. I immediately called up Deepak Gurung (the president of the partys Darjeeling unit) and told him to send word to the police as some of our supporters were yet to cross the spot. However, despite informing the police, our supporters were attacked, Pradhan said.         
	Jayanta Pal, the additional superintendent of police of Darjeeling, confirmed that they had been informed. We immediately sent our forces to the spot and they had to resort to lathicharge to disperse the attackers, who were probably Morcha supporters, Pal said.        
	Later, the police escorted the GNLF supporters to Kurseong and the injured were treated at the subdivisional hospital there.         
	The injured include former GNLF vice-chairman of the Kurseong Municipality Sanjay Chhetri and councillors Palden Bhutia and Nima Lepcha.         
	The GNLF has condemned the attack.         
	Our supporters had gone to meet party leaders in daylight and yet the Morcha, which talks about democratic protests, attacked us. The true nature of the Morcha has been exposed, said Pradhan.         
	The Morcha decided to tread cautiously.         
	We are looking into the matter and until we are sure of the facts, we cannot comment, said Binay Tamang, the press and publicity secretary of the party.

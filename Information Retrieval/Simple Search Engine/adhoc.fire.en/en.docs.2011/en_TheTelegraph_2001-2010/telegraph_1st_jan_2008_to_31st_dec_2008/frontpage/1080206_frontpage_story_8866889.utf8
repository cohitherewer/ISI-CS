	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 5: Ending all speculation, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today expanded the coalition ministry by inducting three legislators into the council of ministers.         
	He also rewarded two ministers of state by elevating them to cabinet rank  Duryodhan Majhi got planning and coordination and science and technology, while Debi Mishra retained excise and tourism.        
	Pradip Amat was given the plum steel and mines portfolio, which was lying vacant after the resignation of Padmanabha Behera. Sanatan Bisi was given the charge of health and family welfare department, which was being headed by Majhi earlier.        
	Pradipta Naik was allocated his previous portfolio of labour and employment. School and mass education portfolio, which was lying vacant after the resignation of Bishnu Das, was given to minister of state Sanjib Sahoo, who was earlier looking after science and technology department.        
	Governor M.C. Bhandare administered the oath of office and secrecy to five of them at a simple ceremony held in the Raj Bhavan this afternoon.        
	This was the third cabinet expansion during the second term of the BJD-BJP government in office. The last cabinet expansion and reshuffle was in 2006. Majhi and Mishra (both from the ruling BJD), who were promoted to cabinet rank, were ironically dropped from the ministry midway while no reasons were shown for the removal.         
	BJD legislators Sanatan Bisi and Pradip Amat along with BJP MLA Pradipta Naik were inducted as ministers of state. While Bisi and Amat are new entrants, Naik had served as minister of state for labour and employment. He had resigned from the cabinet after a criminal case was filed against him for furnishing false affidavit with the election commission on the eve of 2004 Assembly polls. However, the case was later dropped.        
	Todays cabinet expansion was necessary to fill three vacancies arising out of the resignations of steel and mines minister Behera and school and mass education minister Bishnu Das, besides Naik.        
	Behera had resigned on December 28, 2007, on moral grounds following the district clashes in Khandhamal, which he represented, while Das stepped down on moral grounds on May 17 for a mark-sheet scandal involving his son.

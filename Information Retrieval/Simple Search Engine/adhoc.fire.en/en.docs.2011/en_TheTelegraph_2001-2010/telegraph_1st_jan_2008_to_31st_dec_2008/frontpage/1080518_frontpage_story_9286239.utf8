          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, May 17: Vaishali police have registered a case against Lalganj JD(U) MLA Munna Shukla for allegedly tampering with evidence and intimidating public servant.        
	The MLA is being accused after he interfered in police business following the death of panchayat ward member Phekan Pandit (60) in police custody on May 15.        
	Pandit had allegedly died because of police atrocity. Six iron nails were found on his back during post-mortem.        
	Shukla, who had reached Sadar hospital in Hajipur soon after Pandits death, allegedly cornered policemen deployed at the hospital with help of some supporters. They took away the body to a corner of the hospital.        
	The case against the MLA was registered on the statement of Bhagwanpur police station constable Govind Paswan, who had taken Pandit to the hospital. Paswan, however, was not sure if Shukla and his men planted nails on the body to defame the police.        
	Vaishali superintendent of police Paras Nath said: A case has been lodged against Shukla under eight IPC provisions on the constables statement.        
	The police, however, have not questioned the MLA. Shukla could not be contacted.        
	Pandit, a ward member from Kiranpur Rajmera, was arrested on May 15 in connection with a case of obstructing government work in flood relief distribution at Bhagwanpur in October 2007. He died within a few hours of being arrested. The police said he died of a heart attack.

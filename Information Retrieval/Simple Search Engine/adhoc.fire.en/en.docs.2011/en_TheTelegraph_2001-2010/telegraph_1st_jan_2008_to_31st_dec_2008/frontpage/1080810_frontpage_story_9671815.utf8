          MICHAEL DAY                            No worries                                  
	Milan, Aug. 9: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones have been fined more than 2,000 euros after docking their luxury yacht at an Italian resort without permission.         
	Douglas, 64, who played a swashbuckling yachtsman in one of his best known films, Romancing the Stone, fell foul of Italian authorities before he and his 38-year-old Welsh wife had even set foot in the exclusive resort of Santa Margherita Ligure near Portofino.         
	Port authorities claimed the couple, both Oscar winners, had broken immigration and anti-terrorism laws by allegedly landing at the Ligurian destination without notifying them of their arrival and by not gaining the right paperwork. Its a question of security, of guarding the port landing and the visitors. The docks where landings are expected are subject to inspection and clearance. Its also necessary to check the identity of passengers on smaller, supply vessels, a port authority spokesman told the Corriere della Sera newspaper.         
	The fine was said to have been more than 2,000 euros (1,600). However, the sum is unlikely to worry the millionaire couple, who are frequent summer visitors to the sought-after resorts in the Mediterranean. They arrived at the Italian coast after sailing from St Tropez in the south of France. Both are enjoying a well-earned break after filming a string of movies in the past year.         
	Michael, the son of Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas, has completed a succession of films due out next year, including The Ghosts Of Girlfriends Past and Beyond A Reasonable Doubt. Zeta-Jones has recently completed work on the romantic comedy The Rebound and is tipped to play legendary sex-symbol Lana Turner in an up-coming biography.

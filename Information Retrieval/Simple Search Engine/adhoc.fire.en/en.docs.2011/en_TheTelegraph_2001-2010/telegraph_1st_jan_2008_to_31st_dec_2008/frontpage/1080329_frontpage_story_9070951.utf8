The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | IITs bow to faculty quota
                                                                                                           IITs bow to faculty quota
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                             The Telegraph report on IITs violating the quota policy                                  
	New Delhi, March 28: The IITs have agreed to introduce reservations in faculty positions for the first time since their inception, four months after The Telegraph revealed that the apex technical institutes had been skirting the government policy.        
	Contrary to claims by the institutes, they have never been granted exemption from quotas for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and Other Backward Classes, and had been violating regulations for the past four decades, the government has confirmed.        
	The IITs have agreed to introduce quotas in faculty positions. They will implement the quotas in all future appointments, human resource development minister Arjun Singh said today.         
	The decision was taken at a meeting of the IIT standing committee last month, where the government impressed upon the institutes the need to immediately enforce quotas, top sources said.         
	C.N.R Rao, the top scientific adviser to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and other senior government officials told the IITs that it was unacceptable that they do not have quotas.         
	I told them that they simply had to introduce reservations. They have no choice in the matter, Rao had said from Bangalore a few days ago.         
	December 6, 2007, the media had splashed that the IITs were not reserving posts claiming exemption from the Centre.         
	But neither the IITs nor the human resource development ministry could furnish any exemption order  necessary under the office memorandum ordering reservations in government jobs.        
	The IITs had eventually admitted that they did not have any written order, just an oral understanding.         
	Once it was in the media that the IITs were not implementing quotas, and that they do not have any exemption, it was essential that the reservations were implemented. The issue was embarrassing for the government, a senior HRD official said.         
	The government had introduced 22.5 per cent reservation in jobs for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes following amendments to the Constitution in 1951.        
	Based on the recommendations of the Mandal commission report, the quota was extended by 27 per cent in the early nineties to cover the Other Backward Classes.

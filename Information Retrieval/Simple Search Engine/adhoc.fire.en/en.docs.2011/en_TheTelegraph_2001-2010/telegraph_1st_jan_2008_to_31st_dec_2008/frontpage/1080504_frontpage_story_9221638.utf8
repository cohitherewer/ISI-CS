          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 3: South Korean steelmaker Posco today said construction of its 12MTPA greenfield steel plant near Paradip would start soon after the Supreme Courts clearance for forest diversion.        
	We are keen to start the steel plant project soon. But we are waiting for the clearance from the Supreme Court for the forest diversion, said Posco India chairman and managing director Sung Sik Cho.        
	Cho met chief minister Naveen Patnaik here today and discussed with him the progress of the Orissa project.        
	Earlier, the proposed ground breaking ceremony for the mega steel plant, scheduled for April 1, was deferred indefinitely in view of the delay in obtaining certain procedural sanctions.         
	The company is closely monitoring the situation and trying its best to get the necessary sanction. This will pave the away for holding the ground breaking ceremony at the earliest, said sources.         
	Posco officials claimed that the ground situation at the plant site has become conducive for the steel plant project with around 90 per cent of villagers openly expressing support in favour of it, as evident from the successful completion of the socio-economic survey as well as land demarcation work.         
	But certain procedural sanctions still remain to be obtained, they said.         
	Out of the 4,000 acres identified for the Posco steel plant near Paradip port, around 3,000 acres is forestland. The state government submitted proposals to the Centre and forest ministry for clearance. Meanwhile, the proposals for diversion of forestland was approved by the National Forest Advisory Committee and recommended to the central empowered committee of Supreme Court. We are waiting for the final clearance after which we will proceed with the project, said company officials.         
	The company has agreed to go for compensatory afforestation at Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack and Jajpur districts in lieu of the 3,000 acres of forest, said a senior government official associated with the Posco project.                     
	The South Korean steel major had signed an MoU with Orissa in June 2005 to set up a mega steel plant with an investment of Rs 51,000 crore, the biggest FDI in the country. But the project has been in limbo following stiff resistance by the displaced villagers to the land acquisition.

          OUR BUREAU                                           The picture of Mahatma Gandhi that was pulled down. A Telegraph picture     
	Siliguri/Darjeeling, April 8: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today lodged a complaint with Pradhannagar police, alleging that CPM supporters had torn its party flags and pulled down a picture of Mahatma Gandhi in its day-old office at Darjeeling More this evening.        
	Demanding immediate police action, Morcha secretary Roshan Giri said a state committee member of the CPM, Jibitesh Sarkar and the deputy mayor of Siliguri Municipal Corporation, Nurul Islam, were named in the FIR, among others.        
	The impunity with which they pulled down the picture of the Mahatma only shows the little regard that they have for Gandhian principle of non-violence, said Rai.        
	By evening, around 200 Morcha supporters gathered at Darjeeling More in Siliguri and staged a demonstration.        
	Lalit Thapa, the president of the Sukna unit of the Morcha, said the CPM supporters had barged into the office when their procession was passing through the area.         
	The CPM has denied the allegations. We had taken out a peaceful rally to protest against anti-social elements carrying out militant activities in Siliguri, said Mukul Sengupta, the councillor of Ward 46, referring to Thursdays blasts in Champasari and todays recovery of an explosive from Mallaguri. It the ransack) is the fallout of intra-party rivalry in the Morcha. They are trying to malign our image.         
	Swapan Ghosh, the officer- in-charge of the Pradhannagar police station, confirmed having received an FIR from the Morcha.         
	The district magistrate of Darjeeling, Rajesh Pandey, said because of developments in Sukna (he was referring to Darjeeling More), permission has been denied to the ex-servicemens association, affiliated to the Morcha, to hold a rally in Siliguri tomorrow.         
	Pandey said it would be better if the former jawans postponed their rally.        
	The Morcha, however, said it would go ahead with its programme.

  - Jharkhand events get sought-after guest but Bengal project yet to gain firm commitment          SAMBIT SAHA                            Manmohan Singh                                        
	Calcutta, April 20: In the season of steel, Bengal is no longer a magnet for the Prime Minister.        
	Manmohan Singh has skipped an invite to Bengals biggest industrial enterprise, Sajjan Jindals Salboni steel project, while deciding to attend two steel programmes in Jharkhand this week.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had invited Manmohan Singh in February to lay the foundation stone for the Rs 35,000-crore project. Early March had seemed the likely date and a security survey was done in Salboni, but the visit never came. The Prime Minister does not have any immediate plans to visit Bengal now, a senior official in Delhi said.        
	On Tuesday, however, Singh will flag off the Rs 9,000-crore modernisation programme at Steel Authority of Indias (SAILs) Bokaro plant before participating in Tata Steels yearlong centenary celebrations in Jamshedpur.        
	The twin trips come at a time the Union finance and commerce ministers have threatened action against the steel industry unless it brings prices down.        
	Perhaps Singh, who has ruled out blind controls to check inflation, has decided to hold the industrys hands, hoping higher production will bring the prices down in the long term.        
	The Prime Minister seems less willing to hold the Bengal governments hands, though, at a time he has revised his rules of engagement with the Left following the nuclear deal standoff.        
	With the model code of conduct in place because of the May panchayat polls, to be followed by the summer at its hottest and then the rains, its anybodys guess if and when Singh can oblige Bengal.        
	The Jindals, keen to start work, have decided to go ahead. Well start work on the boundary wall this month. The actual construction may begin in October, said Biswadip Gupta, CEO of JSW Bengal, which will run the Salboni plant.         
	The company has set a March 2011 deadline to complete the first phase  a 6-million- tonne plant. Given the stiff target, it doesnt want to wait for Singh to lay the foundation stone formally. We will be happy to have him any time, Gupta said.        
	SAIL and Tata Steel, too, had been seeking the Prime Ministers presence for several months. The Bokaro project was to kick off late last year but Singh could not come. Tata Steel was keen to have him launch the celebrations on August 26, 2007, when the company stepped into its centenary year. But that didnt happen, either.        
	Both SAIL and the Tatas, however, kept their invitation open.        
	So what prompted the Prime Minister to look at Bokaro and Jamshedpur more favourably than Salboni? He, after all, had flagged off only one of SAILs modernisation programmes, visiting the IISCO plant in Bengals Burnpur on December 24, 2006.        
	Sources said the steel minister was keen to have Singh in Bokaro where SAIL is locked in legal battle with the state government on several issues, especially the lease of the Chiria mines.        
	The Madhu Koda government wants to distribute the reserve, one of Asias best, among private players such as Mittal. A visit to Bokaro by the Prime Minister would be a morale-booster for the public sector company.        
	Since Singh was coming to Bokaro, it made sense to accept Tatas invitation as well.        
	The Jindal project is just across the inter-state border. But neither the Congress nor the Prime Ministers Office appear in any mood to oblige the Left Front government for now, the sources said.

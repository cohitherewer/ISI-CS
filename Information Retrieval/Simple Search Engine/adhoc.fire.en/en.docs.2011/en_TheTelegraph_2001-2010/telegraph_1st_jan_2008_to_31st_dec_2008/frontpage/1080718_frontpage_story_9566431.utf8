	New Delhi, July 17: Sonia vandana wasnt on the list, but Brinda Karat and her fellow comrades were treated to one  by an uninvited guest.        
	Junior labour minister Oscar Fernandes today gatecrashed a gathering of CPM women activists who had assembled outside his ministrys office on Rafi Marg to demand better work conditions for domestic helps.        
	But Fernandes didnt merely enter unannounced. He got in a word, too. Several, in fact, on how keen his party chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh both were to address the problems faced by unorganised workers.        
	Brinda, wife of CPM chief Prakash Karat, listened, as 200-odd Janwadi Mahila Samiti (JMS) members and home workers clapped. They had been demanding immediate enactment of a social security act.        
	If it was unusual for a minister to meet people taking part in a sit-in, especially from an Opposition party, Fernandes had a ready explanation.         
	I came to know that you are here... and I also saw the photo exhibition, the permanent Congress Working Committee member said, referring to the posters the CPM activists had exhibited to highlight the problems of home-based workers.        
	The social security bill, he added, was No. 1 on the list of business in the Rajya Sabha and would be passed soon.        
	Fernandes, who spoke for about five minutes, said all unorganised work sectors would be identified, after which there would be detailed discussions with a JMS delegation on problems faced by home-based workers.        
	Brinda, who later addressed the gathering, said the Left had withdrawn support to the government precisely because the Congress-led central coalition wasnt interested in fulfilling the promises it had made in the common minimum programme, the cornerstone of the now snapped alliance.        
	Most of the promises were still on paper, she said, including the long-standing demand for social security for unorganised workers.        
	Its not known if Brindas barbs reached Fernandes, because the minister left soon after she started speaking.        
	Brinda, however, told The Telegraph it was a welcome gesture on the ministers part. But let us see how his ministry is addressing our demands.        
	At the dharna, the CPM Rajya Sabha MP also spoke about the impact of rising inflation on domestic workers. She urged the government to focus on providing relief to people instead of giving in to George Bush, an allusion to the nuclear deal that triggered the Left pullout.        
	Among the other demands at the dharna were recognition for all home-based workers, mandatory identity cards, social security, pension, health insurance, provident fund and maternity benefits.

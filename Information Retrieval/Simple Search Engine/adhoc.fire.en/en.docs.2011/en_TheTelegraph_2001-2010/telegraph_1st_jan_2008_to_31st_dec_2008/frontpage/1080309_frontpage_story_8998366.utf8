          A STAFF REPORTER                            Manju Das. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                   
	Calcutta, March 8: A government that claims to stand for the poor allegedly kept the wife of a day-labourer waiting for seven hours on Thursday when she went to file a complaint of theft.        
	Manju Das, 51, said she had reached Lake police station around noon to complain that Rs 70,000 was stolen from her house. She came out after 7pm  having spent the day sitting on a wooden bench  but still no FIR had been filed.        
	There were a number of policemen sitting around the table. They heard my complaint. I was stunned when the policemen told me they did not believe I had so much of money in my box, she said.         
	The duty officer was later identified as K.N. Das.        
	Seeing that she would not budge unless some kind of complaint was taken down, the policemen finally pulled out the general diary register around 7pm.         
	Before leaving the police station, they told me an FIR would be lodged only when the culprits are arrested, Manju said.         
	But unlike an FIR, a general diary does not require the police to start an investigation. So no case has been registered and no officer directed to find out what happened with the woman who said she had nearly fainted on finding the money missing.        
	The officer-in-charge of Lake police station, Debasish Baidya, has refused comment.         
	Rajesh Subarna, the deputy commissioner of police, south division, said: If the womans allegation is true, it is very unfortunate. We will definitely start a case and also look into why a case was not started immediately after receiving the complaint.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has often been heard telling his force that they should respond to complaints from the poor with alacrity.        
	Sudhu borolokder obhijog shunben na, gorib manush thanate gele tader kothao mon diye shunben ebong tader obhijog shonge shonge grohon korben (Do not heed complaints only by the rich. If poor people come to the police station, listen to their complaints and register it promptly), Bhattacharjee had said late last December at Calcutta polices annual awards ceremony on the National Library grounds.        
	On February 14, Bhattacharjee said much the same thing at Bengal polices awards ceremony in Science City. Do not judge a complainant by what he or she is wearing or by their social and financial status.        
	What the Lake police station officers went by is anybodys guess but Manju said they refused to believe she could possess Rs 70,000. I explained how I had come to possess so much of money. But they were not ready to accept it.        
	The money was given by her Delhi-based brother, Dilip Kumar Das, to help her husband Subal Chandra start a new business and fence off a small plot they own in Behala. Subal, who made a living selling small plastic toys, had been forced to shut down his business because of a funds crunch.        
	Manju said she had found her Raja Basanta Roy shanty ransacked on her return from her married daughters house in Thakurpukur. The small box in which I kept Rs 70,000 was broken and the money missing. I almost fainted.         
	Subal added: My daughter fell ill recently and we had shifted to her home some days ago to take care of her. The money was kept in the box because we wanted to utilise it soon.        
	The police inaction has come at a time the CPM stands accused of taking the law in its own hands.         
	The same day that Manju was kept waiting for justice at a police station, another woman was driven to death by the verdict of a CPM-backed council in Bagmari. Ratna Saha killed herself after the council accused her of loose morals and of being harmful to society.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP sends a nuclear signal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   BJP sends a nuclear signal
          SANJAY K. JHA                             Rajnath Singh                                  
	New Delhi, June 15: The BJPs fears that it might have to share the blame for blocking the nuclear deal have driven it to stress that the government was being tied down by the communists, not the Opposition.        
	Days after senior leader Jaswant Singh said it was for the Congress-led Centre to decide on the deal against the Lefts resistance, party president Rajnath Singh today accused the Prime Minister of shadow-boxing with the communists instead of addressing the BJPs concerns.         
	The underlying message, some leaders said, was that the BJP was still open to the idea of constructive engagement on the deal.         
	Asked if Rajnath was trying to open a window of opportunity, a party leader said: We have always said our opposition is based on concerns about further (nuclear) tests. Rajnathji is highlighting the difference between our position and that of the Left.         
	Many BJP leaders privately admitted that the deals collapse would not send a positive signal to the urban middle class, which has often rallied behind the saffron party.         
	That is why, they said, the party is desperately trying to make the point that pushing the deal through is the governments responsibility and the main hurdle is the Left, not the BJP.         
	I am sure the government will not be able to move a single step in any direction, the nuclear deal or any other issue, as not only their policies and decisions but even their dreams are held hostage by the Left, Rajnath said.         
	Instead of addressing the nationalist concerns raised by the BJP, Manmohan Singh and his UPA allies are engaging in bouts of verbal boxing through the media, Rajnath said. Such statements and public posturing could jeopardise our long-term and strategic relations with the US and China.        
	The BJP has long been careful about not appearing anti-American, and has been trying to highlight the perils of restricting Indo-US relations to a single issue of the nuclear deal.         
	The party has stressed that the Lefts opposition to the pact stemmed from its commitment to Chinese interests. The Left parties are exposing their true colours and cross-border affiliations, Rajnath said. He cited as a matter of concern CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhans remark that the nuclear deal was an attempt to make India a US outpost against China.        
	The CPI seems to have forgotten it is not a Chinese but an Indian party. Ever since the nuclear deal was mooted, the Left Front has indicated that it is more concerned about protecting Chinas interests than our own.

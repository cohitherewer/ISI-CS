	May 8: The Supreme Court today effectively reinstated Dr P. Venugopal as AIIMS director by striking down a law which health minister A. Ramadoss had got enacted in 2007 to oust the cardiac surgeon.        
	Venugopal (in picture) will remain director till July 3, when his tenure expires under the old law. He officially assumes charge tomorrow.        
	While the decision left the ministry shocked, there was mixed reaction at the AIIMS. Students who have been leading an anti-quota campaign for the past two years celebrated. But for many from the reserved categories, the verdict was worrying.

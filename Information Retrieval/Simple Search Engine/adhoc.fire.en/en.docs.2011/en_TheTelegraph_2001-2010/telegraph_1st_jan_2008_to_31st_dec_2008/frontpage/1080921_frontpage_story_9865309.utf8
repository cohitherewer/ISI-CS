The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Taliban message to India too
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Taliban message to India too
                                    
	Ahmed Rashid, Lahore-based journalist, scholar and author of the acclaimed The Taliban, spoke to Sankarshan Thakur of The Telegraph a few hours after the Marriott attack. Rashid rsquo;s most recent book is Descent Into Chaos, a study on how the war against Islamic extremism in the region is being lost  
	This was coming for a while; most people could see it approaching almost inevitably. To my mind, the horrendous suicide assault on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad is a direct fallout of recent US military strikes inside Pakistani territory along the Afghan border, of the Pakistani Armys own operations in the Waziristan region and probably also of President Asif Ali Zardaris strong appeal this very afternoon against terror. This is the Taliban telling all of us: Here we are, let us see what you do to us.   
	I have followed and studied the Taliban and allied groups in the region for a long time now and this is typical of them. This is an assertion of their ability and their capacity to strike right in the heart of Islamabad, very close to the nerve-centres of the Pakistani establishment. As a target, the Marriott Hotel was keenly picked by the Taliban. It is close to the National Assembly and the Supreme Court, it stands at the core of Islamabads top-security district.         
	More importantly, it is a hotel frequented by Western diplomats  most international conferences and press meets are held there, it is the place where a lot of Western diplomatic activity is daily held. The message the Taliban are trying to send out is tough to miss: America, Get Out or Face our Wrath!         
	I know for a fact that a lot many members of the Pakistani ruling establishment and the diplomatic community were at the Marriott at the time the fidayeen (suicide bomber) rammed in his truck. It was the time of iftaar (the breaking of the Ramazan fast), a lot of people had come there having heard President Zardaris address, it was well timed, as far as the Taliban are concerned.         
	There is a strong message for all of us in this. I do not mean merely Pakistan. I mean the whole region. I mean Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. We have known that Pakistan and Afghanistan have their own Taliban, who are on an ominous comeback trail. From all emerging evidence, India now has its own Taliban too, that is what I think. This threat has to be combated jointly, not by blaming each other.         
	The Taliban, and their influence, is spreading like wild-fire across the region and, as I said, recent American strikes in the frontier and tribal areas of Pakistan have fanned the movement and its ideology. This is clearly something we need to urgently combat. One country or one government cannot do it. Pakistan cannot do it alone. Afghanistan cannot do it, India cannot do it. This is a problem of our entire region and we need regional solutions to it. We have to show unity at this time  the leaderships of Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. If we cannot achieve that, we will all sink into chaos.

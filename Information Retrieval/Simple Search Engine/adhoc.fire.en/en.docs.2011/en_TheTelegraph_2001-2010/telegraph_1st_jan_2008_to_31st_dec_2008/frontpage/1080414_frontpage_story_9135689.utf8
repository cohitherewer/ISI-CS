  - Bloodshed in Bengal amp;   Bihar, peace in Nepal        OUR BUREAU                                                          
	April 13: Three CPM leaders working in the rural job scheme were plucked out for guerrilla-style execution in Bengal and suspected insurgents killed six railway guards in Bihar on a day Maoists were reaping the gains of joining the mainstream in neighbouring Nepal.         
	The jawans were killed when alleged Maoists blew up the Government Railway Police office in Bihars Jhajha railway station. The attackers, around 200, looted arms and ammunition.        
	Police had initially blamed Maoists for the Bengal murders, too, but later said they were investigating whether the assailants were masquerading as insurgents to settle old scores.        
	The three shot dead this afternoon in Bengal were among five labourers taken hostage by seven armed men at Jagannathpur, around 170km from Calcutta, in West Midnapores Salboni. The labourers were taking a break from a road-repairs job under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. The victims, aged 26 to 42, were local leaders of the CPM.        
	We believe the killings were carried out by Maoists, said Raj Kanojia, inspector-general of police.        
	Asim Roy, a labourer who saw the abduction, said: Seven people with rifles slung across their shoulders emerge from the forest (the area falls in Arabari jungle). One of them had a local Congress leader, Biren Singh, by his collar.        
	As soon as they aimed their guns, everyone fled. I hid behind a tree. I saw them tie the hands of the labourers and Biren with gamchhas and lead them down the road.        
	Biren  he and another hostage escaped  said: They made us kneel on the roadside and asked us to shout Maobad Zindabad. They took Mukul, Jugal and Nabakumar away a little inside the jungle and asked them to kneel. Then they fired. I saw all of them fall.        
	The police said they had heard that one Babulal Hembram, once fined by the CPM in a pond dispute, was among the assailants. It is being probed whether the attackers are Maoists or hired criminals.        
	Ironically, the twin attacks coincided with the dramatic poll result in Nepal where Maoists appeared headed to lead the government. Indian Maoists had distanced themselves from Prachandas group after it came overground in Nepal.        
	Today, Sitaram Yechury, Indias main interlocutor with the Nepalese Maoists, said: We hope the Indian Maoists would learn lessons from their Nepalese counterparts and shun violence.

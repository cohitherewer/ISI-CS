										      ZEESHAN JAWED       When the Bengal government sleeps on steps to discipline drivers and the home secretary says accidents cannot be predicted, can a cycle a boy will never ride and a father who cleans it every week shame those in power into action?                                              Kaustav rsquo;s bicycle at his home and the report of the boy rsquo;s death in July 2007.   Picture by   Pradip Sanyal      
	Calcutta, April 9: Kamal Bhattacharya has a Saturday morning ritual: cleaning his sons bicycle.        
	But the bicycle he so religiously dusts has been languishing in one corner of the house since July 19, 2007  the day his 9-year-old son Kaustav died in a car pool accident on VIP Road.         
	I know Sonu (as Kaustav was called at home) will never get on the bicycle but I still clean it every Saturday. He really loved his bicycle. I had gifted it on his sixth birthday, said Kamal, pointing towards the cycle that his son would ride for hours on the Roypara Housing premises in Dum Dum.         
	Like every other day, the Class III student of South Point School hopped into his pool car, a Maruti Omni, at 6am after bidding goodbye to his parents.         
	The pool car was racing down VIP Road  where 21 people lost their lives last Friday  when it lost control and rammed into a stationary bus. Kaustav, who was sitting on the left side, suffered a fatal head injury. The remaining six children, sitting at the back, escaped with minor injuries.         
	Little has changed on Calcuttas lawless roads in the intervening nine months. For the Bhattacharyas, life changed forever at 8.30am on July 19.        
	Kaustavs mother Moushami has gone into a shell. She hardly steps out of the house and does not talk to anyone even at home.        
	She has started having violent fits. She shouts saying she wants to kill the people responsible for Sonus death, said Kamal who works as a personal assistant in the higher education department.        
	Kaustavs maternal grandmother Gouri Bhattacharya, too, has been unable to come to terms with her grandsons death. Her health deteriorated and she has suffered two cardiac arrests since last July. Her left side is paralysed and she is unable to speak.         
	Sonu was close to both his grandmothers and both of them have been affected very badly by his death, said Kamal.         
	Kamal used to give lessons in yoga as a hobby but not anymore. I lost all interest in yoga. I have discontinued the classes. Now I just do not feel like mixing with anybody outside. Both I and my wife stay indoors after I come back from office, Kamal said.        
	What still keeps him going is the determination to ensure that exemplary punishment is handed out to those responsible for the car crash.        
	But the lonely fight has run into a wall that snakes through every facet of life in Bengal. Till now, no chargesheet has been prepared against anybody. I am told that it would be difficult to pursue the case as there are no witnesses. What other proof do they require to believe that my son died because of negligence and rash driving? Even today, other cars of the owner of the Omni continue to ferry school children.        
	Kamal had gone to Lake Town police station in February to enquire about the proceedings but he did not receive a satisfactory reply. The driver, Bikas Singh, was arrested at the time of the accident but now he is out on bail. The police say they cannot do much as there is not enough evidence against him, Kamal said.         
	When The Telegraph contacted the police station, an official said: The officer-in-charge got transferred.        
	But Kamal is soldiering on. I am not going to give up. I will see to it that the killers of my son are brought to book, he said.         
	A government that plays with peoples lives by doing little to enforce the law on roads is unlikely to be of any help to Kamal.        
	He is clinging to the memories swirling around the cycle and a cricket bat. Besides riding his cycle in the complex, Kaustavs other passion was cricket. Every evening he would head to the park in the locality with his bat.         
	Sonu was a huge fan of Sourav Ganguly. At home, he would play shadow cricket and give his own commentary as if Sourav was bowling and he was batting, Kamal said, his eyes welling up.

  - Noida company was on verge of taking back workers        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                            Narender Singh Gangwar, the injured assistant manager, in hospital. Picture by Prem Singh                                        
	Greater Noida, Sept. 23: Graziano Transmission India may have been on the verge of reinstating many of the employees it had suspended when angry workers killed the firms CEO here yesterday.        
	Company sources and workers independently said the management had promised to take back  as soon as September 25  most of the employees it had punished on the ground of indiscipline.        
	Yesterday, a mob of over 100 workers clubbed CEO Lalit Chowdhury to death at the plant, injured over a dozen other employees who resisted and beat up 10 security guards.        
	Industry chambers condemned the daylight murder, blaming irresponsible workers of the company, the Indian subsidiary of an Italian auto components firm.        
	The Graziano plant wore a deserted look today. It has been closed indefinitely, the guards manning the gates said. Most of the guards who were present during the violence have fled or are in hospital. They are probably too afraid to come back, said Atma Ram.        
	Ram, his left hand plastered, was the only member of that team of guards on the premises today, his colleagues said. At Kailash Hospital, 2km away, Narender Singh Gangwar recounted the horror of those few minutes.        
	The workers were protesting outside the gate till around 12.30pm. They entered when the gates were opened for a company truck. There was no arguing with them. They started their assault and I happened to be one of their first targets, said Gangwar, assistant manager (productions).        
	The workers swung their iron rods at anyone who came in their way, said Gangwar, his head swathed in bandages and stitched up at seven places.        
	Company sources said the dispute at the 10-year-old plant began when five recently hired workers started encouraging the rest to seek better work conditions. But the workers alleged the company would not let them form a union and constantly threatened to sack them if they opposed the poor work conditions.        
	First, 27 workers were suspended and their case was referred to the district labour commissioner, company sources said. The commissioners report recommended that 16 be sacked and the remaining 11 reinstated.         
	Over 200 of the plants estimated 350 workers protested against the sack order by refusing to work, workers representatives and company officials said. The company suspended these workers too.        
	However, at a company meeting on September 16, the management decided to take back as many of the suspended workers as possible.        
	We told the suspended workers that all of them would be reconsidered, a company official said. The workers were to fill out a form stating their desire to rejoin the company and hand it in by yesterday.        
	The company, however, made it clear that the 16 served with termination orders would not be taken back at any cost. The labour commissioners orders are sacrosanct for us too. Also, in the companys interests, we did not want to take back potential troublemakers, an official said.        
	At least five of the 16 are, ironically, former employees of a Honda plant in Gurgaon where workers were brutally thrashed by policemen for protesting against the management in 2005.        
	Graziano had promised that the submitted forms would be scanned and all except any miscreants would be taken back at a board meeting on September 25, officials and workers said.

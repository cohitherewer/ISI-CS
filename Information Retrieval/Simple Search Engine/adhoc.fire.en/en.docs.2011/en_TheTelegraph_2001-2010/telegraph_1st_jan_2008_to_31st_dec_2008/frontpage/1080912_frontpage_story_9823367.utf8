The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | From floor 99, I watched the plane hit, at eye level
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   From floor 99, I watched the plane hit, at eye level
                                            
	Nafisa Degani, who was born in Calcutta and spent many years in Elliot Road, was busy working on the 99th floor of Tower Two of the World Trade Center when it was hit. The resident of New York recounts 9/11.        
	September 11, 2001. World Trade Center, New York. Tower Two. Ninety-ninth floor. I sat down cheerfully at my desk on yet another morning in the contract wording department at Aon Re Inc. It was my sons 18th birthday.        
	I was speaking to my boss about that when she saw an aircraft come into view. This was not unusual; we would see a number of helicopters and aircraft come close for a touristy view of the towers. Sometimes, we could even see the pilots inside.        
	But this was different. This aircraft was headed for the tower! In the next few seconds, from my position on one of the highest floors, I actually saw the aircraft dissolve into the building. Seen from eye-level, just a few metres away.        
	One of the first things to happen was the environment turning dark, flames shooting out and papers flying all over. For us in the second tower and immediately overlooking the hot spot this was not really alarming. After all, it was only an accident that would be corrected soon, right?        
	Dilemma one. Should I leave or should I stay? Stay, of course. After all, this had happened to another building, not ours. This was an accident, so why worry? This would have attracted the attention of the utility services, so why fret?        
	So I did what was most compelling in the circumstances: stand and watch. After all, this was something unprecedented, the world would need to know what had happened and we made sure we got a ringside view so that we could tell our family every detail when we got home that evening. Besides, the intercom announced that we stay calm, keep sitting in our places and that everything would be okay. Surely the fellows on the intercom knew what they were talking about!        
	So my boss continued to describe to her friend on the phone what was happening. Some of my other colleagues were busy describing how this plane came in from nowhere and how the pilot must have lost control. My colleagues were busy watching the multicolour of the big ball of fire a few feet away from the comfort of their air-conditioned rooms. It was like a Spielberg film unfolding in front of us where we were expected to be the passive audience rolling our eyes and mouths in wonder. Period.        
	Then something else happened. A large flame ball shot out from the other side of the building. The flame kept coming closer every second. Staring in my face now. What if the glass windows shattered? Thats when something inside me shouted: Get the hell out of here! The next instant, I had snatched my purse from the desk and run for the foyer.        
	Dilemma two. Take the elevator or run down the stairs? The elevator would have taken a few minutes with a change of lifts on the 78th floor. If I ran down, it would take 45 minutes. The voice inside said elevator. I took the stairs instead. This is what happened on the stairs from storey 99 to storey zero:        
	* The crowd kept swelling with each passing floor.        
	* Hardly anyone talked. All you could hear was the rhythmic stomping of hundreds of feet. Thump! Thump! Thump!        
	* Some ladies tore their skirts and yanked off their stilettos so they could run faster. I was lucky; I was in trousers and flats.        
	* People helped. People supported. No shoving. No stampede. No let me get out first. A huge shake to Tower Two when we were in the 40s (I later learnt we had been hit).        
	When we reached ground zero, there were policemen to escort us out of the building. I actually got out, walked over to the other side, looked up  and saw two giant candles aflame. I stood entranced for a few minutes. A few minutes.        
	Dilemma three. Stand and watch or run? Surely stand and watch. After all, it was just a fire and even if it were to extend all the way down, endangering me, it would probably take hours. That voice inside me screamed Run! I turned and bolted. Within seconds, the second tower  my building had imploded.        
	I ran and ran and ran uptown to Washington Place. Non-stop. I dont know how long. I collapsed and probably passed out. It was like a pause in my memory. When I regained consciousness I saw this stranger  Laura  come forward to help. When I told her I had been in Tower Two, she exclaimed: Oh my God!        
	She took me home, gave me water and food. I established contact with my family a few hours later  it was trauma for them. I went to the house of a relative and returned home the following morning.        
	It took me months to get back into stride. Our office lost 174 members in all from several floors. I lost my colleagues who were like sisters  of nine years. My department was completely finished. Nothing was found of two of my colleagues. No memorials, no burials. They simply vaporised.

  - Book Fair blow forces Karat to defer launch of N-essays           JAYANTH JACOB                             Karat                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: As chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has no business promoting the Calcutta Book Fair. But you cant say that to his party boss.        
	Prakash Karat has every business to rue the loss after this years event was cancelled  not as Comrade Karat but as Publisher Prakash.        
	I am a publisher, too, Karat told The Telegraph today, adding that his group had lined up the formal launch of a book at the Calcutta event.        
	Karat is the managing director of the publishing group, aptly titled Leftword. Such careful thought has also been given to the title of the book that was to have been unveiled in Calcutta: Uncle Sams Nuclear Cabin.        
	Written by Prabir Purkayastha, Ninan Koshy and M.K. Bhadrakumar and priced at Rs 95, the book details the CPMs opposition to the Indo-US nuclear deal through three essays.        
	It (the Book Fair) is a big affair in Kolkata and a very important event, and it is unfortunate that the court has made an interference, Karat said, asked whether the state government and the party were wasting time fighting for the annual sale. The event is all the more significant, considering most book fairs in the country have not survived, he added.        
	Leftword has not yet decided whether to take part in the alternative fair in Salt Lake in March to launch the book. Some copies of the book are already in circulation.        
	Karat touched upon the nuclear deal, too. He said there was no forward movement on the deal, refusing to attach any significance to Pranab Mukherjees statement that India might face nuclear isolation if the pact fell through.        
	The government will get back to the UPA-Left committee on the nuclear deal after the IAEA talks. Thats all I have to say on the issue, the CPM leader said, adding that Mukherjee had his own compulsions for making such a statement.        
	Karat iterated his partys stand on the womens reservation bill. There is no consensus on the bill. Let the government go ahead with it. The political parties reserving one-third of the candidates doesnt serve any purpose.        
	For example, a party can field one-third of total candidates in a state where it is weak, and give more seats to male candidates in a state where it has better prospects. This doesnt increase womens representation in Parliament, he said.        
	There can be differences within a party on the issue. But the Left parties, the BJP and the Congress constitute three-fourth of the members in Parliament.

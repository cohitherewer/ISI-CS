	Patna/Gaya/Bokaro, March 9: A well-fortified rebel bunker thought to be used as a training camp was busted by police at a village near Gaya while their Bokaro counterparts failed to capture anyone even after zeroing in on a Maoist den in Nawadih today.        
	Gaya superintendent of police Amit Jain said Special Task Force (STF) jawans raided Asuran village  about 150km from Patna  in a forest and hilly area along the Gaya-Dobhi-Sherghati road under Imamganj police station early this morning.        
	STF sources said the bunker had been built 7ft beneath the earths upper surface and was spacious enough to accommodate at least 30 guerrillas with arms. They added that Maoists had been using it to train their newly recruited youths in guerrilla warfare.         
	Its keeper, Pundi Bhokta, a Naxalite leader wanted for many years, was arrested. Four hand grenades, 15,165 live cartridges, two pistols and uniforms and literature of Naxalites were also seized.        
	However, the men in uniform returned empty-handed from Jaruabera under Nawadih police station, about 30km from Bokaro, as the 30-odd rebels fled on time from a temporary training camp.        
	The jawans of CRPF and district police ventured twice  once in the morning and again in the afternoon  to hold the rebels but could not taste success even as firing from both sides continued for several hours.        
	Maoist nabbed        
	Maoist zonal commander Rakesh Paswan alias Kislay Jee was arrested in Daltongunj today. The police picked up Paswan when he had gone there for treatment.        
	Paswan, suffering from malaria, was wanted in nine cases, Palamau police superintendent Deepak Kumar said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Fronts repentance budget   Food for poor before polls
                                                                                                           Fronts repentance budget
   Food for poor before polls          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	Calcutta, March 17: The Left Front government has remembered those it had been accused of forgetting, its memory possibly jogged by the approaching panchayat polls.         
	Asim Dasgupta has squeezed into the budget unveiled today a series of social welfare schemes, the most striking of which is a programme to feed daily the poorest of the poor, including beggars.        
	The scheme is expected to benefit at least 4 lakh people. Food cooked by self-help groups will be given every day to every one of the poorest section, the finance minister said.        
	The criteria for identifying the poor have not been announced yet. But officials said the scheme was mainly aimed at those too weak to take part in rural job programmes.        
	The over-riding theme of the budget seemed to be an eagerness to address charges that the Left government had drifted away from its core constituency by concentrating on industrialisation.         
	Industry, the segment the government has been accused of pampering, did not get much other than simplification of rules governing value-added tax and audit reports.        
	But business did not seem to mind. Industry needs an enabling environment and good infrastructure. We are not looking for sops for which there is hardly any scope in the state budget, CII eastern region general secretary Sunil Mishra said.        
	Industry can, however, take solace from the states willingness to mitigate the fallout of land acquisition. A Rs 100-crore fund will be used to re-skill landlosers.        
	The budget increased to Rs 130 crore from Rs 40 crore the outlay of the department that looks after minority affairs and madarsa education. The Sachar committee had underscored the dismal condition of Muslims in Bengal, and Nandigram is believed to have upset the community.        
	The state budget sought to touch the lives of a wide cross-section. The provident fund scheme for unorganised sector workers will now include maids, while poor girl students attending Class VIII-XII will be given Rs 100 a month.        
	Asked whether he has turned Kalpataru  the mythical tree that fulfils wishes  before the polls, Dasgupta said: My budget is aimed at the poorest of the poor. So it wont be proper to label me Kalpataru.        
	Dasgupta followed in the footsteps of P. Chidambaram by increasing the pay for sahayikas, samprasaraks and samprasarikas in health and education. The Union budget had raised the remuneration of anganwadi workers.        
	But Dasgupta did take a detour from Chidambarams path by imposing a one-time tax on new cars.         
	A medical benefit scheme will entitle government employees to reimbursement for treatment in select private hospitals in addition to government facilities. But the monthly medical allowance will be withdrawn for those enlisting for the new scheme.        
	A scheme for compassionate appointments has been restored, too.        
	The final budget deficit has been projected at Rs 2 crore.

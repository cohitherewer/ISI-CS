  - Senate set to clear bill after debating killer amendments          K.P. NAYAR                              Singh, Bush: Thursday seal?				                                       
	Washington, Oct. 1: Nearly three and a quarter years after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and US President George W. Bush took the first steps together in the White House to end Indias long nuclear winter, the process is finally drawing to a close.         
	If the US Senate approves the deal allowing nuclear co-operation with India, as expected at the time of writing, Bush will be able to sign the legislation into law on Thursday.         
	The final Senate vote on the deal is scheduled to take place around 7.30pm local time on Wednesday (5am IST on Thursday), according to the Senate calendar this morning.         
	Once Bush signs the deal into law, his secretary of state Condoleezza Rice will personally carry the deal package to New Delhi on Friday, if the present plans stay on course.         
	There, she and external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee will sign the inter-governmental agreement operationalising the deal, which nearly ended Singhs rule only a few months ago.         
	Mukherjee, who is now in New York, will fly back home in time to receive Rice and sign the deal.         
	The Senate began its debate  expected to last three and a half hours  on the deal this morning after the last two anonymous holds on the legislation allowing nuclear co-operation with India were lifted late last night.         
	Under Senate procedures, any senator can single-handedly hold up legislation in the chamber simply by writing to their party leaders seeking a hold on any bill. The identity of the senator who holds up the legislation remains secret. Last night, Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate, who have been working overtime to move the deal package to the chamber floor, worked out a compromise.         
	As a result, senators opposed to the deal were allowed to move two killer amendments and debate each amendment for one hour. In addition, the sponsors of these amendments were given the floor for 15 minutes each.         
	At the time of writing, these two sponsors were working to combine their amendments, designed to kill the deal, into one powerful slingshot, which they hoped could marshal greater support on the floor.         
	But as the debate advanced in the Senate, it became obvious that no killer amendment would get off the floor. Under the Senate rules for the deal package, 60 votes are required for any amendment to pass and the opponents of the deal are unlikely to be able to muster such broad support.         
	On the other hand, at the time of writing, supporters of the deal were confident that they would get more than 60 votes that are needed for sending the package to the White House for signature. But they feared that their tally will be less than the 85 senators who voted for the Hyde Act in 2006 with 12 votes against.         
	The effort that went into moving the nuclear deal through the US House of Representatives and the Senate at breakneck speed ought to persuade the Prime Minister to declare afresh that the people of India love the little-known, low-key Harry Reid, the leader of Democrats in the Senate, and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House.         
	Many Americans are aghast that Reid today gave priority in the Senate for the deal with India over the bailout package for Wall Street right in the middle of the US financial crisis.         
	They are also taken aback that Pelosi spent about as much time engineering a compromise on the deal in the House as she did for the failed effort to pass the bailout bill in the House.         
	In the House, there were no committee hearings on the deal package while in the Senate there was a token hearing at the foreign relations committee with just one administration official testifying.

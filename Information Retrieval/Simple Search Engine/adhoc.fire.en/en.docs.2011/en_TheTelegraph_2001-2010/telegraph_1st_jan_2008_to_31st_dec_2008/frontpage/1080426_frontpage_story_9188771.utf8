          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Chagala                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 25: After allegations and counter-allegations, Akshay Behera alias Chagala, has confessed that Raja Acharya killed Biranchi Das.         
	A senior police officer, associated with the investigation, said Chagalas interrogation conducted yesterday after his SDJM appearance, has revealed a lot. The police now believe they have zeroed in on the sequence of events that led to the murder. And the accuseds verdict matches evidence found at the murder spot and tally with eyewitness reports.         
	Though police remained tight-lipped about Chagalas volte-face from his Bhopal confession before a television channel, sources said Chagala confessed that it was Raja who shot at Biranchi, while he was standing beside his boss.         
	Chagala apparently claimed his innocence and has added that he was not aware that Raja was armed when he set up a meeting with the coach.         
	The close aide of the gangster has allegedly insisted during interrogation that his boss had just asked him to accompany him to the Judo Association Hall and once there asked Chagala to call out to Biranchi.         
	When the coach come out, Raja was standing near the main door. Then the two walked to a concrete bench in front of the hall and began to talk. Suddenly, Raja took out a pistol and fired at Biranchi, ignoring the coachs repeated pleas to not shoot him.         
	Chagala, a substance abuser, is said to have narrated the sequence of events and meeting between Raja Acharya and Biranchi that took place prior to the murder. The close aide has reportedly said that they fled from the spot on his motorbike. He then travelled to Calcutta and to Bhopal  however, police remained tight-lipped as to whether Chagala gave misleading statements under pressure.        
	We are following up some leads but it wont be possible to divulge details now. It can be given only after the completion of interrogation, said police commissioner Binay Kumar Behera. He added that if necessary a narco-analysis would be conducted.        
	Earlier, Chagala had gone on air saying that Raja Acharya was not involved in the murder of Biranchi and had named album co-ordinator Jubuli Sundaray, as the murderer. Actress Leslie Tripathy and Bidusmita and her brother Arun Mantri along with senior IAS official Priyabrata Patnaik were also named as conspirators.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Fans will make us the best, says SRK
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Fans will make us the best, says SRK
  - Countdown to Knight Riders debut           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            A Knight Riders poster featuring Shah Rukh Khan                                        
	Mumbai, April 9: Shah Rukh Khans association with Calcutta actually began decades ago when, as a masscom student at the Jamia Millia Islamia University, he chose the city to be the theme of his audio-visual presentation.        
	Bollywoods badshah has, of course, renewed ties with his ownership of the Kolkata Knight Riders. The team is among the more high profile ones in the path-breaking Indian Premier League (IPL).        
	I think that AV presentation went off very well and Im hoping that my latest association is just as successful. Id like the fans to turn out in huge numbers and, even if we arent the best team, their support will make us into one, a grinning Shah Rukh told The Telegraph this evening.        
	Speaking in his top-of-the-line silver BMW, during the hour-long drive from Goregaons Film City to his Bandra Bandstand residence, Shah Rukh added: I realise that the countdown to our first match has begun, but I dont have much of a role now. Its almost time to get on to the park and start playing. Time to get on with the job instead of looking at whats done and whats not done.        
	The Knight Riders first game is on the opening day, April 18, in Bangalore.        
	Being a hands-on owner, Shah Rukh has put in enough sweat and tears to match the effort seen in his blockbusters. Over the years, there have been quite a few.         
	Im a little tired, I must say. I didnt expect so many hurdles. Im passionate about everything I do and this IPL thing hasnt been any different. Believe me, Im not in it to make money. Surely, I dont need to own a cricket team for that, Shah Rukh said, lighting yet another cigarette.        
	One such hurdle is the entertainment tax being levied by the Bengal government. If an exemption isnt given, then I wont be able to entertain fans at the Eden with a song-and-dance routine during the break between innings.        
	The tax could amount to around Rs 1 crore for every match, assuming its a full house in each of the seven home games. A lot of my friends want to perform... Kareena (Kapoor), Rani (Mukerji). But Id like to treat them as professionals and pay their fees. Mohali, I believe, has already got an exemption, Shah Rukh pointed out.        
	An appeal has been made to the government, but Shah Rukh hasnt personally spoken to anybody in authority.        
	Look, Im not good at these things. I dont seek favours and, equally, nobody wants favours from me. Somebody in the administration could, out of goodwill, sanction something. A week later, however, I wouldnt like headlines saying an exception was made. I dont do anything illegal and wouldnt encourage anything which isnt proper, Shah Rukh said.         
	Incidentally, till Shah Rukh heard about Mithun Chakrabortys takeover of the Calcutta team in the Indian Cricket League, hed been wanting to invite him for the Knight Riders first match in Calcutta, on April 20. I realise that cant be done now, he regretted.         
	Mithun wont be there, but the Kareenas certainly will be around  even if they dont perform on a makeshift stage.

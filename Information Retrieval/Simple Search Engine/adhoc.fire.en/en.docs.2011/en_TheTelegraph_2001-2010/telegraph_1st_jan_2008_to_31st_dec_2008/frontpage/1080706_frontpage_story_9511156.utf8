                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Lalu freight hikes nipped 
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                            Lalu Prasad                                  
	New Delhi, July 5: Lalu Prasad had quietly raised freight on essentials like foodgrain and coal from July 1 but the finance ministry has forced him to withdraw the hike because of fears it would add fuel to the inflation fire.        
	This was the seventh time in four months that Lalu Prasad had raised freight by issuing circulars, looking to show better earnings, after proclaiming in the rail budget that there would be no across-the-board hikes in 2008-09.        
	But in a stinging letter, the finance ministry accused the railways of contributing to price rise by increasing freight through the backdoor.        
	The railways rolled back the latest hike through a circular on July 3, two days after it came into effect, but the earlier freight increases remain in place.        
	The latest increase, dubbed a special supplementary charge, was of five to seven per cent and had come on commodities such as ores, minerals, petro products, fertilisers, foodgrain, coke and coal.        
	With inflation well into double digits, the finance ministry decided to act this time. The matter, sources said, was taken up with the Prime Ministers Office (PMO).        
	Other than the price rise fears, the hike directly affected the finance ministry in relation to certain products like fertilisers, since the ministry subsidises the producers completely on freight charges. The fertiliser producers claimed the freight money from the finance ministry.        
	Lalu Prasads move, however, presents a rare instance of an Indian politician showing concern for the balance sheet. Perhaps it was an effect of his brush with IIM, Harvard and Wharton students, to whom he had explained his ministrys amazing turnaround.        
	Few will miss the irony, though: the reform-friendly finance ministry acting populist after a politician expected to pander to populism tried to do his job, which is to improve his ministrys performance.         
	Lalu Prasad had brought about the earlier hikes either by re-classifying commodities or by levying additional charges, such as the busy season, busy route and congestion charges.        
	The last and now-revoked hike was announced just two weeks after he had claimed that despite the Rs 3 hike per litre of diesel, the railways were examining the possibility of a further reduction in freight to compete with the road transport sector.        
	He had also said that the railways would absorb the diesel price hike by improving their productivity, efficiency and volumes.

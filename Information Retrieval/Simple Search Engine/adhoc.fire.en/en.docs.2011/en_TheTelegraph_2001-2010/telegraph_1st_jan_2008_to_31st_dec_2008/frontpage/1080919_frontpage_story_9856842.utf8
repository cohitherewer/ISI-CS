              New Delhi, Sept 19 : Atiq, a militant wanted in connection with the serial blasts in Delhi and Ahmedabad, and his associate were killed while two Delhi police personnel were injured in a fierce encounter in Jamia Nagar of south Delhi today.  Talking to reporters, Joint Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Karnail Singh said that acting on intelligence inputs, the police raided the house where Atiq and four other militants were holed up. In the exchange of fire that ensued, Atiq and another militant were killed.  While one militant was arrested, two managed to escape during the operation, he added.  Mohan Chand Sharma, an inspector who led the team, and a head constable were injured in the heavy exchange of fire.  The Delhi Police special cell carried out the encounter after getting a tip off from Ahmedabad blasts mastermind Mufti Abu Bhashir, who is presently in police custody.  The interrogation report of Bashir, a cleric from Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh, had revealed that he stayed in Delhi between July 24 and 27 at two different places.  His brother Abu Zar was working as a parking attendant in Old Delhi while two of his other contacts Danish and Aftab were staying in South Delhi.  Five bombs exploded in quick succession in crowded markets and busy streets in Delhi on Saturday, killing 20 and injuring at least 90.  Jaipur, Ahmadabad and Bengaluru were hit by serial blasts in recent months killing and injuring hundreds of people.  An outfit quot;Indian Mujahideen quot; has claimed responsibility for the blasts, but authorities suspect it to be an offshoot of the SIMI.

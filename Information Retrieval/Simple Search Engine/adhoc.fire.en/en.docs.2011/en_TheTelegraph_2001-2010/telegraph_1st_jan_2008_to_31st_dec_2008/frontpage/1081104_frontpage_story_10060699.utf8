          SAMBIT SAHA                            R.S. Lodha, B.K. Birla                           
	Calcutta, Nov. 3: A Birla-controlled company had filed a petition to free the MP Birla flagship from the control of the Lodhas a day after Rajendra Singh Lodha was cremated, according to the counsel for the Lodhas.        
	R.S. Lodha died of cardiac arrest on October 3 in London at the residence of Basant Kumar Birla. Lodha was brought to Calcutta on October 8 where his last rites were performed on the same day.        
	Rameshwara Jute Mills, a Birla-controlled company, filed the petition with the Company Law Board (CLB) immediately thereafter, seeking that the boards of Birla Corporation and its 25-odd shareholding companies be superseded, Debanjan Mandal, the counsel for the Lodhas and a partner of Fox and Mandal Solicitors, said.         
	The petition, signed October 9, sought the appointment of an independent committee to administer the companies.        
	Birla Corporation is the flagship of the MP Birla empire, at the centre of a dispute after it passed on to the Lodhas under a disputed will of Priyamvada Birla who died in 2004. Lodha was the chartered accountant of several Birla companies.        
	A similar petition by Rameshwara was filed on another MP Birla group company, Vindhya Telelinks.         
	The fresh legal salvo was fired despite an indication by B.K. Birla that he would not pursue the cases to take control of the MP Birla group.         
	Confirming Lodhas death at his London residence, B.K. Birla had told The Telegraph on October 3 that the battle of wills was no longer important to him. The 88-year-old industrialist was leading the Birla familys challenge to Lodhas claim to the MP Birla group.        
	B.K. Birla could not be reached for comment this evening. He has gone to sleep. Please call tomorrow, an aide said from Birla Park in Calcutta.        
	When the petition came up before the CLB for hearing on October 15, it passed an interim order restraining Birla Corp from holding any board meetings except for quarterly results.        
	A similar interim order was passed in the case of Vindhya Telelinks. The orders meant that Harsh V. Lodha, the son of R.S. Lodha, could not be appointed chairman of Birla Corp and Vindhya Telelinks.        
	Birla Corp then moved a vacation bench of Calcutta High Court and got a stay on October 24. The bench set aside the CLB order but passed a restriction saying the chairman could not be appointed. But board meetings can take place.        
	Subsequently, Harsh Lodha chaired the board meetings of the MP Birla group companies.         
	Vindhya Telelinks approached Jabalpur High Court, which stayed the entire proceedings at the CLB, Mandal said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Oh, Hillary! Obama off the blocks with a bang
                                                                                                        Oh, Hillary! Obama off the blocks with a bang
          K.P. NAYAR                            Barack Obama with daughter Sasha in Iowa. (Reuters)                                  
	Washington, Jan. 4: The vague idea of a Black President for America dramatically moved into the realm of possibility last night after Barack Obamas stunning victory among Iowa Democrats as their candidate in this Novembers election to the White House.In a convincing victory that beat all opinion polls, Obama, a newcomer to national politics and a one-term Senator from Illinois consigned Hillary Clinton to the third place in shock, decisively ending the inevitability of her presidential run this year.        
	Obama accepted his win in Iowa in a speech in which he pledged to end the outsourcing of jobs although he did not mention either India or China -- an issue among thousands of Americans who have seen their jobs move to these two countries.        
	I will be a President who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and put a middle-class tax cut into the pockets of the working Americans who deserve it, Obama said.        
	Hillary Clintons decisive defeat in Iowa is a setback to Indian Americans, who gave her millions of dollars in campaign money in recent months.        
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel broke convention and protocol by attending a fundraiser for her in New York, giving the impression that India was supporting the former First Ladys candidature.        
	There were surprises on the Republican side too. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who emerged as an unexpected favourite in the final weeks of the campaign in Iowa, decisively defeated former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who had money and organisational support as an early front-runner.        
	Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani fared so badly in opinion polls that he opted out of the Iowa contest. He finished last night in a distant sixth place.        
	If Huckabee manages to keep up his winning streak in Iowa -- which is an uphill task since he has no money and little national recognition -- and ultimately goes to the White House, it will be second time in history that the little known Arkansas town of Hope would have given this country a President.        
	Bill Clinton was also born in Hope, became Arkansas governor and was the surprising choice of Democrats as their presidential candidate in 1992.        
	Last night, standing beside his wife as she put on a brave face and egged supporters on to campaign for her in the party primary in New Hampshire, the former President clearly looked downcast.        
	Madeleine Albright, his former secretary of state, who flanked Hillary on the other side, made no attempt to hide her clearly sour face. Despite Obamas 38 per cent win over her own 29 per cent in Iowa, all is not lost for Hillary Clinton.        
	But if she loses in New Hampshire too to Obama in another five days, Democrats in South Carolina, who are largely Black, will be tempted to overwhelmingly vote for Obama, although, for the record, he was born of a White mother and a Kenyan father.         
	South Carolina, where Black support for Hillary has been high so far, holds its Democratic primary in 22 days.        
	Black voters there will be particularly impressed that Obama won in Iowa where, according to analysts last night, no Black man or woman has ever been elected to even a minor public office.        
	Three primary wins in a row for Obama will be a near-fatal blow to Hillary Clinton although her campaign machine is robust and has the most funds.        
	Last nights developments took a toll of two Democratic presidential aspirants who fared miserably in Iowa. Joseph Biden, a Senate veteran of over three decades from Delaware, staunch supporter of India and current chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gave up his bid after getting only one per cent of the vote.        
	Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, who has been a member of the House of Representatives and the Senate for 32 years, also ended his presidential aspirations after securing only 0.02 per cent of support from Iowas caucus-goers.        
	Former North Carolina Senator John Edwards, who won second place in Iowa with 30 per cent, was the Democratic Partys vice-presidential candidate in 2004.  
	Is it all over for Hillary?  
	Not yet. Hillary and Obama face a big test in the New Hampshire primary in five days  
	Then why is Iowa important?  
	Iowa caucuses have served as springboards for winners, providing them a killer bounce. But there have been exceptions (See caucus guide on Page 3)  
	Why is Obama so upbeat now?  
	He outpolled Hillary among women and first-timers. Plus Iowa is an overwhelmingly White state mdash; the victory is a sign that America could be ready for a Black President  
	What if Obama carries New Hampshire?  
	The giant-slayer could then become an unstoppable  superstar, though other tests   lie ahead   
	Can rsquo;t Hillary stop him in New Hampshire?  
	Hillary has a potent weapon mdash; Bill Clinton. The same state had helped the former President rally and become the Comeback Kid in 1992. Bill is expected to campaign extensively there for his wife now  
	OBAMA FILE  
	Obama rsquo;s father was born in Kenya; his mother was White  
	Obama grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia  
	Earned law degree from Harvard. Became the first Black president of the Harvard Law Review  
	Married to Michelle. Has two daughters, Malia and Sasha  
	Favours eliminating tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas

 - 5 die in firing by Gorlosa men

	Nagaon, Jan. 14: Militants were in business even on a day of merrymaking in Assam, killing five in a burst of indiscriminate firing in and around a Neepco installation in the North Cachar Hills. 
    
	Two guards, a teenaged girl basking in the afternoon sun with her mother, a beggar who was passing by and a contractor fell to bullets fired from automatic weapons. The first two to die were Trolin Lamare, 32, and Suresh Koch, 40, who were guarding the entrance to the Kopili powerhouse, about 18km from Umrangsu town. 
    
	The next targets of the militants were Kochs 13-year-old daughter Anamika and wife Junumai, who were on the verandah of their house when gunshots broke their reverie. The teenager was killed and Junumai was battling for life at the Neepco Hospital in Umrangsu till late in the night.
    
	The other two casualties in the attack were Sahadeb Nath, a beggar who was going around the campus with his four-year-old son Ajay in tow, and small-time contractor Jatia. Ajay was injured in the firing.
    
	Police said the Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dima Halam Daogah was most likely to be behind the attack, which occurred around 1pm.
    
	Witnesses told the police that militants arrived at the Neepco office in a Bolero and fired at the two guards. Lamare and Koch tried to retaliate but were outnumbered.
    
	 The firing lasted between four and five minutes. The militants hurled a grenade as they made a quick exit from the campus, said a horrified Neepco employee. 
    
	Senior Neepco engineer L. Liana was one of those who had a lucky escape. Two bullets whizzed above his head before he realised what was happening and ran for cover.
    
	The general manager of Neepcos Umrangsu unit, Rajat Sarma, said the firing began when the two guards signalled to the driver of the black Bolero carrying the killers to stop the vehicle at the main gate. They entered the campus and travelled 50 metres before randomly firing at people. 
    
	Personnel from Umrangsu police station and a CRPF unit stationed there reached the Neepco station almost an hour after the incident. 
    
	The police said the attack may have been provoked by Neepcos refusal to pay money to the Gorlosa group. However, Sarma denied receiving an extortion note from any militant group. 
    
	A company of the 6th Assam Police Battalion was deployed a year ago to escort senior Neepco officials after repeated threats. 
    
	The battalions camp is just 200 metres from the main gate of the powerhouse, but the personnel stationed there were on duty elsewhere when the militants struck, a senior police officer said. 
    
	Extortion attempts by the Dimasa militant group have triggered an exodus of government as well as private sector employees from Umrangsu.
    
	Apart from the Neepco powerhouse, Umrangsu has three cement factories, a tea estate, a temporary office of the North Eastern Council and branches of most departments operating under the North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council.

                                                                                                           Bed of coal        The tandoor might be better known, but the sigree is as crucial, says Nondon Bagchi                       A glimpse of the restaurant and (above) a tandoori delicacy. Pictures by Rashbehari Das      Archaeological evidence tells us that the tandoor which has more or less become a symbol for the north Indian style of cooking mdash; specifically grilling and baking mdash; dates back well over 7,000 years. Excavators in the Indus Valley have shown that our forefathers used this cavernous clay oven with live coals at the bottom, which could be closed at the top, even before 5000 BC. The practice was prevalent, later on, in Balkan and Soviet countries, and also in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Side by side, of course, there has always been the sigree, another typical north Indian barbecuing device, probably as ancient, but an ldquo;open rdquo; grill, also coal-fired. All the kathi-roll shops in Calcutta and all the Mughlai restaurants use sigrees and many establishments use both tandoors and sigrees.   When I first started eating kathi rolls, the beef ones cost a princely 25p or four annas, or ldquo;charzees rdquo; as we used to say. On skewers all lined up on a sigree, as soon as an order was placed the meat would be taken off the skewer, tossed about on a griddle with onions and green chillies and wrapped up in a parantha for one of Calcutta rsquo;s most famous trademarks. For the classic kathi roll, only a sigree will do just as a tandoor is a must for certain other kebabs and items.  What is fascinating, though, is that common to all the countries mentioned earlier mdash; where tandoors have been used for thousands of years mdash; harsh winds, sand and dust are a part and parcel of the environment. And even blizzards. And hence, the protective clay cavern, which can also be closed.  In places like the Kashmir valley, on the other hand, where such conditions do not exist, sigrees are the mainstay and well-suited for the slow cooking of their celebrated Rogan Josh and Shab Deg, which is cooked through the night and finished at dawn.  So if you open a restaurant with a vision of recreating traditional dishes from this region and the North West Frontier in general, from both sides of the border, or rather with the thought that the border is not even there, what is a good name to give it?  Sigree, of course. A new addition to Calcutta rsquo;s restaurants, from the same stable as Mainland China, Oh! Calcutta and Haka, on the EM Bypass at Silver Arcade, a spacious, well-appointed place with great ambience and a well-researched menu with dishes like Pukhtuni Shorba, Multani Chaat, Paneer Rawalpindi, Tandoori Chicken Peshawari, Gujarariwala Sheekh, Pathani Hing Kebab, Borderwali Machhli and Chaamp-e-Baluchistan. There are familiar dishes from the Mughal kitchens of Delhi and the nawabi kitchens of Awadh as well, including many of our Punjabi favourites. And of course, the tandoor is as frequently used as the sigree. But all in all a great concept, a balanced menu and high-standard delicious food at real value-for-money price.  There has also been a serious effort to go easy on oil and fat content and chefs have travelled to London to attend courses on how this can be done without sacrificing taste and quality. For example, Bhunnawa Methi Machhli and Tandoori Bekti Masala have no oil used as an ingredient. The Methi Machli is first marinated in a mix of lemon juice, ginger paste, water and salt and then the second marination is in yoghurt, fenugreek powder, green chillies and gramflour, dry roasted and then put in a tandoor. No basting is done.  For the Tandoori Bekti, whole baby Calcutta bektis (about 700 g) are used. Similar marinations with a few variations are used and the whole fish is put in the tandoor. Again, no oil.   Starters to recommend are Multani Chaat and Dilliwali Tikki, both street-food recipes, both vegetarian. The first is hand-pressed baby potato wedges served with a delicious tangy chutney made with dry mango powder, sugar, red chilli powder, dry ginger powder, salt and water. The second is potato tikkas done on a griddle and served with the same sauce. Chutneywali Makai Sheekh mdash; a super hot and sour chutney mdash; and Jhinga Jaituni (prawns steeped in a marinade flavoured with fresh ginger, garlic and chopped olives and slow cooked in a tandoor) are other fine starters.   Being a staunch Calcuttan, I did feel a bit wistful when the Zaffrani Chilman Biryani (with mutton) arrived without potatoes, but I must say it was excellent; not too moist and the meat soft as butter. As it was with the Kareli Rogan Josh. Overall an impression of refined and clean tastes and distinct yet delicate flavours, with plenty on the menu for those who don rsquo;t count calories as well. Like Malpua with Rabri.   What do you think of Sigree?

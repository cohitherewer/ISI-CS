The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Blast steels resolve: Jindal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Blast steels resolve: Jindal
                            
	Sajjan Jindal, the vice-chairman and managing director of JSW Steel, spoke to Sambit Saha of The Telegraph after the landmine blast.              
	I saw it happen in front of my eyes.         
	I left the venue soon after the media conference. Two Union ministers, Ram Vilas Paswan and Jitin Prasada, were with me. I was sitting in the front seat of the Toyota Innova. My brother Navin Jindal was behind me in another car.        
	After 2pm, there was a deafening noise and a flying stone hit our car. I realised it was an explosion and I saw that the pilot car, which was 30 feet ahead of me, was badly hit.         
	The driver of the pilot car was injured and blood was oozing out. But his condition didnt look serious to me then. As two central ministers were with me and worried whether it was an ambush, I told my driver to keep moving.        
	This incident has only strengthened my resolve to set up the plant and do it faster. I am not deterred by it at all. We just have to take extra precaution in the future.         
	Later, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee called me. He was very worried and asked me if everything was all right. I assured him that it was fine. In fact, I told him that he should take more care of himself.

	Ranchi, Nov. 7: Muster rolls meant to include beneficiaries of UPA governments showpiece job scheme for Jharkhands rural poor have revealed names of a serving army officer and a college teacher, confirming the widely held opinion about the states dismal record in implementing the National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme.        
	Jharkhand State National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) Watch, which is conducting a three-day convention here to evaluate the schemes implementation in the state, have also detected fake bank accounts and other dubious means used to defraud the states poorest of the poor.        
	While the muster roll in Dhanbad district includes the name of a serving army officer, a college teacher is included in Palamau district, revealed Balram, an NREGA activist involved in the review.         
	Several muster rolls of various districts have names of villagers who no longer live there, but show them has having worked and received wages, he said at the meet attended by the likes of economist Jean Dreze, Ritika Khera, Gurjit and others from Chhatisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Maharashtra. We have come across several serious malpractices in the implementation of NREGA in the state. Contractors and the government employees have turned the job scheme into a farce, Dreze lamented.        
	 The NREGA Watch has been formed by NGOs and social organisations to keep tabs on the implementation of the national job scheme in Jharkhand that has already seen the death of two job scheme activists Lalit Mehta (Palamau) and Kameshwar Yadav (Giridih) in May.         
	The government, Dreze said, may have allowed the opening of savings accounts in banks or post offices to minimise corruption, but these too have been milked dry by government employees to perpetuate corruption.        
	In these savings accounts, wages are deposited and withdrawn without the knowledge of the account holder. Such instances have been found in several districts, explained Balram. He claimed employees of post offices often made villagers sign to open savings accounts in their names but dont telling them about it.        
	The post master of Jonha village in Angada block in Ranchi district, Narayan Sahu, used to open savings accounts in villagers names without their knowledge. He would also operate them on his own. When it was unearthed, villagers lodged an FIR at the local police station. But, now the post master is absconding, said Balram.         
	The meet discussed reports presented by various groups that have conducted independent social audits into the implementation of NREGA across the state.        
	Led by Dreze, students of G.B. Pant Institute of Social Science, Allahabad had carried out a social audit of the scheme in Chhatarpur block of Palamau district. They found the muster roll of Cheeru village to include as many as 36 fake names. The NREGA Watch has also conducted social audits in Koderma, Chaibasa and Chatra and detected various loopholes.        
	NREGA Watch has even given suggestions to improve the situation, but the state government has done little. NREGA activists felt the government and bureaucracy had shut them off as adversaries.        
	We are thought of as the enemy of the government and the bureaucracy when we point out malpractices, Balram added.

	Cuttack, March 18: The past and present Ranji cricketers from Orissa, including those who have played first-class cricket matches, are in for a treat.         
	Some 109 state players will receive a monthly pension for life  starting from this month.         
	The Orissa Cricket Association will spend about Rs 31 lakh each year for the welfare of former and present Ranji cricketers, as well as first-class match players.

While those who have played between 16 and 26 matches, will get a monthly stipend of Rs 5,000, those who represented the state 5-15 times will receive Rs 3,000, said Asirvad Behera, the secretary of the state panel.         
	A monthly stipend of Rs 1,500 has been earmarked for those players who have played 1-4 matches, he added.         
	Of the 109 players, 16 fall in the Rs 5,000-category, 27 in the Rs 3,000 category and the rest in the Rs 1,500 category.         
	A state panel spokesperson clarified that the monthly pension would be provided to the players as long as they are alive.         
	However, after the demise of the players the benefits would not be extended to their nominees.

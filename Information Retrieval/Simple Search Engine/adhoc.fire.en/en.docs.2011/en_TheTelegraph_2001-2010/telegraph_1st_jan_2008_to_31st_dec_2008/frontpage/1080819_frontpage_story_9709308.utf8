	Beverly Hills, Aug. 18 (AP): Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi are married, according to reports. In the biggest celebrity union since California legalised same-sex marriage, DeGeneres, 50, and de Rossi, 35, wed on Saturday night in an intimate ceremony at their Beverly Hills home, People and Us Magazine reported.        
	A publicist for DeGeneres confirmed Peoples report and gave no further comment.        
	After the California supreme courts ruling in May, the talk-show host announced that she and de Rossi would wed after four years together.        
	The ceremony was attended by 19 guests, including DeGeneress mom, Betty, and de Rossis mother, Margaret Rogers, who had flown in from Australia, People.com reported on Saturday night.        
	DeGeneres said after winning her fourth consecutive Daytime Emmy for talk show host in June that a date had not been set, and that she would show a tiny bit of the nuptials on her show. While opponents in California have gathered signatures to put a measure on the November ballot for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, Hollywood was throwing its support behind the newlyweds.        
	One of my favourite people of all time is Ellen DeGeneres, Katherine Heigl, star of Greys Anatomy, told Associated Press Television News at a Hollywood charity event on Saturday night. So I wish all the best, all the happiness, all the joy that comes with that certificate ... just the joy of being able to stand up and say that. In front of everyone you love and care about in front of each other and to walk away legal is huge. Tila Tequila, whose dating reality show fame is built somewhat on her affinity for both men and women, passed along her good wishes.

          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 7: The government today summoned officials of two construction companies responsible for providing the infrastructure for the forthcoming Games in a bid to save face despite delays in the construction.        
	Senior officials of Nagarajuna Construction Company Limited, responsible for the construction of a major part of the Khelgaon and the main stadium, have informed state officials that they would be in the city by September 17 to discuss logistics with the government.         
	Though managing director of Calcutta-based Simplex Infrastructures Limited was scheduled to take part in a meeting to be held today, the official was detained in the Bengal capital due to a family emergency.        
	We are firm on our stand that we would be able to meet the December date for the Games.         
	We admit there are some construction delays, but that is because some of the equipment, such as a synthetic track, is hard to procure.        
	However, we would be able to get our equipment on or after September 17. Representatives of Simplex Infrastructures would also take part in the meet, said sports secretary R.S. Verma to The Telegraph.         
	While talking to reporters, Verma did not announce whether Games would be postponed to 2009, but HRD minister Bandhu Tirkey said there were chances of dates being re-scheduled.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Grenade attack on Raj Bhavan
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Imphal, Dec. 21: Militant played another catch-me-if-you-can game with the Manipur security apparatus this evening, lobbing two grenades at Raj Bhavan from a highway and managing to flee in a city guarded by 500 personnel round the clock.        
	Lobbed from National Highway 150 around 6pm, one of the grenades exploded 70 feet from the main entrance of the sprawling Raj Bhavan campus at Nitaipat and just 150 metres away from the governors official residence.         
	There were no casualties or injuries.         
	 Governor Gurbachan Jagat was not at his residence as he had left for New Delhi early this morning to attend a conference of the Governors Committee to be held tomorrow.         
	There is no major damage caused by the blast. Only a few branches of some trees fell under the impact, a Raj Bhavan source said.         
	We have recovered two pins of the grenades from the highway, which runs parallel to the Raj Bhavan boundary, suggesting that the grenades were lobbed from there, a police official said.         
	The Military Council of the Lanheiba group of the Kangleipak Communist Party claimed responsibility for the blast.         
	The outfits one-point agenda is to liberate Manipur from Indian rule.         
	The same group had triggered the October 21 blast in Ragailong village that killed 18 and wounded 40 others.         
	Though there had been two attacks at the residence of chief minister Ibobi Singh this year, this is the first time that any militant group had attacked Raj Bhavan, which is heavily guarded by the CRPF.         
	A police picket is also located close to the main gate along the national highway.         
	But neither the CRPF guards nor the personnel at the picket saw any suspicious movement around Raj Bhavan at the time of the blast.         
	A businessman, Ramu Singh, who resides on the third floor of a four-storey building just behind Raj Bhavan, said he had heard a huge sound.         
	The sound was so loud that initially I thought there was a blast in our building, he said.         
	Todays attack came despite the fact that the city crawls with security forces of various hues like the state police, CRPF, IRB and Assam Rifles.         
	At least 500 security personnel drawn for these forces are deployed to maintain vigil in the city on any given day.         
	The states security is looked after the Unified Command, a joint force of the army, the police and paramilitary forces, which is headed by the chief minister.         
	The posh Nitaipat area around the historical Kangla Fort in the heart of the city, otherwise is a very busy locality, was almost deserted at the time of the attack.         
	Senior police officials led by additional director-general of police Ramen Kumar Singh rushed to the spot.         
	Immediately after the blast, the police sealed all the exit and entry points to the capital city and launched a massive combing operation.         
	The source said tonights attack came in the wake of another militant group  the Kangleipak Communist Party (Military Council-Lalumba) group  agreeing to come for a negotiated settlement of their demands.         
	The groups leaders, incidentally, held talks with home department officials in Imphal yesterday.         
	Moreover, 19 outfits  under two umbrella organisations  have already entered into ceasefire agreements with security forces.         
	A source said todays attack was probably an indication that this outfit was also willing to hold talks.         
	An Assam Rifles official said that tonights grenade attack was very similar to the previous attacks in and around high-security zones.         
	They generally target areas which are close to a road from where they can lob a grenade or fire a bullet and flee. This does not mean any security failure, the official added.         
	He said grenades were available quite easily in the citys underground arms bazaar, each costing around Rs 5,000.         
	This year alone there were at least six grenade attacks targeting VIP areas.

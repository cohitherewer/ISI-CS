	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 23: Union home minister Shivraj Patil today rejected Orissas demand for declaring the prevailing flood as a national calamity, even as he announced a Rs 500-crore interim assistance.        
	Legally, the calamity is nothing like a national disaster, said Patil, while addressing a news conference at Bhubaneswar in the evening.        
	Recently, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urging him to declare the floods as a national calamity and release an interim assistance. He recalled that a debate had taken place after the 1999 Orissa Super Cyclone, when the then chief minister, Giridhar Gamang, had demanded a declaration of national disaster.        
	Even the Latur earthquake in Maharashtra had not been declared a national disaster, Patil said. However, he described the floods as a big one and admitted that the damage was tremendous.         
	If more funds are needed, the Centre will provide it as it is the responsibility of the Centre, he said, adding: However, the disaster should not be politically judged, which I think is being done.         
	He went on to request the media to not focus on internal bickering, but on the natural disaster.         
	The union home minister today undertook a review of the situation at the secretariat, after he and the chief minister made an aerial survey of the affected areas in Puri, Cuttack, Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur.        
	A memorandum was also presented by the government to the visiting minister seeking an additional assistance of Rs 2,454.30 crore. The government also demanded 2 lakh Indira Awas houses for the flood-affected families.        
	According to the latest figures, more than 37.5 lakh people living in 5,311 villages and 108 wards across 18 districts have been affected by the flood. Of them, more than 1.25 lakh in 827 villages still remain marooned.        
	The flood has claimed 35 human lives and 139 cattle, affected more than 9.81 lakh cattle and damaged more than 60,000 houses. Standing crop across 4.33 lakh hectares have been destroyed.        
	Swirling floodwater have inundated more areas downstream, even as water level in rivers showed a falling trend. Sixty-six gram panchayats under five blocks of Kendrapara have been hit the worst, with the flood affecting an estimated 22 lakh people.        
	Naval units from Vishakhapatnam and INS Chilka have joined the rescue operation in the worst-hit areas, while air-dropping of relief materials by IAF choppers is on.

  - Naxalites die in arms loot bid          OUR BUREAU                            Jharkhand director-general of police V.D. Ram inspects the Bansjora outpost. Picture by Uttam Kumar Pal                                        
	Ranchi/Bhubaneswar, Jan. 2: Around 12 policemen of the Bansjora picket in Simdega district of Jharkhand fought bravely for about three hours till dawn, forcing around 150 armed Maoists to retreat into the forests after they raided the outpost  barely a kilometre from the Orissa border  to loot arms.         
	While one police constable was killed and seven policemen were injured, officials believe at least six or seven rebels died too.         
	Around 150 armed Maoists seem to come in from nowhere and opened fire at the outpost around midnight last night, said Sergeant Major T.K. Jha. It happened all of a sudden. They hurled petrol bombs and started firing indiscriminately.         
	Caught unawares, constable Sumit Kumar Sahi, who had stepped out, was gunned down within seconds. He succumbed to his injuries on the way to hospital.         
	Soon, the policemen  of the 22 posted there, around 12 were present at the time  retaliated and the gunfight lasted till 4am.        
	According to Rourkela SP Ravikant, a combing operation is on and a red alert has been sounded in Sundergarh district of Orissa.         
	Jharkhand DGP Vishnu Dayal Ram also reached the spot to find out the sequence of events first-hand.        
	So far, three landmines, 500 empty cartridges and 40 petrol bombs have been seized.        
	Senior officials at the Jharkhand police headquarters in Ranchi are full of praise for the jawans of the Bansjora check post  its along the highway linking Simdega and Rourkela  for the exemplary courage shown by the 12 policemen who forced the rebels to retreat.         
	Ram announced after returning to Ranchi that all those who were on duty at Bansjora during the raid would be promoted.         
	We have extended all co-operation to the Jharkhand police. The injured are being taken care of at the Ispat General Hospital, Rourkela, said Ravikant.         
	Jawans of our Special Operations Group and the armoury have been alerted.         
	The Maoists motive, said Ravikant, was to loot arms. The check post had a good collection  including 24 SLRs, besides rifles and 303s. And the operation, as is now the norm, was well-planned with Maoists felling trees at Keria Ghati and planting landmines on the way to block police reinforcements from reaching the outpost.        
	Of the seven injured policemen  an ASI and six constables  four are critical. Constable Shailendra Pal, who has bullet wounds in his waist and severe injuries in his arm, has been brought to Ranchi from Rourkela in a chopper. He is serious and has been admitted to Apollo Hospital.         
	Sub-inspector Amarnath, constable Ibrar Ahamed and other jawans are still undergoing treatment at IGH, Rourkela. They are all stable.         
	There were bloodstains in the area where the Maoists took positions, indicating that there may have been casualties on the Maoist side, too, said Simdega SP Deo Bihari Sharma who visited the injured policemen at the hospital. Six to seven Maoists are believed to have been killed in the gunbattle and their bodies have been taken away by the rebels.        
	In fact, when Sharma rushed to the check post with reinforcements, a separate group of Maoists triggered a blast at Keria Ghati, about 30km from his official residence. There was an exchange of fire for over 40 minutes after which the SP and his team could proceed. They had also cut down trees near Keria Ghati to restrict our movement, added Sharma.        
	Before retreating, the rebels attacked a Ranchi-bound bus from Biramitrapur at a railway level-crossing near the Bansjora police check post, injuring a passenger. Earlier, the rebels tried to attack the Biramitrapur police station. However, alert police-men foiled the attempt.        
	Chief minister Madhu Koda has directed DGP Ram to directly supervise operations in the area.

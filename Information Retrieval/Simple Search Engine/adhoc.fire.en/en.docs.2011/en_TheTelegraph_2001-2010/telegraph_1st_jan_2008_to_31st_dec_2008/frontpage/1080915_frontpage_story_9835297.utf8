	Ranchi, Sept. 14: Chief minister Shibu Soren is in fresh trouble.         
	A special CBI court in New Delhi has summoned him along with Suraj Mandal and Simon Marandi on September 19 in connection with a bribery case. The notice came after the CBI sought permission to file a supplementary chargesheet 13 years after the bribery case first hit the headlines. Marandi, Mandal and Soren are expected to abide by the court directive.         
	We have to appear before the court, said Mandal, who broke away from the JMM to launch Jharkhand Vikas Dal later. He is not entirely convinced by the order, though. The CBI move is not legally tenable, he said.         
	Sorens counsels in Delhi also said that the CBI move would not survive the touchstone of legality. Requesting anonymity, they said only a court could lodge a complaint against the accused for fabricating evidence under Section 195 of the CrPC. The CBI has no jurisdiction to do so, one of them pointed out.        
	Also, the CBI is raking up the case after 10 years, which the court may condone as inordinate delay, he added.        
	In 1996, the CBI had registered two FIRs, the first involving four JMM MPs  Shibu Soren, Simon Marandi, Suraj Mandal and Shailendra Mahato. They were charged with receiving bribe amounting to Rs 3.5 crore to vote in favour of a trust motion tabled by the then P.V. Narsimha Rao government in 1993.         
	The CBI had filed chargesheets against Soren, Mandal and Marandi, while Mahto had turned approver. However, the Supreme Court ruled later that the four MPs were not liable for statements made or vote submitted in the Parliament.        
	The second FIR was connected with the recovery of Rs 3.5 crore from the accounts of the four accused. The trio had then claimed that the money was a part of donations that the JMM collected and were for the betterment of the party.         
	Following the statement, CBI investigation found that the receipts of funds produced in defence of the argument were printed in 1995, while the funds were deposited in the banks in 1993. The four were then charged with fabricating evidence.        
	Besides the bribery case, Soren is in few legal tangles at present. The Supreme Court has fixed November 4 as the date for the hearing of an appeal filed by the kin of Shashinath Jha challenging the acquittal of Soren and three others in the Jha murder case.        
	He, however, appears to be on solid ground in the Kudko (Giridih) murder case lodged on April 13, 1974.         
	The cases prime witnesses and informant have turned hostile, weakening the investigating officers statement.

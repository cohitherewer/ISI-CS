                                Varsha Sabhnani                            
	Central Islip (New York), June 27 (AP): A millionaire of Indian origin who inflicted years of abuse on two Indonesian housekeepers held as virtual slaves in her Long Island mansion was sentenced yesterday to 11 years in prison.        
	Varsha Sabhnani, 46, was convicted with her husband in December on a 12-count federal indictment that included forced labour, conspiracy, involuntary servitude and harbouring aliens.        
	The trial provided a glimpse into the growing US problem of domestic workers exploited in slave-like conditions.        
	The victims testified that they were beaten with brooms and umbrellas, slashed with knives, and forced to climb stairs and take freezing showers as punishment. One victim was forced to eat dozens of chilli peppers and then was forced to eat her own vomit when she couldnt keep the peppers down, prosecutors said.        
	US district judge Arthur Spatt called the testimony eye-opening, to say the least that things like that go on in our country.        
	In her arrogance, she treated Samirah and Enung as less than people, assistant US attorney Demetri Jones said. Justice for the victims, thats what the government is asking for.        
	Federal sentencing guidelines had recommended a range of 12 to 15 years in prison for Varsha, who was identified as the one who inflicted the abuse. In addition to prison, she will serve three years of probation and was fined $25,000.        
	I just want to say that I love my children very much, the defendant told the court as two of her grown children looked on. I was brought to this Earth to help people who are in need.        
	Mahender Sabhnani, 51, who is free on bail while awaiting his own Friday sentencing, wept as he watched his wifes punishment pronounced.        
	He was charged with the same crimes because he allowed the conduct to take place and benefited from the work the women performed in his home, prosecutors said. He is expected to receive a much shorter prison term.        
	Prosecutors contended that the accusations amounted to a modern-day slavery case. They said the maids were subjected to punishment that escalated into a cruel form of torture, which ended in May 2007, when one of the women fled early on Mothers Day. She wandered into a Dunkin Donuts wearing nothing but rags, and employees called police.        
	This did not happen in the 1800s, assistant US attorney Mark Lesko said during the trial. This happened in the 21st century. This happened in Muttontown, New York.

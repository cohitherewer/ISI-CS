	Perth, Jan. 17: Sachin Master Tendulkar didnt mind being reduced to a foot soldier. In fact, the Rahul Dravids and the Mahendra Singh Dhonis were in the same boat, too.
    
	All were waiting for the general  Anil Kumble  to arrive and formed groups on the Hyatt Regencys third-floor balcony, which overlooked the reception and lounge.
    
	Most of the players are on that floor as is the team room.
    
	Kaptan kahan reh gaya? Celebrations ka delay ho raha hai, said one of the foot soldiers as a national selector, Ranjib Biswal, came down from his ninth-floor room.
    
	Virender Sehwag, who has come to play a crucial role on his comeback, was heard telling a well-wisher: Theek hai, kal century ho gi, but right now, Im looking at an early dinner and then quickly going off to sleep.
    
	The general, whod been delayed at the Waca because of interviews to TV channels, arrived around 8.45pm.
    
	Instead of a gun salute, though, it was probably Irfan Pathan who greeted him with a cat call. Somebody else cheered, with everybody making a dash for the team room.
    
	As his teammates had been waiting, Kumble went straight to the team room where champagne was on ice to mark his joining the 600 club.
    
	Actually, even if Kumble hadnt reached the milestone on Day II of the third Test, the medium-pacers had done enough for the bubbly to be uncorked. 
    
	The Australians, after all, were bowled out for 212. And, believe it or not, in a mere 50 overs on a wicket more suited to their style of aggressive cricket.
    
	Ahead by 118 on the first innings, the Indians extended their lead to 170 (with nine wickets intact) by stumps. With three days remaining, its an excellent opportunity on a surface which was expected to be daunting.
    
	The Australians have already taken an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the four-Test series, but theres much to play for. Not least, clearly, being pride. 
    
	Swing played a significant role in Indias series win in England last summer and, well, it had a huge role today, too. That Dhoni collected a record-setting fiver only helped.
    
	Pathan was the pick, but its not that Rudra Pratap Singh and teenaged Ishant Sharma didnt make an impact. 
    
	Collectively, the trio were awesome  despite searing heat  and with Matthew Hayden not there, the Australians didnt know what hit them.
    
	While Phil Jaques and Mike Hussey were beaten by the swing, Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist got done in by the bounce.
    
	Andrew Symonds (Kumbles 600th victim) top-scored with 66, but shouldve been out to Pathan when on three. The fielder found wanting was Sachin in the slips.
    
	Ifs and buts dont count for much but had Sachin taken Symonds, then its quite likely Kumble wouldve had the option of making Australia follow on.
    
	In any case, at one stage, the Australians were five down for 61.
    
	Oh, our bowlers were superb. They swung the ball beautifully and managed that wicket-taking bounce as well.... Watching them bowl was such a delight and I was particularly impressed with Pathan, former India captain and cricket manager Ravi Shastri told The Telegraph.
    
	Pleased as punch, he added: Our bowlers proved that you dont need express pace to bowl out the opposition... swing and discipline is enough.
    
	The attack was, of course, led by 22-year-old Rudra Pratap and he came in for much praise from Kumble.
    
	For his part, Rudra Pratap said: Its such a nice feeling when the captain has so much faith. Hes my coach... I found my rhythm quickly and, so, could work up a good pace.
    
	Australias vice-captain Gilchrist didnt quite agree his team was on the mat. Theres lots of cricket left and weve first got to stay in the match.... Yes, the Indians utilised the conditions (Fremantle Doc included) very well.... They bowled in the right areas and dominated us.
    
	Thats the bottom line.

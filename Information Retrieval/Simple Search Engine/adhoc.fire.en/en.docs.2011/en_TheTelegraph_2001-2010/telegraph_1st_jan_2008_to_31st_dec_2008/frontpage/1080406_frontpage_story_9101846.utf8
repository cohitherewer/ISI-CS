                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mother in denial, child in hope
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                              Marjina Bibi with son Zahir (top) and Sunita Mirdha on opposite beds in Apex Nursing Home. Pictures by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya      
	Marjina Bibi lies in bed 407, son Zahir by her side. She anxiously asks how her daughters Hena and Neha are.        
	Sunita Mirdha is sitting up in bed 406, opposite Marjinas, with an aunt by her side. She wants to know where her mother Sandhya is.              
	Marjina, 25, is in denial. Sunita, 5, has not been told.        
	The two are bound by a twist of fate in the tragedy on 217B. Yesterday afternoon, as the bus was sinking in Lower Bagjola Canal, Marjina had clutched little Sunitas hand, thinking she had a grip on her daughter Neha, 8.        
	Both were rescued, but Neha and her nine-month-old sister Hena could not be saved. Neither could Sunitas mother Sandhya.        
	Till late last night, a young womans body lay unidentified at Uma Medical Research Centre in VIP Road. Early this morning, she was identified as Sandhya Mirdha, 25.        
	In the female ward of Apex Nursing Home, not far from Uma Medical Research, Sunita softly said: Aami ma-er kachhe jabo (I want to go to my mother). Im feeling better but I havent met my mother yet. My father told me to rest in the hospital while he went to look for her.        
	Sunitas father Gopal had come to know about the tragedy when he saw TV pictures of his youngest daughter in hospital.        
	Canal water was sucked out of Sunitas lungs, and she is running a temperature. She has suffered a psychological setback. She has been weeping since last night and has vomited three times since morning. Its better that we do not tell her about her mother just yet, said S. Chakraborty, a paediatric surgeon at Apex.        
	A few feet away, Marjina, who was told yesterday she had not been able to save Neha, kept asking about both her daughters.        
	I must have performed a good deed by saving another child (Sunita) and so Allah has saved my daughters, she said, speaking in a mumble. They are in another nursing home.        
	Fareha Bibi, a relative, said Marjina was in trauma and was refusing to accept the tragedy.        
	Yesterday, soon after we told her she had not been able to save her daughters, she became hysterical. Since then, we have been telling her that Neha and Hena are undergoing treatment somewhere else. Doctors have said her physical condition is stable after a blow on the head, but she has broken down mentally.        
	Little Zahir, 2, was shifted from the critical care unit to his mothers bed early today. The baby, who has a temperature and minor leg injuries, kept his mother busy.        
	At the Mondol home in Atghara, not far from the airport, Marjinas husband Habibul mourned over the bodies of his mother Asma Bibi and daughters Neha and Hena, handed over after the post-mortem.                    
	My father, mother, wife and children had left home to keep a doctors appointment. Who would have known such a tragedy was awaiting them? the day labourer said.              
	A 10-minute drive away, grief shrouded the Mirdha home at Sarojpalli. I have lost my daughter. I dont know how my son-in-law will take care of these three children, said Biswadeb Biswas, Sandhyas father.        
	His grandchildren Champa, 10, and Sadaram, 8, know that their mother will never come back. Their sister Sunita is still waiting for her in hospital.

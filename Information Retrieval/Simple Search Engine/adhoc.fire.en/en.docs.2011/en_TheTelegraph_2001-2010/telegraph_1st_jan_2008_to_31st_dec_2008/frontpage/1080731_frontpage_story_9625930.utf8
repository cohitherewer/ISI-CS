	New Delhi, July 30: A 2,100-year-old machine built by ancient Greeks to predict eclipses was also a calendar marking the four-year cycles of the ancient Olympics, according to scientists who have deciphered its inscriptions.         
	A new study of the astronomical calculator by a team of international researchers has revealed a stunning level of sophistication and multiple roles  an eclipse predictor, a calendar and a marker for the Games.         
	The bronze instrument called the Antikythera Mechanism had been discovered in 1902 by divers exploring the submerged remains of an ancient Roman ship wrecked off the coast of Greece.         
	In recent years, scientists have dubbed it an ancient technological wonder  a machine with gears and dials, a calculator from around 150 BC that tracked celestial objects and predicted eclipses.         
	Now, researchers from Greece and the UK have used modern 3D X-ray techniques to decode inscriptions on the machine and show that it was also connected to the social and cultural life of ancient Greece.         
	It was a complete surprise, said Tony Freeth, a mathematician and filmmaker who was part of the team studying the machine. What was believed to be a purely scientific instrument also had cultural links.         
	The corroded fragments of the Antikythera Mechanism have been on display at the National Archaeological Museum, Athens. The results of the new study will appear in the journal Nature on Thursday.         
	The new clues were words  including Olympia  inscribed on the machine, and related to the ancient Olympiad cycle. One dial on the machine turns at the rate of a quarter turn per year. A full turn marks four years.         
	We hadnt expected to find the references to the Games, Freeth told The Telegraph .         
	Researchers say they are surprised by the machines complexity. It is the oldest known sophisticated gear-based calculating machine, said Yanis Bitsakis, a team member from the Centre for History and Palaeography, Athens.         
	The team has also deciphered the months on a 19-year calendar on the back of the machine which suggests that  contrary to earlier assumptions  the machine might have originated in Syracuse in Sicily, the place where Archimedes died in 212 BC.         
	Its been believed that Archimedes built astronomical devices, but there has been no evidence so far, Bitsakis said over telephone. Researchers say the Antikythera Mechanism itself was probably built decades after Archimedes death.         
	This machine is too complex to be the first (of a series). But it is possible it represents a tradition of instrument-making that was initiated by Archimedes but continued after his death, Bitsakis said.         
	The links to the ancient Games come from Olympia, Nemea, Isthmia and Pythia, inscribed near a subsidiary dial on the machine. These words correspond to various sites of Games that were part of the ancient Olympiad cycle, Freeth said.         
	It is more complex than any other known device for the next 1,000 years, said Mike Edmunds, an astronomer at Cardiff University in the UK, who has been involved in the project to unravel the mystery of the Antikythera Mechanism.

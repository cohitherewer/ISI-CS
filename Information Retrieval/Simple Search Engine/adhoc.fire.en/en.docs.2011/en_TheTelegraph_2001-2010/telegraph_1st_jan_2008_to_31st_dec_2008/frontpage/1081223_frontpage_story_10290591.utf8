  - Speaker diverts lakhs from Assembly funds to buy legislators ovens          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                                     
	Ranchi, Dec. 22: Guess whats cooking in the Assembly these days? Ummerperhaps some tandoori ideas.         
	The buzz over legislators being gifted high-end mobile phones had barely died down when Speaker Alamgir Alam triggered a micro wave of dissension trying to curry favour with MLAs. Alam, it seems, believes that legislators will not raise the decibel in the House if their spouses are happy at home. And this prompted him to gift MLAs microwave ovens after the Assembly was adjourned sine die yesterday.         
	Some 90 microwave ovens  each costing Rs 6,500  had been purchased by the House secretariat by diverting funds meant for celebrating the Assembly Foundation Day on November 22. Interestingly, the ovens were secretly delivered to MLA homes, understandably to avoid a public outcry. The government, it is believed, has had to shell out a total of Rs 5.85 lakh for the purpose.        
	A senior Assembly official, requesting anonymity, said: Under the rules, unspent funds are surrendered to the state government at the end of each financial year. It can be diverted only if the finance department gives permission. If at all the Speaker wanted to buy gifts, he could have only done so from the miscellaneous funds.         
	The officials pointed out that Assembly funds are normally used to brush up the legislative skills of an MLA. A microwave oven, I believe, is in no way related to enlightening MLAs about legislative business, he said.        
	Talking to The Telegraph, the Speaker claimed that he had done nothing new. It had been a set practice since the Bihar days, he said. He said his predecessor, Inder Singh Namdhari, was also known to divert funds.        
	CPI(ML) MLA Vinod Singh and BJPs Sarayu Roy have not accepted the gift. It is tantamount to bribing legislators, Singh said. Other MLAs are, however, not complaining.        
	Expensive gifts have become a norm in Jharkhands political circles. In April this year, the finance department had kicked up a storm by gifting mobile phones worth Rs 13.39 lakh to MLAs.

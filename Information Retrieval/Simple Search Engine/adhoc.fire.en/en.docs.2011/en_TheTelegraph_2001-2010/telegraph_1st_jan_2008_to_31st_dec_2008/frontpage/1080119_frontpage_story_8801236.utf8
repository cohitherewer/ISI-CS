	Kochi, Jan. 18: The worlds premier offshore yachting event, Volvo Ocean Race, nicknamed the Everest of Sailing, will drop anchor at Kochi this December, the first time an Indian city has been picked as a stopover for the event.
    
	The decision to put the booming shipping port on the Malabar coast on the route of the nine-month-long 39,325-nautical-mile odyssey was finalised today in an agreement signed by race director Andy Hindley, Kochi Port Trust chairman N. Ramachandran and Kerala Tourism Development Corporation managing director K.G. Mohanlal. State home and tourism minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan was present.
    
	Setting off from Spains Alicante on October 4, the seven-yacht race will conclude at St Petersburg, Russia, in July 2009. The sailors will navigate through Cape Town, Kochi, Singapore, Shanghai and then go on to South America and the US.
    
	The race is one of the worlds most demanding and daring team sporting events, with its crests and troughs of human endurance. Formerly called the Whitbread Round the World Race, the 35-year-old contest is held every four years. However, this time it is being organised after three years. The event is named after its sponsor, Volvo.
    
	Volvo Ocean Race CEO Glenn Bourke said: India not only presents huge opportunities for the development of the event but this (the stopover), coupled with the daunting challenges the competitors will face when racing their Grand Prix yachts in unfamiliar waters, will make the visit to India even more exciting.
    
	This years edition will feature 11 ocean legs, seven inshore races and shorter stopovers on a route that touches the hitherto uncharted territories of Asia. The yachts will arrive at Kochi on December 3 and stay for 10 days, before sailing off on the next leg to Sentosa Island in Singapore. 
    
	A race village, spread over 2.5 acres, will be set up on Kochis Willingdon Island. The spin-off will be Kochi rising up the international chart as the hub of leisure sailing and cruising.
    
	The overall budget to host the event is Rs 150 million (Rs 15 crore). Port chairman Ramachandran reckoned that 5,000 hotel rooms would be required to host the travellers. The race managers have waived the 10-million-euro licence fee for India as it is hosting the event for the first time. 
    
	India emerged on the new route as the organisers wanted to move the race away from its traditional circuit  South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and then Brazil. Kochi beat Mumbai, Chennai and Goa to host the stopover.
    
	Kerala tourism secretary V. Venu said: This is a great moment for Kerala and marks the end of a year-long journey of dreams and plans, discussions and debates. Proximity to the international shipping route has already made Kochi a preferred destination for yachts and cruise ships travelling to Southeast Asia and Australia.

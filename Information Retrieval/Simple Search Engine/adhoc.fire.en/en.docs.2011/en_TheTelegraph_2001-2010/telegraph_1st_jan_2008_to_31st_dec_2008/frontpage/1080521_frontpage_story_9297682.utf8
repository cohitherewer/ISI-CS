          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 20: The World Bank, which has been supporting fiscal reforms in Orissa since 2001, today confirmed that the most fiscally-stressed state in India in the mid-nineties has made the strongest turnaround.        
	Over the past seven years, Orissas primary fiscal balance has been converted from a deficit of 5.9 per cent of gross state domestic product to a surplus of 2.8 per cent. That is a fiscal correction by 8.7 per cent points, said V.J. Ravishankar, a leading economist of the World Bank and the expert who conducted a study for the bank on Orissas turnaround.         
	The study, Orissa in transition: from fiscal turnaround to rapid and inclusive growth, was released here today.        
	Orissas economic growth has been faster than the Indian average in majority of sectors during 2003-06, he added.        
	While the industry (mining, manufacturing, electricity and construction) led the recent growth acceleration in Orissa by achieving an annual growth of around 20 per cent, the service sector grew at a rate of nearly 10 per cent. Even agriculture, which was beset by the recent drought, has now recovered and is growing at an average rate of 2 per cent, the expert confirmed.         
	Releasing the findings, Ravishankar said the poverty headcount has declined significantly during 2000-05 by more than 8 per cent in rural areas and 2.5 per cent points in urban Orissa. The national average is of 5 and 2 per cent, respectively.        
	What is heartening about Orissas transition is that the growth has been rapid in the southern region, the poorest part of India, observed the studys principal author. Rural families in the southern region are now spending up to 25 per cent more on basic necessities like food, clothing and schooling, compared to previous five years.         
	The expert believes that the turnaround could be an important lesson for the rest of India.        
	A fiscal correction programme based on a consultative approach has helped bring about the turn around, he said, adding that government resolve to accelerate completion of projects, coupled with policy reforms at a national-level were some of the contributing factors. The fiscal correction programme is a part of World Bank supported fiscal reform process in Orissa.        
	Despite the phenomenal fiscal turnaround and growth, Orissa faces challenges with over 45 per cent of the states population still living in poverty, the study pointed out.

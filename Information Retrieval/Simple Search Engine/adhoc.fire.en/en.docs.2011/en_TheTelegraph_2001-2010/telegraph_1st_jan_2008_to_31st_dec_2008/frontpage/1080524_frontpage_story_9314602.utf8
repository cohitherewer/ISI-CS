          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 23: If voting patterns in the Lok Sabha polls due in a year follow the panchayat trend, the Left would lose around 10 seats, snipping its tally to 25, below the score in 1984 that remains the lowest point in the past 30 years.        
	After a preliminary study of the panchayat results, where the gap at the lowest level of the three-tier system has narrowed dramatically from over 1500 to just above 200, the CPM fears the Left will lose eight to 10 seats. Trinamul believes the Opposition can wrest 11.        
	An MP and a central committee member of the CPM said: Looking at the panchayat results, there could be a possibility of losing between eight and 10 parliamentary seats. But a detailed study has to be made.        
	At the gram panchayat  the lowest level, the CPMs tally stands at 1,562 panchayats and the Oppositions at 1,340, according to figures collected individually from district magistrates today.         
	The numbers mentioned in yesterdays edition were given to the media by CPM state secretary Biman Bose. There are differences between the two sets of figures but they do not change the fundamental lesson emerging from the results: that the Left has taken a hard knock.         
	The CPM has estimated the possible loss of Lok Sabha seats from Trinamuls massive victories in East Midnapore and South 24 Parganas and what it calls an inexplicable rise in the number of panchayat samiti seats won by that party in North 24 Parganas, Nadia and Howrah  all in south Bengal.        
	Hannan Mollah, an MP of the CPM, admitted that the party could lose some Lok Sabha seats but there wont be any sea change as the Trinamul Congress thinks. Moreover, panchayat polls should not be compared with parliamentary elections.        
	It may be true that voters considerations in a parliamentary poll are different but Trinamul is claiming a major swing against the CPM. Partha Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, said: We (Trinamul) have won several panchayat samiti and gram panchayat seats in areas where our party had not been able to penetrate for years. We think that at least 11 Lok Sabha seats can be wrested from the Left.        
	Poll researcher Dwaipayan Bhattacharyya agreed that voters do not treat Assembly or Lok Sabha polls the way they do local bodies elections. The vote shares have to be seen to find out whether there would be any change in the ruling partys strength.         
	The CPM has based its extrapolation of the panchayat results to the Lok Sabha by calculating the vote shares of the Left and the Opposition in every polling booth where Trinamul has fared well or put up a respectable performance, said a party leader.        
	Having worked out the percentage shares of the Left and the Opposition, the CPM has allotted the votes according to Lok Sabha constituencies to see the impact.        
	CPM state committee member Rabin Deb said the party conducted a booth-wise survey of votes secured by the Left and the Opposition after every election.         
	A preliminary study of the districts where the Opposition met with success can be an indication of future trends. But Lok Sabha polls are a long way off and it would be premature to comment on our partys prospects.        
	The Lok Sabha constituencies that Trinamul is eyeing, encouraged by the panchayat results, are Barasat, Basirhat, Contai, Tamluk, Diamond Harbour, Mathurapur, Jadavpur, Joynagar, Krishnagar, Uluberia and Nabadwip.         
	A CPM central committee member admitted that these constituencies could pose problems for the Left but expected the situation to change as our party knows the art of damage control.

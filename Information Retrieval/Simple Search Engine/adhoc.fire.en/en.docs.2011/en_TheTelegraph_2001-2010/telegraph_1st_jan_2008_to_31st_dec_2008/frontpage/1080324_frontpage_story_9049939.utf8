	The federation declared that instructions have been passed on to all the affiliated unions to go all out till the demands of the agitating employees were met and the state government agreed to bear all expenses relating to the education of the wards Pandey and adequate compensation was paid to his kin.        
	Grade IV employees will continue to sit on dharna in front of Nepal House and Project Bhavan. They would stay away from work till their demands were met. Grade IV staff, who are on strike since March 7, will continue with the agitation till the state government pays cash compensation of Rs 50 lakh to the next of kin of the deceased, a terse statement issued by the co-ordination committee stated.        
	Members of all unions also decided to launch satyagraha in front of the Raj Bhavan on March 27.

	We have demanded a cash compensation of Rs 50 lakh to Pandeys family.

	June 23: A state government must call in the paramilitary to ensure normality during shutdowns called by parties, Kerala High Court reminded the executive today. The observation is unlikely to be heeded but may resonate with parts of Bengal and Sikkim that are facing the fallout of an indefinite strike.        
	Responding to a contempt petition, the Kerala court said the government  headed by the CPM as in Bengal  was bound by an order of 2004 that said the state has to call in paramilitary forces to ensure normal life and free movement.         
	The petition contended that the state government refused to comply with the court directive. When the advocate-general said the government had used all the force at its command, the judges pointed out that 32 hartals had taken place in the state since the 2004 order.        
	The southern reminder came at a time the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has suspended its indefinite strike in the hills till Wednesday morning. A victim of the strike has been Sikkim as its lifeline  National Highway 31A  was blocked.         
	The Union home and defence secretaries are expected to hold talks tomorrow with officials of Bengal and Sikkim on the status of the highway. Alleged Chinese incursions into Sikkim could also be discussed.

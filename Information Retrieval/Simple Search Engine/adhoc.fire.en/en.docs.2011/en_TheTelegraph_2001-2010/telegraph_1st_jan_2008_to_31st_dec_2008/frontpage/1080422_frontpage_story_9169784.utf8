                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Liz doesnt mind being airbrushed 
          SOPHIE BORLAND                            Vanity risk                                  
	London, April 21: Liz Hurley has risked the ire of childrens health campaigners by admitting she likes having her body airbrushed in photographs.         
	Hurley, 42, who two years ago vowed never to be seen in a bikini, conceded she didnt mind being made to look a bit thinner and a bit younger as she modelled her new swimwear range.         
	Launching her new Elizabeth Hurley Beach line, the model and businesswoman said: I like a certain amount of retouching, like anybody.         
	We all like to get rid of spots and shadows under our eyes. Ive always been quite particular  I dont like my face to be retouched. Often, people will want to correct ones face, and with me, they always want to change my nose and Im like: No, no, no, I cant look like that. I dont mind if you want to make me a bit thinner and a bit younger, but you cant give me a different jaw or eyebrows. But the vanity retouching  well, who wouldnt?         
	Her comments come as British magazine editors are considering a ban on the use of digitally-enhanced pictures over fears that they are promoting unrealistic body images.        
	In an interview with the Sunday Times, she said: I dont have professional Photoshop, just the one that comes with your camera. Every time I download my holiday snaps, I always go over them. Just the red eye and colour enhancement. I dont do any slimming, because you need a silly programme, but the colour enhancing is heaven.

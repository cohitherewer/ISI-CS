          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Nagaon, April 10: Militants suspected to be from an anti-talks faction of a Karbi outfit today triggered a cycle bomb in a weekly market in the heart of Karbi Anglongs Howraghat town to make their presence felt on the day peace talks between the Centre and their rival, the UPDS, were supposed to resume.         
	The blast comes a day after nearly 15,000 people marched through Diphu town in support of the talks with the United Peoples Democratic Solidarity and demanded an end to the ethnic bloodbath.         
	The explosion, which left 29 injured, one of them critically, occurred when hills areas development minister Khorsingh Engti, Lok Sabha MP Birensingh Engti and Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council chief executive member Mangalsingh Engti were attending a mandal Congress meeting at the PWD inspection bungalow about a kilometre away.         
	Police suspect the blast was carried out by the Karbi Longri North Cachar Liberation Front, a group that was born out of the UPDS and has yet to get into any ceasefire. They said the cycle bomb technique smacked of Ulfa help as the two outfits work in tandem.         
	Karbi Anglongs additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Nityananda Goswami said the bomb was strapped to a bicycle which was parked at the Howraghat weekly market on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road. We are not yet sure whether it was a time device or a remote-controlled bomb, Goswami said.         
	The bomb went off near the vegetable stalls, which were more crowded than the rest of the market. I was bargaining for some vegetables when there was a huge sound... I dont remember anything after that. When I woke up I found myself here, said Jaluar Basumatary, one of the injured, at the hospital.         
	All the 15 seriously wounded have been shifted to Nagaon Civil Hospital. Only Ranjan Das, who required surgery for the splinter wounds in his head, was taken to Gauhati Medical College Hospital.         
	Bhupen Bora, a senior doctor at the hospital, said Dass condition was critical. The others are out of danger though their wounds were quite deep, he said.         
	Talking from Delhi, UPDS publicity secretary Tong Eh Nongloda said todays scheduled talks have been postponed till 4.30pm tomorrow as representatives from Dispur did not turn up.         
	The Karbi Longri and the UPDS have been locked in a fratricidal war ever since the pro-talks group entered into a ceasefire. The UPDS split in 2001, when its pro-talks faction signed a truce with Delhi. In March 2004, the two factions signed an internal ceasefire agreement, but it lasted only three months as the breakaway faction launched an offensive against the other.        
	 Todays blast may be its (KLNLFs) way of telling the government that it also exists and can cause damage, a district police official said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   First Sons Florida flight 
  Detour from Presidents route to conduct personal business           K.P. NAYAR                                                    
	Washington, April 30: President Pratibha Patils son used his taxpayer-funded trip on his mothers entourage to Latin America to conduct personal business in the US when he peeled off from the presidential delegation in Mexico City to travel to Florida on a detour from the official itinerary.        
	Rashtrapati Bhavan yesterday defended Rajendra Singh Shekhawats behaviour on the ground that since he was in Mexico City, he took the opportunity to visit a university in Florida for academic purpose.        
	In Boca Raton, Florida, Kristine McGrath, press secretary at the Florida Atlantic University  whose officials Shekhawat is supposed to have met during his detour  told The Telegraph that my office has not been made aware of this visit.        
	Rashtrapati Bhavan asked the Indian embassy in Washington to send an official to Miami to look after Shekhawat even though he was not there for any official duties.        
	The embassy flew its head of chancery to Florida and put the official up in Miami at public expense to look after the Presidents son during his brief foray into the US.        
	In 1983, long before Patil became President, she founded the Shram Sadhana Bombay Trust, which runs several educational institutions in Maharashtra.        
	The trust is now headed by the Presidents husband, Devisingh Ramsingh Shekhawat. Their son, who went to Florida to negotiate with Florida Atlantic University last fortnight, is listed on the organisations website as a member of the managing committee for its colleges.        
	Sources familiar with the sons recent activities in Florida said the countrys First Family plans to set up new educational institutions and expand their existing ones.        
	Following a recent trend in many educational institutions in India, the Presidents family is now hoping to tie up with Florida Atlantic University.        
	This US university was founded in 1964 in Boca Raton on an 850-acre site located near the Atlantic Ocean.        
	McGrath said the university now has 26,000 students on its rolls.        
	Archana Datta, the Rashtrapati Bhavans spokesperson, said of Shekhawats 36-hour disappearance from the presidential entourage: There was a long-pending invitation (for him) from the University of Florida Atlantic for academic purpose. Since Shri Shekhawat was in Mexico, he took the opportunity to visit the university.        
	Shekhawat rejoined the presidential entourage just before it was leaving Mexico City for Guadalajara and remained its member until it returned to India.        
	As a result of Shekhawats departure to Florida while his mother was on a state visit to Mexico, he was a conspicuous absentee at an elaborate official banquet at President Felipe Calderons castle in Mexico Citys Chapultepec area on the night of April 17.        
	He was listed on the guest list for the banquet and ranked third after Patil and her husband in the order of protocol on the Indian side.        
	Shekhawats absence was a source of embarrassment to both the Indians and the Mexicans. His actions on the presidential entourage were puzzling at best, improper at worst.        
	If he had, indeed, an invitation from the Florida Atlantic University, Shekhawat could have taken any commercial flight from Delhi to Miami in these days of regular travel between India and the US instead of joining his mothers entourage at state expense.        
	Taxpayers paid for Shekhawats accommodation and other expenses during the Presidents stay in Lisbon, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Santiago and Cape Town last fortnight.        
	His travel was on a chartered Air India plane. There is no provision for individual payments on a chartered Air India plane even if one passenger wanted to do so. Shekhawat paid only for his detour from Mexico City to Miami.        
	US officials would not comment on record about the VIP visitor they briefly had on their soil.        
	But veterans of protocol said they would deem it extremely inappropriate if a member of a presidential party travelling on taxpayer money on a state visit left the delegation and travelled to a third country for conducting personal business.

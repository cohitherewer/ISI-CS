          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 17: A team form the state crime investigation department today left for Delhi to interrogate the nun, who had allegedly been raped during communal violence in Kandhamal district on August 25.        
	Inspector-general of police (crime) Arun Roy told The Telegraph that the nun, now staying in Delhi, had agreed to co-operate with the crime branch in the investigation.        
	The team would meet her at a place and time of her choice and record her statement, he said.        
	Roy said the nun was yet to recover from the trauma she had undergone three months ago. Earlier, a team headed by inspector-general of police B. Radhika went to Delhi to meet the nun. However, the team had to return as the nun was untraceable.        
	The crime branch, during investigations, arrested 10 people in connection with the incident. However, investigations could not continue because of the non-co-operation of the nun, crime branch officers said. According to criminal procedure, the victim has to identify the accused. But the test identification parade of the accused could not be held because of the nuns absence.        
	On October 24, the nun made her first public appearance at a news conference in Delhi and expressed her lack of faith in the state police accusing it of being friendly with her attackers. The nun alleged that she had been dragged by a mob and paraded half-naked in presence of police officers and later raped.        
	She demanded a CBI probe into the incident. But on October 22, the Supreme Court rejected the plea of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese archbishop Raphael Cheenath for the CBI probe and asked the nun to co-operate with the state police.        
	The government has also suspended five Orissa State Armed Police personnel who were reportedly present at the spot for negligence of duty.         
	Roy, however, refused to reveal whether the test identification parade would be conducted at Delhi.         
	The state had earlier assured the nun that it was prepared to conduct the test identification parade of the accused anywhere in the country, according to her wish.

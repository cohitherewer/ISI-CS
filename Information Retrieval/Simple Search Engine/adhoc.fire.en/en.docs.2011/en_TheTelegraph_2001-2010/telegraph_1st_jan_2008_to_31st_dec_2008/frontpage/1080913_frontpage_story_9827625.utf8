  - Panel on Monika exclusion criticises communication delay           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: The controversy surrounding weightlifter Monika Devis dope test which led to her withdrawal from the Beijing Olympics could have been easily avoided, according to former Chief Election Commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy who submitted the probe report to the sports ministry today.        
	According to the report, once an athlete has been selected for participation in an international competition, he/she has to be treated with utmost dignity.         
	Until the adverse finding is established beyond doubt, the communication between the administrative authorities and the athlete should be prompt and fully transparent.        
	Criticising the entire system, Krishnamurthy said a better management of the coaching camps, selection of athletes, testing of the samples and a communication of the result could have avoided the whole controversy.        
	I am left with the impression that at every stage the urgency, transparency and the sensitivity of the athletes concerned seem to have been put on the backburner and an ad hoc approach to the core issues was more evident, Krishnamurthy said in his report.        
	It, however, made it clear that there was no mala fide intention of any individual to disgrace the Manipur lifter.         
	However, I must state that I did not come across any concrete evidence of any mala fides on the part of any individual although it is very clear that there was lack of unity of purpose among all these persons.        
	The report also pointed out that there was considerable delay in completing the test on Monika Devi.        
	Had the testing been done within the stipulated time and the result been communicated immediately thereafter, the disappointment and the mental shock the athlete had by the sudden and abrupt communication, especially through the media first, could have been easily avoided, the report said.

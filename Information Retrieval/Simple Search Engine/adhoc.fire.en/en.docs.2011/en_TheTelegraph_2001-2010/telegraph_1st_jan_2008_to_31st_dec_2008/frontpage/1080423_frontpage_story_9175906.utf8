	London, April 22: Since Daniel Radcliffe, star of the Harry Potter films, announced that he was searching for a mystery girl that he met backstage at an awards ceremony on his last trip to Australia, not one but two young women have come forward.         
	Yesterday, the 18-year-old star who is worth $50 million told The Daily Telegraph Australia that after locking eyes with the girl, he wandered around the party for an hour like some sad pathetic dweeb trying to find her, but to no avail. The young magician complained about how hard it has been for him to find a girlfriend and worried that the girls he did meet were gold diggers.        
	Since his comments were published, both Cassi McKay, a blond 20-year-old from Sydney, and Savannah Blount, a brown-haired saxophonist from Melbourne, have claimed that they were the beautiful stranger who stole the wizards heart. And, sadly for Radcliffe, both women already have boyfriends.         
	Blount told Melbourne MX that Radcliffe was not really her type: Handsome? Yes, yes  and very short. Im more for the taller type of guy.        
	But Cassi McKay told The Daily Telegraph Australia that she hopes to meet the actor when she comes to the UK next week for a four-month holiday. Her boyfriend, an electrician from Sydney, was unruffled by the possibility, saying: It doesnt really worry me. I trust her.        
	Disturbing sight        
	Harry Potters many young fans could find the sight of Radcliffe being shot to pieces disturbing. But according to the teenage actor, his new role as Rudyard Kiplings ill-fated son offers an important remembrance message.         
	ITV is prepared for complaints over My Boy Jack, the story of the authors son, who went missing in action on a World War I battlefield after his father pulled strings to get him a commission.         
	Kim Cattrall plays Kiplings American wife, Carrie, in the 10 million film screened as part of the channels Armistice Day commemorations. The film shows the fate of Lieutenant John Jack Kipling at the Battle of Loos in France with brutally violent clarity.         
	Radcliffe, 18, whose first television role this is, said that he wanted young Potter fans to watch the two-hour film. I hope people are moved, he said. The thought of forgetting all those people who fought is terrible. We are lucky not to have to endure those conditions now.         
	Radcliffe, who said that a great-uncle of his had been sent to the Great War, added: It is hard not to feel the parallels with what is happening now in Iraq and Afghanistan. Parents outliving their children is the greatest tragedy imaginable.         
	The Imperial War Museum in south London is holding an exhibition about Lieutenant John Jack Kipling to coincide with the film. Rudyard Kipling was a powerful supporter of war with Germany. When John failed the Forces medical on three occasions, because of severe shortsightedness, Kipling used his influence to get his son a commission with the Irish Guards.

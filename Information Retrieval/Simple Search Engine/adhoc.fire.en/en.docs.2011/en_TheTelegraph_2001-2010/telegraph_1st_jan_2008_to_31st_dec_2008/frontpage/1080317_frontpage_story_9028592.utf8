The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rally unites divided JMM
                                                                                                           Rally unites divided JMM
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, March 16: The JMM legislators might be divided over their real candidate for the Rajya Sabha biennials on March 26 but they are united to make their partys Pehchan rally here tomorrow a grand success.         
	The JMM will be holding a mass rally to prove its might in the current power politics tomorrow in which thousands of its supporters from different parts of the state would be participating.         
	Observers feel that tired with the changing moods of UPA partners, the JMM would formally begin its preparations for the next Parliament and Assembly elections through this rally. But the fielding of separate candidates by the JMM legislators for the Rajya Sabha biennials has put a question mark on its stand.         
	A vertical split in the JMM came to the fore two days ago when its nine MLAs supported by Tala Marandi of BJP proposed Reliance Industries group president (corporate affairs) Parimal Nathwanis candidature to the Rajya Sabha. The next day, JMM chief Shibu Soren forwarded the case of a Delhi-based businessman Kishore Lal. R.K. Anand, backed by JMM, RJD and certain Independent legislators, too, filed his nomination papers.        
	Differences over the candidature notwithstanding, JMM legislators vowed to be united over the rally.         
	This is a fight between the MLAs, why should it affect the success of our scheduled party programme? I am now busy with a cycle rally. I will reach Ranchi tomorrow morning to ensure the success of our rally, said JMM Lok Sabha member Hemlal Murmu, who allegedly brought Nathwani here in a chartered plane.        
	Murmu, however, claimed that he had no link with Nathwani and that he only wanted a son of the soil to contest the Rajya Sabha biennials. For this, he had supported Durga Sorens candidature. But now that Durga is not in the fray, the JMM legislators will have to exercise their franchise at their own wisdom.        
	MLA Sufal Marandi, who is learnt to have proposed Anands candidature, said he was busy arranging vehicles for the transportation of rallyists to Ranchi tomorrow. He also denied having proposed anyones name.         
	Champai Soren said he was not aware how and when the names of all these candidates were finalised.         
	The Congress may be accused of promoting horse trading during the ensuing biennials but its legislators claimed that they are not a party to the nefarious designs. Niel Tirkey and Sukhdeo Bhagat said they were forced to flee to their respective Assembly constituencies by the advances of the three contestants.

  - Tiwari paternity suit          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            A photograph taken 22 years ago shows Rohit when he was seven, his mother Ujjwala and ND Tiwari                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 17: Caught in the paternity battle between her son Rohit Shekhar and veteran politician N.D. Tiwari, Ujjwala Sharma feels like a dustbin.        
	The asthmatic 64-year-old says she has begun to feel  all over again  dumped by the man she claims to have given her best years to, while regularly being subjected to fits of a frustrated sons anger.        
	Rohit, 29, a lawyer who lives with his mother in south Delhi, has filed a suit in Delhi High Court asking Tiwari, the octogenarian Andhra Pradesh governor, to acknowledge him as his son out of wedlock or take a DNA test.        
	Tiwari has denied the allegation of being Rohits father, refused to undergo the test, and in his reply to the court notice described Ujjwala as an unchaste woman while mentioning he had been her paramour.        
	Ujjwala, who has been in and out of hospital, has made herself plaintiff No. 2 in the case despite the pain it has forced her to relive. She says she must see the battle through, at least so that her son  depressed and suffering from a heart problem  can rid himself of his demons.        
	Yet the case has underscored the tension that always existed between mother and son. Rohit doesnt acknowledge it but, somewhere in his heart, blames Ujjwala for bringing him into the world as Tiwaris son, she says.        
	I have to face his anger, day in and day out. But he is my son. After he fell ill, I just about managed to save him. I dont keep well myself, and I hope my son one day gets what he has set out to get, Ujjwala says tentatively, as if afraid that each word could be quoted against her in court.        
	Sitting in her posh home, Ujjwala steals a glance at her son each time she mentions Tiwari, with a nervous edge to her voice.        
	Only a mother knows who the father of her son is. I remember the day when N.D. Tiwari pleaded with me to give him a son. He said he was issueless and we should have a child so he could have the satisfaction of fathering a child. I had a 10-year-old son from my failed marriage and didnt want to take any decision in haste, but he said he was getting old, Ujjwala says.        
	Ujjwala had been married at 17, in the early 60s, to Bimal Sharma, assistant to her father Sher Singh who later became junior defence minister. But the marriage failed. In 1967, Tiwari, then Youth Congress chief, began visiting the Singh home.        
	I had Rohit in 1979, six to seven years after Tiwari first spoke of having a child. I trusted him unconditionally and what completely convinced me was that he promised to marry me and adopt both the children. He wanted to get a divorce, and advised me to get one too, Ujjwala says.        
	He told me I had a right to live my life. In a way, in retrospect, I feel he had gauged that after a bad marriage, I was vulnerable and he used that to his advantage.        
	Rohit, clad in white kurta-pyjama, has closely cropped hair, soft eyes and an endearing smile. But his eyes burn when he recalls the alleged rebuffs he received from Tiwari down the years when he tried to get the four-time chief minister to accept him as his son.        
	Rohit, born when Ujjwala was married to Sharma, says he used to address Tiwari as uncle as a boy. He claims that when he was 12-13, he overheard a quarrel between Tiwari and Ujjwala, following which his mother told him the politician was his father.        
	He says the last time he had met Tiwari was exactly three years ago  on October 18, Tiwaris birthday, in 2005 when the politician was Uttarakhand chief minister.        
	I went to his birthday party with a cake in hand, hoping against hope that he would at least welcome me. But when I reached Dehra Dun, in the mass of people who had gathered there to wish him, I was just another man, not a son. I was taken to another room and hidden away, he says. That day I decided I had had enough.        
	Rohit claims he waited till April this year to file the case because he was ill -- his heart problem forced him into regular hospital visits. He is only seeking recognition as Tiwaris son or a DNA test, not any financial benefits.        
	I know Im fighting against odds; he is a powerful man. But if I win this one, I would have the satisfaction of knowing I have given strength to hundreds of other women who face a similar plight, he says, refusing to talk more.        
	Ujjwala and Rohit have been advised by their lawyer to neither speak to the media in detail about the case nor pose for photographs.

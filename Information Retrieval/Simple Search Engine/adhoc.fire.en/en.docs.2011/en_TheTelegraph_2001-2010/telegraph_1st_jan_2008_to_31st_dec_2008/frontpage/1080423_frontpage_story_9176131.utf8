          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Jamshedpur, April 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh advised the steel industry to take a long-term view and not fall prey to the temptation of seeking windfall gains from market manipulation in a period of excess demand.        
	Addressing the centenary function of Tata Steel at the JRD Tata Sports Complex here today, Singh said: The Indian economy, as well as the demand for steel, will continue to grow. The steel industry should avoid short-term gains that hurt consumers.

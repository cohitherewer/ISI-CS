          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: What the National Investigation Agency wants, it will get.        
	The NIA Bill 2008 leaves little choice for state police but to step aside and assist if asked to. Nothing save the very scope of the bill can prevent the Centre from taking over a case from the state police.        
	The bill, passed by the Lok Sabha today, says it will be the agencys discretion to ask the state polices assistance if it is expedient to do so, or to transfer the case to the state with the Centres approval.         
	The bill also empowers the NIA to investigate any other offence a terror accused is alleged to have committed if the offence is connected to a scheduled list.        
	In other words, a bribery allegation against a terror accused can be probed by the NIA.        
	The bill says the agency can simply take over a case from the state police unlike the CBI, which has to get the state governments nod before stepping in.        
	The police are expected to send a report to the state government as soon as a case is registered under the scheduled list of offences. In turn, the state is expected to forward the report to the Centre as expeditiously as possible.        
	It is here that the discretionary powers of the Centre come in. If the central government is of the opinion that a scheduled offence has been committed which is required to be investigated under this act, it may, suo motu (on its own), direct the agency to investigate the said offence, Section 6(5) of the bill says.        
	The Centre can take cognisance of information from sources other than the states and the different aspects would be considered. The bill says the Centre will consider the gravity of the offence and other relevant factors before deciding if the case is fit to be probed by the agency. The decision will be taken within a fortnight of the states report.         
	Although the bill brought the ruling coalition and the Opposition on the same side, some parties voiced their reservations.         
	Speaking against Section 6(5), Telugu Desam Party MP K. Yerran Naidu said the provision encroaches upon powers vested in state governments by the Constitution.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram said the Centre would take over investigations only after looking into the gravity of the offence.         
	Assam regional party AGP said it would not support the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill, 2008, as it bears a striking similarity to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act to which the party is opposed.         
	The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act is one of the seven acts that make up the scope of the NIA bill. In other words, the NIA can probe offences listed under these acts.         
	We will not support even the NIA without a discussion, said AGP Rajya Sabha MP Kumar Deepak Das.         
	The CPMs Sitaram Yechury advised the Centre not to tamper with the federal nature of the Constitution.

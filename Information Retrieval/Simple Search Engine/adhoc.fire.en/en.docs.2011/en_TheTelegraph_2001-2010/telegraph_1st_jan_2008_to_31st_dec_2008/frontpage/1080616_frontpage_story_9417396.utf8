	A meeting would be held on June 16 to finalise the requirement of staff  academic and managerial  budget and other paraphernalia to take off the project.        
	The project was conceptualised with a view to promote, encourage, support and execute schemes for younger generation and adventure sports enthusiasts. The activities include facing challenges  both artificial and natural or rivers, seas, mountains  in forests, deserts, sky and wilderness, said tourism secretary Arun Kumar Singh.        
	The government would give special emphasis to the underprivileged sections of the society. Some of the main objectives of the institute would be to sponsor and support all kinds of adventure expeditions, events and activities in the state, country or abroad. It would act as a clearing agent and co-ordinator with appropriate ministries, including youth affairs and sports, home, defence, tourism, environment, surface transport and highways, civil aviation, state governments and NGOs.        
	Apart from setting up museums, clubs, auditorium and library on the subject, organising film shows and exhibitions for disseminating knowledge among people, they would help in execution of schemes.         
	These would be aimed to promote national integration, a spirit of travel and adventure and better understanding of tradition, flora and fauna in border, tribal and remote areas.        
	The government also has plan to go for public-private-partnership and enter into joint collaboration with those institutes or agencies involved in development, support and execution of adventure tourism activities.        
	In fact, the state forest department also planned to make Saranda forests into a hub of adventure sports, including treks, rock climbing and river rafting.

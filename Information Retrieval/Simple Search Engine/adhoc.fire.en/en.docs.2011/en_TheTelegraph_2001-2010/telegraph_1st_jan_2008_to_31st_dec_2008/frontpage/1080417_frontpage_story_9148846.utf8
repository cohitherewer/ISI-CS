	Ranchi/Dhanbad, April 16: Within an hour of their daylong bandh that began at midnight, Maoists blew up railway tracks between Chaudhary-Baandh and Chengro stations of Jharkhand, disrupting traffic on the Grand Chord section till nine this morning.        
	Though the explosion failed to cause much damage only two metres of the down track were bent it once again proved the might of the Maoists who have made a habit of picking railway establishments as soft targets in the past few years.        
	In Bihar, the Naxalites blew up Nathgunj, a one-room station on the Grand Chord section, after asking two railway employees to leave the premises around 10.45pm. Dhanbad RPF commandant Santosh Dubey rushed to the station between Gaya and Gajhandi stations. The rebels also abducted the station master and the driver and guard of a goods train.        
	In another incident, over 100 rebels barged into the Faisar railway station near Aurangabad and took four employees hostage around 12.30am on Wednesday. They were later released.                
	In Jharkhand, the explosives used were mild in nature. So, the tracks werent blown up, Dhanbad superintendent of railway police Shashinath Jha said. However, several long-distance trains, including three Rajdhani Expresses, were delayed by several hours. The damaged tracks and the overhead wires  snapped due to the blast  could be repaired only by 8.30am.        
	Howrah and Sealdah Rajdhani Expresses were delayed for over five hours. Similarly, the Ranchi Rajdhani Express was detained for about seven hours near Gomoh.         
	When I learnt that the Maoist had blown up tracks at Chaudhary-Baandh, my sleep was gone. Several of my co-passengers kept awake the entire night in fear of rebel terror, said Gopal Sharma (name changed), who was travelling with his wife on the Ranchi Rajdhani. Sharma heaved a sigh of relief only after his train reached Ranchi at 1.45pm, four-and-half-hours late.        
	The Dhanbad railway division suffered a loss of more than Rs 8 crore due to suspension of loading and unloading of coal today, said Amarendra Das, the PRO of Dhanbad division.

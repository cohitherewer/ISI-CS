	Ranchi, March 15: In the rush to file nominations for the Rajya Sabha elections, there was a virtual stampede in the UPA camp today  JMM chief Shibu Soren didnt field his son after all, but named former South Delhi MP Kishori Lal as official UPA nominee.         
	With lawyer R.K. Anand doing a volte face and throwing his hat into the ring with the blessings of a few RJD men, there are now four candidates for two Rajya Sabha seats  yesterday, Parimal Nathwani of Reliance Industries filed his papers as an Independent while the BJP fielded Jai Prakash Narayan Singh.         
	Todays surprise was Lal, who won the Lok Sabha elections in 1977 from South Delhi on a Janata Party ticket. His name was proposed by Sudhir Mahto, Stephen Marandi, Nalin Soren, Dulal Bhuiyan, Bandhu Tirkey, Joba Manjhi, Kamlesh Singh, Bhanu Pratap Sahi (all ministers) and JMM MLAs Champai Soren and Ravindra Mahto.        
	Anand filed his papers as an Independent. But five RJD MLA  Uday Shankar Singh, Ram Chandra Singh, Videsh Singh, Ramchadra Chandravanshi and Prakash Ram  proposed his name along with Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Anosh Ekka (both ministers), Sufal Marandi, Mathura Mahto and Bhushan Tirkey (all JMM MLAs).        
	The Congress is holding its horses. Ajay Maken, in charge of party affairs in the state, postponed his scheduled visit to Ranchi.         
	Anand claimed he joined the race after Soren did not field son Durga. If 11 JMM MLAs could go to Nathwani, they could always switch sides. Guruji was not even aware of his MLAs move, he alleged.        
	Soren justified his decision to back Lal. UPA leaders have given the seat to JMM. So, its for us to choose a candidate, he maintained.        
	Lal claimed he was rewarded for his continuous fight for tribals and quipped, talk to Ahmad Patel if I do not have Congress support.        
	Several ministers claimed Soren kept them in the dark till the last minute over Lals candidature. In fact, we had endorsed Durgas nomination at last nights meeting, said one of them.         
	There was considerable speculation, too, about why Soren dropped Durga. Among the theories doing the rounds was to curb a brewing rebellion within his party  11 MLAs backed Nathawani.        
	The BJP has also got jittery with its nominee, Jai Prakash, filing another set of papers today.

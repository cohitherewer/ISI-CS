          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, May 31: At least five women bureaucrats have alleged discrimination in postings and promotions, with women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury taking up their complaints.        
	Chowdhurys ministry has written to the department of personnel and training as well as the Union Public Service Commission, asking for an explanation and urgent action.        
	Although the complaints were not supported with concrete evidence, they were accompanied with documents that suggested possible bias, womens ministry officials said. There was no hard evidence, but the complaints were considered serious since they had been made by IAS officers, an official said.        
	One complainant detailed a chain of events leading up to the promotion of another official and not her, despite her being more eligible and having a better departmental record.        
	Another complainant alleged she had repeatedly been posted to soft sectors  a reference to social-sector ministries  instead of tougher areas like security and external affairs.        
	Her complaint was that the subconscious mindset of the personnel department and the UPSC makes them think these tough ministries need male bureaucrats although there is no evidence to suggest this, the official said.        
	The home and foreign ministries  which look after internal security and external affairs  together have nine secretaries but not one of them is a woman. The defence ministry does have a woman as a secretary-level official, apart from its four male secretaries, but she is in charge of the welfare of ex-servicemen.        
	In contrast, the secretaries of the panchayati raj, parliamentary affairs, labour and employment, information and broadcasting, and environment and forests ministries, and that of the department of northeastern region, are women.        
	The womens ministry is dominated by women  all four joint secretaries and the minister herself  although the secretary is male.        
	Gender bias charges have been thrown at the government earlier, too. Last year, when the home ministry selected Y.S. Dadwal over Kiran Bedi as Delhi police commissioner, Bedi alleged discrimination.        
	IFS officer Veena Sikri had contested the appointment of S.S. Menon as foreign secretary, saying her seniority was overlooked because of her gender.        
	Last year, Chowdhury had asked the personnel department to change the questions in the promotion pro forma for women bureaucrats, which required them to detail their menstrual history. Several of the women had objected to these questions, which were eventually removed. India has 591 women IAS officers in all.

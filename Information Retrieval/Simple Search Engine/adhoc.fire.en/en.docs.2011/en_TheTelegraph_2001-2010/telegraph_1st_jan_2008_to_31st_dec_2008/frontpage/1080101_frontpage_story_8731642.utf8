     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                       
	Calcutta, Dec. 31: While you were warming up for the New Year party, the city was gritting its teeth through the coldest December in a decade.
    
	Mondays minimum temperature in Calcutta was 11.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal, according to G.C. Debnath, the director of weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.
    
	Today was the coldest day of the season so far. This is also the coldest day in December since 1997. On December 25, 1997, the minimum temperature was 11.2 degrees, he said.
    
	Debnath added that New Years Day is also expected to be cold. From Wednesday onwards, the minimum temperature is expected to rise following a possible change in the wind flow pattern, he said.
    
	Met officials said the minimum temperature in Calcutta had been dropping steadily since last Wednesday.
    
	The sky is clear and the cold and dry north wind is now blowing across Calcutta and other south Bengal districts without any hindrance. The minimum temperature dropped because of the prevailing cold-wave conditions in northern India, a Met official said. 
    
	From Wednesday, a wind is likely to blow in from the Bay of Bengal. Around this time, the moisture-laden wind from the sea will be warmer and the minimum temperature is expected to rise, the official said.
    
	But that does not mean there will not be any further cold spells in January. If the wind pattern shifts and the wind blows in unhindered from the northern parts of the country, the temperature will fall again, the official added. 
    
	The Met office has issued a warning of cold-wave conditions in Purulia, Birbhum, Bankura and Burdwan during the next 48 hours.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Bhubaneswar/Mumbai, May 5: After being on the run since April 13, Sandeep Acharya alias Raja, the prime suspect in the murder of coach Biranchi Das, was arrested today from Panaji, Goa.         
	While unconfirmed reports stated that the gangster had surrendered in a Panaji court, Orissa and Goa police maintained Raja was indeed arrested.         
	They added that a joint force of Orissa and Goa police succeeded in tracing the fugitive gangster using electronic surveillance system and laid a trap to nab him.         
	We arrested Raja (35), this afternoon after receiving information from the Orissa police that he will surrender at Panaji police station. We have arrested him under Section 41 (arrested on suspicion) of Criminal Procedure Code. He will be produced before a magistrate tomorrow and his custody would be handed over to the Orissa police after that, said inspector Francis Korte of Panaji police station.        
	Police sources said Raja arrived in northern Goa this morning and was traced by the Orissa police through his cellphone signals.         
	Orissa police negotiated his arrest and asked him to surrender before the Panaji police. An Orissa police team led by our assistant commissioner has already left to bring him back on transit remand, said police commissioner Binay Behera. We had been monitoring Rajas movements electronically. Details would be given once he is here, he said, refusing to elaborate on the type of electronic surveillance used.        
	Police sources said that Raja was caught from near an STD booth near MG Road by the Goa police.         
	Ever since the murder of Biranchi on April 13, the gangster had been absconding. The Orissa police had been on their toes raiding not less than 50 places in and around Bhubaneswar to trace him  but had failed. Police teams were also sent to Mumbai and Visakhapatnam, but they, too, had returned disappointed.         
	However, the state added extra pressure on the fugitive when an SDJM court called him an absconder and announced that his properties would be auctioned if he did not surrender.         
	The gangster has 35 criminal cases against him, including four for murder, registered at different police stations. In his 16-year-old criminal career, Raja was jailed 18 times, including the last time when actress Leslie Tripathy lodged a complaint against him.         
	On April 22, Rajas close aide Chagala surrendered in Bhopal.

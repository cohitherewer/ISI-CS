          MANINI CHATTERJEE                               
	Sapporo, July 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today refused to get perturbed by the political turmoil back home and made it clear that the Lefts formal withdrawal of support to his government tomorrow would in no way affect his resolve to take the next step of the nuclear deal nor put a brake on his efforts to persuade the galaxy of world leaders here  George W. Bush heading the list  to help seal the deal.        
	In an impromptu interaction with a group of reporters who caught him in his hotel lobby today, the Prime Minister said: I dont think it (the withdrawal of Left support) will affect the stability of the government.        
	Asked when the government planned to formally approach the IAEA, he said: As soon as possible.         
	The Prime Ministers brief remarks indicating business as usual were amplified by foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon who maintained that the domestic political situation had no bearing on the Prime Ministers back-to-back meetings with a number of leaders today.        
	We went through the day as we had planned to; I am convinced we have a good case (on the nuclear deal) there is no reason why the NSG cannot give us a clean exemption, he said.        
	Asked if the domestic opposition to the nuclear deal and the possibility of the government falling on the issue had made any impact on the position of the members of the IAEA or the NSG, Menon categorically said: Nobody has brought up the domestic political situation.        
	The support for the nuclear deal had, in fact, grown in international circles, he said  a roundabout way of asserting that the Lefts opposition over the last one year had not affected either the governments efforts to lobby for the deal or the response of other nations to Indias bid to end its post-1974 nuclear isolation.        
	Of all the meetings held today, the most important was the one between the Prime Minister and Chinese President Hu Jintao. Indias officialdom seemed particularly pleased at communist Chinas cooperative spirit on a day when the Indian communists struck.        
	The Prime Minister, Menon said, had raised the issue of civil nuclear cooperation with Hu. We do not anticipate that this (the nuclear deal) will be a difficulty between us, Menon said.         
	The Chinese side had expressed a willingness in helping India on civil use of nuclear energy, Menon added.         
	China and India, which share very similar views on climate change, also discussed how the issue should be tackled in a fair and equitable manner that does not affect the imperatives of growth and development. The nuclear issue was mentioned separately and not as part of the discussions on climate change, Menon clarified in response to a query.        
	The Chinese position today was not new. In bilateral talks with India over the last one year, Beijing has always expressed support for Indias keenness to develop civil nuclear energy without giving any firm assurances on the Indo-US nuclear deal which also tacitly acknowledges the strategic component of Indias nuclear programme.        
	But the pro-deal lobby in South Block is reasonably sanguine that when Indias case comes up before multi-lateral bodies such as the IAEA and the NSG, China will not prove a stumbling block.        
	With China becoming a major global player, its leadership would not want to play spoilsport on an issue that has the backing of the Big Guys  the US, the UK, France, Russia.        
	Nor would China, they feel, want to precipitate a setback in ties with India at a time the two Asian giants have begun working closely on a range of issues through groupings like the G5 and are fast-tracking efforts to improve bilateral ties.

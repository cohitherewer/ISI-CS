  - Jharkhand worst in NREGA         VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR                                                      Jean Dr egrave;ze at a public hearing. File picture		    
	Markachcho (Koderma), June 18: A team led by eminent economist Jean Drze to monitor the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) today termed Jharkhand the worst state in implementing the scheme.        
	A public hearing regarding the Union governments showpiece job scheme was convened at Sarvodaya Uchcha Vidyalaya in which hundreds of villagers, including women, took part. Koderma deputy commissioner Kanhaiya Pandey were also present at the school, about 20km from Koderma town.        
	Drze, one of the key acrchitects of NREGS, said Koderma and Palamau districts lagged far behind others in implementing the scheme as villagers had not been properly briefed.        
	Continuous monitoring revealed that only 26 per cent of villagers in these districts know about a job card and the benefits that come with it. We arent to find fault only. We will also appreciate those who take up this scheme honestly. But we will not tolerate corrupt practices, he said.         
	At one point, Drze, who looked upset at the way in which the scheme was being run, asked all villagers who had got NREGS work for 100 days to raise their hands. To his surprise, not a single hand was raised.        
	The team, including Planning Commission senior consultant Santosh Mehrotra, visited a remote part of Koderma district. Drze also said the teams finding indicated that progress in implementation of NREGS in Jharkhand was worst compared to other states.        
	At the meeting, the gathering resolved to make 10 demands, including seeking a CBI inquiry into the murder of NREGA activist Lalit Mehta.         
	Late this evening, however, the state government ordered a CBI probe.         
	They also demanded the State and the Centre reject the report of Palamau district administration on the circusmtances of Mehtas murder and sought a fresh report in a month.

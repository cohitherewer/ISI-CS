          OUR BUREAU       
	Aug. 16: JMM chief Shibu Soren sounded confident today on the eve of the partys central committee meeting in Ranchi, declaring he had the support of almost all the Independents who were till recently aligned with the Madhu Koda government.        
	Refusing to provide numbers, he said even if a few of them were not with him today, he was sure to become chief minister.         
	Mera bhi naam Guruji hai, aur main bhi politics kar sakta hoon yeh main dikha doonga. Sirf 24 ghante ka intezaar phir yaa to meri sarkar yaa Rashtrpati shashan ke liye Koda ho jayen taiyyar. (My name is Guruji and I too know politics. After 24 hours, either its my government or its Presidents Rule, Koda better beware), Soren said in Bokaro before leaving for the capital where he was scheduled to meet Union minister of state for food processing Subodh Kant Sahay.        
	In Ranchi, JMM central organisation secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said tomorrows legislature party meeting would begin at 11am, followed by the partys central committee meeting in the afternoon.         
	The JMM central committee will formally decide to make Soren Jharkhand chief minister. The legislature party will formally elect him its new leader, he confirmed.         
	Later in the evening, a 25-member JMM delegation led by Soren is scheduled to meet Governor Syed Sibtey Razi to apprise him of the decisions taken at the two meetings.         
	Razi, on on the other hand, has okayed the state governments proposal to hold the monsoon session of the Assembly from September 19 to 24. In case, JMM withdraws support, a special session for Koda to prove his strength, therefore, cannot be ruled out earlier.         
	Sahay said he and Soren were scheduled to discuss tomorrows plan tonight.         
	We have always been opposed to the Koda government Now, Soren too wants to get rid of Koda. The Congress will be benefited either way, be it Soren becoming chief minister or Jharkhand being put under the Presidents Rule, he added, indicating how the Congress viewed the recent developments.         
	But will Soren manage the numbers? Adding to the intrigue, JMMs deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto publicly praised Kodas chief ministerial tenure, but chose to maintain a diplomatic silence on his boss, Sorens bid for the top job.                          
	Asked in Giridih about his opinion on Koda and Mahato said, Very good his tenure as chief minister was very good.        
	What about Shibu Soren?         
	Mahato kept quiet, his silence indicating what was widely believed_ that the deputy chief minister wasnt in favour of his party chief becoming chief minister as he feared his own clout in the government would then automatically diminish.        
	Mahato, who was in Giridih to participate in a function to celebrate the birth anniversary of Lav-Kush by the Kushwaha Society at Town Hall, however, maintained there was nothing wrong with the JMMs demand for a change of guard.        
	In coalition governments, chief ministers do change and it has happened in Jharkhand before, he said citing the example of Arjun Munda, who replaced Babulal Marandi.        
	Giridih MP Teklal Mahto, who was also present at the function, was more forthright, claiming a good number of MPs and MLAs would find place both at the Centre and the state.         
	 We are clear on our stand to form the government in Jharkhand and there is no if and but about it inside the party and among our MLAs. We will get our share at the Centre as well, claimed the JMM chief whip.Waise kal sabh faisla ho jayega (Everything will be finalised tomorrow), he added.

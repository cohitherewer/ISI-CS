	Beijing, Oct. 24: On a day the sensex plunged over a thousand points back home, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today used the forum of the Seventh Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM-7) to concede for the first time that the international financial crisis was beginning to have a grave impact on India for no fault of its own.         
	The Prime Minister repeated the governments standard mantra  that the banking system was sound and that the economy was slated to grow at 7 to 7.5 per cent.         
	But shedding the usual complacency, Singh went on to admit that India cannot remain unaffected for long.        
	Our stock markets and the exchange rate of the rupee are under pressure due to capital outflow of foreign institutional investors. Sooner or later, the real economy is bound to experience the pain, he said.         
	Singh, however, did not confine himself to a description of the crisis but went on to offer some concrete proposals  one reason, perhaps, that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao placed on record his appreciation of Singhs speech.        
	Speaking out on behalf of developing countries as a whole, the Prime Minister called upon international financial institutions, particularly the IMF, to provide additional assistance more quickly and in large amounts, with less service conditionality and greater flexibility.        
	He pointed out that one way to counter a looming global recession was to increase infrastructure investments in developing countries.         
	Such a move, if backed by increased resource flows from multinational financial institutions such as the IBRD and the Regional Development Banks, can act as a powerful stabiliser.         
	The IMF, he added, should revisit the potentially powerful instrument of creating liquidity through fresh allocation of special drawing rights in favour of multilateral development financial institutions.

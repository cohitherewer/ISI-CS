       Who can resist a bag of potato wafers, or a plate full of french fries, asks Nondon Bagchi                    
	In school  The Primary Demonstration School, Kampala, which went up to Class VIII  the last day of each term was always Picnic Day. It would be all play and no work. Groundsheets spread out to all corners of the field, music, party games and of course, the main attraction, food. This was a pooling of resources, with each of us taking along something, either bought or home-cooked.   
	Everyone brought picnic-friendly stuff; usually dryish and easy to pack. No runny gravies and curries or dal and rice, just snackish stuff, mainly. There were mainly Gujarati students in school so wed look forward to mouth-watering khandvi, dhokla and other farsan, and luchis, puris and paranthas with aloo dum, aloo gobi or any other dry vegetable preparation were always there, as there were sandwiches, samosas, singaras and more.  
	One hot favourite combination, specially for us kids in classes V or VI, was simply chips, ketchup and Coke, and the more the merrier. We would never have gotten away with having such fare at home (Balance your diet! Eat lots of vegetables!) so Picnic Day was the time to indulge. Potato wafers  the plain, salted variety  would be bought in large numbers a day or two before the big day and stashed in the house.  
	But the forbearance required to only look but not touch was simply too much for us. Well just open one bag, someone would say and that was enough. Someone else would scurvy off to bring some ketchup and the bedroom would be transformed into a Picnic Day preview. At least three bags and many guilt pangs later we would troop off to pick disinterestedly at dinner and of course mother knew at once.   
	Youve been at the chips. Yes, but how could one explain the sheer impossibility of staying away from them? Crisp and golden yellow, pleading to be dipped in ketchup and popped in? What was worse was that in the morning we would have to face fathers wrath as he made a diversion to stop by at the shop to replenish supplies on the way to school.  
	From the sublime pleasure of those potato wafers one went on to discover chips of every variety. French fries, or finger chips as they are also known, delicious with ketchup and also with mustard or chilli sauce, came next. The old khansamas in some of the clubs in Calcutta had perfected the art of making these and did a much better job than the burger joints around the world where the potatoes are processed and cut by machines and dont, I think, taste half as good. Some clubs in the city still do excellent finger chips.  
	Chips form a scrumptious part of the Bengali diet as well, to go with rice and light masoor dal. Our jhuri bhaja is unique  needle-thin potato juliennes deep-fried to a crisp. Or sometimes we will cut the potatoes into thin rounds (but not wafer thin), often with the skins on, and fry them till partly crisp and partly soft. Squashed into fresh, steaming rice and accompanied by dal, a twist of lime and green chillies, they are great.              Banana chips		    
	Other tubers make good chips too. The colocasia tuber  kochu in Bengali  is also cut into rounds, sprinkled liberally with chilli powder and deep fried. As kids, we knew they werent potatoes, and we simply called them jhaal chips. Cassava, also known as tapioca or manioc or yuca depending on where you are, is an excellent tuber for chips, and these can really be tasty. In South India, they make them out into slim fingers or flat discs, and chilli powder is used generously.   
	And then chips from fruit. Most of us have had banana chips, made from green bananas, available in south Indian shops around the city, with the characteristic flavour, just a hint, of coconut oil clinging to them.  
	On a recent visit to Bangkok, one more variety was added to my chips repertoire. These were monthong durian chips. Durian is a popular fruit in Thailand and of the two varieties  chanee and monthong  the latter is better for chips because its flesh is denser and more firm. The flesh of mature durians is sliced into thin chips and these are sprinkled with fine white salt and deep fried, till lightly browned. Durian chips, like banana chips, have a slightly sweetish taste and Im sure that the sweet-sour chutneys with tamarind that we have for samosas and dhokla would suit them fine. Next time in Bangkok, look out for them!

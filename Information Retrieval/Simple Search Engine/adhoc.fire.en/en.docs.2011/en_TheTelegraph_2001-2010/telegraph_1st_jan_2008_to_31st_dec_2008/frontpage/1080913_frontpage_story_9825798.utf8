  - Soren forms panel to plan revised pay structure        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Ranchi, Sept. 12: The state cabinet today resolved to execute the recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission, by forming a committee, headed by retired accountant-general S.K.F. Kujur and deputy secretary of the finance department S.S. Tiwari as the member-secretary.        
	The committees main task would be to plan out a revised pay structure for the workers.        
	Though the state government had agreed in principle to introduce revised wages from January 1, 2006, according to the Centres recommendations, employees were to get the actual benefits only from April 1, 2007. Sixty per cent of the arrears due will be given to employees during the current fiscal.         
	If the revised wages were being implemented from January 1, 2006, the additional financial burden on the government would have exceeded Rs 3,383 crore. Even with the introduction of the revised wages from April 1, 2007, involves additional expenses to the tune of Rs 1,770 crore, said cabinet secretary P.K. Jajoria.         
	The revised wages from September 2008 to March 2009 would cost the state Rs 1,958 crore. Another Rs 1,062 crore would be spent on giving due arrears. The arrears will be paid at the end of the current fiscal.         
	It was also decided at todays meeting that graduates and postgraduates belonging to primitive tribes would be given Grade-III jobs in district collectorates and allied offices. Diploma-holders would be given Grade-II jobs. The reservation roster would be followed strictly in the case of such appointments.         
	The Arjun Munda cabinet, too, had taken a similar decision in 2005, which was ratified by the Madhu Koda cabinet. However, only a handful of graduates benefited because of a technical lapse. At todays meeting, however, it was decided to link such appointments to reservation rosters.         
	For that, officials have been directed to trace out such degree and diploma-holders, who were forced to return to their villages after failing to secure jobs. For the past few years, appointment letters were granted to primitive tribes during statehood foundation day, Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations.         
	The PowerPoint presentation to be made before the Thirteenth Finance Commission, too, was discussed by the cabinet. The commission members would be visiting the state on September 28 and 29 to hold meetings with senior officials in Ranchi and visit parts of the state.         
	Decisions taken by the Koda cabinet on August 18, too, were reviewed and ratified after minor modifications. In addition to the 46 new blocks constituted by the Koda government, the Soren cabinet added Bariatu in Latehar to the list.         
	After the JMM withdrew support to the Koda government last month, the Koda cabinet resolved to constitute 35 new blocks. It also agreed in principle to create 11 more new blocks. Today, the cabinet added one more to the list and asked officials to complete necessary formalities regarding the 11 blocks that the previous government had proposed.        
	In fact, Soren had strongly objected to the minority Koda government going ahead with such crucial cabinet decisions. But today, his own cabinet endorsed all the decisions.        
	The cabinet also directed the chief secretary and secretaries of rural development and disaster management to visit the drought-hit areas of Palamau. A fund grant of Rs 10 crore was also sanctioned for Bihar flood victims.

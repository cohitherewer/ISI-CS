	Ranchi, Aug. 13: Ready for a fight to the finish, JMM chief Shibu Soren reached the state capital today to personally oversee his partys attempt to dislodge chief minister Madhu Koda and form a government in Jharkhand.        
	We have been dragging the Koda government under severe compulsions for the last 23 months. Earlier, AICC general secretary Ajay Maken was also saying the same things. Now, it is time to take firm decisions, he said.        
	The JMM leader said the partys central committee and legislature party meeting on August 17 would take a final call on when they would withdraw support to the Koda government.         
	When will the JMM form a new government? Or will it prefer to seek a fresh mandate from the people? Confronted with more such direct questions, the JMM leader remained evasive.        
	Everything will be decided on Sunday. We have to respect the sentiments of our party workers at the grassroots level, he added.         
	Soren added he and his partymen would be talking to all the Independent ministers to seek their support. We will be talking to the Independents as well. I am also aware the Jharkhand High Court has served notices to five ministers under the anti-defection law. Everything will be discussed in the right perspective.        
	Till yesterday, at least five of the eight ministers, namely Stephen Marandi, Joba Manjhi, Kamlesh Singh, Bhanu Pratap Sahi and Hari Narayan Rai, were said to be opposed to the idea of Soren as chief minister. In fact, even Sorens wife Rupi is said to be doing her bit by trying to convince some of them, including Marandi, to back her husband.         
	Koda kept himself busy with official engagements. But by the evening after Soren had landed, he and his supporters decided to meet and chalk out their strategy. Except, human resources development minister Bandhu Tirkey  he is known to be close to Soren  all ministers met Koda at his residence.        
	That meant C.P. Chaudhary and Anosh Ekka had also joined their ranks. Later, they announced the formation of a new front with Sahi (health minister) as spokesman and decided to meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and RJD boss Lalu Prasad.        
	Seven of us are firmly with the chief minister. Only Bandhu Tirkey did not join our meeting. If need be, we will go to Delhi A change of guard is not needed at the moment, said Sahi.         
	Earlier in the day Koda sounded confident and advised his detractors to show some patience. Without naming Soren, he said those hell bent on toppling his government should think of the future.

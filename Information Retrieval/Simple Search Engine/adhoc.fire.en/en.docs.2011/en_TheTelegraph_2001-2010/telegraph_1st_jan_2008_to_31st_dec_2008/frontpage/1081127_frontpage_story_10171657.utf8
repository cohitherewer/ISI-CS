          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 26: A legislation that aims to protect buyers of flats against unscrupulous promoters was tabled in the Assembly today.         
	According to the West Bengal Apartment Ownership (Amendment) Bill, the buyer will be a flats deemed owner once the promoter has been given an advance or the first instalment of a housing loan taken for the holding paid.         
	Housing minister Goutam Deb, who tabled the bill, said: This legislation was framed in 1972 during the Siddhartha Shankar Ray regime to allow flat owners to form associations for development and upkeep of their housing complexes. Todays amendment bill was necessary to give flat purchasers the right to become deemed owners after payment of an advance or the first equated monthly instalment.        
	Mayor and senior lawyer Bikash Bhattacharya said the law would offer protection against promoters who sell off a flat booked by one buyer to another for a higher price.        
	If a deemed owner sues a promoter, the chances of the promoter being prosecuted will be much higher, he said.        
	So far, there was no specific law to protect the rights of the purchasers. A buyer who got cheated could only file a general cheating or breach of trust case, Bhattacharya said.         
	However, possession of a flat would be handed over to the buyer according to the agreement with the promoter, the housing minister said.        
	Deb said deemed ownership would allow the purchaser to become a member of the association that runs a housing complex and enjoy the rights and privileges other members are entitled to.         
	Bank branches, automated teller machines and market complexes are coming up in areas earmarked for housing complexes. They are paying all sorts of charges for running their operations but do not enjoy membership of the housing complex. This amendment bill would ensure that.

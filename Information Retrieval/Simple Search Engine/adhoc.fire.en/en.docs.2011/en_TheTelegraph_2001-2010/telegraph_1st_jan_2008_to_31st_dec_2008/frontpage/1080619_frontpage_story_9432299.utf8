          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, June 18: Buckling under pressure of social activists and Union rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, the Madhu Koda government today recommended a CBI inquiry into the killing of NREGA activist Lalit Mehta.        
	Earlier, the case was being investigated by the CID.        
	Mehta, a resident of Garhwa district, was found dead in the forests of Vishrampur in Palamau on May 15. He was probing irregularities in the execution of NREGS there.        
	A formal complaint was lodged with the Vishrampur police station the same day and the police started probing different aspects of the mysterious death.        
	 Activists, including Aruna Roy, Jean Drze, Swami Agnivesh and CPI leader D. Raja, demanded a CBI probe into the incident, saying the police were out to hush up the case.        
	Though the CID was capable of efficiently handling the case, considering the sentiment of NGOs and social workers we have recommended a probe by the CBI. This became necessary also because Mehta was apparently probing irregularities in the implementation of NREGS in the state, said Koda.        
	The chief minister added the proposal had been forwarded to the Union government and it was expected that the CBI would begin investigations soon.

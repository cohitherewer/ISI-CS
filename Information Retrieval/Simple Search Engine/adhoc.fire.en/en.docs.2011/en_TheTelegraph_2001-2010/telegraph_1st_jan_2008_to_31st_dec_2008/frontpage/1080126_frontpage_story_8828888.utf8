	Jan. 25: Call it a tsong or a djoke.
    
	Sundays Australian Open final was to be tenniss version of Muhammad Ali versus George Foreman, with a polished Swiss whom many consider the greatest taking on a brawny Spaniard.
    
	Instead, the rumble on the Plexicushion will feature a world No. 38 who looks like Ali and a Serb who does a brilliant impersonation of Maria Sharapova.
    
	Any talk of a change of guard will be premature but over the past two days, the games new generation has announced itself with unmistakable confidence.
    
	Novak Djokovic, 20, put it in words moments after piercing and prising apart Roger Federers armour of invincibility. Its a significant moment for tennis, the world No. 3 said. Every sport needs new faces.
    
	Especially if one of them is a version of a face recognised as readily in Congo as in Canada. But if that was the sole reason Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 22, was being likened to Ali, it changed last night. 
    
	The son of a Congolese handball player and French mother played audacious ground-strokes with amazing hand speed, outgunning world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in straight sets. He then skipped across the court, arms up in a biceps-flexing pose, thumbs pointing at his head.
    
	I played unbelievable, said Tsonga, who has shown himself as much of an extrovert as Ali, with similar lack of stage fright and almost the same gift of the gab. My backhand worked a lot and my serve also. My forehand, my volley, my drop shot everything was perfect. It was like a video game.
    
	I was flying like a butterfly, he had said after his quarter-final win, echoing the boxing greats famous words.
    
	Djokovic, son of pizza-and-pancake restaurant owners in Serbia, is as economical with words as with his strokes. Talking of Sundays game, the baseline slugger with the calculated chip and charge said: Looking at the rankings I would be the favourite but its (the) final so anything can happen.
    
	That last bit could be Tsongas motto. He has never played a mens tour final before. Since late 2004, he has suffered a herniated disc, two right shoulder injuries, back and abdominal ailments and a repeat abdominal injury.
    
	Hes never depressed, coach Eric Winogradsky said. Having to fight all those injuries is probably why hes so strong mentally today.
    
	Like the unseeded Marcos Baghdatis in 2006, Tsonga has used the tournament as a springboard to stardom by beating a string of top-10 players. On Sunday, he might expect to be the crowd favourite.
    
	Hes the most exciting player since Federer, former World No. 1 Mats Wilander said.
    
	While Djokovichs game may not be as exciting, he can sure entertain. The djoker had the US Open crowd in splits last September with his impersonations of Nadal and Sharapova.
    
	On Sunday, Melbourne wont be expecting him to do a Nadal, at least till the game is over.

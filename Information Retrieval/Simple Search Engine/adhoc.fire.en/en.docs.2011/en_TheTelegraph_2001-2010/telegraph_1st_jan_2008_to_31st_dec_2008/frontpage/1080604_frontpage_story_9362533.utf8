          OUR BUREAU                            Ripun Bora                                  
	June 3: Assam education minister Ripun Bora was arrested from south Delhi today for allegedly offering a CBI officer Rs 10 lakh to hush up a murder case.        
	Sources said Bora was picked up from Mathura Road this afternoon while he was allegedly offering the bribe. He is a suspect in the 2000 murder of Assam student leader Daniel Topno, who was his political rival.        
	Late this evening, the Tarun Gogoi government dropped Bora from the Assam cabinet. The law will take its own course, was all the chief minister would say.        
	A trap was apparently laid for Bora after the CBI officer filed a complaint last evening that he was being offered money to negotiate the outcome of the probe, the sources said.        
	Daniel Topno, the district president of the All Assam Tea Tribe Students Union, was murdered on September 27, 2000. He defeated Bora from Gohpur in the 1996 Assam elections and was one of his most vocal critics.        
	One of Boras associates, alleged to have been in Delhi yesterday while the deal was being fixed, was arrested from Guwahati airport today when he flew in from the capital. He was then taken back to Delhi.        
	Ramesh Maheshwari, a Delhi-based businessman believed to have given Bora the money, was also picked up in the capital.        
	In Gohpur, Daniel Topnos mother Silonti said everyone knew Bora had a hand in her sons murder but was afraid to speak up. But she had always believed that justice would prevail.        
	I was almost sure Bora was involved when he asked me to force my other son to withdraw the case seeking a CBI probe, she said over the phone.        
	Silonti claimed Bora had visited her home soon after he won the 2006 elections to pressure her. God is there and now it is almost proved that Bora was behind the killing, she said.        
	The arrest has come in the middle of the Gogoi regimes two-year celebrations. The chief minister has acted swiftly instead of waiting like other parties. Our party will not side with corruption or killers, a spokesperson said.        
	The CBI has registered a case under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

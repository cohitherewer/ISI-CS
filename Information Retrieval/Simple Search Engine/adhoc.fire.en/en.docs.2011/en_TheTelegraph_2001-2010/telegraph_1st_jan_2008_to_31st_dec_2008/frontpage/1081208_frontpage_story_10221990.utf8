                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Slash-and-cash stimulus
  - Centre cuts tax, spends more to help real estate and job-intensive units        JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                                
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has marked his takeover of the finance ministry by clearing an economic stimulus package aimed at shielding India from a deepening global economic crisis and creating jobs.        
	The proposals include beyond-the-budget expenditure of Rs 20,000 crore on infrastructure and pro-poor schemes and an across-the-board cut in central value added tax that will make cars, consumer durables and construction material cheaper. (See chart)        
	The government has decided to seek authorisation for additional planned expenditure of up Rs 20,000 crore in the current (financial) year, the Prime Ministers Office said.         
	The decision echoes similar stimulus packages announced abroad. US President-elect Barack Obama had yesterday unveiled the contours of his package, which looks set to unleash the largest public works programme in 60 years in America.        
	Under the mini-budget unveiled today, state-run banks are expected to announce soon a package for those seeking home loans up to Rs 20 lakh. The RBI will put in place a refinance facility worth Rs 4,000 crore for the housing sector.        
	Ailing export-led industries such as textiles and gems and jewellery will be given interest subsidy. These industries are labour-intensive and downturn-induced job losses could work against the government in the approaching election year.        
	Officials added that banks would also restructure loans to companies and real estate players, giving some relief to firms hit by cash shortages.         
	Government departments, which had been asked to refrain from buying new cars, will now be allowed to replace vehicles within the permitted budget. The permission is expected to help the auto industry that has been facing sluggish demand.        
	 Fresh investments in infrastructure should create fresh jobs here, said Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, who has emerged as the Prime Ministers point man on economic issues since P. Chidambaram was shifted to the home ministry.        
	The package will minimise the impact of weak global economy on the Indian economy.... (It should) make 7 per cent growth rate quite feasible, Ahluwalia added.        
	Industry reacted with cautious optimism, waiting for more incentives. The fiscal package is pointing in the right direction, but could have done even more of stimulation to increase the growth trajectory, said Amit Mitra, Ficci secretary general. We hope this is the first tranche and more needs to follow.        
	The government hinted at more steps if needed. The government will not hesitate to take any additional steps that may be needed to counter recessionary trends, the PMO said.        
	The extra spend, coupled with the tax giveaways that some officials said could lead to a revenue loss of Rs 8,700 crore in the next four months, will mean the government will end up borrowing more money.        
	But Ahluwalia refused to quantify the package. Its just a very good stimulus package, if you want one word for it, he said.

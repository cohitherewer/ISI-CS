                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AGP splinter groups   re-unite in Golaghat 
  - Mahanta begins second innings          SAMIR K. PURKAYASTHA                                                 
	Golaghat, Oct. 14: The small piece of paper that former chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta clutched in his hand was worth more than its face value. The receipt for Rs 2 was a price he was more than willing to pay to see the AGP as one once again.         
	The piece of paper was the amount he paid to become a member of the AGP after a hiatus of about three years. Minutes earlier, he had handed over the flag of the AGP (P) party, which he headed till then, to the AGP president Chandra Mohan Patowary, signifying the end of a long-drawn unification process.         
	Thunderous applause rent the air at the Bhrigu Kumar Phukan Khetra, the venue for the dual agenda of the day: celebration of the 23rd foundation day of the AGP and the unification. Thousands rejoiced and clapped in unison to the tune of the partys theme song.         
	The other big names in the states regional politics, Atul Bora, Pulakesh Barua, Biraj Sarma, Rekharani Das Boro, among others, followed suit.         
	The leaders jointly took the oath after the merger, pledging to rise above self-interest and take the state forward by implementing the Assam Accord and peacefully resolving the insurgency problem. Mahanta, in his speech, tried to defend the charges against him, saying his government had not endorsed any secret killings and that he had never encouraged any dynastic politics in the party as has been alleged.         
	Rolling out a long list of achievements during his tenure, Mahanta, however, sought forgiveness for his governments failure to fulfil the various aspirations of the people.         
	Taking an indirect dig at the AASU, Mahanta said as its president, it was he who had united the fragmented student body and made it a world renowned one. I expect the present leadership of the AASU to continue to play that role, he said.         
	 We had in the past failed to live up to the expectations of the people and we seek forgiveness for the mistake. Let us make a new beginning, rising above self interests, partypresident Patowary said amid statewide protests by the All Assam Students Union against Mahantas re-induction in the party.         
	Patowary hoped that there would be no further division in the party. Let there be no need for the party to form any more unification committees, he said.         
	The presidents plea, however, failed to convince many in the audience. Conspicuous by his absence was former president Brindaban Goswami, ousted from the presidentship last month.         
	To many, that was an ominous sign.         
	 The AASU, too, staged demonstrations and burnt effigies of Mahanta to protest his inclusion in the party.         
	The student body also raised black flags in various parts of the state, including near the venue of the programme.         
	But for once, the AASUs voice of dissent was marginalised by the overwhelming desire of the AGP workers to unite with their discarded leaders. Mahanta was welcomed back to the party with the loudest applause even as black smoke from burning effigies enveloped the sky over the southern corner of the field.

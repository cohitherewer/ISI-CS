	New Delhi, Jan. 9: Admissions to the National Defence Academy and the Indian Military Academy have plummeted to an all-time low with more than half the candidates selected for the courses that began this month preferring careers in the corporate world over a future in uniform. 
    
	Many candidates who cleared the written exam and the medical evaluation during the five-day tests of the Services Selection Boards chose not to enrol in the academies.
    
	They have found a career with a starting pay packet of Rs 14,000 a month too unattractive when graduates of IIMs and IITs begin with salaries of at least Rs 80,000 a month. 
    
	We are taking serious note of this. I hope there will be a much better deal for the services this year, defence minister A.K. Antony said today. 
    
	The armed forces have proposed salary hikes of two to two-and-a-half times their current wages to the Sixth Pay Commission. 
    
	Although the wide gap in salaries between the corporate world and the armed forces has been known for some time, it was felt in the government that the perks of an officers career  good golfing grounds, official accommodation and personal attendants  would compensate for the risks and the frequent transfers during a career in uniform. 
    
	The army says it is not willing to lower standards for recruitment that have remained the same for 30 years. 
    
	This is happening when the army has about 11,300 vacancies in its officer cadre. 
    
	At the National Defence Academy, near Pune, where candidates are selected after higher secondary, only 172 of the available 300 seats have been taken up. 
    
	NDA cadets go through a three-year degree course for all three armed forces after which they go into the Indian Military Academy, Air Force Academy or the Naval Academy for a year before being commissioned into the services. 
    
	At the IMA, which is celebrating its platinum jubilee this year, only 90 cadets have enrolled for the 250 available seats. 
    
	In comparison with engineering, medical and management institutes, this is dismal. The IIMs alone offer 1,500 seats a year and there is a huge waiting list for each of them. The IITs offer around 5,000 seats for engineering courses and the rush for them is choking. For medical courses, there is one all-India test (barring the AIIMS test) for 10,000 seats, and there is a demand for many more berths. 
    
	The army top brass is convinced that this desertion in droves by the youths is because of more lucrative opportunities in the corporate world.
    
	 The push factor from the forces is not limited to the entry level. Shortages in the officer cadre in the army have been a constant for the past 10 years. Last year, nearly 600 officers took premature retirement. There were about 1,100 such requests.
    
	This figure has been rising. In 2005, 341 officers quit the service; in 2006, the figure was 435.

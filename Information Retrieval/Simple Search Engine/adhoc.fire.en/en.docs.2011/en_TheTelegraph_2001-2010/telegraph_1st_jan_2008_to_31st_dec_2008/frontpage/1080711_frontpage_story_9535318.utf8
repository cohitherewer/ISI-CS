	New Delhi, July 10: The Supreme Court today allowed airlines operating in the country to revert for the time being to a 1992 rule that places additional workload on pilots.        
	The 1992 circular of the directorate-general of civil aviation (DGCA) requires pilots to put in a minimum of nine hours flight time within which they can be asked to carry out a maximum of three landings.         
	In 2007, a revised circular was issued limiting the maximum number of landings to two. The DGCA recently decided to re-enforce the 1992 circular, but the directive was stayed by Bombay High Court.        
	Till the matter will be heard (in Bombay), the existing flight schedule will operate, a Supreme Court bench said today. It also directed the high court to hear the case in the week commencing July 21 and dispose of the petition as soon as possible.        
	The lawyer appearing for associations representing pilots said the workload was reduced last year after taking into account factors such as air safety and fatigue. The 1992 rule (restored by civil aviation minister Praful Patel) had put air safety to peril, counsel Uday Lalit said. Air traffic has increased drastically since 1992 and pilots are under tremendous stress, he said.         
	The submission was opposed by the counsel for Jet Airways, one of the appellants, saying that in view of latest technology, stress could not be the ground to reduce the number of landings for pilots.        
	The high court had criticised the DGCA for following the dictates of Patel and increasing the workload of pilots at the behest of private airline operators.        
	Reacting to the Supreme Court directive today, a representative of the Joint Action Committee of Airlines Pilots Associations of India said: But the last word has not been said yet. The Supreme Court has just passed a stay order on a Bombay High Court order that slammed the DGCA for ordering a more hectic schedule for pilots. We will not like to comment on this till a final hearing comes.        
	In May, the civil aviation ministry junked the easy roster following representations from various airlines struggling with pilot shortage. The airlines said that the two- landing guideline pushed up demand for pilots by 35 per cent.        
	Indian pilots fly between 45 and 70 hours a month, whereas those abroad clock around 80 to 90 hours, industry sources said. But the DGCA wants to phase out foreign pilots from India.        
	But Indian pilots say most foreign pilots on domestic airlines are paid much more than them. The airlines actually want to get Indian pilots to fly the same 80 hours as foreign pilots but for lower salaries, said the representative from the joint action committee.

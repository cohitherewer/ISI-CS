          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 23: The three suspected bombers arrested in Jammu had spent two full days in Bengal guided by two local contacts, most of it in a rented apartment in Kamarhati on Calcuttas northern fringes, Bengal police said.        
	A police source said the trio had crossed the India-Bangladesh border at Habibpur in Malda on December 16, and taken the night train from Malda station with a local guide who is yet to be identified. The four men reached Calcutta on December 17 morning.        
	Their city-based helper put them up in a rented single-storey apartment in Kamarhati, which they left on December 18 afternoon to catch the Jammu Tawi Express from Chitpur station, the source added.        
	A police officer said the Bangladesh-based Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami had positioned several linkmen in Calcutta a long time ago, and they helped operatives of whichever outfit used the city as a transit point.         
	The trio must have used one of them, said the officer from the special task force (STF), set up recently to combat terrorist activities in Calcutta.        
	The Jammu and Kashmir police version of the trios route to Jammu goes like this:        
	In September, they flew from Karachi to Dhaka where they stayed with Nadeem, a Punjabi-speaking handler. Later they travelled, probably by bus, in a zigzag route to Khulna and then Rajshahi.        
	On December 16, they left their Rajshahi hideout and walked a few kilometres before taking an hour-long taxi ride to reach the Malda border. A tout accompanied them in Bangladesh, Jammu inspector-general K. Rajendra told The Telegraph over phone.         
	Various branches of Bengal police today looked busy after the news from Jammu arrived.         
	There is no specific information about the exact location of the house where they took refuge, an STF officer said. A police team from J amp;K is expected soon.        
	Well scan every house (in Kamarhati) where rooms were rented out, a state Intelligence Branch official said.        
	We sent a team to Belgharia police station (closest to Kamarhati) to get a map of the locality, said an officer of the special operations group (SoG) of the criminal investigation department (CID).        
	We are trying to find out whether any tenant has gone missing from the area. Well also check new tenants backgrounds.        
	STF officers have asked the railways for the reservation list for Thursdays Himgiri Express from Howrah and Jammu Tawi Express from Chitpur.

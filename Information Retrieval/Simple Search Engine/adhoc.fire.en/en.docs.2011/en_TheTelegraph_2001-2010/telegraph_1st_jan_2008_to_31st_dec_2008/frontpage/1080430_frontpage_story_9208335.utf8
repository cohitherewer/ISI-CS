	Rio de Janeiro, April 29: Brazilian police are investigating allegations by three transvestites that Ronaldo, the Brazilian football star and AC Milan forward, threatened to harm them after he took them to a Rio de Janeiro motel.        
	Police said they were also looking into an accusation by the 31-year-old player that one of the three men tried to extort 50,000 reais (15,000) in return for not telling the media about the incident.        
	Ronaldo, who is in his hometown recovering from an injury, left a nightclub in the Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood early yesterday with three call girls, only to find out at the motel that they were men, according to authorities.        
	He then offered each of them 1,000 reais (300) to keep quiet, but only two of the men accepted his offer, police said.        
	I have to check both sides of the story, the transvestites version and Ronaldos, Carlos Augusto Nogueira, chief of the police precinct investigating the incident, told a news conference. Ronaldo said he is not good in the head and that he is going through psychological problems because of his recent surgery he said.        
	In a statement, Ronaldo said he was a victim of extortion and would take all possible steps to clear his name, according to the Globo television website. Representatives for Ronaldo were not immediately available for comment.        
	The three-time World Player of the Year suffered a career-threatening knee injury in February in a match against Italian club side Livorno. Ronaldo suffered a similar injury in his right knee when playing for Inter Milan in 2000.

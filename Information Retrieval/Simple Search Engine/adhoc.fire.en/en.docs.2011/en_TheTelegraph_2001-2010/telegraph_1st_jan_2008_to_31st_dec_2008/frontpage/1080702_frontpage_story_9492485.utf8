          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, July 1: The pro-peace companies of Ulfas 28 battalion today rejected any possibility of surrender, a term laid down by the government for any ceasefire-bound militant group.         
	Moon Borah, alias Jiten Dutta, one of the Ulfa leaders who offered ceasefire on June 24, today told The Telegraph that there was no question of depositing their weapons as they had not surrendered and would need the arms for their own security.         
	We are not going to go amidst our own people surrounded by police who may be deployed for our security if we were to deposit our weapons, said Borah.         
	The Alpha and Charlie companies of the 28 battalion formally moved Dispur on the truce last Sunday.        
	Borah said the state police headquarters today confirmed receiving the formal declaration of ceasefire.         
	We have been told that the government would get back to us in the next couple of days, he said, adding that they have already prepared the modalities for the ceasefire pact.         
	The cadres of the two companies of the 28 battalion have been put up at a camp in Sadiya subdivision of Tinsukia district.         
	Borah said the leaders of the two companies were already in touch with other battalions and were trying to persuade them to join the ceasefire declaration.         
	There have been certain developments and we will discuss these with the government when we meet, he said, not willing to disclose any more details.         
	The ex-Bodo Liberation Tigers Welfare Society today welcomed the ceasefire offered by the two companies of Ulfas 28 battalion, terming it as a bold step that would help to bring peace in the state.         
	They also urged the top Ulfa leaders to come overground for a peaceful negotiation.         
	Borahs declaration on the groups unwillingness to surrender came on a day when the outfits talks facilitator, Mamoni Raisom Goswami, told Dispur that she had never espoused the cause of a sovereign Assam, Ulfas primary objective.         
	She was replying to chief minister Tarun Gogois explain your stand on the sovereignty issue yesterday.         
	Had it been so, I would not have intervened for a peaceful resolution of the Assam imbroglio, she said.         
	Goswami said she had spelt out her stand during news conferences and at various forums.         
	I will do so again for the information of all. I have never ever sought sovereignty for Assam anywhere in the world. I want to see an Assam that is free from political corruption, free from economic, cultural, social and financial exploitation, Goswami said.         
	I am sure the chief minister, too, dreams of a similar Assam as does the common man, she said.

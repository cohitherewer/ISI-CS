	New Delhi, Dec. 16: The question after probing question fired at Chand Mohammad and Fiza today were unsparing, but the couple survived the trial by media.        
	The woman for whom Chand lost his chair showed flashes of her training as a lawyer when she counter-questioned a reporter who told her to recite a verse from the Quran if he could reel one off from his scripture.        
	You look like a Hindu. Can you recite the Hanuman Chalisa? Fiza shot back when the reporter told the couple, who had turned Muslim to marry, to prove their faith.        
	Do not bring religion into everything, she continued angrily, her husband looking on uneasily at the raging war of words.        
	The missing couple had surfaced some 10 days ago and announced on TV that they had converted to Islam and married. Chand, 43, has two children by first wife Seema and Fiza, 35, is a divorcee.        
	Chand was sacked as Haryana deputy chief minister soon after the news broke. Fiza was fired as the assistant advocate-general.        
	Today, at an event at Delhi Press Club, neither showed signs of any regret. For love, I can sacrifice everything, Chand said, appearing the milder of the two.        
	Nettled by a journalist on whether he had converted only because Islam allows a man to take four wives, he merely said: From childhood, I was inclined towards Islam.        
	If he was so keen, why did he delay his conversion so long?        
	My timing is my personal choice, he replied, opting not to answer whether he intended to take a third and a fourth wife.        
	Fiza gave her reply a more philosophical spin. Parmeswar (God) or Allah comes into ones life first and then people, she said.        
	Another reporter then fired the obvious question: What came into their lives first --- Allah or love? The couple replied that they did namaaz every day.        
	Fiza claimed she had not done any injustice to Seema as she still respects her. Chand said he was trying to meet Sonia Gandhi to explain why he had re-married.        
	Fiza, who answered most of the questions on her husbands behalf, suddenly went meek when asked if she would enter politics. It is up to my husband. If he allows me, I will surely do so.

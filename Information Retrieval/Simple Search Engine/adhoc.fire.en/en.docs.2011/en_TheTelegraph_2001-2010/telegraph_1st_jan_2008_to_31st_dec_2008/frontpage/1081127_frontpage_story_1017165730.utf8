(AP)      Mumbai, Nov.27 (PTI); 04.25 PM (IST): Commandos today stormed two luxury hotels -Taj and Trident (Oberoi)- to end the overnight siege laid by the unspecified number of heavily-armed terrorists even as the death toll in the synchronised attacks at 10 places across the city rose to 101, including nine foreigners.  The commando action triggered intense gun-fights and loud explosions at the two hotels where over 100 people are held hostage or trapped.

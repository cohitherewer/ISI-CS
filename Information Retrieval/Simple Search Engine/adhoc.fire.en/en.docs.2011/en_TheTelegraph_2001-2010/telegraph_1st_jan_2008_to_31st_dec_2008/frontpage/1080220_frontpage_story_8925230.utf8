	Rawalpindi, Feb. 19: The Pakistani voter has handed President Pervez Musharraf a stunning rebuff and set the stage for a power struggle between his presidency and a parliament that is now dominated by adversaries keen to cut him down to size.        
	A sullen silence fell over Army House, the resplendent Pindi residence President Musharraf retained even after casting off his uniform, this morning and, as the streets woke to drumbeats and crackers, you could hear authority rumbling away.        
	The PPP and Nawaz Sharifs PML rallied widespread disenchantment against the Musharraf regime to grab more than half of the 272 National Assembly seats.        
	The Musharraf-backed PML(Q) was routed, many of its leading lights blown in the anti-incumbency blizzard.        
	Party boss Chaudhary Shujaat Hussain was humbled on his Gujrat homeground, and railway minister and key Musharraf crony Ahmed Rashid was trounced in two Rawalpindi constituencies. Former foreign minister Khurshid Ahmed Kasuri and Speaker of the outgoing National Assembly Amir Hussein fell to lesser opponents.        
	President Musharraf himself was left cradling the unlikely consolation prize of honest conductor; contrary to fears, the verdict ran close to popular mood and, in a rarity for Pakistan, has been accepted by parties across the board. Western diplomats who met President Musharraf this morning reported that he appeared reconciled to the slap in his face and reiterated his willingness to work with the new government.        
	But as frenzied celebrations broke out at camp offices of the PPP and the PML(N) across the country, formidable prospects confronted the victors: they must now not only cobble a credible and stable alliance, they must also prepare to take on President Musharraf in order to effect the mandate for restoration of democracy.                 
	De facto PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, widely seen as an unscrupulous dealmaker, has been circumspect on spelling out future strategy, but co-victor Nawaz Sharif was forthright on his agendas bottomline.        
	The Constitution will have to be restored, all unconstitutional steps taken by the President during the Emergency will have to be rolled back and the independent judiciary restored, there is no compromise on any of this, he said in Lahore.        
	It is known that Zardari is not taking as hard a position on the restoration of disbanded judges.        
	Zardari spoke briefly to the media after a daylong meeting with party seniors and said the PPP had come to no decision about who would be Prime Minister. He hinted at a consensus government but gave no clues to how he was approaching it.         
	Significantly, he would not be drawn into any commitment on reinstating judges dismissed by Musharraf  a demand made forcefully by Sharif. Zardaris reluctance on rolling back Emergency-era decisions may become a stumbling block in alliance formation with Sharif.        
	Zardari said he would not make any deal with people from the previous government, which does not necessarily mean Musharraf who is still in power.        
	But pressure from Zardaris own ranks to use the mandate to neutralise Musharraf might be mounting.        
	Reflecting the urgent mood in the party, Bushra Ahsan, wife of incarcerated PPP leader Aitzaz Ahsan, told The Telegraph: The verdict is clear, President Musharraf has to go and democracy has to be fully restored.        
	Asked to spell out what that might mean, she said: Clearly, President Musharraf has to be impeached, the constitution and the judiciary have to be reinstated and democracy restored to its rightful place, that is what the people want.        
	Impeaching the President may not be easy, though; his adversaries dont have a two-thirds majority, they are not even agreed they should push so far so fast. Our experience with democracy in this country has been bitter, Presidents enjoy huge powers and the army has often come into play, said a senior Sharif aide. It may not be prudent to open too many fronts too soon. The immediate task is to form a government of reconciliation and give the people a sense that their vote has not been in vain.         
	The shape and leadership of the future government is tough to predict yet but most observers feel that the PPP and Sharif will have to join hands if it is to be stable.        
	Will they, wont they? Nobodys saying.                     
	Zardari is playing with his cards closed, Sharif said he would begin discussions on government only on Thursday.         
	But hectic back-channel confabulations are on, and typical of hung verdicts in our parts, there is no end of permutations and combinations being worked out.        
	Both the PPP and Nawaz Sharif are making public noises about a government of reconciliation  We will not fly solo, said victorious PPP leader and former National Assembly Speaker, Yusuf Raza Geelani  but contrary manoeuvres are in play.                     
	The Sharif camp has indicated it was gratuitous of the PPP to be offering to take them on board. This victory is as much ours as the PPPs, said a PML(N) leader who would not be quoted as his party has not taken an official stand. Why should we not lead this coalition? Sharif is a former prime minister, the PPP does not have one in its ranks.        
	Sources in the PPP hinted Zardari may be trying to outflank Sharif by attempting a government with the lesser parties like the MQM(19) and ANP (10) and Independents (28). The numbers could make a majority but they may not add up to a stable government.        
	Besides, said a retired official who worked with Benazir Bhutto, leaving Sharif out of a government of national consensus will run against the mandate, he has got fewer numbers but he has done better than the PPP, he has been a strong factor in making this mandate what it is. A government minus him will be a government weakened from the start.        
	But ask around the streets of Pakistan and youll find opinion tainted even in this jubilant hour by past letdowns. Things will change, inshallah, said a trader in Rawalpindi as he dusted out an old portrait of Sharif to adorn his show-window. But it is true our leaders have made a mess of mandates in the past, it is not unlikely they will not be able hang together for too long.         
	President Musharraf, lonely and demoralised as he watches the nation celebrate his humiliation, may be looking for just that kind of schism to regain centrestage.

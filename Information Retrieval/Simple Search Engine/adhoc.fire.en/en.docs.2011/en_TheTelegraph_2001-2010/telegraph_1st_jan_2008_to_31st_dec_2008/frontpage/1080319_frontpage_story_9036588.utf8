          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 18: India and China have pencilled their first-ever agreement to mutually recognise higher education degrees, allowing unhindered flow of students across the Himalayas. But the current Tibet crisis may delay the pact.        
	The human resource development ministry and Chinas education ministry are finalising the text of an agreement that will bring equivalence between degrees offered by the neighbours.        
	Officials from the two countries are currently studying a draft agreement. But sources said the latest round of talks has been put on hold because of the turbulence in Tibet.        
	The deal will open India as a market competing with the West for Chinese students, who form the largest chunk of foreign students in the world.        
	It will also bring relief to thousands of Indian students who go each year to study in China but return to find that their degrees are either not recognised or considered below par in India.         
	The deal will elevate ties with China in higher education to a status India shares with neither the US nor the UK. Indian degrees are not considered equivalent to corresponding ones offered in the US or the UK. Australia accepts Indian degrees as equivalent to its own, but the two countries do not have an agreement similar to the one India is signing with China.        
	According to the draft text, India and China will each assign a nodal body the responsibility for preparing and maintaining a list of all recognised higher education institutions in their countries. The lists can be updated, and will be shared regularly.        
	A graduate from any of the listed institutes in India (or China) can apply for a post-graduate course in China (or India) at a listed institute.        
	The same equivalence will hold true for postgraduates applying for doctoral studies. PhD degrees will be considered equivalent across the two countries.         
	Initially, the list will include institutes teaching the arts, social sciences, sciences, technology, engineering, agriculture and veterinary sciences. In the next stage, we will include management and medicine, an Indian official said.

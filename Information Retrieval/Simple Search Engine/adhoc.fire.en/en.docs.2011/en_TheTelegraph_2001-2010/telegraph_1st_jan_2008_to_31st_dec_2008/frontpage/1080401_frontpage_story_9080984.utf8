The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Greed and graft glare on ranks
                                                                                                           Greed and graft glare on ranks
          JAYANTH JACOB                            Prakash Karat at the CPM congress on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Coimbatore, March 31: The party of the poor has hit out at greed, corruption and lavish living  by its own members.        
	One of the CPM party congresss worries is how to get some comrades to shed the ways of the rich and the grasping.        
	The draft political organisation report says the party, which launched a rectification campaign in 1996, will start another. It cites instances to explain why this is necessary.        
	CPM workers in Bengal, the report says, live in an atmosphere marked by self-centredness, greed, consumerism, jealously, etc. The party has blamed such traits on the philosophy of globalisation.        
	(The) communist morality of the party workers is under attack through enticement of different forms, the report says.         
	Besides, some party cadres follow (the) caste system and some the dowry system.        
	The report goes on to cite how some members organise lavish birthday parties or weddings, buy costly gifts or observe religious ceremonies. These it dubs the temptations of the present bourgeois-semi-feudal order.        
	Many leaders and workers are guilty of financial irregularities. That a manager of Deshabhimani, the party mouthpiece in Kerala, could take a bribe of Rs 1 crore is proof how corrupt degeneration can creep in, the report says.        
	It mentions corruption among the partys Khammam district leaders. This includes collection of money and bourgeois lifestyle, the report says.        
	There are also complaints that the assets of certain party members are disproportionate to their known sources of income. The party had already issued guidelines that party leaders and mass organisation leaders should submit a statement of income and assets. Although the statements of income are filed, the assessment of the statements by the appropriate party committee is not taking place.        
	Heat on allies        
	 The CPM feels it needs to take on its partners politically and ideologically.        
	The CPMs draft political organisation report, which its general secretary Prakash Karat presented to the party congress this evening, says the reaction of allies to the events in Singur and Nandigram and differences over special economic zones (SEZ) have contributed to strains on Left unity in Bengal.         
	The report points out that after the March 14 police firing in Nandigram, all over the country, there was confusion and misgivings among Left-minded intellectuals and supporters. The stand of the RSS and Forward Bloc on a number of issues needs to be countered politically and ideologically.        
	The issues on which the allies had taken a different stand are explained in the report.        
	The Forward Bloc and the RSP began public criticism of the government and the party after the January 3, 2007, incident in Nandigram. With the March 14 firing, these issues became more acute, says the document.         
	The draft report also singles out the RSP and the Forward Bloc when referring to the SEZ policy. On special economic zones, though the Left parties submitted a note suggesting amendments to the act and changes in the rules, later the RSP and the Forward Bloc stated that they are totally opposed to SEZs being set up.

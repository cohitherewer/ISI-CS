	Ranchi, Sept. 29: The judiciary has stepped in to monitor the rural employment scheme, whose architect Jean Drez rates Jharkhand as the worst among states implementing the UPA governments flagship job programme.        
	The states 32 lakh rural job card holders will be relieved to know that the Jharkhand State Legal Services Authority (Jhalsa), an arm of the Jharkhand High Court, will monitor the implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS).        
	And to finalise the modalities of overseeing the programme, the National Legal Services Authority (Nalsa) will hold a convention at New Delhis Vigyan Bhavan on October 2 in association with the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee and the Supreme Court Middle Income Group Legal Aid Society.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, activist Aruna Roy and heads of legal services authorities will be among those who would be participating from across the country.        
	Welcoming the initiative, Drez  he and Roy are among the members of the Central Employment Guarantee Council  maintained the tremendous potential of NREGA was in danger of being wasted due to corruption. The embezzlement has deprived millions of people of employment and wages, and thereby, of their constitutional right to life, he said.        
	During his social audit of the scheme in Jharkhand, Dreze had categorically declared that Jharkhand was the worst in implementing NREGA. Also, two NREGA activists were murdered in the state for raising their voice against corruption within the system.         
	While Lalit Mehta was killed on May 26 in Palamau, Kameshwar Yadav was killed on June 18 in Koderma. Also, an NREGA card holder, Tapas Soren, immolated himself in Hazaribagh on July 2 to protest against official harassment. Drze said all these issues needed to be addressed urgently if NREGA was to survive as it was being implemented in a dangerous vacuum in the state.        
	Private contractors, or quasi-contractors such as the so-called labhuk samitis (beneficiary committees) are virtually controlling the implementation in the absence of panchayats. But private contractors work for profit, and the only way to make profit from NREGA is to cheat. So, corruption is built into the system, he said.        
	Under the Legal Services Act, 1987, NALSA is mandated to take steps to educate weaker sections of society about the rights, benefits and privileges guaranteed by social welfare legislations and other enactments as well as administrative programmes and measures.

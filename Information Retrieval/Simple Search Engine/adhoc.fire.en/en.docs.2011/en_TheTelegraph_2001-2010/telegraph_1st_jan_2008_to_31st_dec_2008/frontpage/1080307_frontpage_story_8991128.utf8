The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Morcha ready for last war
                                                                                                           Morcha ready for last war
  - Gurung warns against ignored state cry        NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                     
	New Delhi, March 6: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has warned that if its demands go unheeded, the movement for Gorkhaland might spiral into something more than a call for statehood.         
	Morcha president Bimal Gurung also dismissed the suggestion of a parliamentary committee that Union Territory status be conferred on the hills. This (the demand for Gorkhaland) is our last war, I have told the people, he said.         
	Gurung, who met a host of political leaders, including UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, here today said the Bengal government should utilise the community living in the hills and in return, give it its due.         
	We have been staying in a sensitive zone for years. Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh and China border our land and for more than 100 years, we have been guarding Mother India. Now is the time for correct decision, otherwise there might be problems later, Gurung told The Telegraph in an interview.         
	Having started the agitation for Gorkhaland afresh, almost two decades after the GNLF led by Subash Ghisingh had launched it in the eighties, the Morcha leader hinted that the call for something beyond statehood quot; might not be far away if the current demand is ignored. He, however, refused to elaborate on beyond statehood.         
	Ghisingh, who later settled for autonomy under the DGHC and more recently for the Sixth Schedule status for the Darjeeling hills, has been branded a traitor by the Morcha. Gurungs party has been against the special status, the bill on which was stalled in the Lok Sabha after the parliamentary panel recommended a review. As things stand now, the bill is most likely to be withdrawn.        
	Sources in the Morcha delegation, which met Sonia and Opposition leader L.K. Advani, said they believe that the Centre might not push for the Sixth Schedule bill. Yesterday, Gurung had asked Union home minister Shivraj Patil, who had introduced the bill in Parliament, to withdraw it.         
	Asked why the people of the hills were opposing the memorandum of settlement to grant special status more than two years after it was signed, Gurung said fear of Ghisingh had played a key role then. The Morcha leader accused the GNLF chief of having masterminded the murder of C.K. Pradhan, another advocate of Gorkhaland.         
	He warned Ghisingh against entering Darjeeling before he resigned as caretaker administrator of the DGHC. Even after that, his security in Darjeeling would be the state governments responsibility.         
	The Morcha will send 60,000 letters to Gorkha soldiers in the military and paramilitary forces posted across the country and ask them to support the statehood cause.         
	Gurung had yesterday addressed a gathering of Gorkha ex-servicemen from the hills at Jantar Mantar. We will tell them that for years you have sacrificed for Mother India but not got justice: now is the time to fight for Gorkhaland.         
	Keeping in mind the sensitive nature of the region, it may not be long before the Maoists start influencing the vulnerable groups, the Morcha leader warned.         
	However, Gurung, insisted that the Morcha movement was democratic in nature. He said more than 1,200 people were killed during the Gorkhaland agitation in the eighties, but nobody wants anymore deaths.

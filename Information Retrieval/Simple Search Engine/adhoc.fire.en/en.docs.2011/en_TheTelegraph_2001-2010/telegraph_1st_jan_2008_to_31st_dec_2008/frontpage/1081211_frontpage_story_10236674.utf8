          OUR BUREAU                              
	Hamiltongonj/Darjeeling, Dec. 10: More than 40 people were injured when supporters of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha in Jalpaiguris Hamiltongonj clashed with those who are against the demand for a separate state, provoking the party to call a 12-hour bandh in the hills, the Terai and the Dooars tomorrow.         
	The Morcha claimed that 27 of its members were injured, including three women who were hospitalised. Police said 16 of its men were hurt.         
	The trouble broke out at 10am today when around 300 Morcha supporters came to the Kalchini block development office at Hamiltongonj, 30km from Alipurduar town, and locked it up. The office of the panchayat samiti nearby was also shut down. The protesters stood in front of the two offices holding Morcha flags and shouting pro-Gorkhaland slogans.        
	Around the same time, a separate group of Morcha supporters who had marched to the Latabari gram panchayat office, 2km from Hamiltongonj, was confronted by people opposed to Gorkhaland. The statehood agitators were told to leave and when they refused, a scuffle broke out.         
	The Morcha group, consisting mostly of women, trickled back to Hamiltongonj. As news of the scuffle reached the Kalchini block office, both groups armed with sticks and stones, geared up for a showdown.         
	The local Morcha men pelted the Kalchini BDO office with stones, prompting retaliation. Soon brickbats started raining down on the Morcha supporters.        
	Around 12 noon, extra police forces were brought in from Alipurduar, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri and the warring groups were kept at bay till they dispersed at 4.30pm after district magistrate Vandana Yadav arrived with police superintendent Manoj Verma.         
	The police lathicharged and burst four tear-gas shells to disperse the mob. Zulfikar Hasan, the deputy inspector-general of police (north Bengal), later said: The situation is under control and Section 144 has been imposed in the area. We had to go for a mild lathicharge.        
	The additional superintendent of police of Alipurduar, Sabyasachi Raman Mishra, said: Sixteen policemen, including myself, were injured. All of us were given first aid and released.        
	In Darjeeling, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri, while announcing the bandh, blamed the CPM, RSP and the members of the Jana Jagaran Mancha for orchestrating the attack on his party supporters.         
	Our supporters in Kalchini had brought out a rally in support of the ongoing strike in government offices when they were attacked unprovoked. Twenty-seven of our supporters, including three women, have been badly injured and 12 houses damaged in the stone-throwing, claimed Giri.        
	He said the state government was trying to create a rift between the Morcha and others, including the Adivasis. The incident at Kalchini today only reaffirms our demand for Gorkhaland. We will wait till 6pm tomorrow and if the culprits are not arrested by then, we will announce a fresh agitation, Giri said.        
	A number of central committee members were already on their way to Kalchini to take care of the injured.         
	We have heard that several of the injured who have been taken to the Alipurduar subdivisional hospital are in serious condition, Giri said.        
	The Morcha has called for a total shutdown tomorrow. Traffic on NH31A, the road that connects Sikkim with the rest of the country, is likely to be affected.

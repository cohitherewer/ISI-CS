The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Singur enters Beijing class
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Singur enters Beijing class
          ASHIS CHAKRABARTI                            Nano: Textbook case                                  
	Beijing, Nov. 23: There were 18 students  all mid-career business journalists of Xinhua, Chinas official news agency. The teacher: Martin Mulligan of the Financial Times, London. Lesson for the day: Identifying winners and losers: Tata Motors in Bengal.        
	That was last week in the Xinhua office in Beijing. At the end of the day, the students write a business/trade feature of at least 500 words about Tata Motors in West Bengal.        
	The Nano didnt roll out of Singur. But the controversy over the stillborn project seems to be rolling far and wide. Just last month, Mulligan used the same model in another workshop for journalists he conducted in Sofia, Bulgaria. The contrasts between the responses of his students in Beijing and Sofia could surprise both Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee.        
	In communist Beijing, the journalist-students had more sympathy for Mamata. The consensus in Mulligans class was that higher compensation to landlosers in Singur at an earlier stage could have saved the project. In other words, the communist scribes didnt think the Marxist government in Bengal had done enough to carry the farmers on its side.        
	In Sofia, the response was more sophisticated, Mulligan tells me over cups of green tea at the lounge of a Beijing hotel. The Bulgarians were more sympathetic to the Bengal chief minister and blamed Mamatas cynical politics to exploit Singur in order to regain lost political ground.         
	But why did he choose the Nano story for his workshops? Mulligan says he had two broad reasons. One: the international focus on Nano, slated to be historys cheapest car. Here is a car thats on offer for just the price of the stereo system of a Mercedes. Thats simply fantastic.        
	The other reason is the widely varying kinds of reporting of the story in the international media. In his class in Beijing  hes at Xinhua on a Thomson Foundation assignment  Mulligan gave the examples of three British papers  The Guardian (sympathetic to Singur farmers), Evening Standard (absolutely Right-wing, pro-business) and Financial Times (more balanced).              
	Theres a third reason that the Lex columns story on Singur mentioned back in August. Tata Motors difficulties in West Bengal, a state of more than 80m people, it said, reflect the real obstacles to industrialisation in many densely populated and poor regions.        
	The Bengal story resonated with Mulligans Beijing students more than it did with the ones in Sofia. The Chinese students found two things particularly relevant to their own country. First, Chinas vehicle market is the second largest in the world after the US. Even as top executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler beg the US Congress for a $25 billion bailout, GMs China sales grew by 10.2 per cent in the first nine months of this year. Last year, vehicle sales in China soared by 22 per cent to 8.8 million.        
	Little wonder Chinas automobile industry watched the Singur developments with interest. Actually, the curiosity over the Nanos fate went beyond the industry. Two weeks ago, a travel agent at Datong, the city in central China famous for its 1,500-year-old Buddhist grottos, asked me about the Nano when he learnt I was from India. His enthusiasm turned intense when he learnt I was actually from the land of the Nanos aborted birth.        
	But to get back to Chinas other reason for intense Nano-watch. The country has been facing increasing, larger and often violent protests by farmers against acquisition of farmland by the government or property dealers. Only last week, one such protest led to a mob attacking government office buildings in an eastern city. Although land belongs to the state in China, farmers enjoy contracted rights over their plots. The contracts which lasted 30 years were extended to 70 years under the new rural reforms initiated by the government last month.        
	Mulligan, however, had another lesson for his Beijing students. Supplementary to the first lesson was another project  he asked his students to write a company results report for Tata Motors a few years after the Nano actually rolls out of its new factory in Gujarat. That futuristic story, hopefully one of success, could make Singur, and Bengal, rue the loss yet again.

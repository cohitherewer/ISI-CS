          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: Indias central universities are preparing to reopen admissions in the middle of an academic session for the first time, with the Centre relenting under Supreme Court pressure to fill vacant OBC quota seats.        
	The human resource development ministry has asked all centrally funded higher education institutions to independently draft plans for mid-session admissions, top government officials said.         
	The ministry has called a special meeting of all central higher education institutions on November 10 to prepare a roadmap for filling the vacant seats, sources said.        
	The fresh admissions  for the academic session 2008-09  could throw open nearly 5,000 seats lying vacant in colleges and universities funded by the Centre.        
	Never before have all central higher education institutions across India faced the prospect of such mid-session admissions.        
	But the vacant quota seats will not be directly offered to general category students, as has been sought by appellants before the Supreme Court, a senior HRD ministry official said.        
	They will first be offered to OBC candidates who meet new creamy layer guidelines issued recently. Only those seats that still remain vacant will be offered to general category students, the official said.         
	The HRD ministry has already sent copies of the notification on the new creamy layer guidelines, as well as the Supreme Courts directive to fill vacant seats, to all centrally funded institutes, the official added.        
	We were earlier planning to seek a clarification from the Supreme Court, citing the difficulties universities will face in reopening admissions mid-session. But now we will try and fill the seats wherever possible, another HRD ministry source said.        
	The Centre may, however, seek exemption for the IITs from the fresh admission process, citing their semester system of examinations that makes it hard for students joining late to catch up, other sources indicated.        
	The IIMs have no vacant OBC seats this year.         
	The IITs have two semesters a year, with several tests, quizzes and assignments  all contributing to a students final score  within a semester. Most of the first semester is already over.        
	At the IITs, it would be next to impossible for students joining now to catch up with the rest of the class, an IIT director said.        
	The IITs together have 20 vacant OBC seats.        
	Other central universities are also expected to highlight the difficulties in filling the vacant quota seats at the November 10 meeting.         
	At Delhi University, 2,023 OBC quota seats are lying vacant, according to varsity officials.

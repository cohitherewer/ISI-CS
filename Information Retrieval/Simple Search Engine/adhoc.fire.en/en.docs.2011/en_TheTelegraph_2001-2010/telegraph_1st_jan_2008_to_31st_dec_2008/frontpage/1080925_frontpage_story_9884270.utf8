  - St Bedes in financial trouble          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR                            Preity Zinta                                              
	Shimla, Sept. 24: The college that gave Bollywood Preity Zinta is facing closure.        
	The troubles for St Bedes College, one of the countrys oldest womens colleges, began when Himachal Pradeshs BJP government cut grants two years back following a court order that asked the state to provide equal assistance to all private aided institutions.        
	St Bedes, established in 1904, has had its grants reduced from 95 per cent to 50 per cent of its expenses. We have been running on loans. Were helpless and cannot run this institution on loans any more. Our Delhi provincial (administrative office) has asked us to draw up plans for closure, principal Molly Abraham said.        
	The government said it was bound by a 2006 high court ruling on equal grants. St Bedes was one of the four private colleges getting 95 per cent grants in aid since 1994. The court directed the state to disburse grants on an equitable basis. We are bound by this ruling, education minister I.D. Dhiman said.         
	Most colleges received 50 per cent grants but exceptions were made by previous governments to give some more. Most such decisions were taken by Congress chief minister Virbhadra Singh, who ruled the state for several years and whose wife Pratibha is from St Bedes. Any closure, however, can take place only after March 2009, when the current academic session ends.        
	Other than Preity, who had graduated in 1993-94, the other old students include Anjana Kuthiala, 1975 Miss India and painter, and Parneet Kaur, wife of former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh.         
	The closure moves have shocked ex-students. Institutions like St Bedes are a national heritage. The decision to close this legendary college could be disastrous, said Pratibha Singh. Some have suggested a fee hike as a solution. The college authorities can raise fees easily to bail out the institution, Ritul, an ex-student, said.        
	Principal Abraham, however, ruled out an increase in fees, saying it would go against the colleges objective of offering affordable education.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jamshedpur, March 22: After 48 hours since former district judge R.P. Ravi was shot at and injured by unidentified gunmen, the police said they will come to a conclusion in another two days.         
	Superintendent of police Naveen Kumar Singh said the police would be in a position to say something conclusively as to who all were involved behind the attack in the next two days. We have interrogated several suspects, but nothing concrete has come out so far. We are working on the little clue we have got to the incident, but it requires some more time before it could be clear, said Singh.

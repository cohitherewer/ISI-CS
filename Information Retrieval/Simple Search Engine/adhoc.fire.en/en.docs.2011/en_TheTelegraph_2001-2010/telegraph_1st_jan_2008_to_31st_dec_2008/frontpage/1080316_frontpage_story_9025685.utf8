The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tea worker foils Ulfa plan, pays with life
                                                                                                           Tea worker foils Ulfa plan, pays with life
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, March 15: A temporary worker of a small tea garden in Upper Assam paid with his life when he refused to lure his employer into an abduction trap laid by Ulfa in the wee hours today.        
	It was 1am and 48-year-old Ratiya Gaur was fast asleep in the office-cum-residence of Mayuri tea estate at Borpathar in Golaghat district when he was jolted awake by a knock on the door.        
	He and co-worker Netro Phukan, who works as an accountant in the tea estate and also stays at the gardens office-cum-residence, went to find out who was calling them.        
	When they opened the door, they were confronted by a group of five Ulfa militants.         
	The rebels pushed Phukan back in the office and then asked Gaur to call the owner of the garden, Kartik Saikia, over a mobile phone they carried and tell him to come to the office. Saikia stays in Golaghat town, 40km from the garden.         
	When Gaur refused, they shot him dead from point blank range, Golaghat superintendent of police P.K. Saloi told The Telegraph over phone.        
	The motive was clearly abduction for ransom. The employee lost his life because he refused to obey (the Ulfa diktat), a Borpathar police official said.        
	The rebels took away Phukans mobile before leaving. He later told the police that the militants had come on two motorcycles.        
	The incident, which comes a day before Ulfas army day, is being seen as yet another act of defiance by the common man against militants, a trend which has been growing across the state in recent times.        
	A district administration official said Gaurs family  his widow and son  would be paid a compensation of Rs 5 lakh. The administration is likely to announce an ex gratia tomorrow.        
	Gaur hailed from Kocharighat, about 48 km from the garden, and had joined the tea estate just six months ago.        
	Saikia was not available for comment, but according to the police, he said he had not received any extortion demand from Ulfa.         
	The outfit is active in the district and one of its activists was killed in an encounter with security forces near the tea estate recently.        
	Mayuri tea estate, covering around 100 bighas, is among the nearly 5,000 small tea gardens which have sprung up in Golaghat district. Assam has about 50,000 small tea-growers, whose numbers have steadily increased over the past few years.        
	The garden does not own a factory and only sells green leaf to factories. It employs around 20 workers, all on a temporary basis, who come from different parts of the district.        
	The Assam Tea Tribes Students Association (ATTSA), an apex body of the tea community, demanded adequate compensation for Gaurs family.        
	The associations general secretary, Pallab Das, said, We had demanded compensation for Riten Karmakar who was killed by security forces at Borjan tea estate last year (he was mistaken for a militant of the Adivasi National Liberation Army). Be it Ulfa or security forces, we cannot allow innocent people from the tea community to get killed, he said.

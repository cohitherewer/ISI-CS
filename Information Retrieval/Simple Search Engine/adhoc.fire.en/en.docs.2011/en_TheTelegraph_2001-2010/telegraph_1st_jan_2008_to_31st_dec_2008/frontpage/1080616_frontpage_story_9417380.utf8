          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, June 15: City police last night arrested a senior official of the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (Neepco) on charges of torturing his wife.        
	The police today said the deputy general manager of Neepco, Prafulla Sarma, was arrested from his Paltan Bazar residence in Guwahati last night on the basis of a complaint filed by his wife. The official is posted in Shillong.        
	Sarmas wife Mamoni, 48, had lodged a complaint against her 54-year-old husband at the all womens police station in Panbazar a few days ago accusing him of physical torture, mental harassment and attempt to murder. A police source said the official has been booked under Sections 498 (A), 497, 307, 120 (B) and 506 IPC        
	Mamoni had lodged the complaint with the police a few days ago. After carrying out preliminary investigation, he was finally arrested last night, the source said.        
	Sarma was picked up from his residence at the Pink Enclave near Hotel Starline at Paltan Bazar by a team of from the Panbazar all womens police station.         
	The accused was today produced in the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Kamrup, and remanded in 14 days judicial custody.        
	The couple have been married for 30 years. Their son Gautam, who was a captain in the army, died in June last year while on duty in Jammu and Kashmir. Their only daughter is studying MBA at an institute in Bangalore, the police source said.        
	Mamoni had told the police that the harassment and torture had started soon after their marriage on the pretext that she was not from a financially well-to-do family. Of late, the harassment had considerably increased and became intolerable for her, the source said.        
	Sarma, who practises astrology, used to tell his wife that she will die at 49 and their daughter at 30. Mamoni, who will turn 49 next month, became suspicious that Sarma might try to kill her,he added.        
	The couples daughter is about 23 years old.        
	Mamoni also told the police that Sarma had recently tried to take out a life insurance policy worth Rs 40 lakh in the name of their daughter. However, he could not do so after the agency refused to issue him a policy of such a huge amount.        
	Sarmas wife alleged that his intention was to murder his daughter and then claim the insurance amount. Her doubt was fuelled by his prediction that their daughter will die when she attains the age of 30, he said.        
	The police suspect the official to be suffering from some psychological problems.         
	However, we cant call him mad because he is holding a responsible position in an important public sector undertaking, the source added.

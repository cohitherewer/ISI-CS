The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Old flame comes in Krishna way 
                                                                                                        Old flame comes in Krishna way 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            SM Krishna                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: An old flame is lighting fires on S.M. Krishnas road back home.        
	Nobody would have recalled the Maharashtra gover- nors alleged endeavour in 2004 to get a ticket for B. Saroja Devi, a star of the sixties and seventies, but for the speculation that he is trying to return to Karnataka before the coming state polls.        
	Krishnas rivals in Delhi and Bangalore, waiting for a chance to scuttle his comeback, think they have sniffed one out in H. Vishwanaths book Halli Hakki Haadu (A Village Birds Song).        
	Vishwanath, a member of the former chief ministers cabinet and counted among his loyalists, apparently believes he has done no harm to his former boss. But a passing reference to the actress has handed Krishnas detractors what they were looking for.        
	According to excerpts carried in a Bangalore paper today, Krishna had asked Vishwanath what people would think if Saroja Devi was given a ticket from Mandya, his political turf, in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.        
	Vishwanath had replied: Sir, people know what happened between you and the star when you were young. They say Krishna wont forget his old number and will definitely give her a ticket.        
	Krishna was said to have laughed and said: We should not forget old numbers. It is a sin.        
	Karnataka Congress sources said Krishnas supporters were out on the streets of Mysore, pulling down banners and posters advertising the book launch today.        
	In Mumbai, the governors house refused comment. But a Raj Bhavan source said: Every time Krishna plans to return to active politics, mischievous reports of this nature are floated. Last time he tried to return to active politics, there were speculative reports alleging his links with the Telgi stamp scam.        
	Krishna himself was not amused  not when the Congress brass, it is learnt, has almost made up its mind to ask him to head the election committee.        
	His critics have started a campaign accusing Krishna of taking the Congress to ruin in the last polls by undermining its pro-rural image.

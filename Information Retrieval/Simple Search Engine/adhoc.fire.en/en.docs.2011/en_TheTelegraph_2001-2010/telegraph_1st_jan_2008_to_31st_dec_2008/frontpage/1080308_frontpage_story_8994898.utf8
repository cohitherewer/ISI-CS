          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Agartala, March 7: A pre-poll divorce initiated by a belligerent Forward Bloc failed to block a landslide victory for the Left Front in Tripura today.         
	Chief minister Manik Sarkars CPM accounted for 46 of the 49 seats that the Left Front won to retain power for the third consecutive term. The Congress and its ally, the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra, barely survived the Left sweep with 11 seats.        
	The Bloc, which broke away from the Left Front because it wanted to contest more than the one seat that it had to be satisfied with in previous elections, got less than 100 votes in most of the 12 constituencies where it challenged the CPM. That is ominous for the party in Bengal, where it has decided to go it alone in the panchayat polls.        
	The Left juggernaut crushed several Congress heavyweights, including PCC president and former chief minister Samir Ranjan Barman, state Intuc chief Dipak Roy and sitting MLAs Prakash Das and Jyotirmay Nath. Maharani Bibhu Kumari Devi of the Tripura royal family lost, too.        
	The only glitches in the Left Fronts performance were the defeats of deputy Speaker Subal Rudra in Sonamura and minister for social welfare Bijay Laxmi Sinha in Kamalpur. This is the first instance in three decades of a Left Front candidate losing in Kamalpur constituency.        
	Congress leader Ratanlal Nath, the leader of the Opposition in the previous Assembly, retained the Mohanpur seat by a slender margin but seemed to draw more comfort from the fact that Sarkars victory in Dhanpur was not as comprehensive as before.         
	The chief minister got only 1,500 votes more than his rival, political greenhorn Md Shah Alam of the Congress.        
	The lone victor from the INPT was party president Bijay Kumar Hrangkhawal, who retained the Kulai seat in Dhalai district. He defeated his nearest rival, Sabitri Debbarma of the CPM, by only 115 votes.        
	A jubilant Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the CPM, said in New Delhi that the outcome of the elections reflected Tripuras rejection of the economic policies followed by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance at the Centre.        
	Poliburo member Sitaram Yechuri was unabashedly upbeat. Where we are in power, anti-incumbency does not work, he said.        
	Congress leaders hoping to make a dent in the Left bastion on the strength of a populist manifesto groped for words to explain the drubbing. We have to respectfully accept the peoples verdict. Our basic failure lies in our inability to put across our ideas and programmes to the electorate, PCC vice-president Gopal Roy, one of the nine party leaders to survive the onslaught, said.

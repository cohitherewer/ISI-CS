	Calcutta, Dec. 10: The Bengal government today ruled out providing Rs 100 crore as working capital to Dunlop.         
	It is not the practice for the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation to provide working capital for companies, the industries secretary said after a meeting with the chief minister and the industries minister.         
	After the refusal, Dunlop chairman Pawan Ruia met Mamata Banerjee at her home to apprise her about the problems of reopening the Sahagunj factory.        
	Mamata sought tax cuts for Dunlop and the cash, days after suggesting to Ruia that he sell off his assets to clear workers dues.

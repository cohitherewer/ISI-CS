                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Aiyar invites NICT for all-year link
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, Aug. 29: DoNER minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today invited NICT, Northeasts biggest IT convergence, to shed its once-a-year schedule and work as a bridge between the government and the industry for all 365 days.        
	The suggestion came on the concluding day of NICT 2008, organised by The Telegraph.        
	We need your imaginative and proactive involvement. And this forum is the right place for this. I think, instead of meeting once a year, this forum can serve as the link between the DoNER and the industry 365 days a year, Aiyar said.        
	In his hourlong captivating speech as chief guest, Aiyar took digs at the IT industry for its elitist mindset but also praised it for driving Indias growth story. In between, he subtly articulated his concerns over an economic policy guided by LPG, (short for liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation), inflation and uneven growth that India can ill afford.        
	Wooing the IT sector to discharge its social corporate responsibility, he said: We have decided to play facilitator between the industry and the other government departments to boost the IT sector in the Northeast. You should see how you fit into the Northeast picture by looking at the larger picture. Instead of the IT sector importing manpower from the region, the IT industry should come to the Northeast, he said.        
	Aiyar also urged corporate honchos to give up their irrational paranoia about the law and order situation in the region as well as its elitist mindset that cannot function without five-star ambience.         
	Things have improved and will be so more once you come in. Lack of five-star hotels should not be a deterrent. Other things will fall in place. Look at Bangalore. It was not like this from the outset. We are seeking a true partnership between the Centre, state and the IT industry in the region. Please look beyond your bottomline, Aiyar said.        
	He urged IT players to come forward and set up a regional institute for training of telecom personnel in Dimapur in the public-private partnership mode to meet the manpower requirement of the sector.         
	I would like you all to come forward and help set up the centre and we will do every bit to facilitate it. I would be more than happy to applaud any such public-private partnership initiative sitting in the crowd instead of getting applauded at seminars and workshops, he said.        
	Aiyar also revealed that the Kohima Summit on IT, IT-enabled services and Telecommunications on July 31-August 1 last year showed results, like improving connectivity in the border areas along Bangladesh and training manpower in IT skills.               
	He also asked the state electricity boards of the region to give priority to ensure regular, uninterrupted and quality power for running the telecom and IT network.        
	In a session on SME: Shaping the Future through Innovation and Entrepreneurship, M.K. Yadava, managing director, AMTRON, made a strong case for encouraging small and medium enterprises (SME) in relation to established companies.         
	Our mindset has become such that we always go for brands with out giving the SMEs a chance. We need to change the mindset if we are to encourage it. Let us believe in ourselves instead of brands, Yadava said.

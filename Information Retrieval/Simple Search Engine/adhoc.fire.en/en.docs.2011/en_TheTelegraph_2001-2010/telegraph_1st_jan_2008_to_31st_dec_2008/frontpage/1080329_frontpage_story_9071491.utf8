          A STAFF REPORTER                                                
	Calcutta, March 28: A shower of sparks from a lamp post started an inferno below that burnt three young men alive and set 30-odd motorcycles and two cars ablaze in Barasat this afternoon.        
	LIC agents Debkanta Barua, 30, and Shekhar Jana, 27, were standing outside their four-storey office building at Dakbungalow More when they were trapped between the row of burning, exploding motorbikes and the ground-floor photocopy shop.        
	The petrol tanks of the bikes, parked on the compound, were exploding with loud bangs. The two men panicked and rushed inside the shop. They tried to pull the shutters down but it jammed and the flames leapt inside, said Sugato Sen, additional superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.        
	The shop was gutted and the two were roasted alive. Shop employee Ashim Biswas, 24, who too was inside, died at Barasat District Hospital.        
	Another LIC agent said he had been lucky: he was standing between the bikes and the gate.        
	I ran onto the street but Debkanta could not escape. He had got married just last month, said Pinaki Dutta outside the building that houses the LIC office in the two middle floors and two shops below, one of which was closed today. A family lives on the top floor.        
	Eyewitnesses said a short circuit in the tangle of overhead wires running from the lamp post rained sparks towards the building, barely 7-8 feet away, setting the first-floor khas khas mat on fire around 3.30pm.                  The charred vehicles. Telegraph picture       
	The fibre mats, hung outside windows, are usually doused in water so evaporation would lead to cooling but were probably dry today since summer hasnt peaked.        
	Within five minutes, the burning mat fell on the bikes parked below. Soon we could hear explosions and the fire spread quickly to other vehicles, said Parthasarathi Ghosh, who lives across the street.        
	More than 50 people were in the building but none apart from the three dead men suffered burns.        
	Some other parts of the building also caught fire but the flames had almost died down by the time we arrived, said Gour Ghosh from Barasat fire station whose team reached with five engines around 4.15pm.         
	The bikes and cars were charred but the fire did not spread to the adjoining buildings.        
	An LIC official said files and documents were safe. The fire was at the front of the building; so we had quickly moved the files and cash to the rear.

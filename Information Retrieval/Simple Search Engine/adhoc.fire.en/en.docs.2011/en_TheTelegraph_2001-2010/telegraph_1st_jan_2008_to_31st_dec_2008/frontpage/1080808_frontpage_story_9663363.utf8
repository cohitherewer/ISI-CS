          NASIR JAFFRY                       Musharraf                          
	Islamabad, Aug. 7: Rivals barely on speaking terms have sunk their differences to serve an ultimatum on Pervez Musharraf: exit gracefully or be impeached.        
	It has become imperative to move for impeachment against Musharraf, Asif Ali Zardari, the head of the Pakistan Peoples Party, sitting beside Nawaz Sharif, the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-N, said at a news conference.        
	The two, leaders of the main parties in the governing coalition who could not see eye to eye till a few weeks ago, have joined together in saying that Musharraf would be required to face a vote of confidence in the National Assembly.        
	By calling for the vote, they are essentially giving the President an opportunity to step down gracefully before having to confront impeachment proceedings.         
	A key question for the coalition government is whether it has the votes in Parliament to sustain an impeachment move. To remove Musharraf from office, the coalition needs two thirds of the votes in a joint session of the Senate and the National Assembly.        
	The coalition forces insisted that they had enough votes. The Assembly and Senate together have 439 seats, which means the coalition needs 293 for impeachment. The coalition has 259 members in the Assembly but its support in the 100-member Senate is not clear.        
	Musharraf did not make any statement today as he mobilised his political forces to consider his choices, spending three hours on Thursday with his constitutional lawyer.        
	In an indication of the gravity of the threat against him, Musharraf today cancelled his trip to Beijing to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.        
	As President, Musharraf still has the constitutional power to fight back against the impeachment by dismissing Parliament.         
	But to do so, Musharraf needs the agreement of the army. His successor as military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, has repeatedly indicated in the last few months that the army would stay out of politics, a relatively rare phenomenon in the country.                    WITH INPUTS FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES

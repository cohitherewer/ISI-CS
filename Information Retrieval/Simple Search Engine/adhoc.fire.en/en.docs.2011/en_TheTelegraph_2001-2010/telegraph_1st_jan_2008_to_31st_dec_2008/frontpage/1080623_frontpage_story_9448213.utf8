          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Darjeeling, June 22: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has announced a 60-hour relief in the indefinite bandh from 6pm today while promising to enforce the next round more strictly by including educational institutions, tea gardens and cinchona plantations in the shutdown when it resumes at 6am on Wednesday.         
	Party president Bimal Gurung said the decision for a relaxation was taken after requests from central ministers and MPs. On the other hand, the three sectors, which were kept out of the bandhs purview from June 12, have been told to observe the strike for a few days.         
	I cannot disclose the names of the central ministers and MPs who had called me up in the morning but they made a request for relaxation. Taking their requests into consideration and to ease the hardship of our people we have decided to provide a relaxation from 6 this evening till 6am on Wednesday. The second round will be more strict and educational institutions and tea and plantations have been told to observe the bandh for a few days, party president Bimal Gurung said.         
	The leader also said since a number of schools have just closed for their summer vacations he didnt want the students to remain stranded.         
	The Morcha has decided to send a four-member delegation of Roshan Giri, Pradeep Pradhan, Harka Bahadur Chhetri and Phubi Rai to Delhi tomorrow to brief the central leaders.         
	As a positive gesture to the chief ministers recent request, we will also send another team to Calcutta the day after tomorrow. The delegation will request him to write to the Centre to arrange for a tripartite meeting as soon as possible, said Gurung, who reiterated that he would take an all-party delegation to Delhi if the Centre invited him for talks. Although representatives of the Congress, CPI, BJP and Trinamul Congress in the hills had seconded Gurung recently in his demand for Gorkhaland, the state leaderships of these parties had disowned the members who had signed the resolution.        
	The Calcutta team will later join the Roshan Giri-led delegation in Delhi.         
	The Morcha indicated that it would fax a reply to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in response to the letter from inviting the Morcha for talks without any condition. The content of the reply is not yet known but sources said the party would be officially communicating that it was ready for discussions with the chief minister provided it was a tripartite meeting convened by the Centre in Delhi.         
	Observers said Gurungs announcement of a relaxation after requests from central ministers indicates that the party has built a strong lobby in Delhi. However, the relief appears more to be pre-planned as Gurung had assured hill residents that there would be relaxations to help them tide through. In the first phase of the bandh, Gurung had given a relaxation of five days.         
	The tea industry has breathed a sigh of relief and is already gearing up to dispose the produce that has been lying in the garden godown for the past six days.

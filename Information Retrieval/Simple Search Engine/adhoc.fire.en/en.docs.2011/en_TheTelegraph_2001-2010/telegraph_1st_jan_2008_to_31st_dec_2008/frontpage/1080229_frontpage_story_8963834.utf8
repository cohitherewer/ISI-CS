The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Smoke over kick-butt pill
                                                                                                           Smoke over kick-butt pill
          G.S. MUDUR                             Champix, the anti-smoking pill                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 28: A pill to help people quit smoking approved in India last year without local clinical trials has drawn an alert from US drug authorities following neuropsychiatric symptoms and suicide attempts among some who had taken the drug in America.        
	Medical studies have established that the drug called varenicline, produced by Pfizer under the brand name Champix, is superior to existing drugs to wean people away from cigarettes, company officials said. The US had approved the drug in 2006 after trials on about 5,000 people, they said.         
	But Indias drug authorities approved varenicline in May 2007, applying a clause in domestic laws that exempts certain drugs from clinical trials, Pfizer officials said. The drug is now available on doctors prescriptions in 17 cities, and a 12-week course of therapy will cost a patient about Rs 9,600, they said.         
	Varenicline works in two ways  it reduces withdrawal symptoms and the smokers sense of satisfaction derived from smoking. The drug has been prescribed to an estimated 5.7 million people worldwide, including more than 4 million in the US.         
	China had asked Pfizer to undertake a safety trial on 100 people there. Data from that study is still under review in China, the Pfizer officials said.         
	Some medical experts in India are questioning the haste with which the exemption was applied. Phase III clinical trials required to be done on 100 patients are intended to determine safety and efficacy of a drug in Indian ethnic populations, said Chandra Gulhati, the editor of the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, India, a journal of drugs.         
	It is strange that China is cautious and needs local trials, but India dispensed away with the requirement of Phase III clinical trials, Gulhati said.        
	A Pfizer official said Indias drug authorities have asked the company to conduct a post-marketing surveillance study after the product was launched. Instead of a quick study on 100 people before approval, were doing a rigorous post-marketing study on 500 people, Shekhar Potkar, Pfizers director of medical and regulatory affairs, said.        
	But after a review of post-marketing surveillance data in America, the US Food and Drug Administration stated earlier this month that serious neuropsychiatric symptoms had occurred in some patients who had taken the drug.         
	Quit-smoking pill advisory         
	Drugmaker Pfizer has said that before opting for Champix, the smoking cessation pill, patients should inform their doctors whether they had suffered from depression or any other form of mental illness.        
	Its a prescription drug, and its the job of the doctor to discuss this with the patient and take a decision on whether to prescribe it or not, Shekhar Potkar, Pfizers director of medical and regulatory affairs, said.        
	In the review of the post-marketing surveillance of people who used the drug in America, the US Food and Drug Administration had said: (The) symptoms include... agitation, depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and attempted and completed suicide.        
	It appears increasingly likely that there is an association between the drug and serious neuropsychiatric symptoms, the FDA said in an alert issued on February 1, 2008.         
	But the FDA and company officials have emphasised that the role of the drug cannot be established because smoking cessation has also been associated with exacerbation of underlying psychiatric illnesses.         
	A Pfizer official said not a single person in the clinical trial in the US had serious neuropsychiatric symptoms or completed suicide. The approval in India was based on safety and efficacy data from the US trial  we had substantial data, the official said.         
	Trials are conducted with great care and cause-and-effect can be determined, he said. Post-marketing surveillance has limitations, and the actual cause of suicide attempts cannot be established, he said.         
	The official said every drug was evaluated on its risk-benefit ratio. The benefits of this drug far outweigh its risks, which is why it is still in the market, said Anjan Chatterjee, the medical director of Pfizer based in New York.         
	But in its alert, the FDA also said that while some patients may have experienced these types of symptoms and events as a result of nicotine withdrawal, some patients taking (the drug) who experienced serious neuropsychiatric symptoms had not yet discontinued smoking.        
	Indias drug control officials contacted by The Telegraph refused comment, but said any approval for marketing was given only after safety and efficacy had been established.         
	I would have thought a drug to aid smoking cessation would have been approved after a Phase III trial, said a senior doctor at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, who requested anonymity.         
	Doctors say there is an urgent need for an effective drug to help smokers quit. Studies show that India has one of the worlds lowest rates of people who successfully quit the habit  2 per cent.

   MANDIRA NAYAR 
        Yuck! Vigyan Bhavan. (Prem Singh)
   
	New Delhi, Jan. 16: Montek Singh Ahluwalia once helped Manmohan Singh change the face of the Indian economy. Now he wants his mentors government to do the same to New Delhi.
 
	Ahluwalia, part of the original Team Manmohan of 1991 that unleashed the reforms and now Planning Commission deputy chairman, has sent a letter to the Centre saying the capitals signature stretch mdash; the Rajpath mdash; should only have buildings that reflect Indias booming economy by the 100th anniversary of Independence in 2047.
 
	The letter to the urban development ministry was written in Ahluwalias personal capacity but it carries an echo from the heyday of reform. If the reformers then suggested banishing white elephants such as public sector units, Montek the moderniser wants to get rid of monumental monstrosities in the capital.
 
	The articulate official has not used such strong language but he has politely pointed out that redevelopment should not bank on poor imitations of Edwin Lutyenss and Herbert Bakers neo-imperial style. 
 
	Most of the eyesores mdash; Ahluwalia prefers the euphemism non-descript mdash; that line Rajpath now were built after Independence on the pretext that they follow the neo-imperial style (see chart above). Lutyens and Baker had merged Indian symbolism with neo-classical styles, imperial in scale but Indian in material, finish and in the use of symbols.
 
	Ahluwalia has suggested replacing buildings built after Independence with architecture that reflects 21st century designs and Indias position as an economic giant.
 
	Vigyan Bhavan, the conference hall built in the sixties by the central public works department, is on Ahluwalias to-be-replaced list. 
 
	The present Vigyan Bhavan also uses available space inefficiently, he said. It should be replaced by a much larger and modern convention centre with adequate underground parking. 
 
	This could be done on a Private Public Partnership basis with land remaining with the government and a fixed number of days available for the government for official initiatives, provided notice is given in advance, he suggested.
 
	If the Left demurs mdash; as it had done when the reforms were launched mdash; there is the ubiquitous China card. Ahluwalia has said the same formula was adopted by Beijing to construct an Olympic stadium.
 
	The later government buildings on Rajpath are poorer in design and in quality of construction, he wrote. 
      
	One can fully understand that consideration of economy in the initial decade after Independence justified the modest efforts made at the time. However, it is time to consider whether these buildings, which occupy the nations most prestigious real estate and symbolise India, should continue to exist 100 years after Independence, when India is expected to have the third largest GDP in the world after China and the US, he added. 
 
	The new buildings should complement the more traditional neo-imperial styles of North and South Blocks without trying to be poor imitations. 
 
	The letter has been forwarded to the Delhi Urban Arts Commission, headed by architect Charles Correa, which examines proposals to ensure that the character of Delhis cityscape is not tampered with. The commission has decided to hold a workshop in February with architects, town planners and citizens to discuss the suggestions. 
 
	If Ahluwalias proposals are eventually implemented, the cluster of government offices in the heart of Delhi could become friendlier mdash; towards employees as well as visitors. He has suggested underground parking for offices, and bookshops, restaurants, museums and art galleries for the Rajpath stretch. The lawns, now dead after office hours, should be revitalised.
 
	Not all are convinced, though. A.G.K. Menon, a town planner and the convener of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritages Delhi chapter, says Ahluwalias suggestion was an extension of the India Shining campaign. I am concerned with the need to dictate a style that represents new India. It is exclusionary. We may have the third largest GDP, but what about per capita?

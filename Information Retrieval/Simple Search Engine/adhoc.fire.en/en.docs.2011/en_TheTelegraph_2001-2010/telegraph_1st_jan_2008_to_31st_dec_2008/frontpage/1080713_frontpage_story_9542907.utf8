  - Rural job scheme funds lying unused in Soren, Marandi, Koda bastions of Bokaro, Giridih, West Singhbhum          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                                    
	Ranchi, July 12: If Jharkhand is known by its leaders  the likes of Shibu Soren, Babulal Marandi and chief minister Madhu Koda  then the areas represented by them should logically be shining examples of the states development model.        
	Unfortunately their home turfs  Bokaro, Giridih and West Singhbhum  are the least developed, as Planning Commission members found out during their recent review meeting, and mirror the poor state of affairs in Jharkhand.        
	Development commissioner Ashok Kumar Singh confirmed that most of the development work and welfare schemes are in a shambles in these otherwise high-profile districts.         
	Hardly 5-10 per cent of the allocated funds meant for National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) and Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana (RSVY) have been utilised by Giridih, Koderma and Godda districts. They havent even claimed the last instalment, he said.        
	West Singhbhum and Bokaro are no better. Though the districts have collected the last instalment, the funds are lying unused.         
	The set parameters of development have not been achieved by any of these districts, lamented Singh.        
	While Giridih is the home district of former chief minister Marandi, he now represents Koderma in the Lok Sabha.         
	West Singhbhum is Kodas home turf and Bokaro is the JMM chiefs native place. Godda, a traditional JMM stronghold, is being represented by the Congress in the Lok Sabha.        
	True to form, the politicians are ready with their stock replies. The government has purportedly been posting corrupt and incompetent officials in Giridih and Koderma districts to malign my image, said Marandi.         
	But I believe in long-term gains. That is why I have waged a war to form a stable government in the state, said the former chief minister, who floated the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha on the development plank.        
	During their recent meeting with Planning Commission members, state officials argued that extremism was the biggest stumbling block in executing development projects.         
	But the plan panel rejected the plea, lambasting the state for not having a clear roadmap for development.         
	As for the existing plans, it said they were superfluous.        
	Vast stretches of land are lying vacant everywhere. Have the officials posted in the districts ever tried to find out who are the owners? asked Singh.         
	The land may belong to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and people living below poverty line or even the government. Why was no action plan prepared for reclamation? If agriculture wasnt possible on the land, plantations could be done. If nothing was possible, palm trees could have been planted.         
	Chief minister Koda tried to defend his government by denying that arbitrary transfers and postings of officials were responsible for the sorry state of affairs. But he promised action against over-confident officials who feel secure due to their proximity to bigwigs.         
	Also, in an effort to undo the damage of the years, the state government has asked DCs to prepare composite plans to successfully implement various welfare schemes including the UPA governments flagship job scheme under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.        
	It has also decided to identify competent block development officers (BDOs) and ask them to adopt model villages that could be worthy examples for other BDOs to follow. The best among them would be felicitated during the states Foundation Day celebrations on November 15.

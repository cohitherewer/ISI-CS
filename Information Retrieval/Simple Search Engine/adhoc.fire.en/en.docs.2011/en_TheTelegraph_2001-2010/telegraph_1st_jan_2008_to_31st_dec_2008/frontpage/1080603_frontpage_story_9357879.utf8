  - Govt cannot fully   insulate consumer        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, June 2: The signal that an oil price hike is round the corner came from the highest authority in government when the Prime Minister said consumers could not be protected entirely from a rising worldwide trend.        
	We cannot allow the subsidy bill to rise any further. Nor do we have the margin to fully insulate the consumer from the impact of the world commodity and oil-price inflation, Manmohan Singh said.        
	The statement that the government could not fully insulate the consumer, read with the rider that at the same time we have to have the fiscal means to protect the poor from the adverse impact of inflation, suggests the increase will be modest.        
	Given the political differences within the Congress-led ruling alliance, with the Left warning against any revision and Sonia Gandhi saying that the government should keep the interests of the poor in mind, the chances of a big increase are slim in any case.        
	A mild dose of price increase, coupled with a lowering of taxes on petroleum products and compensating oil companies for their losses, is the preferred formula. Political issues have held the government back from going ahead with this combination.        
	Oil industry officials expect the mix to be firmed up in a week, or even earlier. There are rumours that a decision would be made in a cabinet meeting in a day or two.        
	A Rs 2-4 a litre increase in petrol and Rs 20 in cooking gas prices are expected, leaving diesel unchanged on the ground that it is the fuel used by truckers and a rise would fuel inflation.        
	The government has responded coldly to the CPMs suggestion of a windfall profit tax on private petroleum companies like Reliance and Essar on the argument that they have cashed in on the global price surge by exporting their entire output.        
	Such a tax was once imposed in the US in 1980 in a similar situation. But the government is against the tax as it feels the move will discourage petroleum companies from exporting their products.         
	The Prime Minister pointed out that the government had not raised kerosene prices for four years while diesel and cooking gas prices were only marginally increased. Petrol prices are lower than international rates, now hovering around $130 a barrel.        
	The situation cannot continue for ever. We need a wider political consensus to adopt more rational economic policies, he said, adding that the government could protect the poor only up to a point and economic pricing of oil was essential to sustaining growth.        
	Speaking at business lobby Assochams annual general meeting, Singh sought industrys support to control price rise. I do not wish to see a return to an era of blind controls.        
	Suggestions have been made, even from within the government, to place certain commodities under control to stem rising prices.

	Ranchi, Jan. 8: In a bid to ensure the smooth execution of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Development Mission projects, the Jharkhand government today decided to set up the State Urban Development Agency (SUDA) and several other facilitating agencies with new officials posts to man them.         
	The State Urban Development Agency, which will primarily address issues of slums, will be headed by the states urban development minister and have three cells under it: programme support, training and finance.        
	This apart, the state will also have a Municipal Administration Directorate, an Urban Development Agency and a Town and Country Planning Organisation.         
	These agencies will be responsible for the execution of urban development schemes by tackling various issues ranging from the release of funds to preparing and maintaining data banks.         
	The Town and Country Planning Organisation will be preparing master plans and city development plans for urban areas and also assist municipal bodies in their execution. Over 51 posts were surrendered to create new posts. These will cost the exchequer Rs 89.07 lakh annually, said the cabinet secretary, N.N. Pandey.

A cow development directorate will be formed, which will carry out research for improving the breed of milking animals under the supervision of BAIF.        
	nThe state has also decided to spend another Rs 39.60 lakh on this project over five years. Under this scheme, new dairies and over 150 cattle breeding centres  one for 2,000 cattle  will be set up across the state.         
	nFor the safety of forests and wildlife at the Betla Tiger Reserve, Jharkhand government will now set up a special force that would be headed by an official of sub-inspector rank, including a staff of two assistant sub-inspectors, two head constables, 24 retired army jawans, two drivers and two cooks.

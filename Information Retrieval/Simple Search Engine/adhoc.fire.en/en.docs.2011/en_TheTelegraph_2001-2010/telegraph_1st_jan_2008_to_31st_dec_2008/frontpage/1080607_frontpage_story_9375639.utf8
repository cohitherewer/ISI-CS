                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   NREGS skeletons tumble out of closet
  - Probe on NGOs with Rs 20cr funds        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                          
	Ranchi, June 6: Under fire for widespread irregularities in the implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), the state government has decided to probe the role of various NGOs who were sanctioned over Rs 20 crore in Gumla and Chaibasa under the Centres showpiece job scheme.         
	The rural development department has ordered a probe by divisional commissioner Nidhi Khare into complaints of massive irregularities in the utilisation of the money granted to 19 NGOs in Gumla and the one in Chaibasa.        
	NREGA commissioner Amitabh Kaushal told The Telegraph that reports received from the Gumla DC wasnt satisfactory. So, we have asked the South Chhotanagpur commissioner to look into the whole issue, he said.         
	The state has been at the receiving end for its inept handling of the job scheme which many alleged had been taken over by middlemen.        
	Last month, a team of students of GB Pant Institute of Social Science, Allahabad, led by economist Jean Drze revealed several anomalies in the muster rolls in Chatarpur and Chainpur blocks of Palamau.        
	According to officials monitoring NREGA, former Gumla deputy commissioner Aradhana Patnaik, now on study leave to IIM, Ahmedabad, had sanctioned funds to the tune of Rs 19.9 crore to 19 NGOs. Another Rs 1 crore was granted to Su-Savera, an NGO in Chaibasa, for jatropha plantation. Out of Rs 19.9 crore, Gumla-based Brahmanand Farmers Research Centre alone got Rs 5 crore under an MoU it signed with the district administration, Kaushal revealed and promised to take suitable action once the probe report was ready.        
	On her part, Khare promised to submit a report soon. Works under NREGS can be implemented through NGOs, but a proper procedure should be followed, she added.         
	For instance, the Chaibasa NGO reported that it planted some 14 lakh jatropha plants using the Rs 1 crore it got under NAREGA.         
	So, we have asked a report from the West Singhbhum DC whether those plants were numbered or not. He is also to find out the locations and whether the district forest officer had verified the plantation, Kaushal said.        
	In fact, the NREGA commissioners office had clearly defined the policy for granting funds to NGOs in order to avoid such bungling.        
	NREGA guidelines specify who all are eligible to be implementing agencies: intermediate and district panchayats, line departments of the government, public sector undertakings of the Centre and state, co-operative societies with a majority shareholding by the Union and state governments, and reputed NGOs having a proven track record of performance.         
	But the work has to be executed by job card holders only, Kaushal clarified.         
	All schemes must be approved by the gram sabha. The NGOs should be selected by the management board of the district rural development agency (DRDA).         
	Also, the NGO should be registered with the government for at least three years and have experience in implementing similar projects.

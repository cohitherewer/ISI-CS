The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mosquitoes get a temple
                                                                                                           Mosquitoes get a temple
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                            The mosquito shrine                                   
	Hyderabad, March 5: N. Satish Kumars anti-malaria messages didnt appear to have any sting. Then, he sought divine intervention and built a temple  to mosquitoes.        
	The shrine built by the government doctor in Prakasams Mokshagundam village  home to the ancestors of pioneering engineer M. Vishweshwariah  isnt a design marvel.         
	But Kumar, weary of his ineffective campaign against mosquito-borne diseases through exhibitions and sermons, thought the 2.5-foot-high shrine would capture minds in villages where religion works more than the myriad brands of mosquito coils and repellents.        
	The mosquito temple, possibly the countrys first such initiative, stands out even in a state that has shrines to actresses, pets, departed lovers, dead parents and the like.        
	I set up the temple to spread awareness about diseases spread by mosquitoes, Kumar said. Each evening, on the way home from hospital, he spends time at the shrine, which has a large mosquito sketch (in picture) with the words, Mosquito, come tomorrow. His lectures are about basics  avoid waterlogging and filth.                  
	There are no idols or prayers, only messages. I told the villagers the temple wasnt meant for worshipping mosquitoes but to learn more about the harmful effects of the insect on their own lives and that of their loved ones.        
	To ensure that Kumars words arent forgotten, signboards with caricatures of the insect have been strung up, along with a list of dos and donts, on the walls.        
	Kumar is getting his anti-mosquito mantras across but, unlike the celebrity temples, he has few devotees at his shrine. He tells us that we get fever, filaria and other diseases from mosquito bites, said Krishna, a villager, who was present during one of the many thinly attended sessions.        
	Mosquitoes might not have spawned temples before but authorities have long struggled to devise new ways to battle the sting squadron. In the early 90s, a Rajahmundry resident sued the local civic body for not doing enough to contain the menace and was awarded compensation.        
	The legal blow had prompted the authorities to offer cash rewards to those who swatted the insects in large numbers.

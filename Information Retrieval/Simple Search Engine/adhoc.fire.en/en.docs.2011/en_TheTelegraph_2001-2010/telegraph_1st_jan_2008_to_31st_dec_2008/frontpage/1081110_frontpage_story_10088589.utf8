                                Omar: File picture                            
	Dubai, Nov. 9 (Reuters): Osama bin Ladens son Omar and his British wife arrived in Qatar capital Doha today after being refused entry by Egypt, Al Jazeera television reported.        
	The Qatar-based television said Omar bin Laden arrived in the Gulf Arab state on an Egyptian passenger aircraft. It gave no further details.        
	Omar and his wife arrived yesterday in Egypt from Madrid after the Spanish authorities refused his request for asylum. The couple, who lived in Egypt for several months in 2007 and 2008, have also been denied entry into Britain.        
	Airport sources in Egypt said Omar, who has not seen the al Qaida leader for many years and says he does not support violence, had asked to go to Qatar, where as a Saudi citizen he would have right of entry.        
	The Spanish interior ministry rejected his asylum plea on the grounds that it did not consider he was in danger in Egypt.        
	His British wife, Zaina al Sabah, said on Friday the couple fear they will be assassinated for condemning the views of bin Laden and al Qaida.        
	She said her husband, one of bin Ladens many sons, had stopped living with his father before he masterminded the September 11 attacks on the US seven years ago.

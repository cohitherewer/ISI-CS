          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, April 8: Police today seized 30 high-explosive grenades along with 30 detonators from an auto-rickshaw near the Bhutan bus stop at Rangia in Kamrup district.         
	Two persons  Monoj Gorh of Samdrup Jongkhar in Bhutan and Mouza Ali of Darranga Mela in Baksa district bordering the Himalayan kingdom  were arrested along with the consignment. The duo told the police that the arsenal, kept in six containers, was being brought from Darranga Mela, on the Indo-Bhutan border, known to be an Ulfa stronghold.         
	Ulfa militants were using Darranga Mela to cross into Bhutan where the outfit had camps before the Bhutanese security forces launched Operation All Clear in 2003.         
	The consignment was to be delivered to Ulfa militants at Ghagrapara in Nalbari district. Though the police could not confirm whether the consignment originated in Bhutan, they were not ruling out the possibility either.         
	Intelligence reports had warned that Ulfa was trying to set up base in Bhutan again. The police have informed the army and asked it to step up vigil along the international border.         
	The deputy inspector-general of police (central western range) G.P. Singh, said two Ulfa militants had been following the auto-rickshaw on a motorcycle. The two militants fled when they saw the police party intercepting the auto. But we have identified them, Singh said. He said Mouza and Monoj have been taken to Darranga Mela from where the consignment had originated for further investigation. We are expecting to seize more arms, he said.         
	The Kamrup superintendent of police, Debojit Hazarika, said the consignment was loaded on the auto-rickshaw early this morning and the vehicle had travelled for about 30km when it was intercepted around 8.30am.         
	The DIG said Darranga Mela has once again turned into a Ulfa stronghold with the commander of the outfits 709 battalion, Hira Sarania, holed up in the foothills of Bhutan. With the passage of time, the militants have regrouped in these areas, he said.         
	Todays recovery was made during a routine check by a joint team of the CRPF and the police team which was tipped off about arms movement in the area. We narrowly missed an IED consignment a couple of days back. It had also come from Darranga Mela, Singh said.         
	The police said they have taken up Monoj Gorhs case with Bhutan. Though Gorh is from Rohmari in Sonitpur district of Assam, he claimed to have been staying in Samdrup Jongkhar for some time now. We will get information on the Bhutan link, if any, only after questioning the duo.

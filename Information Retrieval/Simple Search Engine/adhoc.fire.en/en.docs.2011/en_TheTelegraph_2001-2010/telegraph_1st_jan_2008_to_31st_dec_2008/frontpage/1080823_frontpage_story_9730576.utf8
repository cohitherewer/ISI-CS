	Cuttack, Aug. 22: Worlds largest nesting ground for the Olive Ridley turtles  along the Orissa coast  is in peril owing to rampant erosion of beaches.         
	Wildlife conservationists are already concerned as progressive erosion has created an unstable beach profile along the coast.         
	It has started to destroy the most preferred nesting grounds of the endangered sea turtles.         
	The Orissa coast has three major nesting sites  at the Gahirmatha, the Devi mouth and the Rushikulya mouth.         
	The Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary is acknowledged as the worlds largest rookery of Olive Ridley turtles.         
	Nearly 50 per cent of the worlds Olive Ridley population turn up at the Orissa coast every year and use the nesting sites to lay eggs on the beaches.         
	If the erosion of beaches continue with such a pace, it wouldnt be surprising if the nesting turtles abandon the Orissa coast altogether, said the secretary of the Wildlife Society of Orissa (WSO), B. Mohanty, while talking to The Telegraph today.         
	The loss of the sandy beach in Orissa, according to experts, accelerated with the plantation of casuarinas that was taken up by the state forest department after the 1971 cyclone.         
	The experts believe that the absence of open beaches prevented the formation of sand dunes.         
	Besides, large stretches of casuarinas plantation stunted the growth of a particular species of creeper and grass that act as sand-binders and stabilisers, making the beaches vulnerable to rapid erosion.         
	The impact of progressive loss of beaches is being felt some 30km north of the Paradip port already, Mohanty said, quoting findings from a recent survey by the National Institute of Ocean Technology.         
	The wildlife conservationist further expressed concern over the proposed seaports at the Dhamra, Subernarekha, Budhabalanga, Jastadhar, Devi, Rushikulya, Palur, Balil and Harchandi mouths.         
	Once the ports start being operational, the erosion would be unstoppable. Unless the government erects a sea wall across the entire 476km stretch along the Orissa coastline, the secretary said.         
	The ocean technology institutes study had identified some 108km of the total 476km coastline as being adversely affected.         
	The erosion at Puri, where the beach profile has remained stable for nearly two centuries, has been unprecedented in the recent years. The greedy sea, it seems, has gobbled up nearly 70 per cent of the Puri beaches during the past three to four years.

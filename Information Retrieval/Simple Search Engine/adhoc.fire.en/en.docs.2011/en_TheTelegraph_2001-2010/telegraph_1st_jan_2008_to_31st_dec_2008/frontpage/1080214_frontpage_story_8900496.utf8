          RANJAN DASGUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Feb. 13: Chief minister Madhu Koda has spiked a proposal of the state home department to hire over 800 ex-defence personnel on contract to beef up security in jails.        
	A crucial issue for Naxalite-affected states like Jharkhand, Kodas stand hasnt gone down well with prison officials responsible as they are for over 800 Maoists held captive in 26 jails across the state.         
	Koda, who looks after home portfolio, favours a long-term solution to the jail security issue and hence is in favour of permanent recruitments.        
	Though the sanctioned strength of securitymen for state prisons is 1,500, there are 800 vacancies.         
	Home secretary Sudhir Tripathi confirmed that the state government had shot down the proposal to hire ex army jawans. We will now go in for regular appointments and the nitty-gritty is being worked out, he added.        
	But, prison officials were unhappy with the governments decision. We desperately needed the ex-servicemen to guard jails as some of them housing Maoists are extremely vulnerable. The recent jail break at Chattisgarh should have alerted the higher-ups, lamented a prison official.         
	Prison authorities are largely dependent on home guard jawans for securing the outer periphery of the jails. In July last year, over 180 rebels lodged in Garhwa had attempted a jail break by forcing open the main gate. But additional forces from the district police rushed to the spot and prevented the rebels from fleeing.         
	Among the prisons considered more vulnerable to Maoist attacks are the ones at Daltanganj, Koderma, Ghatshila, Garhwa, Gumla, Simdega, Lohardaga and Chas.         
	Appointment of security personnel on a regular basis is a cumbersome process. There could be political interference, too, that could further delay the process as it was in the case of police recruitments, said a prison official explaining their apprehensions about the government move.              
	Thats why we were thinking of an interim measure, he added.

	Lucknow, April 21: Seasonal gusts swept small fires from house to house and field to field in Uttar Pradesh yesterday, charring 1,500 homes and killing at least 12 Dalit villagers across nine districts.        
	The fast winds, usual this time of the year, helped the flames across acres of crop fields and blew them into the grassy patches at the Dudhwa National Park.        
	Most of the fires had small origins: a woman making tea in Lakhimpur-Kheri district, electric cables snapped by the wind falling on fields in Ambedkar Nagar and Rae Bareli  even funeral pyres.        
	Villages were affected in both Sonia and Rahul Gandhis constituencies. In Amethi, Sultanpur district, deaf and mute girl Jyoti Singh, 15, and her uncle Pawan Singh were burnt alive.        
	When flames engulfed the girl in Debina village around 3pm, she could not scream for help. Pawan, who sensed the danger late, rushed inside their hut to save Jyoti and died with her.        
	Most of the villages belonged to Dalits, the traditional sellers of fodder and fuel who grow grass around their thatched-roof homes and heap cow-dung cakes in their courtyards. The grass dries up and turns inflammable in summer.        
	Weather experts said that in March and April, the hot ground air rises up from the states plains allowing winds from the northwestern mountains, which are still cold, to rush in. It still being early summer, the temperature falls at night and the winds cease.        
	Yesterday, wind speeds had reached a higher-than-usual 27-45kmph, state meteorology director K.P. Kulsheshtra said. Winds blowing at 36kmph helped torch a dozen villages in Lakhimpur-Kheris Terai region.        
	The fire started in a single home in Khaliham village around noon and spread quickly to neighbouring villages, said district magistrate Pinky Jowel.        
	By evening, when four fire engines arrived, all they saw were burnt huts and wailing people surrounded by dead cattle and the ashes of foodstocks, crop and grass.        
	Even the water bodies had dried up in the heat, so they wouldnt have helped the firefighters, an official said.        
	We used chemicals to fight the blaze but some open pastures are still smouldering, a Dudhwa park official said.        
	In Ambedkar Nagars Akbarpur, 40 goats and a buffalo were killed after an electric cable fell on them. Wheat and paddy was destroyed across 12 acres, and two young boys and a woman were killed. Another snapped wire helped burn down 25 acres of crops in Sarai Mahesh, Rae Bareli.        
	The affected districts include Gonda, Colonelganj, Ghazipur, Gorakhpur and Pilibhit.        
	Every year, summer winds play havoc with Dalit villagers lives. Nine members of a Dalit family were burnt alive last year in Farrukhabad district, a social welfare department official said.        
	We have been trying to educate villagers to be careful when they light fires during the daytime in early summer.        
	Relief operations have been launched and a rehabilitation package is being readied.

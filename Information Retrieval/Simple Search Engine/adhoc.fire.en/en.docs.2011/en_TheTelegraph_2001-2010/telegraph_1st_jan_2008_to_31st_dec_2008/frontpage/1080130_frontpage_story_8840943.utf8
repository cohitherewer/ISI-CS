     A STAFF REPORTER 
               
	Guwahati, Jan. 29: Assam State Zoo began preparing to vaccinate its rhinos and all other ruminant mammals against anthrax for the first time after receiving confirmation about the contagious Bacillus anthracis spore lurking somewhere on its sprawling campus.
    
	Clinical tests at the College of Veterinary Sciences in Khanapara confirmed what was feared: that an acute case of anthrax caused the sudden death of a 30-year-old rhino, Jon, in the early hours of January 22.
    
	On receiving the report yesterday, the committee of experts that was constituted to oversee preventive measures contacted the Institute of Veterinary Biologicals, also in Khanapara, to suggest the dose of anthrax vaccine appropriate for different species of mammals. 
    
	 There are different doses for different animals. One must know the right dose to be administered for it to be effective, a member of the committee said.
    
	The Khanapara institute stocks the anthrax vaccine. 
    
	The divisional forest officer in charge of the zoo, Narayan Mahanta, said the anthrax death might have been caused either by ingestion or inhalation. Since there is no way of knowing whether the spore-forming bacteria is still around, vaccination is the only way out.
    
	Mahanta said the committee of experts suggested vaccination of all animals in and around the zoo, with the focus on ruminant mammals such as cattle, sheep, buffalo and goats. We implemented a series of preventive measures after the rhino died. We were only waiting to find out whether it was anthrax that caused the death before taking the final step of vaccinating animals. 
    
	On whether anthrax may have already spread beyond the zoo, the DFO said there was no reason to panic.
    
	Jon led a charmed life until anthrax killed him. In August 2005, suspected poachers tried to electrocute the rhino in his enclosure at the zoo. Had it not been for a police team that had entered the zoo to look for fleeing militants just when the poachers were at work, Jon would have been electrocuted and his horn taken away. 
    
	He was brought to the zoo from Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary in 1980.

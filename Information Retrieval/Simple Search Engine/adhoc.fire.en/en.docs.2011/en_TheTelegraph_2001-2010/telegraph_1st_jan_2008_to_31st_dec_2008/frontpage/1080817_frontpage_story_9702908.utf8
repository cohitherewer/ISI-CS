          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	Ahmedabad, Aug. 16: Gujarat police today claimed to have solved the Ahmedabad blasts, saying they had custody of 22-year-old mastermind Mufti Abu Basheer and nine accomplices, and alleging that perpetrator Indian Mujahideen was the Students Islamic Movement of India by another name.        
	At a news conference, senior officers spoke of a pan-Indian terror plot where cadre from Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh planted bombs in Ahmedabads streets after receiving commando training at jungle camps in Kerala and Gujarat (see map).        
	A Mumbai-based Wipro executive was alleged to have frequently travelled to Ahmedabad and plotted the bombings cooped up in a rented flat with Basheer, a madarsa teacher who would come down from his workplace, Hyderabad.        
	Over 100 local people in Gujarat, members of sleeper cells, helped out with the July 26 strike that killed 57 and was blamed on home-grown terrorists from the beginning, director-general of police P.C. Pande said. The same group is also accused of causing the Surat bomb scare.        
	Basheer, who married last year, was vacationing at his village home in Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, when he was picked up following tips from central intelligence, the police said. After his formal arrest in Lucknow, he was being brought to Ahmedabad on a three-day remand.        
	Officers said Basheer headed the Indian Mujahideen, which had claimed responsibility for last months Ahmedabad and Bangalore blasts through emails. He apparently took charge after former Simi general secretary Safdar Nagori was arrested in March.                  File picture of Mufti Abu Basheer       
	Basheer was in Hyderabad during the May 2007 explosions and is alleged to have frequently travelled to Ahmedabad before the bombings.        
	Pande said the Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi) was now operating under the name of Indian Mujahideen. The claim comes 11 days after a tribunal had overturned the ban on Simi only for it to be re-imposed a day later, when the Supreme Court stayed the tribunals order following a government appeal.        
	The nine other accused are all from Gujarat but none is a riot victim, Pande told a questioner. He said five SIM cards the bombers had bought provided vital clues: they were used only to receive incoming phone calls from PCOs, and the mobiles went dead after the July 26 blasts.        
	Officers said the curriculum at the jungle camps included lessons in frustrating police interrogators. But the minute details provided by the police suggested the accused, mostly detained in the past couple of days, sang quite quickly.        
	Their meetings were held at the home of Yunus Mansuri, an Ahmedabad shopkeeper and one of those arrested, who used to send his wife to his parents home beforehand, officers said.

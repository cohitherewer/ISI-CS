          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, July 12: Bengals top engineering school will honour two of Indias best-known technocratic proponents of the nuclear deal at a time the states ruling Left Front is marching into nation-wide protests against the pact.        
	IIT Kharagpur will award honorary doctorates to former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar for their stellar contribution to Indias nuclear programme, government officials said.        
	Their latest contribution, backing the nuclear deal, will not find mention on their citations but was on the minds of institute administrators who proposed their names, the sources said.         
	The nuclear deal was certainly at the top of our minds when we selected them, a member of the IIT Kharagpur board of governors said.        
	IIT Kharagpur is run by the Centre but has been linked virtually by an umbilical cord to the Bengal administration. The brainchild of former chief minister B.C. Roy, Indias first IIT was set up in Bengal by the Centre because the state was at the time the most industrialised in India.        
	The IIT Kharagpur board, which chose Kalam and Kakodkar for the DSc (honoris causa) degrees, includes a representative of the CPM-led Bengal government apart from central officials and institute administrators.         
	The duo will receive their degrees at the institutes annual convocation ceremony on July 25, the sources said.        
	The CPM, after withdrawing support to the UPA government along with its Left allies, has announced nation-wide protests against the nuclear deal from July 14. We dont expect the Lefts protests to die down by July 25. But we dont expect any trouble, a senior IIT Kharagpur official said.        
	As head of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, Kalam had co-ordinated some of the scientific efforts that culminated in the 1998 Pokhran nuclear tests.        
	Kakodkar has staunchly supported the deal, becoming the Centres scientific face for the pact at a time several scientists and former heads of Indias nuclear programme have expressed reservations.

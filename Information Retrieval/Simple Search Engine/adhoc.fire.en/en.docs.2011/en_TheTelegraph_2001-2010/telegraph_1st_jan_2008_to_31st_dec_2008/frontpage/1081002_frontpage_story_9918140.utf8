The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mud-fed monster activates Haldia Port alarm
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mud-fed monster activates Haldia Port alarm
          SAMBIT SAHA                                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 1: Not far from Nandigram, an underwater monster feeding on mud is posing possibly the biggest threat to Bengal industry after the Singur controversy.         
	A key part of the riverbed leading to the Haldia Port, the lifeline to many an industry in Bengal and most of eastern India, is being caked over with sludge in the absence of dredging as scheduled.        
	If the pace of dredging is not cranked up immediately, ships will find the guiding channel  called Auckland  to the port unusable within a few months. The worst-case scenario has projected the possibility of a crippling crisis in less than a month.        
	The other channel  Jellingham  is also said to be facing the same problem. This means if remedial measures are not taken fast, the Haldia Port will be virtually unable to function and Bengal will be left with only the Calcutta Port, which has limited capacity.        
	The gap between the water surface and the riverbed has narrowed to such an extent that the danger mark is now less than a metre away.        
	On average, a gap of 7.7 metres is required to keep Auckland navigable. The current official figure is 8.6 metres  other sources said it could be still lower  which leaves a narrow leeway of 0.9 metre.        
	Between August 12 and September 24, the depth in one of the tracks of the channel has gone down by 1.5 metres, Ramakant Burman, secretary of the Haldia Port Officers Forum, said.        
	The accumulation of mud depends on the flow of water and it need not have the same impact on all tracks. But the example cited by Burman suggests that if the circumstances are similar, the current surplus of 0.9 metre could be eaten up in less than 26 days.         
	The situation is so grim that an emergency meeting was held today in Delhi between the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) chairman, Anup K. Chanda, and shipping secretary A.P.V.N. Sarma.        
	Highly placed sources said the CPT chairman spoke of a critical situation if more dredgers were not immediately pressed into service.        
	A reduction in the number of mud-removers on call is at the root of the crisis. Five dredgers are supposed to work in the port round the year and another is expected to be available for 120 days a year.         
	However, only three machines of the Dredging Corporation of India are slogging now. Officials said the two others were infrequent in service, adding that one was expected this month and another at the end of November.        
	The sixth dredger was taken away three years ago by the corporation: the cumulative impact now telling on the riverbed.        
	The sources said the CPT chairman has demanded two more dredgers over and above the originally allocated six to tide over the crisis.        
	Burman, the union secretary, alleged that the corporation could not deploy dredgers because seven were deployed for the controversial Sethusamudram project in Tamil Nadu, the home state of shipping minister T.R. Baalu. Shipping ministry officials could not be contacted for comment.        
	Sethusamudram is a pet project of DMK, an ally whose value has gone up for Manmohan Singh after Prakash Karat withdrew support.        
	If Sethusamudram can spare a few dredgers, they could reach Haldia in four days. However, if the sludge excavators get caught in a tug-of-war between the DMK and the Bengal Left, the equations in Delhi are now tilted in favour of the southern ally.        
	At least on this count, Mamata Banerjee cannot be faulted. She had written to the Prime Minister as early as on August 5, alerting him to the gathering crisis.         
	The fall in the gap is already costing companies more. A metre less means the carrying capacity of a vessel goes down by 6,000-7,000 tonnes, which means more vessels are needed to ferry consignments.        
	Among the companies affected are Bengals showpiece project Haldia Petrochemicals, the Indian Oil Corporation, Mitsubishi PTA, Tata Steel, SAIL, South Asian Petrochem and Shree Renuka Sugars. The problem is costing Haldia Petro Rs 80 crore a year.        
	An IOC official said more ships are being used this year to maintain the same level of production, adding to cost. The depth cannot reduce any further. In that case, it will be serious, he said.        
	Every year, the port dredges 22 million square metres of sludge from the channels and throw it aside. If dumped on the shore, the silt will need around 1,100 acres a year.

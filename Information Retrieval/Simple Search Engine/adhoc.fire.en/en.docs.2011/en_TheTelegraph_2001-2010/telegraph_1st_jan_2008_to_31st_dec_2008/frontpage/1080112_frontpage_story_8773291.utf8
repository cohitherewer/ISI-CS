	Darjeeling, Jan. 11: When Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed Mount Everest, a ray of hope had shone on the little-known Sherpa community.
    
	He was like a god to many of them, Sonam T. Tshering, Tenzings grandson told The Telegraph over phone from Sydney. It (Hillarys death) is a great loss to the Sherpa people. 
    
	Through his Himalayan Trust, which was founded in 1962, Hillary had given the Sherpas in Nepals Solukhombhu area a new life.
    
	The trust built 26 schools and two hospitals, mobilised funds to build an airport, promoted tourism and provided scholarships to Sherpas. 
    
	The Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI) in Darjeeling today hoisted its flag at half-mast to pay homage to the man behind its birth. His portrait was placed near Tenzings memorial. 
    
	Hillary had visited Darjeeling in 1997 to unveil Tenzings statue on the HMI premises. 
    
	Colonel J.S. Dhillon, the HMI principal, said: We also organised a condolence meeting at the institute today. It was because of Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillarys feat that this institute was set up and it continues to inspire the younger generation.
    
	Dorji Latoo, an Everester, described Darjeelings favourite guest as compassionate. 
    
	Hillary visited Darjeeling a number of times and I last spoke to him in 2004 when he handed over the Tenzing Norgay National Award. He was compassionate and kind. He was attached to Darjeeling as all expeditions started from this place before Nepal opened its gates, said Latoo. 
    
	No wonder that Hillary visited the hill town eight times.
    
	Latoo said the climber was worried about the increasing traffic to Everest. He was disturbed about the increase in traffic and would always speak about it even during formal interactions. 
    
	Kushang Sherpa, who has scaled Everest five times  he is the first man to climb all four faces  said he would always remain indebted to Hillary and Tenzing. 
    
	They are father figures. Had they not achieved the feat, we would perhaps not have been here. We followed in their footsteps, he said.

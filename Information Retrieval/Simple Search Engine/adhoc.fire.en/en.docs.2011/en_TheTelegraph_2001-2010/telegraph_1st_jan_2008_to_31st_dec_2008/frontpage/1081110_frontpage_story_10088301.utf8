          SEAN RAYMENT                            William: Royal misuse                                  
	London, Nov. 10: Royal Air Force chiefs have admitted that they were misled over Prince Williams controversial Chinook pleasure flights, it can be revealed.         
	Documents obtained have disclosed that neither William nor his aides informed senior officers of the true nature of two Chinook training flights which the prince used to attend a stag party and a wedding.         
	The documents, which can be made public for the first time, state that senior officers would have cancelled the flights if they had been told that the sorties were being used by William, 26, to ferry him to private functions.         
	The documents also reveal that in the wake of the furore surrounding the flights, senior officers were criticised for errors in judgement and were ordered not to give the second-in-line to the throne any more special favours.         
	The five flights, which the RAF describes as contentious, took place between April 2 and April 11 this year whilst William, a serving army officer, was on a four-month attachment with the RAF.         
	In a series of sorties while based at RAF Odiham, the prince flew over his fathers house in Gloucestershire, practised landings in a field next to the home of the parents of Kate Middleton, his girlfriend, in Bucklebury, Berkshire, and flew to a wedding in Hexham, Northumberland.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Calcutta, April 21: Dont think no record was broken at the Eden dust bowl while you were baking in the stands yesterday: the Calcutta temperature breached a decade-old barrier.        
	When the mercury bubbled up to 39.6C on Sunday, it was the first time in 10 years the temperature in the city had reached the level in the so-called cruellest month.        
	We have not had the maximum temperature in April crossing 39C in 10 years, G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, said today.        
	Monday was not much better  the heat helping Mamata enforce a successful bandh despite an apparent lukewarm response from her foot soldiers. Mondays maximum temperature was put at 39.3C, three degrees above normal. The normal maximum temperature in April is 36C.        
	Will Tuesday be kinder? Unlikely, if the Met office is proved right. We expect the current hot spell to continue. The next two days will be hot and uncomfortable, Debnath said.        
	Power cuts  which took a back seat on Monday because of the bandh-induced low demand  are also expected to return on Tuesday.        
	This April has been a month of highs and lows. The first seven days were the coolest in Calcutta in at least a decade.        
	However, the temperature started climbing steadily thereafter. The city missed a heat wave yesterday by just over a degree. If the maximum temperature in summer shoots up five degrees above normal, it is termed a heat wave condition.         
	According to Met officials, a dry hot wind has been blowing in from the western part of the country, pushing up the maximum temperature.        
	The officials said the humidity level had dropped because the westerly wind was strong and there was virtually no wind from the sea.        
	The day humidity or the minimum humidity was 25 per cent today and 21 per cent yesterday, against 61 per cent last Thursday. This shows how the moisture level has dropped. A strong breeze from the Bay of Bengal can help bring down the maximum temperature. But if there is no Norwester or thunderstorm in the next few days, there wont be any respite, an official said.

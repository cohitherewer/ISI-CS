                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Cyber crime up 50 per cent
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Online alert                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: Cyber crooks are on a roll, age and location no bar.        
	The National Crime Records Bureau has revealed that there has been a 50 per cent jump in cyber crime between 2006 and 2007; that 60 per cent offenders are between 10 and 30; and that Bhopal accounts for 87.8 per cent of the crimes.        
	In its report Crimes in 2007, the bureau has said that 46 per cent of the crimes relate to pornography, but warned that hacking and online thefts are at an all-time high.        
	It has also sounded an alert on criminals getting unauthorised access to protected documents and manufacturing false electronic evidence.        
	In India, which has the fourth largest number of Internet users in the world, cyber crimes are punishable under two laws: the IT act and the Indian Penal Code.        
	Last year, nearly 217 cases were registered under the IT act, compared with 142 in 2006. Under the IPC, 339 cases were registered in 2007 against 311 the year before.        
	For the first time, the bureau has said that such crimes are no longer limited to metros, with Bhopal topping the list. Most offences go unreported, sources said.        
	To combat the spurt in cyber crime, police officers are being asked to take a six-week training course at the Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University in Delhi.        
	They are being taught the basics of computer hardware and software, communication networks and network protocols as well as wireless networks and network security.        
	Sources in Delhi polices cyber crime department said more and more IT firms and big companies were hiring what they term ethical hackers to learn the techniques criminals use and the loopholes they exploit to access networks and servers.        
	The global economic downturn was providing cyber crooks the perfect platform to make hay, they said.        
	Cyber criminals are using consumer anxiety to make huge profits. People are being lured into quick-fix deals via the web and they are signing up on websites on the promise of easy money, an official said.        
	Earlier this month, a report on Virtual Criminology by the Santa Clara-based McAfee Inc, one of the worlds largest computer security firms, had noted the same trend.        
	The report had said: Recessionary times are proving to be a hotbed for fraudulent activity as cyber criminals capitalise on a climate of consumer fear and anxiety.        
	McAfee has predicted that malicious cyber activity will further strain the suffering global economy by impacting consumer confidence, which could paralyse global recovery in 2009.

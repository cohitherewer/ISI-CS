The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sex scandal in US? This time its a mayor
                                                                                                           Sex scandal in US? This time its a mayor
                                Kilpatrick: Young amp; in trouble                            
	Detroit, March 24 (AP): The mayor of Detroit, a one-time rising star and the citys youngest elected leader, was charged today with perjury and other counts after sexually explicit text messages surfaced that appear to contradict his sworn denials of an affair with a top aide.        
	Prosecutor Kym Worthy also charged the popular yet polarising 37-year-old Kwame Kilpatrick with obstruction of justice and misconduct in office.        
	Former chief of staff Christine Beatty, 37, who also denied under oath that she and Kilpatrick shared a romantic relationship in 2002 and 2003, was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice. Kilpatrick said he expects to be cleared.        
	I look forward to complete exoneration once all the facts have been brought forth, he said. I will remain focused on moving this city forward.        
	Worthy filed eight counts against Kilpatrick and seven against Beatty. This case was about as far from being a private matter as one can get. Honesty and integrity in the justice system is everything. That is what this case is about, Worthy said at a news conference.        
	A perjury conviction could bring up to 15 years imprisonment and force Kilpatrick to relinquish the mayors office.        
	The scandal broke when the Detroit Free Press published excerpts of sexually explicit text messages sent to Beattys city-issued pager in 2002 and 2003.         
	The messages contradict statements Kilpatrick and Beatty gave under oath during a trial last summer when each denied a romantic relationship.

	Calcutta, Feb. 15: The mega chemical hub, rehabilitated in Nayachar after being hounded out of Nandigram, has been given the licence to lay the groundwork on the island as requests for central clearance pick their way around red tape in the mainland.        
	The Bengal government today handed over the certificate of permissible possession of Nayachar island to anchor developer PCR Chemicals. The document will allow the company to start preliminary work like soil-testing on the island.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee gave the certificate to Prasoon Mukherjee, the director of PCR Chemicals, at Writers Buildings. Industries minister Nirupam Sen and commerce secretary Sabyasachi Sen were present.        
	The company has appointed Singapores Jurong Town Corporation to carry out a feasibility study to see if the soil needs to be strengthened and the ground level raised. A project report will be prepared after the assessment, followed by a master plan.        
	The process will run parallel to the states initiatives to get Delhis approval, which could take six to eight months.        
	We do not want to wait for the Centres formal approval before starting the initial work. That is why permissible possession was given today. Nayachar will be the processing zone of the hub, Nirupam Sen said after the meeting.        
	Bhattacharjee said the Prime Ministers Office and all ministries concerned had been positive about the project. They are awaiting our final proposal. It will be approved as soon as they get it, he said.        
	Delhi has sought two clarifications on the proposed Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemical Investment Region (PCPIR), to which the state has responded. The final proposal incorporating the clarifications will be submitted shortly.        
	Mukherjee expressed happiness with todays development. According to a financial study done by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the project will entail an investment of Rs 55,000 crore and create 1 lakh jobs, he said.        
	PCR Chemicals  49 per cent of the company is owned by the WBIDC and the rest by New Kolkata International Development Ltd (NKID)  will undertake development projects worth Rs 5,000-6,000 crore.        
	NKID is owned by the Indonesian Salim Group, Delhis Unitech and Mukherjees Universal Success.        
	The state had signed a comprehensive pact with NKID on July 31, 2006, for developing various projects, including the Kukrahati-Raichak bridge and the Eastern Expressway. This is the first important step in realising the agreement, Mukherjee said.        
	The chemical hub will come up on a 250sqkm area, 40 per cent of which will be the processing zone. Existing industrial areas in Haldia will be part of the processing area.        
	The state, which has engaged the Indian Oil Corporation as the anchor investor to build the mother refinery, is also courting private players like Reliance, the Mittals and the Hindujas. But prospective investors have been fretting about the delay in building a deep-sea port.

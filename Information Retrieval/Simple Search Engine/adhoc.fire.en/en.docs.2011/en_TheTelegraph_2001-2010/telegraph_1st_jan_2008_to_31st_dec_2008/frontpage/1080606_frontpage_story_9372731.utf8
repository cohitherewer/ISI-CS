          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, June 5: The Assam government slashed the price of petrol and diesel by a rupee each this evening to provide some relief to consumers amidst widespread protests against the hike in the state.         
	A statement issued by the government stated that prices had been reduced by a rupee each per litre on both petrol and diesel a day after the Centre decided to increase the same by about Rs 5 and about Rs 3 a litre respectively. The rise in price yesterday saw a litre of petrol shoot up from Rs 47.61 to Rs 52.86 while that of diesel went up from Rs 32.45 to Rs 35.53 a litre in the state.         
	Immediately after the announcement, the government asked the finance department to work out the modalities. A notification to this effect will be issued tomorrow, an official of the department said.         
	 Sources said Dispur was worried about the impact of the slash because it has more or less decided to match the hike announced by the Central Pay Commission. Last fiscal, there was an overall earning from all sources of Rs 2,864 crore. This time the overall target is Rs 3,400 crore.

  - Indians commission portraits but forget to pay up        AMIT ROY                                                     
	London, April 13: Indian princes commissioned top British artists to paint their portraits, lavished praise on their work but forgot to pay them, it has been discovered by Sothebys, the London auction house.         
	The 18th-century portraits provide the kind of insight into the life of the courts that would prove very helpful to set designers aiming for visual authenticity, for example, in Bollywood films.         
	The artists travelled to India with the aim of attracting lucrative commissions either from Indian rulers or British residents attached to the East India Company or serving in the military.         
	Five miniature portraits of Indian subjects painted during the second half of the 18th century by leading British artists of their day are to be auctioned at Sothebys in London this Wednesday.         
	According to Sothebys, the miniatures evolved from an established tradition of full-sized (English) portraiture.         
	The artists included John Smart (1741-1811), arguably the greatest portrait painter of the 18th century who arrived in Madras in 1785, soon after which he was appointed court miniaturist to the Nawab of Arcot.         
	The others are Ozias Humphry (1742-1810) and Edward Nash (1778-1821).         
	A total of 120 works, all from the same private collection, will be offered for sale, of which the portraits of the Indian subjects are considered to be the star items.         
	The five, with their subjects, artists and reserve prices are as follows:         
	nAsaf-ud-Daula, Nawab Wazir of Oudh, by Ozias Humphry (8,000-12,000): He succeeded his father Shuja-ud-Daula as Nawab Wazir of Oudh in 1775.        
	A contemporary observed of him: He is mild in manners, generous to extravagance, affably polite and engaging in his conduct; but he has not great mental powers, though his heart is good.         
	His reputation for lavish expenditure, combined with a noted penchant for all things British, encouraged artists to visit Lucknow and seek their fortune. He praised the artists but forgot to pay them.         
	nHaidar Beg Khan, by Humphry (8,000-12,000): He was chief minister to Asaf-ud-Daula, Nawab Wazir of Oudh.        
	In his dealings with the East India Company, their representatives noted a tendency to put his personal interest before that of his master  a fault to which they themselves were not immune.         
	On June 12, 1786, the Chief Minister granted Humphry a half-hour sitting. Nonetheless within this short period, Humphry succeeded in capturing the forceful and reportedly duplicitous character of the sitter. Humphry submitted an account of 47,000 rupees for all his work; the Nawab graciously rounded the figure up to 50,000 rupees but then failed to pay in full.         
	nMuhammad Ali Khan, Nawab of Arcot and prince of the Carnatic (1718-1795), by John Smart (30,000-50,000): Scion of the Farukhi (Anwariyya) dynasty, Muhammad Ali Anwar-ud-din Khan Bahadur was born in Delhi, third son of Jan-i-Jahan, subedar of the Carnatic.         
	Like Humphry, Smart appears to have found it impossible to be paid in full by his Indian sitters.         
	nHafiz Muhammad Munavvar Khan, Amir-ul-Umara of Arcot, Smart (25,000-35,000): He was the second and favourite son of Muhammad Ali and Begum Sahiba.         
	In 1773, Emperor Shah Alam granted Hafiz Muhammad the title Amir-ul-Umara in recognition of his services in capturing Tanjore. The prince died in 1788, a year after this portrait was drawn.         
	nMooda Maji of Coorg, by Edward Nash (10,000-15,000): Painted in 1807, the princess is shown seated, wearing a muslin jama, with a jewelled necklace, pearl earrings and a rose-coloured three-cornered plumed hat edged with green.         
	A member of the Paleri dynasty, Mooda Maji was the second daughter of Dodda Vira Rajendra, Raja of Coorg (1763-1809), and his first wife Mahadeva Rani.

	London, Oct. 30: Gentlemen may prefer blondes, but they really want a brunette for a wife, according to research.         
	A new survey has found that men think blondes are better as girlfriends, but brunettes are the best for settling down with.        
	Almost one in five say blondes are sexier than other girls, with just under half saying they had more outgoing personalities. When it comes to marriage, however, more than half said they would rather wed a dark-haired woman because they were more dependable and sensible.        
	Hairdresser Andrew Collinges company carried out the poll.         
	Its always been said that blondes have more fun and men obviously enjoy going out for dates with blondes as well as upgrading them to girlfriend status, he said. But when it comes to marriage, men seem to opt for brunettes as they see them as more dependable and down-to-earth.         
	This is really surprising when you think were in 2008 and the blonde versus brunette debate is still rumbling on  Im surprised as I thought men were more modern than this! Im obviously in the minority as I married a blonde.         
	Out of a poll of 3,000 men, almost half said dark-haired women were the most loving.        
	Collinge added: This just goes to show how important first impressions are to men. However, it doesnt mean its time to rush to the salon for a drastic image change  at the end of the day, men marry a person not just a head of hair.         
	Its more important that women are happy and confident in who they are and how they look, and make the most of what they have. Its all about having a good relationship with yourself that makes you attractive.

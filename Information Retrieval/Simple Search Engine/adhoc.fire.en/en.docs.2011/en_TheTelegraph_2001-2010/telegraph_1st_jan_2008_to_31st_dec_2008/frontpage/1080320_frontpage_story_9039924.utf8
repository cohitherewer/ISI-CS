The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Brand Modi in RS surprise
                                                                                                           Brand Modi in RS surprise
  - Four contenders for two seats        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                    
	Ranchi, March 19: One is selling the Gujarat model of development in Jharkhand. Another is taking credit for bringing the National Games to a state sans infrastructure, while yet another is promising to be a saviour of tribals. And the fourth Rajya Sabha nominee from the state wants to debar outsiders from contesting.        
	On the last day of withdrawals today, four aspirants to the Rajya Sabha remain in the fray that will see a colourful contest for two seats on offer from Jharkhand.        
	Parimal Nathwani, president (corporate affairs) of Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries, is the surprise candidate and he is contesting as an Independent, much like lawyer R.K. Anand, who jumped into the race at the last moment.         
	The JMM is backing former South Delhi MP Kishori Lal. NDAs candidate J.P.N. Singh is sitting pretty with 34 MLAs in the coalition.         
	I have been an important member of the delegation of chief minister Narendra Modi to at least six countries to promote Gujarat. So, I could also be the brand ambassador of Jharkhand, a confident Nathawani told The Telegraph.         
	He has been camping here for the last one week and has been meeting the legislators irrespective of part affiliation. I am seeking the support of legislators across party lines. Those who cannot defy their party, can give me their second preference votes, he added.        
	Anand claimed the contest was far from over. I am going to be declared the Congress nominee, the lawyer, who rejoined the Congress after severing ties with the JMM, said. Lal is a JD(U) man. How could Shibu Soren enlist the support of the Congress or for that matter the RJD for him?         
	Targeting his efforts at woo the Indepedent ministers on board, Anand rejected the outsider tag that threatens to stick on him. The amount of work I have done for Jharkhand during my first stint should be an eye-opener. I have given sports a new orientation in the state. Bihar has not got the National Games, which we got gifted to Jharkhand. The state could have one of the best sports infrastructures now, he maintained.         
	Both Anand and Nathawani are operating on the assumption that JMM chief Shibu Soren had ditched both the Congress and RJD, which offered the seat for his son Durga. After Soren broke his promise, the other two partners may not necessarily toe the JMM line, they pointed out.         
	Meanwhile, Soren worked hard to keep his flock together. He held a meeting of his legislators and extracted a promise from them to stay united.

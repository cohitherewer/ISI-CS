	Siliguri, July 4: A 59-year-old man died at Siliguri District Hospital this evening after suffering a cardiac arrest following an altercation with an on-duty nurse.         
	Arun Sarkar, a resident of Aurobindopally of the town and an official of the Siliguri court, had undergone a bypass surgery recently. His sons alleged that the nurse had humiliated Sarkar who then collapsed and was declared dead at the emergency ward of the hospital. He had come to visit a relative admitted to the hospital. The Sarkars have lodged a complaint with the hospital superintendent.

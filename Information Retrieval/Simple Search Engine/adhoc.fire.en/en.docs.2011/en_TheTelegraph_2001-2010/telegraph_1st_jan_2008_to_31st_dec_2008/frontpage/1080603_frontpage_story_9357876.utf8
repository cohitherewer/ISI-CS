          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 2: Cars in India that were manufactured after 2005 are less fuel-efficient and emit more carbon dioxide per kilometre than those made before the year 2000, the Centre for Science and Environment said today.        
	The CSE said that data obtained from the Pune-based Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI)  a 42-year-old industrial research association set up jointly by the automotive industry and the Union government -- shows cars are increasingly guzzling more fuel.        
	Petrol cars with engine size 1400cc made between 2000 and 2005 emit 143gm/km of carbon dioxide, but post-2005 cars emit 173gm/km, and the fuel economy has dropped from 16km/litre to 13 km/litre, the CSE said.        
	Diesel cars with engine size lower than 1600cc and made in 1996-2000 emitted 129 gm/km, but post-2005 models emit 149gm/km, with a fuel economy drop from 20 km/litre to 18km/litre.        
	The CSE said SUV models with engine capacity less than 3000cc and made in 1996-2000 emitted 189 gm/km, while those of post-2000 vintage emit 229gm/km. Post-2005 SUV models emit 256 gm/km. All this translates into a fuel economy decline from 14km/litre in 1996-2000 to 10 km/litre in post-2005 models.        
	This is unexpected and disturbing. Fuel efficiency has declined in the new models, said Anumita Roychowdhury, a researcher with the CSEs Right to Clean Air Campaign.        
	This is likely if manufacturers increase the weight, performance and power without paying enough attention to efficiency.        
	Older cars can become less fuel-efficient and emit more CO2 because of poor maintenance and ageing, she said. Some cars are fuel-efficient, others are fuel-inefficient, but we dont have access to data about specific models. The government has not yet enforced its policy of getting carmakers to reveal fuel-efficiency values for each model.

          ANITA SINGH                            Kate at the premiere of Revolutionary Road in Los Angeles. (Reuters)                                  
	London, Dec. 17: Kate Winslet plays Leonardo DiCaprios wife in her latest screen role, but she only had eyes for her real-life husband at the films US premiere.         
	 The 33-year-old actress beamed at Sam Mendes, her husband of five years, as the trio posed together on the red carpet in Los Angeles.         
	Mendes directed the film, Revolutionary Road, an adaptation of Richard Yatess novel about a married couple in 1950s America who yearn to escape their mundane suburban lives. Winslet has admitted that shooting love scenes with DiCaprio in front of Mendes was too weird.         
	Her performance as the unhappily married April Wheeler merited a Golden Globe nomination and she is tipped to make the Academy Awards shortlist for the same role. Success would be sweet because Winslet has been nominated at each ceremony five times but has never won.         
	Revolutionary Road reunites Winslet with DiCaprio, 34, for the first time since they appeared together in Titanic. The romantic epic remains the highest-grossing film of all time. Winslet has a second Golden Globe nomination for The Reader, in which she plays a German woman who has an affair with a teenage boy.

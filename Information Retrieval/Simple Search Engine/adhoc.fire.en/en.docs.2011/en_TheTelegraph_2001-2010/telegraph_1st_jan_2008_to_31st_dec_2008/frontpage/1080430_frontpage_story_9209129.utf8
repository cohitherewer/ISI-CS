	New Delhi, April 29: The men who judged and hanged K.P.S. Gill yesterday have just as poor records as the former hockey chief in running their own sports.        
	Now it seems they are on thin ice legally and have used arguments that can easily be turned against them.        
	Lawyers said the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) dusted off a forgotten clause in its constitution to sack Gill and suspend the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), reminiscent of Emergency-era purges. And it flouted its own rules by failing to send the federation a showcause notice.        
	There are lots of holes in the IOA decision. They may get embarrassed if the IHF officials challenge the decision in court, said Ushanath Banerjee, an apex court lawyer.        
	The IOA constitution allows the countrys parent sports body to consider disaffiliation/derecognition/suspension of the national sports federations after ensuring that a showcause notice has been served and an explanation obtained and considered.        
	Besides, the IOA constitution allows such action only under three conditions:        
	- If the federation repeatedly refuses to follow IOA directives        
	- If it fails to hold elections after office-bearers tenures run out        
	- If it fails to hand in its annual audited accounts, annual report or list of office-bearers        
	The IHF had not violated any of these clauses. IOA sources said the association brass had scoured the constitution to find a suitable weapon, and settled on a rule under the powers and duties of the organisations general assembly, made up of all its member federations. Clause A (xviii) allows the IOA to take disciplinary action against any national sports federation/association for misbehaviour or any other undesirable activity bringing discredit to the country.        
	Since the IOA president and the executive are authorised to deal with all matters between general assembly meetings, they decided to go ahead. The immediate charge against the IHF was the bribery scandal involving its secretary K. Jyothikumaran, who has since resigned. With the probe yet to be completed, this was an insufficient tool.        
	The IOA finally used world hockey body FIHs threat, following the bribe scandal, to cancel all development projects in India and withdraw the 2010 World Cup unless the current office-bearers were removed.        
	Rahul Mehra, another apex court lawyer, felt the IHF had been denied natural justice. Since Jyothikumaran was not present at the meeting, his side wasnt heard.        
	Mehra feels that if the IHF moves court, the IOA will argue that the notice for the meeting where Gill was sacked was actually a show-cause notice. It might say that since Gill was present, he got an opportunity to present his case.        
	A senior IOA official said the logic behind the sack could be turned against IOA president Suresh Kalmadi and football chief Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.        
	If the FIH criticism is used to sack Gill, one should also take into account what Sepp Blatter said when he came to India.        
	Blatter, the head of world football body Fifa, had said India was a hundred years behind the leading soccer nations.        
	Also, the Commonwealth Games Federations inspectors have, after every Indian tour, criticised Kalmadi and his men for the tardiness of the 2010 Games preparations. Will these two also be sent to the guillotine? the official asked.        
	Kalmadis and Das Munshis good fortune could be that unlike Gill, they have not had to stand comparison with a glorious past. India has never done well in the sports they run.

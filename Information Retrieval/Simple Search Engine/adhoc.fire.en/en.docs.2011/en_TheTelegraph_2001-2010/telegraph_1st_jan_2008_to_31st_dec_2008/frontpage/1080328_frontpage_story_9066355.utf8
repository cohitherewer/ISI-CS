The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP shadow over civic poll winners

	Ranchi, March 27: As if to claim that its success in the Rajya Sabha elections was no flash in the pan, the BJP seems to have cornered most of the key posts in various municipal bodies in the state today.        
	Though the civic polls werent fought on party lines according to the state election commission diktats, there was ample scope for political parties to throw their weights behind prospective winners.         
	And today while the results of the states first civic polls in decades were being announced, the writing on the wall was clear: in Jharkhand the saffron combine remained the choice of urban voters as the Congress, supporting the lacklustre Madhu Koda government, was a distant second.        
	The exceptionally long ballot papers for the mayors and deputy mayors post in the Ranchi Municipal Corporation held up results in the capital.        
	Elsewhere, the BJP seemed to be going great guns. Candidates with its blessings were said to have bagged the chairmans post in Giridih, Gumla, Simdega, Chatra, Hazaribagh, Khunti, Mihijam, Seraikela, Chaibasa, Adityapur, Phusro, Lohardagga, Latehar and Dumka.        
	The vice-chairmans posts that went to the BJP-supported nominees were in Giridih, Bermo, Mihijam, Seraikela, Latehar, Sahibganj, Godda and Dumka, among others.         
	While the Congress fared well in Medininagar, Simdega, Madhupur, Raj Mahal and Chatra, JMM had to be content with Chaibasas vice-chairman winner Mithilesh Thakur, indicating that Shibu Soren was yet to have an urban following.        
	The JMM also cut a sorry figure in Dumka, the heartland of Santhal Paragana, where most seats were shared by the BJP, Congress and JVM-supported nominees.         
	Lalu Prasads RJD did not do well too. Manoj Singh, the nephew of RJD MLA Videsh Singh, was elected vice-chairman in Medininagar, while Purendra Narayan Singh, who religiously celebrates Lalu Prasads birthday every year, bagged the post in Adityapur.         
	Former chief minister Arjun Munda was understandably elated. The BJP has swept the civic body elections and the trend will continue in the forthcoming Assembly elections too, he asserted, but clarified that the party would not be eager to woo to municipal bosses.         
	We would keenly watch their performance and decide their entry only when they become performers.        
	State BJP president P.N. Singh said the outcome vindicated the people wanted change. Our cadres performed well not only in urban centres but also in semi-urban areas, he pointed out.        
	The Congresss response was indicative of its mood. We are not keeping track, said Congress legislature party leader Manoj Yadav.

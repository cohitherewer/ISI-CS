  - New airport opens but take-off to be delayed          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	Hyderabad, March 14: India today got its first world-class airport. But it may have to wait a while before planes start taking off from there.        
	Congress president Sonia Gandhi inaugurated the spanking new Shamshabad airport on the outskirts of Hyderabad  almost three years to the day after laying the foundation stone for the first public-private initiative to build an airport from scratch.         
	However, an hour later, the airport authorities announced that they had put off plans to start commercial operations from early Sunday.        
	A few private airlines wanted some more time to shift operations from the existing airport at Begumpet to Shamshabad. They had approached the civil aviation ministry. We have agreed to put it off by a few days at the ministrys request, said an official for GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd.        
	Late tonight, GMR sources said the commercial flights might be put off for a month.                   
	In Delhi, aviation ministry officials said: The launch of commercial operations has been delayed by a few days because of operational reasons. They didnt spell out what the hitch was.         
	Members of Parliament have been urging the government not to shift to the new airport from the existing one in Begumpet as several systems were not in place and a premature start of operations could leave passengers frazzled.        
	Ministry sources said the delay would help the government work out a deal that would ensure Begumpet airport  in the heart of the city  could continue operations and earn viable revenues.        
	Just two days ago, civil aviation minister Praful Patel had given assurances to keep Begumpet airport in operation while persuading employees of Airports Authority of India (AAI) to call off their strike.        
	Employees of AAI have been protesting against plans to close down the existing airports at Hyderabad and Bangalore and shift to new airports that been established by private players under agreements that permit them to run the airports for up to 60 years before ceding ownership.                  
	Whats new?        
	Shamshabad  the largest airport in the country that sprawls across a 5,495-acre dustbowl of aspirations and promise  projects itself as an amalgam of Singapores Changi airport, Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Hong Kong International Airport and Frankfurt. The first three are rated among the best airports in the world.         
	We have picked the best features from all these airports: customer service handling from Changi, operational efficiencies of Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur, and the infrastructure of Frankfurt airport, said G. Mallikarjun Rao, the chairman of the GMR group which is also redeveloping the Delhi airport.         
	Malaysian Airport Berhad, the operator of Kuala Lumpur airport, is GMRs partner at Shamshabad. Fraport, the operator of Frankfurt airport, is its partner for the Delhi project.        
	Shamshabad airport  like the existing airport at Begumpet -- will be called the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport.         
	Never mind the moniker, if you are looking for a doppelganger in airports, you wont find it here. Begumpet and Shamshabad are as distinct as chalk and cheese.        
	The old airport is creaky and falling apart: its dirty, grimy and littered with entry and egress choked by years of haphazard development in the area.        
	Shamshabad, on the other hand, is the first of the new-look airports in the country built in public-private partnership with several foreign collaborators thrown in. It is being touted as an aerotropolis that mimics the concept that turned Seoul, Munich and Hong Kong into some of the finest airports in the world.        
	An aerotropolis is an intricate web of hotels, business centres, retail spaces, convention and exhibition centres, golf courses and entertainment centres  all built around an airport.         
	The new airport has a trailer load of firsts: the seven-storey high glass-enclosed is the first eco-friendly airport in the country which relies principally on natural sunlight; it is also the first airport in the country that can receive the double-decker, super jumbo Airbus A-380. It has the longest runway at 4.26km, though Delhi is expected to have a longer one in two years.         
	It aims to handle 12 million passengers a year in the first phase and expects to bump that up to 40 million passengers  making it as big as Mumbai by 2012. It will also have a highly automated cargo terminal with a capacity of 100,000 tonnes.         
	Tough task         
	But how much of this is really hype and how much fact? Will Shamshabad emerge as Indias answer to Changi?         
	Its tough to match the customer services at Changi. Take an example: to kill boredom for transit passengers who have a couple of hours before taking a connecting flight, Singapore airport authorities and the islands tourist board have worked out a promotional scheme that throws in a free tour of the island. Passengers leave their passports at a designated counter at the airport and get a ticket stub for the free tour. It builds interest in Singapore  and they reckon that many will return for an extended stay.        
	With just 12 aerobridges, it might be hard for Shamshabad airport to meet its objective of ensuring that 90 per cent of the passengers get to just walk into the aircraft. Both Mumbai and Delhi  both busier airports  have plans for at least five times as many aerobridges.        
	Delhi plans to have two metro stations and a travelator to ease the pain for passengers.         
	But the biggest worry is the distance. Its one and a half hours away, said the driver who picked me up from the old and familiar Begumpet airport.         
	Shamshabad is trying to solve that problem. There are plans to build an eight-lane, 24.38km access controlled outer ring road along with a four-lane 11.6km elevated expressway to smoothen access to the airport.         
	The expressway will create problems for the next two months, said Y.S. Rajashekar Reddy, chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.         
	Shamshabad clearly has a long way to go  literally. A 40-km ride to the world class airport from the city centre will certainly quell enthusiasm about all the delights it has to offer.

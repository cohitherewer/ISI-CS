          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dumka, Jan. 27: I am not concerned about the survival of my government but I am worried about the welfare schemes in the pipeline, said chief minister Madhu Koda after hoisting the Tricolour here on the Republic Day.        
	He was visibly upset over the Congresss apparent rejection of the report on his governments progress in the past 15 months. That Sonia Gandhi did not meet Shibu Soren a couple of days ago in Delhi also shocked Koda. How can I guess the reason behind it (turndown by the Congress)? But I was honest to produce 100 per cent correct reports compiled from each district, he said yesterday.        
	The UPA in the state will be the loser and the process of development will stop if the government falls, said Koda, who termed his 15-month tenure the golden period.        
	Koda said he was elected the leader after joint resolution of different allies in the UPA and so he did not tender his resignation on Congresss demand. If the allies ask me, I will submit my resignation letter immediately, he said.         
	On the Simaria bypoll, Koda said: I will be aloof.

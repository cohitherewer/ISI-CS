          A STAFF REPORTER                            The Australians in Kolkata Knight Riders, (from left) Michael Buchanan, Ricky Ponting, John Buchanan and David Hussey, during a training session at Eden Gardens on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta: The excitement had been building up since Saturday morning. By the time the bus carrying the Kolkata Knight Riders team members arrived at the Eden around 3.30pm, a few hundreds had turned up to cheer the Ricky Pontings and the Brendon McCullums.        
	The session was meant to know the players  14 took part  but coach John Buchanan made it clear that he means business. Besides actively participating in physical and fielding drills, he also took time off to speak to the local players individually. Trainer Adrian le Roux was at hand during the hour-long session that left the players exhausted in the intense heat and humidity.        
	Each player was handed a file that included the training schedule for the entire tournament.        
	Buchanan, accompanied by Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla, also spoke to curator Kalyan Mitra. The former Australian coach enquired about the nature of the wicket. It is likely that the track, which has a fair sprinkling of grass on it, will make the task of the strokeplayers easier.        
	We have some mixed memories of this place But the one thing we do remember most is the atmosphere he said later. Personally I havent had much of an experience in Twenty20 cricket But we have a lot of experienced players. It promises to be a very exciting tournament as all teams seem to be evenly matched on paper, Buchanan said.        
	He also spent a while speaking to the Knight Riders team management on his plans and programmes.        
	It will be an incredible learning experience for the youngsters We hope to make their experience worthwhile. Hopefully the guys will be enhanced as individuals by the end of six weeks, the former Australia coach said.        
	We need to keep the right balance... We are going to assess ourselves right through the tournament Overall we will take a flexible approach.        
	The nets session is expected to begin from Sunday and bowling machines will also be pressed into service.

          SANJAY K. JHA                            Somnath Chatterjee                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: Somnath Chatterjee, in probably his last few days in Parliament, has been left shattered by an accusation of partiality from the CPM yesterday.        
	I can tell you this is the worst period of my life, if it has any relevance for this House, the Speaker told the Lok Sabha as soon as it assembled today.        
	Chatterjee did not name the CPM, which expelled him three months ago after a 40-year association, but his target was obvious.        
	The CPM deputy leader in the House, Mohammad Salim, flanked by other party leaders, had told a news conference yesterday that Chatterjee was using his discretionary powers as Speaker for discrimination.        
	I am not an aspirant for anything; personally you can take it that I am out for all purposes, Chatterjee, who is not expected to fight elections any more, told the House today.        
	But I want this institution, which I (have been) associated with for nearly 40 years, to remain. Every day I am going back with a lot of pain and agony from this House.        
	The CPM had created a din yesterday over a rice crisis in Kerala. Chatterjee had rapped CPM member Abdullah Kutty when he kept waving a sheaf of papers without permission, prompting Salims attack.        
	Chatterjee today challenged MPs to cite one instance when I deliberately did not allow any matter which could be raised. Naturally, I will be targeted. I dont mind. My only reply is, please do some self-introspection. Please consider whether all of us are contributing to the functioning of this House. Every day you are getting up; all of you are coming here (to the well). (If) I dont take strong action, Im criticised. If I take very mild action, Im criticised.        
	The outburst had a calming effect and the House, which adjourns tomorrow, was allowed to run today. But the Speaker continued to demonstrate his sense of hurt.        
	During a tiff with the CPMs V. Radhakrishnan, he said: I accept your admonition that the Speaker should not behave in this manner.        
	An embarrassed Radhakrishnan said he did not want to challenge the Speakers authority. Chatterjee retorted: Are you sure? Ask your leader and deputy leader.        
	Salim got the message. He sheepishly asked: Why are you so unkind to me?        
	The atmosphere, however, heated up again over the Kerala grain crisis. All CPM members rose to protest loudly, prompting Chatterjee to threaten punishment yet again. Since I have been abused left and right, I will also start doing this, he said.

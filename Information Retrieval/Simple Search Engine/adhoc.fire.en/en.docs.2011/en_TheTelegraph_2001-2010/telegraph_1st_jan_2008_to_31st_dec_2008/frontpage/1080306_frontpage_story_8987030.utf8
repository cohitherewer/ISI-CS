The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Left set to begin nuclear squeeze
                                                                                                           Left set to begin nuclear squeeze

	New Delhi, March 5: The Left is set to demand an urgent meeting on the nuclear deal and iterate its opposition to operationalising the agreement as it is not prepared to allow the government more time to build a consensus.        
	Top CPM sources told The Telegraph that an urgent meeting was being sought in the backdrop of media reports that a draft safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was ready.        
	A joint committee has not met since November when the Left allowed the government to go ahead with the IAEA talks in Vienna on the condition that no draft agreement would be finalised without first discussing it with the domestic panel.        
	The sources indicated that a statement demanding a meeting could be issued as early as tomorrow, either by the party or by CPM general secretary Prakash Karat. The forthcoming issue of Peoples Democracy, the partys mouthpiece, will carry an editorial explaining the depth of opposition to the deal.        
	The sources said if the government was asked to convene a meeting of the UPA-Left committee, where details of the fifth round of talks with the IAEA would be revealed and discussed, it could upset deadlines the government has set for finalising the deal.        
	Letting the government go ahead with the IAEA talks was only a means to giving it an honourable exit from the deadlock, the sources said.        
	The CPMs eagerness to push matters and underline its opposition comes at a time senior US officials have been prodding the UPA to hurry the deal. Another US official, visiting assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher, said today that time is tight and it would be possible to wrap up the deal only if it reached the US Congress by July. This was also the deadline set by Senator Joe Biden, the head of the US Senates foreign relations committee.        
	The CPM sources said the government has to convene a UPA-Left meeting at the earliest to explain the reported progress on the safeguard talks.        
	The CPM is in consultations with other Left parties to ensure that the Finance Bill is not passed if the government is determined to go ahead with the deal, the sources said.        
	External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee had updated CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury on the successful outcome of the fifth round of negotiations with the IAEA on February 29.        
	But CPM sources said an erroneous impression had been generated that the Left parties have seen the draft agreement.        
	Boucher, who reviewed the progress of the deal with foreign ministry officials, told a media conference: Time is very tight. But I think we can make this happen.        
	On the IAEA negotiations, he said: This is an important piece of puzzle that needs to be put in place. There are other pieces of puzzles that need to be put in place as well.... You start adding these things up and we are kind of playing in overtime right now.        
	In an obvious reference to the possible opposition that can come from Scandinavian countries at the Nuclear Suppliers Group, Boucher said: There are going to be a lot of questions in the NSG. But we believe India should be brought into the non-proliferation mainstream.

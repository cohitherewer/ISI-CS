          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 16: The government has refused a nuns demand for a CBI probe into her alleged rape saying the matter was sub-judice.        
	The matter is pending in the Supreme Court, said chief minister Naveen Patnaik, when reporters sought his reaction on the nuns demand. But he neither confirmed nor denied receiving a letter from the nun expressing her lack of faith on the state police and seeking a CBI probe in the case.        
	Her demand was first reported in a news agency which quoted her stating she would be happy if the matter was handed over to the CBI. She had added that she would not like to meet the state police that remained a mute witness of her predicament.        
	The nun wrote from a hospital, as she is yet to recover from the shock, Archbishop Raphael Cheenath told the news agency.         
	Cheenath also confirmed that he had filed a petition in the apex court praying for the transfer of the case.        
	On the night of August 25, the 28-year-old nun and one Father Chellan was beaten up by a mob at K-Nuagaon and few of the accused raped her. Though the two lodged a case on August 26, the state police sat on the case till October 3, when they arrested four men.        
	A police team who had travelled to Kerala to trace the nun, who went missing after the incident, has not been able to find her. Earlier, efforts of a another team, headed by an inspector-general, had also failed.         
	The only eyewitness to the crime, Father Chellan, who is under treatment in Kerala, has also refused to co-operate with the police, said deputy superintendent of police Jayashree Kundu, who had led the group.         
	The visiting crime branch team had, however, succeeded in arresting the main accused, Mitu Patnaik, and co-accused Muna Ghadei and Saroj Ghadei from a mill in Kerala. The absence of the nun, however, is hampering the investigations and identification of the culprits.        
	Meanwhile, the Global Council of Indian Christians has urged the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to constitute a special investigation team to probe the nuns rape, the murder of Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati and his associates and ensuing violence in the state.        
	Talking to The Telegraph today, council president Sajjan K. George said he had met NHRC chairman Justice S. Rajender Babu on October 14 in New Delhi to request for an investigation team under the direct supervision of the commission.

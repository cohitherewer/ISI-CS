                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Curry crisis on Commons platter
          AMIT ROY                       The annual curry lunch at Washington Hotel in Mayfair                          
	London, April 25: When Gordon Brown addressed the annual curry lunch of the Labour Friends of India a few days ago, he mingled for an hour and delivered an important speech and had to leave before the meal was served but his cabinet colleagues and dozens of MPs tucked into some choice dishes.         
	Joginder Sangar, the proprietor of Washington Hotel in Mayfair where the party was held, said: We have 40 chefs, of whom 14 are Indian. The meal was prepared by our head chef, Rajesh Rao.         
	Rao (ex-Meridien Hotel from Delhi) outlined what he had served: Canapes: fish amritsari and chips, onion bhaji, chicken tikka, papdi chaat; main: kachumber salad, boondi raita, dhaniwal korma (chicken with fresh green coriander), marzwangan korma (lamb with Kashmiri red chilli), meen moilee (mild fish curry with coconut milk), chatpate aloo (tangy potato), paneer butter masala (Indian cottage cheese in a smooth tomato gravy), langarwali daal (mixed lentil), vegetable pulao, naan; dessert: hot gulab jamun, vanilla ice-cream, fresh fruit salad.         
	Although Labour politicians were probably the first to take up curry in a serious fashion, Indian cuisine now cuts across party lines. In fact, curry is now a national obsession.         
	Yesterday, for example, at the Guildhall in the city of London, food entrepreneur Sir Gulam Noon provided food free of charge for 1,100 guests, including Prince Charles, who attended the Lord Mayors Curry Lunch in aid of the Army Benevolent Fund.         
	The Lord Mayor, Alderman David Lewis, who has just returned from a trip to India, called the event the worlds biggest curry lunch.         
	Noon told The Telegraph: I served chicken labadar, chicken marinated and stuffed with mature cheddar, tandoori paneer makhni, pilau Basmati, proper paratha, not naan, mango chutney, and mango kulfi.         
	Everyone loved it, laughed Noon. They asked, Where can we get it?         
	The answer might be Calcutta or Mumbai. This is because Britain has been hit by a deepening crisis over curry.         
	Under the governments new points based immigration rules, newcomers coming into Britain from outside the European Union have to demonstrate a number of skills, including the ability to speak English.         
	Although the top Indian chefs from the Taj and Oberoi groups are able to do so, Bangladeshis especially fall at this barrier. The governments solution is apparently to urge Bangladeshi restaurants, which constitute the majority of the Indian curry houses in the country, to employ Poles and other East Europeans. The latter, experience has shown, simply cannot do the job.         
	The Prime Ministers preferred solution is to train British people to work in the industry. However, British Bangladeshis do not want to work the long hours their fathers and uncles have tolerated over decades in hot kitchens, often putting up with abusive lager louts.         
	The curry crisis was debated in the Commons yesterday where Labours Diane Abbott (Hackney N and Stoke Newington), said if British people were to keep enjoying the delicious food they had been used to, chefs had to keep coming from the region where the food was from.         
	Immigration minister Liam Byrne said a balance had to be struck between bringing in skilled workers from outside the European Economic Area and training up British workers.         
	Abbott hit back: There are concerns within Chinese restaurants and South Asian restaurants that your department is saying to them, You must recruit Polish and Latvian cooks and they insist that to have the sort of delicious South Asian food which British people have been accustomed to over the years you really do have to recruit cooks from the region. There is a desperate shortage of them now.         
	The Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, Keith Vaz, said it was estimated that there were 9,500 Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants and takeaways in the UK employing 72,000 people with an annual turnover of 3.2 billion. But there were more than 27,000 vacancies in Bangladeshi restaurants.         
	Unfortunately the crisis is something that has been created by this government through the points based system, Vaz alleged.         
	Each year the restaurant sector has to recruit several thousand new staff. Where once they were able to turn to the subcontinent to find talented chefs brought up with the spices and cooking methods that made a great curry they now have to fill the vacancies, sadly from within the EU. These skills are simply not available within the EU. The skills are not here  the skills are in the subcontinent.

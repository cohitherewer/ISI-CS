  - Meet to finalise rehab plan for 67000        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                                    
	Ranchi, May 6: The state government is ready with a rehabilitation package for over 60,000 families who would have to be shifted out of Jharia where an underground fire, raging since 1916, is estimated to have consumed 37 million tonnes of high grade coking coal valued at Rs 3,000 crore.        
	Acting in tandem with Coal India Limited (CIL), the Madhu Koda government is finally ready with the Rs 4,000-crore package egged on as it was by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh no less during his recent Bokaro visit.        
	State mines and geology secretary Jaishankar Tiwary told The Telegraph that 67,000 families would have to be shifted to a safe zone. We will have to declare the zone as unsafe before we begin the relocation, he said.        
	Implementation of the Jharia Action Plan would be finalised tomorrow at a meeting between chief secretary A.K. Basu and CIL chairman Partho Bhattacharya. The chairman and managing director of Bharat Coking Coal Ltd (BCCL), which owns the raging mines, would also be present.         
	We want CIL to agree to it before we get a cabinet approval for our proposal, Tiwary maintained.         
	According to Tiwary, there were three components to the action plan  douse the underground fire, shift the affected families, and thirdly, relocate the highways, and railway tracks that pass over the Jharia coalfields.        
	The state government, the mines secretary pointed out, was asked to relocate only those who werent employees of BCCL. We have identified 67,000 families, 23,000 of them are unauthorised landholders. Besides, there are 658 public buildings, like schools, dharamshalas among others, which have to be relocated, he said.         
	The rehabilitation package, BCCLs original proposal reworked in the light of the new national R amp;R policy, and the action plan would be implemented through the Jharia rehabilitation development authority headed by the North Chhotanagpur commissioner.         
	Around Rs 4,000 crore would have to be spent over the next 10 years. While CIL would contribute Rs 2,500 crore, the rest would come from coal conservation and development fund.        
	One of the issues that would be discussed tomorrow was the quantum of relief. In its original proposal for the oustees, BCCL sought daily wages for each of them for the next two years, creation of adequate infrastructure facilities at the new habitations, vocational training and adequate compensation.        
	BCCL wants to stick to the old proposals, said Tiwary. However, we are telling them to make a one-time payment to every oustee so that they could get some capital to begin a new venture, he added.

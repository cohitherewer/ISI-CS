	K.G. Subramanyan, who is one of the most cerebral artists of our times and is equally at home in Santiniketan and Vadodara, on Paritosh Sen. Manida, as he is popularly known, lives in Vadodara.         
	I have known him for long years. He was a good friend of mine. When I was the dean of faculty at MS University in Baroda (from 1968 to 1974), Paritosh Sen was one of the visiting professors. At that time, a film made on him was shown and everyone liked it. He was one person who had many parts. He was a very articulate man.        
	Earlier, when I was in better health, I did not leave Calcutta without meeting him. I have visited him several times at his flat in Raja Basanta Roy Road, where he lived earlier. I have also dropped by at his flat in Alipore. The last time we met was when he released my book of poems. That was I think two years ago. Unfortunately, he was too poorly to sit through the entire programme. He had breathing problems and a bad back.        
	The wonderful thing about him was that he was a great motivator of young people. I have heard that he gave young artists very useful critical advice.        
	He was one of the major artists of this generation. You might not agree with everything he did but he was definitely one of the most challenging figures of our times. He was one of those persons who had a social consciousness. He could look at human life with a lot of involvement. He was a mixture of the involved and the critical.        
	He was a remarkable writer. He could bring to life whatever he wrote about. He had written a series of articles on Indian art down the ages, including articles on Kalighat patas. This is the kind of thing I find very difficult.

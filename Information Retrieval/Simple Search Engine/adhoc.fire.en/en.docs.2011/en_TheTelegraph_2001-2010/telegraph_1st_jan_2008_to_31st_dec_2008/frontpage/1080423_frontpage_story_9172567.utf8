	Bokaro, April 22: Setting the course for a rejuvenated Bokaro Steel Plant, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today expressed the hope that rising steel production from the SAIL unit would not only benefit Jharkhand, but also help India to be on a par with some of the top steel producing nations of the world.         
	Advocating a new era of industrialisation in the state, the Prime Minister announced a couple of new trains and three new, world class, four-laned highways  Barhi-Jamshedpur, Hazaribagh-Ranchi-Jamshedpur and Ranchi-Vijaywada  for quick mobility of raw materials and finished products.        
	He said the Centre would support the state in setting up two major power plants with a combined capacity to generate 5,000MW.         
	He also promised to set up a medical college in Bokaro, six engineering colleges in the state, a central university and an Indian Institute of Management (IIM).        
	The Prime Minister began the day by laying the foundation stone of Bokaro Steels Rs 11,000-crore modernisation and expansion plans to raise production capacity from 4.5 million tonnes to 7 million tonnes by 2010.        
	He then went to Jamshedpur to take part in the Tata Steel centenary celebrations and unveil a special postage stamp to commemorate the occasion.        
	Though we are prospering ahead in this field, the pace needs to be accelerated if we want to be on a par with most developed countries of the world, he said in Bokaro about steel production. With increase in consumption of steel each day, production needs to be enhanced at a fast pace.                     
	While extolling the virtues of the mineral-rich state, he however, stressed on stable, dedicated governance to ensure the people of the state were not left out of the development process.        
	With a vast store of minerals like iron ore, coal, copper, graphite, uranium, bauxite, natural forests and adequate manpower, Singh hoped the day was not far when Jharkhand could be counted among the most developed states of the country.        
	However, he was sad to note that as a backward region, Jharkhand could not get Rs 700 crore in central funds as it had failed to conduct panchayat elections for years.         
	On the long-pending Jharia rehabilitation programme which could have benefitted more than 90,000 families, Singh blamed the state government for not finalising the rehabilitation policy.         
	Later, Singh also launched the Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Programme by switching on power supply in two villages of Bokaro district, Obra and Pordag. During his visit to Bokaro, Singh was accompanied by steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan, his state counterpart Jatin Prasad and Union ministers Subodh Kant Sahay and Rameshwar Oraon.        
	Among the others who were present, were chief minister Madhu Koda, Governor Syed Sibtey Razi all of whom reached here around 12 noon to be welcomed by UPA state convener Shibu Soren and Bokaro Steel MD V.K. Srivastav.

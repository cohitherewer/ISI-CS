	Berlin, July 5: An angry Berliner fought off guards and beheaded a life-sized waxwork of Adolf Hitler only minutes after the Nazi dictators model went on public display at a newly opened branch of Madame Tussauds in the city.         
	Police said the attacker, a 41-year-old German man, walked up to the figure of Hitler who was depicted looking downcast and sitting morosely at a table his Berlin bunker, and first appeared to wrestle with the waxwork.         
	Berhard Schrodowski, a Berlin police spokesman added: The museum guards tried to restrain him, but he fought them off and then tore off the waxwork figures head. Afterwards several visitors to the exhibition managed to restrain him, he added. Police were called to the museum and the man was arrested shortly afterwards. Police said he would be charged with causing wilful damage to property.         
	They said he had told them that he wanted to demonstrate against the public display of the Hitler model.         
	The decision to return Hitler to Berlin, even as a waxwork, has provoked a storm of controversy in the German capital, with many critics arguing that the Nazi leader was still too objectionable to be shown at all.         
	Some historians claimed that a waxwork Hitler was an attempt to turn history into entertainment.         
	As a result, the organisers of the Berlin Madame Tussauds deliberately chose to depict Hitler in his bunker and close to defeat rather than punching the air and standing face to face with Winston Churchill, as he is portrayed in the London branch of the museum.         
	Susanne Keller, the Berlin exhibitions director had insisted: We would hate him to become the centre of attention. Visitors to the Berlin waxwork show were banned from posing or being photographed with the Hitler figure who was displayed in a roped off corner of the museum next to a picture of Berlins bombed out Reichstag building.         
	A spokesman at the citys Madame Tussauds said the Hitler section of the museum would remained closed until further notice.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Lalgarh (West Midnapore), Nov. 11: Headmaster Asim Ganguly woke up on November 4 morning to hear two of his Class VIII students had been arrested in connection with the Maoist blast two days earlier. He couldnt believe his ears.        
	They are normal, innocent boys who wouldnt dream of doing anything subversive, the head of Vivekananda Vidyapith in Kanthapahari, Lalgarh, said today. The police action was absurd, cruel and high-handed.        
	The arrest of the two 14-year-olds and a friend  and police raids that led to women being beaten up  were the main reason Lalgarhs villagers have dug up roads, Nandigram style, to keep the administration at bay.        
	Buddhadeb Patra and Goutam Patra were picked up with Aben Murmu  a 15-year-old Class VIII student from Ramakrishna High School  on November 3 night on suspicion of links with the Maoists who had tried to bomb the chief ministers car the day before.        
	All three were freed on bail four days later but Ganguly hasnt yet recovered from the shock. Why didnt the police get in touch with me first? Ive taught these boys and watched over them for so many years now  wouldnt I know what sort they were?        
	Perhaps to give their action a semblance of credibility, the police had initially bloated the ages of the boys by four years each to 18, 18 and 19. However, the man they dragged out of bed at 3 the next morning in Barapelia village was 62.        
	Retired teacher Khamananda Mahato, who used to teach at Gangulys school, said: Some 200 armed policemen surrounded my house, their faces covered with black cloth. They ordered me to accompany them.        
	Mahatos wife was ill and he requested them to wait till morning, but they would not agree. At Lalgarh police station, he was asked to identify a man he had never seen, and was held till 4pm. Mahato today said he was still traumatised.        
	Mastermoshai was a very popular teacher. Its absurd to link him to any anti-national activity, Ganguly, 40, said of his former colleague.        
	District police chief Rajesh Kumar Singh admitted the arrests and the detention were mistakes. He said: We had no evidence and so did not oppose the boys bail plea. We also dropped their names from the chargesheet.        
	Mahato, Singh added, lives in an area that is a Maoist corridor; so we thought he might know some of the suspects. Later we realised that he didnt.        
	The boys said they were returning from a baul performance at Kanthapahari, 4km from their home in Banshber, around 11pm when armed policemen pounced on them.        
	They threw me by the collar inside a van, flat on the floor, my face shoved between their boots. Not a single question was asked, not who we were, or where we were from, Aben said.        
	Within minutes, Goutam and Buddhadeb too were flung inside the van and, like Aben, lay prone on the floor.        
	I was so frightened, I started crying, Goutam said. A policeman prodded me with his boot and shouted he would kick me to death unless I stopped. I tried to smother my sobs and then the van started moving.        
	At Salboni police station, when the boys were repeatedly asked to name their dadas (Maoist seniors), one of them, clueless about what they were being asked, replied he didnt have a dada (elder brother).        
	The police slapped us and beat us but they got nothing out of us because we didnt know anything, Buddhadeb said.        
	After some time, they were pushed into the lock-up. One night here, and youll be talking tomorrow, a policeman said.        
	The boys were charged with waging war against the country, causing hurt with dangerous weapons and attempt to murder.        
	How could the police think my son would do any such thing? wept Pratima Patra, Goutams mother, at her mud hut. I went to Lalgarh and fell at officers feet but they wouldnt listen.        
	The boys were released only when village after village erupted in protest. The agitators today dug up a road in Salboni and continued blocking the Midnapore-Bandwan highway despite a promise yesterday to repair it.

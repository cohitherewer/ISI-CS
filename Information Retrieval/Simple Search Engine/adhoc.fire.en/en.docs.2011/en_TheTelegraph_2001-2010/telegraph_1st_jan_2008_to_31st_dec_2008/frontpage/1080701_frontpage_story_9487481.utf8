          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, June 30: Two old adversaries from Uttar Pradesh might be preparing to bail out a third as the crisis over the Indo-US nuclear deal heads to a flashpoint.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party (SP) and Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) have both hinted they could help the Congress muster the numbers in the Lok Sabha and fend off early polls in case the Left withdraws support to the Manmohan Singh government.        
	Support will come at the cost of a bargain  spoken or unspoken  but the two could make the Congress feel a lot better as it struggles to save both the deal and the government.         
	The SP has 39 members in the Lok Sabha and the RLD three. Their backing will leave the Congress in need of only a manageable few.        
	SP general secretary Amar Singh arrived from the US today to take his partys slow rapprochement with the Congress a step further, saying that it was time to think of the lesser evil  which, in the SPs lexicon, is the Congress because it believes the BJP and the BSP, its main adversaries in Uttar Pradesh, to be the greater evil.        
	If the Prime Minister of India wants to engage in discussions, it is not wrong to talk (to him). You may agree to disagree but non-communication is the worst thing in politics, he said.        
	Amar also called on foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee tonight and held talks for at least 30 minutes.        
	The United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA), of which the SP is the core, is meeting formally on July 3 to decide its view on the nuclear deal. It is quite possible the SP will not take a pro-deal view and yet resolve to support the UPA government on the plea that it wants to keep the BJP-BSP threat at bay.         
	Sources in the party have been indicating as much for days now. Mulayam, too, has kept the door open for talks with the Congress.         
	The Left parties have been lobbying Mulayam not to vote for the deal, but sources say they havent been able to secure any commitment.        
	The RLD leader, Ajit Singh, known for his flip-flops, is also keen on striking a deal with the Congress in return for his support on the Lok Sabha floor. With elections not far away, he could be seeking to be part of an anti-BJP/anti-BSP seat-sharing alliance with the Congress and the SP.         
	Ajit Singh, son of the late Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, may only have three MPs at his command but he is adept at maximising the play of his numbers.

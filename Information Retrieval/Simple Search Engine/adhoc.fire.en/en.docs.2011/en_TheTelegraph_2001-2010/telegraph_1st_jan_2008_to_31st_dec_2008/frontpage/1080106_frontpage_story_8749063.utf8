  - India denies racist abuse          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                    
	Sydney, Jan. 5: As dusk settled, fireworks across this seductive city marked the start of the 2008 Summer Festival.        
	There could be more fireworks at the SCG tomorrow evening, though, during the hearing called by match referee Mike Procter to determine whether Harbhajan Singh hurled a racist abuse at Andrew Symonds.        
	The charge pertains to a standoff between the two yesterday. If guilty of calling the Australian a monkey, viewed as highly offensive in these parts, then Harbhajan stands to pay dearly.        
	The hearing was to have been today, but Team India manager Chetan Chauhan got it deferred so that Harbhajan could focus on the second Test which is at a critical stage.        
	Also, it would allow the team management time to prepare an appropriate response.        
	However, its not entirely insignificant that Procter (who was the match referee during the August 2006 fiasco at The Oval) has been ticked off by the International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive, Malcolm Speed, for letting off Yuvraj Singh at the MCG.        
	Having made the allegation, seen by many as part of their mind games strategy, the Australians have gone on the offensive.        
	Indeed, senior pro Matthew Hayden went to the extent of declaring: We believe weve got a very strong case.... Its a situation none of us likes and I hope it doesnt overshadow good cricket....        
	It already has.        
	Harbhajan declined to comment, but Chauhan did respond. Theyre the complainants, so theyll claim they have a very strong case.... Im confident my boy didnt say anything offensive.... Moreover, why would he?        
	There has been no love lost between Harbhajan and Symonds for some time (it was evident during the recent ODIs in India too), but word is also getting around that the charge is probably part of Australias larger game plan: To keep the offie, who has an excellent record against them, away from the 22 yards.        
	The mind games shouldnt cross limits.... The world is seeing how Harbhajan is repeatedly getting Australias best batsman  captain Ricky Ponting  out.... It happened this morning as well, pointed out somebody associated with Team India.        
	To his credit, Harbhajan didnt allow the hearing-sword to affect his bowling on the second Tests penultimate day. In what gave him much joy, which manifested itself in celebrations seen more on soccer fields, he got Ponting (the complainant) yet again.        
	Harbhajan, by the way, draws inspiration from Shaheed Bhagat Singh.        
	The allegation has surprised Australians too. I must confess Ive been surprised.... I played against India a number of times but never heard a racist comment from any player, former captain Mark Taylor told The Telegraph.        
	Taylor, who was Australias captain when Harbhajan made his debut in March 1998, added: Whatever the outcome, I hope this whole business doesnt mar the rest of the Test series and the tour.        
	Apparently, theres no audio evidence to establish the charge and, so, it will be one persons word against the other. In such a scenario, how can anything be proved?        
	Both sides have, of course, lined up witnesses. Sachin Tendulkar, who was the other batter when the showdown occurred, is from Harbhajans side while Ponting, vice-captain Adam Gilchrist, Hayden and Michael Clarke will depose against Harbhajan.        
	Captain Anil Kumble, Chauhan and assistant manager Dr M.V. Sridhar will also be part of the defence team. It wont surprise if they raise the issue of the Australians themselves frequently crossing the line.        
	Surely, what they do cant be passed off as gamesmanship if other teams are to be nailed.         
	Realising, perhaps, that a Pandoras box could open, the ICC has assigned legal eagle Nigel Peters to assist Procter and the rest in matters of procedure.        
	I dont know what exactly happened.... I only got to know of the allegation from this mornings papers.... Theres a lot of quality in Harbhajan.... Hes a competitive guy and all men arent the same.... Thats the way he is.... Thats the way we are, said former captain Sourav Ganguly.        
	If anybody knows the Sardar well, its Sourav.

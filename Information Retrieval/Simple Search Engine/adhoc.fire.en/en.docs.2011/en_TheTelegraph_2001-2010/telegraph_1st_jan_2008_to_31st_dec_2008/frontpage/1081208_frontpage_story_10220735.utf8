	London, Dec. 7: The demise of Jemima Khans relationship with Hugh Grant does not appear to have scared her away from men in the public eye. James Goldsmiths 33-year-old daughter has struck up an intriguing friendship with Guy Ritchie.         
	They have become very fond of each other, says one mutual chum.        
	The film director, 40, announced his separation from Madonna in October after eight years of marriage. The couple were granted a divorce last month.        
	Madonna, 50, said they had not been living at the same address for the previous six months.         
	Last week, Ritchie and Jemima attended a dinner party at the Notting Hill home of Matthew Freud, the founder of Freud Communications, at which Stings wife, Trudie Styler was also a guest.         
	Trudie had introduced Ritchie to Madonna at a dinner party at her house in Wiltshire in 1999.         
	It is understood that Ritchie was, however, introduced to Jemima by Arpad Arki Busson, the financier and former boyfriend of model and actress Elle Macpherson.

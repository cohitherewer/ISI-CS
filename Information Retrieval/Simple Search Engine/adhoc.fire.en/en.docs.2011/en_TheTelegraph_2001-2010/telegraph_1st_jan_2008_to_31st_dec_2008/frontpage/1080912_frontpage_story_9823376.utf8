          SAMBIT SAHA AND INDRANIL GHOSH                               
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: The government plans to sound out the Tatas on the possibility of sparing a few slices from within the project site to break the land deadlock, sources said.        
	The Trinamul Congress has privately conceded that their demand for 300 acres was not realistic. However, the party has conveyed to the government members on the committee that the possibility of setting aside land meant for environment projects and some vendors should be explored.        
	The land includes a 30-acre pond, a green patch left for afforestation in line with pollution control norms and 15 acres in the vendor park where land-filling has not been done yet. This is over and above the 40 acres the government said it could find.        
	The pond was dug to meet a requirement set by the collector to make up for the water bodies filled while the complex was being built. The government representatives said it would be difficult to shift the pond but agreed to request the government to check with the Tatas whether it could be done.        
	The Tatas have repeatedly ruled out return of land if it affected the integrity of the mother plant and the vendor park.        
	The states representatives requested the Opposition members to explore the idea of higher compensation with their leadership.        
	The Trinamul team was told of the need for haste amid unconfirmed reports that some items have been moved out of the Tata plant. However, in public, the Trinamul members dropped hints that the committees task might not be over by Monday.         
	As the committee wrapped up the third days work, Trinamul singled out industries minister Nirupam Sen for target practice, setting in motion a slow-burn campaign the government fears will force the Tatas to roll out the Nano from outside Bengal.        
	We will tell the chief minister that his industries minister has not been sharing details with us. If the details are not made available, we will have no option but to launch a campaign against the Tatas, leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee said. We are not happy with merely the reproduced text without the annexures.        
	However, sources said the partys real intention in picking out Sen was to create a perception that the chief minister and the industries minister were at odds on Singur.        
	There are reasons to believe that the chief minister is in favour of accommodating our demand for land within the project area but Nirupambabu is standing in the way, said Chatterjee.        
	Some Trinamul leaders felt that the cauldron would be kept boiling close to the pujas, following which it would be put on simmer.        
	But by then, government sources concede, the Tatas might decide to launch the inaugural batch of Nanos from elsewhere and continue the suspension of work at Singur.

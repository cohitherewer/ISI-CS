The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PM sheds Bengal kid gloves
                                                                                                           PM sheds Bengal kid gloves
  - Carrot policy yielding little, Singh said to be reworking engagement rules         RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                                    
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: The Prime Minister is rewriting the rules of engagement with the Left and the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, having apparently realised that carrots to Bengal need not save him from Prakash Karats stick, sources said.        
	Manmohan Singh had hoped the chief minister would use Bengals clout within the Left to get an okay for the Indo-US nuclear deal, a source told The Telegraph. But Buddhadeb has not delivered.        
	The perceived change of tack in Delhi need not tell on ties immediately; the shift will be more of a shot across the Lefts bows, other sources said. But pending projects in Bengal could feel the heat as the Prime Minister might no longer feel compelled to go out of his way to clear bottlenecks and cut red tape, the sources added.        
	If Singh implements the new policy, the changes are expected to manifest themselves in three ways:        
	 The Prime Minister will speak directly to CPM general secretary Karat and not depend on a second, third or fourth channel        
	 He will not go out of his way to indulge Bhattacharjee but just be civil        
	 Delhi will not pro-actively push things for the Bengal government.        
	The new rules may kick in before the budget session if the Prime Minister needs to sound the Left on the annual financial exercise and the bills the government wants to push.        
	The undeclared shift could mean disappointment for Bengal. The Centre may not treat as special cases the proposals for a deep-sea port in Haldia and a petrochemical hub in Nayachar, an official source said. Bhattacharjee had brought them up when he met Singh on February 6 but he just heard him out, the source said.        
	Political sources contrasted the Bengal Lefts failure to wangle concessions for its government with N. Chandrababu Naidus expertise in getting quick decisions out of the NDA regime. The Telugu Desam Party supported the BJP-led government from outside  as the Left does for the UPA ministry  but that had never handicapped Naidu.        
	The Left had botched its own case for the deep-sea port by antagonising the DMK during the last budget session. Left MPs had prevented the shipping and surface transport minister, T.R. Baalu of the DMK, from tabling a bill for a marine university in Tamil Nadu, saying it should be set up in Calcutta instead.        
	Since then, the minister has ignored the requests on the deep-sea port, although the state remains hopeful that clearances will be expedited.         
	A railway freight corridor that Bengal wanted extended from Ludhiana to Calcutta port has been put off till a pre-feasibility study is done.        
	The cabinet had approved the plan in principle, as it has done with several others on Bengals wish list, such as upgrading the Teesta river project and inter-linking national highways 34 and 117 (see chart).        
	Other likely casualties include the demands for a university in Muslim-dominated Murshidabad and the revival of two sick public-sector wagon companies, Burn Standard and M.S. Braithwaite.        
	A cabinet meeting on February 8 decided to revive a sick railway PSU, but it is located in Bihar, not Bengal.        
	Some sources, who have access to both the Prime Minister and Left leaders, claim they had all along warned Singh that his strategy  promising to fulfil Bhattacharjees demands when he wanted to place something unpalatable on the Lefts table  would not work.        
	Singh, however, had worked on the premise that it was more politic for the CPM to work with a friendly government and not unsettle it and make way for the BJP or an amorphous non-Congress, non-BJP coalition. He didnt realise, the sources said, that Karat was keenest on the last option.

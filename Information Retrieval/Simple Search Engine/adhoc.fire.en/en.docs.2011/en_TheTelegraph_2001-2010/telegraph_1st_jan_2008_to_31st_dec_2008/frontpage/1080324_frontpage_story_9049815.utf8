          OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES                            Monks, who are not allowed to vote in Bhutan, outside a polling station in Thimpu. (PTI)                                  
	Phuentsholing/Thimpu, March 23: A keen contest is likely as Bhutan steps nervously into the modern world tomorrow, holding its first parliamentary elections to end a century of absolute monarchy.        
	And no one, apart from the king who is giving up his power, seems happy about it.        
	Candidates proudly call themselves monarchists. Party workers describe the vote as heartbreaking. Voters fret about what will become of the country when it trades its Precious Ruler for politicians.        
	Bhutan is voting only because the king said it should.        
	No one wants this election, said candidate Yeshi Zimba as he campaigned door-to-door in Thimpu. His Majesty has guided us this far, and people are asking, Why change now?        
	After the election, King Jigme Kesar Namgyal Wangchuk, 28, will remain head of state and likely retain much influence. But elected leaders will be in charge, a fact that worries many here who have seen the disastrous democracies in Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the often corrupt and chaotic politics of India.        
	Former king Jigme Singye Wangchuk virtually forced democracy on Bhutan by releasing the draft of a new constitution in March 2005. He then deposed in favour of his son.        
	A study in 2006 ranked Bhutan as the eighth happiest country in the world. Most people credit royal rule.        
	Change, therefore, will be gradual. Just two parties have been allowed to compete in the elections, so each of the 47 constituencies has just two candidates.        
	Both parties are staying close to the kings vision, featuring leaders who each twice served as Prime Minister under royal rule. Both are promoting the Bhutanese idea of Gross National Happiness, a political philosophy that seeks to balance material progress with spiritual well-being.        
	Its a tough choice, said businessman Kinley Penjor, 42. Both leaders are good men.        
	Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Sangay Ngedup, 58, has served as agriculture, health and education ministers and his record has won him the support of many older, rural voters.        
	He is also a member of the royal family, the brother of one of Wangchuks four wives.        
	His rival is Jigmi Thinley, who put flesh on the kings concept of Gross National Happiness.        
	Thinleys Druk Phuensum Tshogpa (DPT) pitches itself as the party of ordinary Bhutanese and takes a subtle dig at Ngedups weak spot  some of his relatives in the extended royal family lack the same support as the new king and his father.        
	We are not royalty, DPT candidate Yeshey Zimba said. We are ordinary people like anyone else.        
	Young, urban, educated Bhutanese say they love the king but not all his relatives by marriage. If the king has to stand aside, they do not want his relatives to fill the breach.        
	Ngedup being one of the royal family, we do not believe in him, said a 26-year-old man. Ranbahadur Ghole, a farmer, disagreed: Its the PDP that can preserve the traditional culture of our nation.        
	Bhutans border with Bengal was sealed last night for the 9am-5pm voting and will reopen at 6am on Tuesday after the results are out. The polls, with 318,465 voters, will be watched by 42 international observers and an army of reporters.        
	I think democracy will be good, said businessman Penjor. In the past if you went to a minister about your problems  well there is always a little bit of corruption, even in Bhutan, or it might be decided according to his mood. Now we can elect the best candidates.

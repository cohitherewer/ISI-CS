	New Delhi, Feb. 25: The Centre hurried through an ordinance last week allowing railway minister Lalu Prasad to acquire land for special projects without state governments approval.        
	Today, on the eve of the railway budget, Lalu Prasad announced about a dozen special projects, of which at least four are for his home state.        
	There could be even more for Bihar since the list includes unspecified east and west sections of the Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC). The east section is likely to cover Bihar extensively.        
	Sources said there was some opposition within the government about issuing an ordinance less than a week before Parliament convened. The Land Acquisition Special Powers Act, issued on February 19, amends the Railway Act, 1989.        
	The ordinance says a committee will be nominated to ensure reasonableness of compensation and make certain that there are enough grounds to acquire land. The catch: the committee will be appointed by the railways and its head will be a railway official, probably the general manager of the relevant zone.        
	Certain provisions will ensure that the land is transferred to the railways even if the titleholders initiate litigation, an official said.        
	What has happened is highly improper, a bureaucrat said. The ordinance was not emergent in nature.        
	He said an amendment bill was pending with the parliamentary committee on railways. It was to be tabled this budget session. There was no hurry other than placating Lalu Prasad.        
	The minister announced the special projects a day before he presents the budget.        
	Among the projects are five in Kerala, two in Maharashtra that include the doubling of the Panvel-Pen-Roha line, and an unspecified number for the DFCs east and west sections.        
	The four projects in Bihar are: Patna-Ganga bridge, Hajipur-Vaishali-Sagauli line, Marauhara diesel engine workshop and Madhepura electric engine workshop.        
	Most of these projects were announced earlier and were pending because of problems in acquiring land. Now Lalu Prasad will not have any problems, the bureaucrat said.        
	He added that the DFCs alignment had not yet been finalised and as of now, the railways do not even know where exactly they need to acquire land for Lalu Prasads pet project. But they have conveniently included it in the list so that there is no trouble when the alignment is fixed.        
	Sources said Lalu Prasad had made the Planning Commission unhappy by getting some 10 new and unprofitable railway lines for Bihar approved by the cabinet committee on economic affairs last Friday.        
	These will be among 25 new lines he is expected to announce in the budget, and include Sitamarhi-Jaynagar-Nirmali via Susand, Muzaffarpur-Katra-Orai-Janakpur Road, Gaya-Daltonganj and Darbhanga-Muzaffarpur.        
	Sources said Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia had objected to the new lines, saying they would lead to losses.        
	The railway ministry had earlier decided that projects would not be considered viable unless they brought at least a 14 per cent profit.

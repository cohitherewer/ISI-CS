  - Lunch amp; music help create informal atmosphere          VIVEK CHHETRI                                     
	Singla (Bengal-Sikkim border), March 12: An interactive session, interspersed with lunch and music, was how the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha would like to describe its gathering on the banks of the Rangit today.        
	The idea was to develop a personal relationship with cadres who have worked tirelessly for the past six months. We wanted to hear them speak their minds in an informal atmosphere, said Roshan Giri, the general secretary of the Morcha. No public address system was in place, nor were there any sombre speeches. In a reversal of roles, Gurung stood listening as party workers shared their experiences.         
	Hundreds of Morcha supporters holding various portfolios in local village committees came here, 33km from Darjeeling, on vehicles decorated with the party colours. A music system set up next to a hastily constructed dais belted out popular Nepali songs. Young Morcha members danced till late in the evening.         
	Apart from party members, the Morcha had also invited professionals from different walks of life. The invitees garlanded Gurung with khadas (traditional silk scarves) and the Morcha leader obliged everyone who wanted to be clicked with him.         
	Lunch consisted of rice, dal and mutton.         
	Tenzing Khambachey, a Morcha central committee member from the Tungsung area of Darjeeling town, said the experience was rewarding, especially after months of agitation.         
	We were constantly on our toes because of developments that followed one after the other: the indefinite hunger-strike, the tabling of the standing committee report and then Ghisingh (GNLF chief Subash Ghisingh) trying to garner support for the bill. Today, our president listened to the cadres and their requirements, Khambachey said.

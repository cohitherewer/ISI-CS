  - Sourav rules out second thoughts after century          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Punch at the bosses? Ganguly exults after scoring his century. (AP)                                        
	Chandigarh, Oct. 18: Sourav Ganguly had barely finished a sada dosa and was into his first cup of Darjeeling tea when somebody knocked on his Taj hotel door.        
	It was one-time protege Harbhajan Singh, whod come with friends who wished to be photographed with Dada.        
	Realising that somebody from the media was also in the room, one said: Aap sab shor karen... Dada should take back his retirement... Look at the way he got his (16th Test) hundred today.        
	The former India captain grinned, but the Harbhajan friend had echoed a sentiment that kept doing the rounds in neighbouring Mohali, which is hosting the second Test, throughout the day.        
	Asked by the media whether he would reconsider retiring at the end of this four-Test series, Sourav reiterated what hed conveyed to The Telegraph yesterday: No review. Ive made the right decision and there are no regrets. I just dont want to play any more. It has been a personal decision.        
	However, when somebody wanted to know if he would respond to a call and serve the country later this season, Sourav replied: Well cross the bridge when it comes.        
	That set the cat among the pigeons, so to say, with many scrambling to read between the lines. Later, Sourav told this reporter that any comment on the retirement issue could ignite a controversy.         
	My mind really is made up, he insisted.        
	One of the selectors, by the way, responded by saying: Sourav has decided to retire and I think we should allow him to do so like a king... After such a personal decision, there cant be ifs and buts... I wont encourage speculation.        
	Souravs 102 wont be remembered as among his finest, but given the circumstances (163 for four), will still be special. Of course, he should have gone for a really big one, instead of holing out soon after reaching three figures.        
	Bottomline, though, is Sourav got those runs and Sachin Tendulkar, for one, termed the hundred excellent and very important for the team.        
	Sourav said: Its not the most memorable, but one that Ill cherish... Any hundred against Australia has to be good... Today, I (just) want to enjoy every day of the series that remains.        
	A strong advocate of age not being a criterion, Sourav remarked: Age is no bar... Its the runs that matter... Whether its Sachin or a (VVS) Laxman, they should be judged on performance alone.        
	Sourav didnt say so, but authoring a hundred in front of Greg Chappell, who is with the Ricky Pontings till the ongoing Test, would have made the achievement even sweeter.

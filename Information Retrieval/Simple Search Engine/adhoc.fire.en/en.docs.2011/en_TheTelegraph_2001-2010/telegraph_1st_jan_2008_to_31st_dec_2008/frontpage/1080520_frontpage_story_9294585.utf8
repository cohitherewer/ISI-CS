  - DHD-J admits to truckers massacre        OUR BUREAU                                          
	Guwahati/Silchar, May 19: The Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dima Halam Daogah today lifted its ban on work on the East-West corridor and gauge conversion projects in the North Cachar Hills district to give peace a chance.         
	The outfit also formally declared its ceasefire with effect from Friday. Police had earlier said they had reports of the outfit declaring a ceasefire but were verifying it.        
	Talking to The Telegraph over phone from an undisclosed location, the outfits publicity secretary Paiprang Dimasa said his organisation wanted peace to be restored in the district. We want to give peace a chance, he said.         
	While declaring the latest ceasefire on Friday, the DHD (J) had, however, said work on the two projects would not be permitted till there was a formal ceasefire. Dimasa said it was now upto the government to decide whether it, too, wanted peace in the hill district.         
	We had kept quiet after we declared a ceasefire on March 25. But the army killed a dozen of our cadres... what could we do after that? he asked, confirming that it was indeed his outfit which had carried out the strikes since May 10. The cadres had gunned down 22 people, including two railway employees, forcing the NFR to suspend services on the Lumding-Badarpur section. The railway had also evacuated its staff and their families from the section. Work on both projects had come to a halt after the fresh round of violence unleashed by the DHD (J).         
	An NFR official said the situation would have to be observed before work could start on the gauge conversion project.         
	Paiprang also confirmed that the outfit had submitted an eight-point charter of demands to the government after the first ceasefire. They (the state government) talk, but there is no action, he said. The response from their side has left much to be desired. The DHD (J) leader also came out strongly against the army, which had reportedly said that it would finish off the group. Bolne se kya hoga? Kya woh hum sabko khatm kar sakega? Some will still remain and grow again.         
	Not completely relying on the truce offered by the outfit, the government has decided to increase the security presence in the troubled district. The troops of 57 Mountain Brigade posted at Masimpur have been moved to the killing fields of the district.         
	Army sources, however, made it clear that the troops would not be given overall responsibility of maintaining law and order and running of trains in the disturbed district.         
	The railway ministry had been in favour of entrusting the army with the responsibility of overseeing the movement of trains and keeping the guerrilla incursions under their vigil along the 214-km metre-gauge hill section from Silchar to Lumding junction, portions of which meander through North Cachar Hills district.                    
	But the army, according to sources, is resisting this idea as its role in counter-insurgency operations in North Cachar will be further stretched in the event of this new duty. The army is in favour of continuing only its usual counter-guerrilla operations on the basis of the fixed intelligence inputs and the regular patrolling.         
	The army has agreed to the proposal by the state government for better co-ordination between its troops and those from the paramilitary and police forces.         
	 The railway ministry has also turned down the state governments request to provide locomotive drivers with bullet-proof jackets.

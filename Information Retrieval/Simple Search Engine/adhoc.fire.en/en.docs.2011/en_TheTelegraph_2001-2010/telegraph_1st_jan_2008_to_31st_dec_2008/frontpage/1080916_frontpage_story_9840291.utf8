        A STAFF REPORTER                                                
	Guwahati, Sept. 15: The Centre today guaranteed security for all projects in the Northeast, irrespective of the quantum of the investment, in a desperate bid to court industrialists.         
	DoNER minister Mani Shankar Aiyar announced the project guarantee security plan at the 4th North East Business Summit that was inaugurated by Vice-President M. Hamid Ansari at the Sarusajai Stadium today.        
	Aiyar even went on to assure investors that there were no law and order worries in the Northeast, at least in most parts of the region.        
	The situation has dramatically improved over the years. If there is a problem in any area we will provide you project guarantee security. It is our commitment to you all. The state government will work in tandem with the Centre to finalise a strategy to this effect in consultation with the investor, he said.         
	The guarantee assumes significance since this is the first time that the Centre has committed to provide security to projects in the region.         
	Plans have already been finalised to provide security to those engaged in the two national projects  East West Corridor and gauge conversion  in Assams volatile North Cachar Hills district.         
	The DoNER minister cited the participation of a large number of foreign ministers and diplomats as proof of the growing interest in the region.        
	More such exposure trips for foreign delegates have been planned for the winter.         
	The Northeast is finally moving and is the most exciting development story taking place in India, he said, adding that 30 of the 74 projects in the region got under way since the last edition of the summit.         
	Aiyar, however, could not help taking a dig at private investors whose contribution he said was abysmal.        
	The Vice-President took over from Aiyar, underscoring the need to strengthen ties with Asean countries and beyond to bring about a sea change in the economic firmament of the region.         
	The efforts of the Prime Minister, Aiyar, ministers and governors of the region have resulted in a plan of action and identification of sectors where private investments have immense opportunity. The government is aware that good governance, infrastructure, power, skilled manpower and peace are as important as concessions and incentives for attracting investments. The experience and example of public private partnership in other parts of the country must be used for developing this region, the Vice-President said.         
	The chief ministers of Assam, Meghalaya and Manipur, too, did their best to woo investment for roads, horticulture, food processing, mine-based industries, IT, health, eco and adventure tourism as well as education.        
	Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh hoped to introduce a bus service from Moreh to Mandalay to boost entrepreneurship, besides lifting restrictions on movement of visitors to the state.         
	His Assam counterpart, Tarun Gogoi, assured all help to provide security for projects, before dismissing the threat perception, which, according to him, had been blown out of proportion.        
	 The other representatives from the northeastern states of Nagaland, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Sikkim, too, attempted to hardsell their states natural resources as a good enough reason for investment.         
	An exhibition was also put up to showcase the region to foreign delegates, who were welcomed by Indian Chambers of Commerce president Sanjay Budhia.

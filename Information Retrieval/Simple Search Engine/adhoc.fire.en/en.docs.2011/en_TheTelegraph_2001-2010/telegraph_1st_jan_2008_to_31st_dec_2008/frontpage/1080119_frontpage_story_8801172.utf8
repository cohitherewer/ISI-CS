	Washington, Jan. 18: A new shadow emerged over the Indo-US nuclear deal today when its chief US negotiator, R. Nicholas Burns, unexpectedly resigned his job as the Bush administrations third ranking diplomat.
    
	If Prime Minister Manmohan Singh can win over the CPM by March to allow the deal to go through, Burns may still be in a position to shepherd its operationalisation here: he will formally step down as under secretary of state for political affairs on March 31.
    
	Announcing the resignation of her most high-profile aide, US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said at a hurriedly arranged appearance with Burns at the state department: I have asked Nick also that after he retires, that he will spend some time continuing to work on the India file.
    
	She asserted that we would like to push the US (India) civil nuclear agreement to conclusion if possible and Nick has agreed to continue that work.
    
	Burns said in his reply: I am going to continue to support your efforts to... finish this very promising strategic opening with India which will do so much good for our country and our global foreign policy, and to help and to support as you contend with these extraordinary challenges at this difficult time. You can count on that.
    
	But that is cold comfort for New Delhi for several reasons. According to insiders at the state department, the departure of Burns, who has shared a friendship with Rice for almost two decades, will mean greater influence on policy and style by the deputy secretary of state, John Negroponte.
    
	Negroponte, the Bush administrations second ranking diplomat, has already clashed with Rice over Indias record on politically correct issues, such as trafficking in people, which distanced Washington from New Delhi in the Cold War era.
    
	A former director of national intelligence who has spent much of his career ordering Latin American dictators to crawl according to Washingtons whims, Negroponte has little patience for Indias continuing reluctance to be Americas cats paw in Asian strategic affairs.
    
	Many career diplomats at the state department, especially those working on non-proliferation, have been opposed right from the start to the nuclear deal with India on grounds that it weakens the existing nuclear non-proliferation regime.
    
	While the charismatic style and the ability of Burns to get the better of his opponents in any internal debate neutralised them, his departure will embolden them to put impediments in the operationalisation of the deal during its next phase.
    
	Burns is being replaced by his namesake, William Burns, the US ambassador to Russia.
    
	Although the replacement is a Rice ally who shares her accommodation of Russia and has quietly worked in Moscow to control the steady damage to US-Russian relations from administration hawks like Vice-President Dick Cheney, William Burns is a study in contrast to Nicholas Burns, according to officials who have worked with both men.
    
	Without the aggression and the dynamism of Nicholas Burns, his successor may find it hard to overcome opposition to India-related breakthroughs from the dinosaurs in the Bush administration and in the US Congress, who still have grave misgivings about New Delhi.
    
	When Nicholas Burns begins work on the India file from April 1, the US and India will be on the same page on the nuclear issue. 
    
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appointed foreign secretary Shyam Saran soon after his retirement as special envoy to deal with the nuclear deal: the same mission that Burns will undertake after he formally leaves the state department.
    
	Saran has discovered that working outside the system has severe drawbacks. It will be to Indias disadvantage that Burns will inevitably discover this at the US end and may be unable to influence either policies or decisions relating to the nuclear deal come April: unless the CPM softens its opposition to the deal very soon.

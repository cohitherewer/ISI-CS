	Calcutta, Aug. 2: Reliance has taken its first tentative steps in Bengals retail sector, riding piggyback on an innovative arrangement with city industrialist Mahendra K. Jalan.        
	Reliance itself is not selling fruits or vegetables at its three stores but has allowed Jalans Keventer Fresh to set up a shop within a shop, selling mostly imported fruits.        
	Soon, local vegetables will also be sold under the Keventer Fresh brand, whose entry into large-scale retail coincides with Reliance Fresh opening the stores yesterday at Budge Budge, New Town and Swabhumi.        
	The stores, which span 3,000-5000sqft, now have the same look as Goenkas Spencers, Pantaloons Food Bazaar or Aditya Birlas More. The hallmark of Reliance Fresh stores elsewhere in the country is their large stock of green vegetables and fruits.        
	It was this issue of selling fresh farm commodities that had ostensibly sparked violent protests by ruling Left Front partner Forward Bloc and main Opposition Trinamul Congress. Two upcoming stores were vandalised last year at Uttarpara and Girish Park.        
	Under the new arrangement, which appears to have passed the Bloc and Trinamul test, Keventer will sell the farm products since it has the requisite licence from the Bloc-controlled state agricultural marketing board. Reliance is yet to get the licence.         
	Board chairman Naren Chatterjee, a firebrand anti-Reliance protester, declined comment on the latest development. The Bloc had said Reliance would undercut local vegetable vendors, driving them out of business.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who believes Reliance will bring good prices to farmers, has been saying he was trying in my own way to persuade his Left partners. So far, the fresh offerings in the stores have been limited to New Zealand apples (Rs 120-145/kg), Australian grapes (Rs 220/kg), American oranges (Rs 140/kg) and the kiwi fruit (Rs 270/kg), apart from some Shimla apples and papaya.        
	Sources said Keventer, which runs Metro Dairy, will sell vegetables, too, starting with organic vegetables priced higher than at nearby markets. We want the customer and farmers to benefit from this venture, Jalan said without giving details. Reliance officials declined comment.        
	The sources said if the three stores got acceptance from all quarters, Reliance would open more stores in the state. The Mukesh Ambani-promoted company has taken back 30 of the 500 employees it had sacked last September after failing to break the Bengal jinx.

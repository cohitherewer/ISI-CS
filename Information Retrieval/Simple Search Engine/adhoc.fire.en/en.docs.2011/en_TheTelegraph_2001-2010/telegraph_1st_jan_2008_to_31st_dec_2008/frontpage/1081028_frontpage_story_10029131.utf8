	New Delhi, Oct. 27: An international team of archaeologists has excavated a 10th century BC copper production site in southern Jordan, resurrecting a decades-old debate whether it represents the mines of the biblical King Solomon.         
	The excavations by Jordanian and American researchers and high-precision dating techniques by British scientists point to copper smelting activity in the 10th century BC, coinciding with the biblical narrative of King Solomons reign.         
	Thomas Levy at the University of California, San Diego, and his colleagues explored Khirbat en Nahas, a site 50km south of the Dead Sea, an area first claimed to be King Solomons mines by American archaeologist Nelson Glueck in 1940.         
	But excavations during the 1970s and 1980s by British archaeologists had indicated that copper smelting in the region emerged only in the 7th century BC  more than 200 years after King Solomons reign  and discredited Gluecks claim.         
	Now, fresh dating of charcoal sticks from Khirbat has shown industrial-scale copper smelting in the 10th century BC. Levy and his colleagues have described their findings today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.         
	The question of whether King Solomons copper mines have been discovered (in Jordan) returns to scholarly discourse, they wrote.         
	This helps us establish a link between the copper smelting and ancient texts, said Mohammad Najjar, a member of the research team.         
	The results show the presence of largescale copper smelting, said Mark Robinson, professor of environmental archaeology at the University of Oxford who used a new technique to assign date to the charcoal sticks.        
	But the fact that copper was smelted there in the 10th century BC could have been later turned into a story of King Solomons mines, he said over phone.         
	Biblical references suggest King Solomon became ruler around 970 BC and reigned for 40 years. The findings raise the possibility that the copper mines may have provided him with the metal that could have been a source of his power.

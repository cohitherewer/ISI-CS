The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bush taps Indians to push N-deal in Senate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bush taps Indians to push N-deal in Senate
          K.P. NAYAR                            Bush: Calling all Indians                                  
	Washington, Sept. 14: In its zeal to pass the nuclear deal on Capitol Hill before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh travels to Washington, the White House has taken the unprecedented step of mobilising the Indian American community against US senators who voted against the Hyde Act that provided for civilian nuclear co-operation with India.        
	In a conference call on Friday with handpicked Indian community leaders and a few other Americans who are lobbying hard for the nuclear deal, a White House core group listed the senators who are expected to vote against the 123 Agreement when it comes up on the floor of the two chambers of US Congress soon through a joint resolution.        
	Bush administration officials virtually admitted in the course of the conference call that what they were doing was highly irregular in setting up an ethnic community against positions freely and rightfully taken by individual senators. We cannot ask you to lobby with them, one White House official said right at the beginning of the dialogue that lasted about 90 minutes. But we can tell you that these are the senators who we think will vote against the 123 Agreement which has to be signed into law for nuclear co-operation to be operationalised with New Delhi.        
	The administration is jittery over support for the nuclear deal package in the Senate. Unlike in the House, the Senates extremely complex rules require unanimous consent of the chamber for passage of the 123 Agreement.         
	When the Hyde Act was passed in 2006 by the previous US Congress in the final days of its two-year term, 12 Senators and 69 members of the House of Representatives voted against the bill.         
	The White House is not worried about the House now since the 123 Agreement commands adequate support when it goes for a vote. But in the Senate, even opposition by a single Senator can hold up the nuclear deal in the absence of unanimous consent.        
	The unstated message in the conference call was that Indian Americans should put in all their efforts to convince  to put it gently  the dissenting senators to change their stand. But the secrecy surrounding the 90-minute call reflected an awareness in the White House that if its substance leaked into the public domain in the US, it could stir up a hornets nest for an administration that has already been criticised for constitutional, ethical and conventional improprieties in office.        
	White House officials who came on the conference call named 10 senators as likely opponents in the vote for passage of the deal. Edward Kennedy, one of the Senators who voted against the Hyde Act, is recovering from surgery for a brain tumour and will not return to the Senate until January.         
	That means one other senator who opposed the deal has changed his mind since.         
	Meanwhile, the Senate foreign relations committee has scheduled its first hearing on the nuclear package sent to Capitol Hill by President George W. Bush on September 10.         
	The hearing will take place on Thursday and the sole deponent will be William Burns, the successor as under-secretary of state for political affairs, to Nicholas Burns, one of the architects of the deal.         
	It is worrying the administration that the chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, Howard Berman, the man who disclosed the contents of a secret administration letter about the deal some 10 days ago, has not yet scheduled a hearing before his committee. Efforts are on to twist his arm into holding a speedy hearing.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            CPM leader Brinda Karat consoles Sunita Sharma, whose husband is dead and daughter is battling for life, at a Guwahati hospital on Friday. Picture by Eastern Projections                                         
	Guwahati, Oct. 31: The badly charred body could be lawyer Anup Bhuyans. It could be that of his colleague Bipul Nath, who too died in yesterdays blast at the chief judicial magistrates court. Or it could be someone elses.        
	At the Gauhati Medical College Hospital morgue, Anups family staked claim to the body this morning. But so did Bipuls family, who arrived with some 100 people from their village in Mangaldoi, 68km from Guwahati.        
	The huge crowd from Gorkhuti is camping in front of the morgue, trying to convince authorities the body is Bipuls.        
	The body is hardly identifiable. Neither family could provide irrefutable evidence. So well have to do a DNA test, said K.J. Hillaly, subdivisional officer (Kamrup metro), adding the test will be done after two days.        
	Some of the 46 killed by the three blasts in Guwahati were charred to their bones. Of the 27 other bodies at the morgue, 25 were handed over to families today. Two still lie unclaimed, one of which could be the body of lawyer Deepamoni Saikia, who lived alone in a rented house and whose family could not be contacted.        
	Deepamoni, who worked at the CJMs court with Anup and Bipul, died when a portion of a car blew up and hit her.        
	Anup, 37, had married last year, said younger brother Pranjit, a college lecturer and Guwahati resident. Anups wife has been passing out off and on since she heard of his death. Shes been hardly able to speak, Pranjit said. He added: The bodys build and height resembles my brothers.        
	The family isnt sure whether to take the body home if it is handed to them since its a gory sight.        
	Bipuls family has no doubts. The shape of the head resembles mine and the height matches my brothers, said farmer Narayan Nath. He is gone but I wish they would at least hand the body to us.        
	Bipul had been practising law for the past three years, said Gajen Nath of Gorkhuti.        
	A little distance away, under a tent for the worst burns victims, Sunita Sharma sobbed beside the bed of daughter Marami, 4. The child has 90 per cent burns. We cannot say anything now, a doctor said.        
	Sunitas husband Sagar, a carpenter, died in the Ganeshguri blast while bringing Marami home from Ganeshguri LP School. I came here leaving my only son at home with no one to look after him, Sunita sobbed.        
	Grieving auto-rickshaw drivers marched on Dispurs streets to protest the deaths of nine colleagues at Ganeshguri. Twelve autos were parked at the auto stand near the blast site. Nine drivers are confirmed dead and one is missing, a marcher said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mumbai probe into migrant death
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mumbai probe into migrant death
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                            Dharam Dev Rai                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 29: Mistrust has added to the regional tension cleaving the city regarded as a cosmopolitan icon following the death of an Uttar Pradesh labourer after a scuffle on a local train yesterday.         
	The Maharashtra government, for the second time in 48 hours, had to order a high-level probe to inquire into the killing of Dharam Dev Rai, a 25-year-old migrant worker from Gorakhpur.         
	Rai died after being punched and kicked by a group of Marathi-speaking men on a suburban train in Thane yesterday afternoon following a row.        
	The government had announced a similar investigation on Monday night into the gunning down of Rahul Raj, a job-hunter from Patna, who took around 15 bus passengers hostage at gunpoint as he wanted to send a message to migrant-baiter Raj Thackeray.         
	Maharashtra deputy chief minister R.R. Patil denied Rais death was a hate crime and said the tragedy occurred after a scuffle over train seats, a statement later echoed by inspector-general (railways) K.P. Raghuvanshi, who is investigating the case.        
	It is not a hate crime. It is pure goondaism, the officer said, amid growing apprehension that any incident in Mumbai would now be seen as a hate crime.        
	Rai, who boarded the train at Khopoli, 111km from Mumbai, was travelling with two relatives and a friend to the Kurla terminus to catch the Kushi Nagar Express to his hometown in Sant Kabir district of Uttar Pradesh.         
	According to the complaint at Karjat police station, a group of Marathi-speaking men asked them if they were bhaiyyas  a term often used as a derogatory reference to people from the north  and hearing a yes, severely thrashed them and ordered them out of the state. Rai, who bore the brunt of the assault before the attackers got down at Lowjee, the stop after Khopoli, lost consciousness and died in Dubey Hospital in Badlapur, three stations away.        
	Rais wife Deepmala, 23, is expecting their second child. The couple have a 13-month-old daughter. He worked in a steel factory in Khopoli and stayed in Vashi.        
	The Congress, sandwiched between its north India and Maharashtra allies, chose to take the middle path and issued strong condemnations.         
	I think the Maharashtra government should do what it is expected to do and I hope they would do it, Union home minister Shivraj Patil, who spoke to Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh during the day, said.        
	But for migrant workers, the atmosphere has vitiated beyond repair. Rais relatives, shaken by the experience, have decided to return to Uttar Pradesh.         
	I will not stay here any longer. Provide me security. I just want to leave Maharashtra, said Veerendra Rai, who saw his relative die.        
	Government Railway Police commissioner A.K. Sharma said Rai died of liver rupture though there were no external injuries on his body. A case of murder has been registered against 10 to 12 unidentified people.        
	Sharma said a few people had been detained for questioning, but ruled out the role of Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. The people who attacked Rai did not shout any slogans, Sharma said.        
	Mumbais citizens, however, said the mistrust enveloping the city was the outcome of Thackerays politics and the governments inaction.         
	Gerson da Cunha, former adman and convener of AGNI, a citizens movement, said: An atmosphere of hate is being created, and this is because the leader of this campaign (Thackeray) has got away with impunity. It is the state government which has failed abysmally to protect migrants.

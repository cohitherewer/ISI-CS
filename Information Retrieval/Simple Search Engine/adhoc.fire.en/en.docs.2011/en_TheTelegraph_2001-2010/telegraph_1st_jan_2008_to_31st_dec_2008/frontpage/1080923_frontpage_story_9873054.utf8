                                David Blaine hangs upside down in Central Park, New York. (Reuters)                            
	New York, Sept. 22 (Reuters): Its a bird! Its a bat! Its ... David Blaine?        
	Blaine, a 35-year-old magician and showman, strung himself upside down above Central Parks Wollman ice skating rink today and plans to stay there for 60 hours.        
	Wearing a safety harness attached to a crossbar, Blaine dangled by his feet from a large steel scaffold structure.        
	The spectacle is due to conclude on a prime-time television special on Wednesday night when Blaine takes what he calls the Dive of Death and falls 13.4 metres to the ground.        
	I think we can really, when put in any situation, I think we can really adapt to it, Blaine told Reuters.         
	Doctors say the increase in blood pressure raises the risk of stroke or blindness, and gravity could restrict the blood flow to his lower extremities.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kokrajhar, Oct. 22: Four children, aged between nine months and one-and-a-half years, died just hours after being given measles vaccine at a health sub-centre in the Nimua area of Baksa district this morning.         
	The children, identified as Bikash Dorjee of Kursijhar, Pramod Barman of Baganbari, Pamit Barman of Narsingbari and Bhagyasri Swargiary of Dikiajan, had high fever and bouts of vomiting before breathing their last at their homes except for one, who died in hospital.        
	Health department officials said the real cause of death would be known by tomorrow afternoon after the post mortem. The vaccines will be sent for tests.        
	The vaccine is given every Wednesday under the National Rural Health Mission. Nearly 15 children took the vaccine at the Nimua health sub-centre today.         
	A Bangalore-based institute manufactured the vaccine with an expiry date of December 2009.        
	The government tonight ordered a probe into the deaths, besides announcing Rs 1 lakh each for the family of the deceased.         
	Additional chief secretary P.P. Verma, who will conduct the probe, has been asked to submit the report soon.         
	A five-member team from the Union health ministry is scheduled to visit Nimua health sub-centre tomorrow to take stock of the situation.

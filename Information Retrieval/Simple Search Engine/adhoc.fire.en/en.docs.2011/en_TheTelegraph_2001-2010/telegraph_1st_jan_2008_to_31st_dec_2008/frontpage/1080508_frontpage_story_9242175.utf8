  - Ridiculed, governor says sarcasm is acid
          Our bureau                            Raj Bhavan becomes an island of darkness during the voluntary power cut on Wednesday evening as a skyline of lights burns bright in the city. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Calcutta, May 7: High-voltage sarcasm versus low-pitched rapier thrust.        
	Leading lights of the Bengal government and the CPM today virtually switched off regular business to target governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi for setting in motion voluntary power cuts in Raj Bhavan.        
	As the five central switches in the governors bungalow were toggled down at 1.30pm so that he could share the plight of other power-cut-hit Calcuttans, the temperature soared inside as well as outside.        
	Unsolicited advice started flowing in, mainly from Writers Buildings and CPM venues spread over the state. The tips to the governor ranged from moving out of Raj Bhavan to a bustee, opening the doors of the sprawling complex for the poor, walking to non-government programmes and donating 75 per cent of his large salary since he has a small family.        
	Amid the acid rain came another question that many, including the CPM, had asked earlier but under graver circumstances: why does the country need the gubernatorial post, a Raj relic?                  quot; hellip;Have fun but 
  don rsquo;t allow low levels of derision to creep in. Humour is like pure water but sarcasm is like acid quot;
  Gopalkrishna Gandhi
  at the Rabindra Bharati University convocation            He (the governor) should also walk to any non-government function within 10km of city limits. This 
  will save fuel hellip;

  CPM leader    
	It is high time the Centre ponders whether the post of governor is required. If need be, the Constitution should be amended to abolish the post. A non-elected person cannot judge elected representatives of the people, said CPM state secretary Biman Bose. We are against harbouring white elephants in Raj Bhavans.          
	But Boses party boss Prakash Karat was more restrained. The CPM and the DMK have said that there is a need to redefine the role of governors. We will take it up with the Centre-state panel, he said in Madurai.        
	Asked about the Raj Bhavan power cut, Karat allowed himself a smile and said: If we save electricity, it is a good thing.        
	The governor did not react to any of the flurry of statements but his speech at the Rabindra Bharati University convocation in the morning had a striking theme to which he has been subjected to since last night: sarcasm.        
	Without mentioning the rumpus over the Raj Bhavan power cut, Gandhi told students how to enjoy the very complex and very short life with pure laughter.        
	Create and have fun but dont allow low levels of derision to creep in. Humour is like pure water but sarcasm is like acid. Satire is a high form of creation but low level of sarcasm is targeted at individuals. If you see something good happening, try to accept that.        
	The governor did not say so  he specifically mentioned that the advice was meant for the students  but the words could have touched a nerve in those giving him tips laced with acid through the day.        
	The speech continued in the same vein. Do criticise but dont be irreverent. Hurting others has become a performing art and we have done that, the governor said.        
	Sources said the speech, delivered in Bengali, was finalised at 9pm, less than two hours after the governor issued the power-cut statement and soon after the first sparks of criticism had begun to fly.        
	Power was switched off in two phases of an hour each in Raj Bhavan on Wednesday  first at 1.30pm and then at 6pm. Guards and staff used newspapers as fans. In the evening, the governor went to the verandah to cool himself, the sources said.

	New Delhi, Oct. 3: The Centre today raised the income ceiling to determine the OBC creamy layer from Rs 2.5 lakh a year to Rs 4.5 lakh, finding a way past two Supreme Court rulings its allies are unhappy with.        
	The decision ensures that the court-ordered exclusion of the creamy layer from the higher-education quota will now hurt fewer OBC students. It will minimise the transfer of vacant quota seats to the general category.

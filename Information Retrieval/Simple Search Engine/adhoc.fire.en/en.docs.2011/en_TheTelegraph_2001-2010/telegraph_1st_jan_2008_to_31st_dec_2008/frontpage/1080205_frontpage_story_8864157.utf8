	Imphal, Feb. 4: Manipuri filmmaker Aribam Syam Sharma has been selected for the V. Shantaram Lifetime Achievement award for documentary films.
    
	Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh announced Sharmas name at the inaugural function of the 10th Mumbai International Film Festival for Documentary, Short and Animation Films last night. The award, which comprises a cash prize of Rs 2.5 lakh, a citation and a shawl, will be given to the filmmaker on Saturday. 
    
	This is the first time that a person from the Northeast has bagged the prestigious award. Sharma, who arrived in Mumbai last evening for inauguration of a special package of 33 films from the Northeast, was overwhelmed when he heard the news. It was a big surprise for me. I never thought of such a grand honour, he said.
    
	Talking about his future plans, Sharma said, I am planning to make documentaries on Mr Manipur Pradip Kumar, the HIV-positive bodybuilder, and on Manipuri classical dance forms. I love to make Manipuri feature films but cant do so as they involve huge amounts of money.
    
	Twelve-time winner of the National Award, Sharma has represented India at several international film festivals, including Nantes, Cannes, London, Toronto, Locarno, and Montreal. He was the first Indian to receive the prestigious Grand Prix at the Nantes International Film Festival for his feature film Imagi Ningthem (My Son, My Precious) in 1982. 
    
	Born in 1936 in Imphal, his cinematic journey started in 1972 with Manipuri feature film Matamgi Manipur (Modern Manipur) as a music director and actor. 
    
	He made his directorial debut with Lamja Parshuram in 1974, followed by his first documentary Sana Leibak Manipur in 1984. 
    
	Sharma also authored Living Shadow, an autobiography.
    
	Some of his other films that attracted attention include Ishanou (The Chosen One).
    
	The British Film Institute, London, declared his Sangai The Dancing Deer of Manipur, as the Outstanding Film of the Year in 1989.

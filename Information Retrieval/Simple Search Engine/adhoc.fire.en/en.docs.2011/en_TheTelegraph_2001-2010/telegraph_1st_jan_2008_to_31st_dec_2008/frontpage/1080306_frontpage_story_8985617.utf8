  - Comeback bid with state cry          OUR BUREAU                            Former Gorkha soldiers and war widows at Jantar Mantar. Picture by Prem Singh                                         
	New Delhi/Darjeeling, March 5: Subash Ghisingh has toed the Gorkhaland line, a day before he resigns as caretaker administrator of the DGHC. His party, the GNLF, had been harping on statehood ever since it realised how the demand was cashed in by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha to garner support against the special status for the Darjeeling hills.         
	The GNLF chief, it seems, is trying to make a comeback with the statehood demand in tow. At one point he had banked on the Sixth Schedule bill to see him through even when indefinite bandh and hunger strike launched by the Morcha against the special status crippled the hills.        
	In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today, Ghisingh asked him to look afresh into the Gorkhaland demand. He has also accused the Centre and the Bengal government for the inordinate delay in implementing the memorandum of settlement granting Sixth Schedule status to the Darjeeling hills.        
	With the passage of the special status bill stalled for an indefinite period, the GNLF chief has now picked up the threads of the old demand, which had once under his leadership rocked the hills in the eighties.        
	Ghisingh has also announced that he will resign as caretaker administrator of the DGHC tomorrow. He will send his papers to the governor of Bengal after he reaches Siliguri, a close aide of the GNLF chief said at Gorkha Bhavan in New Delhi today.         
	The subject in the Prime Ministers letter, a copy of which is with The Telegraph, reads: Carving out separate state of Gorkhaland within the framework of Constitution of India.         
	The GNLF chiefs announcement  he had called a news conference at the Bhavan  that he was going to Siliguri tomorrow has created a furore in the hills. The Morcha, which is against the special status, has banned his entry to the hills. The newly formed party is currently riding high on its twin victories: extracting an assurance from the state government that Ghisingh would resign by March 10 and successfully stalling the Sixth Schedule bill from being passed in Parliament.         
	It will be the people who will not allow him to come to the hills. If he wants to resign in Siliguri, it will be fine, said Roshan Giri, the general secretary of the party. Giri, along with Morcha president Bimal Gurung and more than 300 ex-servicemen, is also in the capital. The former soldiers, under the banner of the Bharatiya Gorkha Bhutpurba Sainik Morcha, assembled at Jantar Mantar this morning to demand Gorkhaland.         
	Gurung also called on home minister Shivraj Patil, asking him to withdraw the special status bill since it had been introduced by him. The Morcha chief along with the ex-servicemen will call on UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee on Friday. Thousands of Gorkha soldiers fought for India and now it is the duty of the Centre to do justice to the community, Gurung said in his address at Jantar Mantar this afternoon.         
	Brig. (retd) N.K. Gurung, the president of the ex-servicemen organisation, said the Morcha movement was democratic in nature.         
	Asked why the GNLF chief was being denied entry to the hills, the former brigadier said: He might be lynched by the people. Maybe he will be allowed to come, once he resigns.

	Bangkok, Nov. 27 (Reuters): Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat declared a state of emergency today at two Bangkok airports besieged by anti-government protesters, as rumours of a coup swirled round the capital.        
	In a televised address, Somchai said police and some military units would try to end the blockades by the Peoples Alliance for Democracy (PAD) at Suvarnabhumi and Don Muang airports, which he said were causing massive damage to the economy.        
	I need to do something to restore peace and order, Somchai said, invoking emergency rule in the capital for the second time to disperse the PAD.        
	However, the previous declaration in September to dislodge protesters occupying Government House was ignored by the army and it was not clear what the police would do now.        
	The PAD refused to end their protests, which have forced flight cancellations and stranded thousands of travellers. The Suvarnabhumi airport authorities said the hub will remain closed till

          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Guwahati/Nagaon, Aug 2: Jolted by a Gauhati High Court ruling that dubbed those at the helm of affairs as silent spectators to the largescale infiltration from Bangladesh, an embarrassed Dispur today launched a damage-control exercise.         
	It announced a slew of measures, including drawing up departmental proceedings within a week against the police officer who certified a Bangladeshi national, Md Hasim, as an Indian. It also directed those dealing with such cases to be very cautious.        
	Within hours of the governments announcement, Nagaon police said it had arrested a Bangladeshi, Md Kamaluddin, who had filed nominations to contest the 1996 Assembly elections from Jamunamukh constituency.        
	Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi chaired a high-level meeting at his residence this morning  before leaving for Delhi en route to Beijing  to discuss the contents of the July 23 high court ruling that upheld the Foreigners Tribunal order that declared Md Hasim as a foreigner. Md Hasim and his eight family members are absconding.         
	It was in this case that the high court made critical observations about the police and the bureaucracy.         
	In Md Kamaluddins case, he was in possession of a passport issued by the Pakistan government for his travel to Bangladesh. After coming to Bangladesh, he stealthily came to Assam, stayed back and even contested the election. This can happen only in Assam, the court observed.        
	Dispur is under tremendous pressure from the All Assam Students Union, the AGP and the BJP for the faux pas. Todays meeting and the subsequent action are seen as a damage-control exercise.        
	Additional SP (border) J. Hazarika told The Telegraph this evening that Md Kamaluddin was arrested from his residence under Moirajhar police station last night and was being taken to Karimganj for deportation to Bangladesh. He had married a girl from Lanka in 1990. He filed nominations to contest the 1996 elections but later withdrew. He was arrested and deported in 1998 and 2000. This is his third arrest.        
	The government has asked thana-level committees, which include members of the public, to meet at least once a month to keep tabs on suspected illegal migrants. It will also set up a committee to identify the lacunae in the present system of detecting foreigners.        
	Gogoi will move Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to expedite the finalisation of the modalities to update the National Register of Citizens. He stressed the need for cent per cent registration of births and border fencing.         
	Pointing to the vanishing acts of foreigners, Justice Sharma, who has fixed September 9 to see the follow-up action on part of the authorities, said: This is how the hide and seek game is being played by foreigners in Assam. Those at the helm of affairs are mere silent spectators.

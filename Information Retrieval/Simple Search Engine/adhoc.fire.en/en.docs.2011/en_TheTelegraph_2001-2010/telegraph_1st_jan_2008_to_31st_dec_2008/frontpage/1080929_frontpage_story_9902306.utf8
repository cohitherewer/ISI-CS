	Chandigarh, Sept. 28: The famous Diwali fireworks show at the Golden Temple may look a little different this year.        
	Temple authorities have decided to either curtail the five-hour spectacle, which draws lakhs of devotees every year, or replace it with a laser show.        
	The reason is that smoke from the firecrackers has been damaging the gold plates on the temples dome and walls, as well as some of the frescoes inside.        
	Every Diwali, the shrines custodian, the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), bursts crackers worth lakhs of rupees. Last year, some of the gold plates on the dome began turning black.        
	Four pollution-monitoring machines have since been installed in buildings around the sanctum sanctorum. The state pollution control board has now identified the Diwali firecrackers as a key cause of the pollution apart from the smoke from factories, auto-rickshaws and other vehicles, as well as the nearby goldsmiths and blacksmiths units.        
	A three-member committee has been formed to look into the pollution caused by the fireworks and is expected to give its report soon, SGPC secretary Dalmegh Singh said over the phone from Amritsar.        
	Singh said the SGPC was considering a display of smokeless fireworks, which are expensive, this Diwali.        
	If smokeless fireworks do not cause more damage to the shrine then we will opt for it. Otherwise, a laser show will be organised. It is the smoke from the firecrackers that is the most worrying factor, Singh added.        
	Firecrackers release corrosive gases such as sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, which remove a layer of gold every year. The temple frescoes, made with vegetable dyes, too have shown signs of damage.        
	The shrines dome and the outer and inner walls of the upper stories are plated with layers of gold leaves, weighing hundreds of kilos.        
	The temple was built in 1604 on land donated by Mughal emperor Akbar. The gold used on the dome was donated by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1830. All the gold on the dome and the walls was replaced in 1999.

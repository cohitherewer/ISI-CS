	Toyako, July 9: Beneath the gush-gush, the meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President George W. Bush covered crucial ground that could ensure the ratification of the 123 Agreement regardless of whether the Indian or the American leader is in office.        
	The Prime Minister, it is learnt, informed Bush that he had delivered on his promise. Singh had overcome domestic compulsions and was taking the safeguards agreement to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).         
	In exchange, Singh sought and received an assurance from Bush that the US would use all its influence to get India a clean waiver at the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).         
	The personal rapport between Singh and Bush gave the meeting the necessary political push at the highest level, officials said.         
	Once India gets past the NSG, it will be imperative for the US to ratify the 123 Agreement and gain first-mover advantage in the lucrative nuclear commerce sector that will open up in India, the officials added.         
	If the US Congress fails to ratify the deal after the NSG waiver, it will leave the door open for Russia, France and other players to enter the field and snap up orders at the cost of American business.        
	That is why even if a lame-duck session of Congress fails to pass the agreement, the next US dispensation  be it Democratic or Republican  will push it through, Indian officials hope.        
	Soon after the meeting between Bush and Manmohan, the G8 nations decided to adopt a more robust approach to civil nuclear cooperation with India.        
	We look forward to working with India, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Nuclear Suppliers Group and other partners to advance Indias non-proliferation commitments and progress so as to facilitate a more robust approach to civil nuclear co-operation with India to help it meet its growing energy needs in a manner that enhances and reinforces the global non-proliferation regime, the Chairs summary released at the end of the summit said.        
	The G8 is made of the US, the UK, France, Russia, Japan, Canada, Germany and Italy  all members of the NSG as well.        
	The spiralling oil price and the growing concern over carbon emissions, reflected in all the meetings at the G8 summit here, also helped the Indians push the case for the nuclear deal which is expected to help generate clean energy.        
	If nuclear commerce holds the bait to lure France and Russia, the clean energy argument at a time India is under pressure to cut greenhouse gas emission has been used to persuade sceptics (such as Japan and Australia) that the civil nuclear agreement was not just good for India but also good for the world, the officials said.

	Singur, Oct. 3: For the unwilling farmers of Singur, the Tata pullout sparked off celebrations over a moral victory, though doubts over the fate of their plots crept in.        
	Some wondered whether the willing farmers would now unleash their anger on them.        
	On the temple ground of Ghoshpara, a pocket that has the largest concentration of unwilling farmers who owned large tracts of land in the project area, a Puja is being organised after a gap of two years.        
	As the news spread this evening, farmers gathered at the pandal and switched on a black-and-white television to catch the latest.         
	Eta amader joy (This is our victory), said Bhuban Bagui, who had not collected the governments compensation for his two acres. We will really celebrate this Puja.        
	Across parts of Gopalnagar, Sanapara and Ghoshpara, unwilling farmers swung from celebration to uncertainty sitting in front of TV sets as grave doubts surfaced over what would happen next.        
	Ratan Ghosh, 81, retired for the day in his two-storey house, pondering what would happen to his nearly five acres inside the project area.         
	We are just so confused. An agreement was struck between Mamata Banerjee and the state government at the governors residence, but Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government refused to abide by it. So what can we expect from such a government. The Tatas are going, but I am not sure how we will get back the land.        
	Outside the house, a younger lot beamed with confidence. We know that the land is all right and, if returned now, we can start cultivation within a few weeks, said Tarak Ghosh, who owned over two acres. The Tatas had undermined the collective intelligence of the farmers of Singur. We have now proved a point to them, he added.        
	Outside Saupara, a few people trickled out of their homes late at night, trying to feel the pulse of the other unwilling farmers in the area.         
	This is a big victory for us and we are all very happy, said Harisadhan Ghosh, who owns around two acres. But we are now apprehensive that the willing farmers will now pour on us their frustration and anger. They outnumber us by a large margin.        
	As night descended and the chatter receded, small groups discussed among themselves whether this was a political tactic on the part of the government and the Tatas to tarnish Mamata Banerjees image ahead of the elections.        
	Why is it that the state government is unwilling to reveal the details of its pact with the Tatas? asked Jugal Kishor Ghosh, who, along with his brothers, owned nearly five acres inside the project area.

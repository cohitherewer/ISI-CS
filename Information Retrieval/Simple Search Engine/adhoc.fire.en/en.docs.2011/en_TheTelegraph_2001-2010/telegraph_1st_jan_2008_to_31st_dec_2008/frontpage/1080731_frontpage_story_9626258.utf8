	Mumbai, July 30: Legal hope has flickered to life for mothers at risk during their pregnancy.        
	Bombay High Court will hear on Friday a petition seeking an amendment to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act to allow abortions beyond 20 weeks.        
	The law at present permits conditional abortions within 20 weeks of pregnancy.         
	The petition has been filed by a Mumbai gynaecologist, Dr Nikhil Datar, and a teacher couple. The woman, in her 25th week of pregnancy, has appealed for abortion as the foetus has a heart abnormality.        
	A division bench yesterday constituted a committee headed by the dean of JJ Hospital to examine the woman and submit a report by Friday. The petition has taken recourse to the extraordinary jurisdiction of the court under Article 226 and the fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution, said Pradeep Havnur, the advocate for Datar.        
	The couple, identified as Mr X and Mrs Y in court papers, are residents of Bhayander in suburban Mumbai and expecting their first child.         
	Foetal echocardiography carried out in the 24th week of pregnancy showed that their unborn child suffers from congenital complete heart block.        
	I told the couple that the foetus will develop hydrops fetalis (accumulation of fluid), which can be fatal. If it lived, it would need a pacemaker from birth to survive, said Dr N.C. Joshi of Mumbais BJ Wadia Hospital.        
	Faced with little choice, the couple decided to abort the child. But Datar pleaded his inability to terminate the pregnancy at such an advanced stage because of the legal constraints.         
	Many doctors believe Indias 20-week cut-off for abortion is outdated. We support raising the limit to 24 weeks in cases when the foetus is not viable or the mothers life is in danger, said Jaydeep Tank, chairperson of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Committee of the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India.         
	The 20-week limit was set in the late sixties when ultrasound screening of foetuses was not done and the methods of pregnancy termination beyond 12 weeks were relatively risky, Tank said. Now, with ultrasound scans, a number of foetal abnormalities such as congenital heart block and spinal problems can only be detected best after 20 weeks.

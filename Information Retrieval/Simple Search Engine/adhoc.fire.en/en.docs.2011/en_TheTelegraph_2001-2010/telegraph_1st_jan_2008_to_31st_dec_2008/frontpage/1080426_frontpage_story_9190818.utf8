  - Bicameral legislature gets crucial nod        A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, April 25: Dispur has set the ball rolling for a bicameral legislature in Assam with a state cabinet sub-committee giving the crucial nod for an Upper House to offer representation to small ethnic groups.        
	Sources in the state parliamentary affairs department said the proposed chamber would be a 42-member House. One-third of these members would be nominated by the governor. The remaining 28 would be elected by the 126 members of the Assembly.        
	The cabinet sub-committee, headed by revenue minister Bhumidhar Barman, was asked to study the need for a two-tier House. In its report submitted last week, the committee recommended an Upper House to give equal representation to all the communities.         
	A proposal in this regard was submitted to chief minister Tarun Gogoi, sources said.         
	Barman could not be contacted, but an official in the parliamentary affairs department said: It is a long-pending demand and all the political parties are unanimous about the need for a two-tier legislature in the state, considering the aspirations of diverse ethnic groups.        
	On several occasions in the past, the issue was discussed in the Assembly where political parties, cutting across party lines, supported the idea.         
	During the last Assembly elections, the ruling Congress also made an election pledge to create the Upper House if elected to power.        
	Honouring its commitment after returning to power, the Congress-led government constituted the cabinet sub-committee to give its suggestions on the matter.         
	There are six states in the country that have a bicameral legislature  Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.        
	The Upper House is called Legislative Council or the Vidhan Parishad and it cannot be more than one-third of the total size of a Legislative Assembly.         
	But the size of the council cannot be less than 40. As in other states, the role of the proposed council will be primarily consultative with limited legislative powers, the official said.        
	Explaining the procedure, which now needs to be completed for Assam to have a bicameral legislature, the official said the proposal would be discussed by the state cabinet. Once the cabinet approves it, it will be tabled in the Assembly for approval.        
	The Assembly, after adopting a resolution, will recommend to the Centre to take it up in Parliament for a necessary amendment in the Constitution for the formation of the Legislative Council. The council will be a permanent body, not subject to dissolution.         
	But one-third of the members will have to retire after every three years.

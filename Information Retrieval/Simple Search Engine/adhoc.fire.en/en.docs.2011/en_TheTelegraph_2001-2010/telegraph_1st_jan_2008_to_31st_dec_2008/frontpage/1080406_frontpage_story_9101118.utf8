The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Aussie veto looms on N-deal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Aussie veto looms on N-deal
          K.P. NAYAR                                         Kevin Rudd      
	Washington, April 5: The Indo-US nuclear deal is rapidly sinking. Not because of the Left parties.        
	The new Australian governments views on nuclear non-proliferation have put the clock back on the deal at the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which has scheduled a meeting next month. The US, which championed the deal in the NSG, and India, which has been following up its presentation to the group last year with an intense lobbying effort, may find at the May meeting that support for changing the rules of global nuclear commerce has waned.        
	All NSG decisions are by consensus. Australias recent announcement that it will not sell uranium to India has emboldened NSG members, whose reservations about the deal had earlier been neutralised by the US, to go back to their opposition to the agreement.        
	According to US officials, Australias new Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd diplomatically evaded an effort by President George W. Bush last week to get Canberras commitment to support the deal in the NSG.        
	The effort was made when Rudd was in the White House on his first major foreign trip after roundly defeating one of Bushs last remaining partners in the Iraq misadventure, Prime Minister John Howard.        
	The change of guard in Australia and the likelihood that the NSG may now step back on the deal  even if India signs a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  is good news for the Left parties.        
	They may now be able to preserve the tenuous alliance with the UPA arguing that, after all, they were not responsible for sending the nuclear deal into coma. Political expediency after the next Lok Sabha elections may persuade the Congress too to overlook the fact that by standing against the tide of history at its turning points, the Left parties allowed global enemies of the deal to succeed in putting the agreement in deep freeze. Bush and Rudd avoided saying anything in public about the nuclear deal during their White House summit.        
	But in the run up to the summit, US defence secretary Robert Gates and the deputy secretary of state, John Negroponte, went to Canberra, where they sought the new governments support for the nuclear deal.        
	Bush administration sources said the two US officials found Australias new foreign minister Stephen Smith in uncompromising opposition to the Indo-US agreement.        
	Smith rebuffed US efforts to insert language in a joint communique at the end of the ministerial meeting that would have raised hopes about some continuity in Howards policies towards India.        
	In the end, the joint communique merely stated that both countries noted the significance of the US-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative.        
	It is understood that the Rudd government, as a sop, agreed at that meeting to support Indias membership of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Gates is said to have informally communicated the Australian sop to India when he visited New Delhi later.        
	Australias change in policy  which could have the effect of an NSG veto on the deal  is said to be behind a public statement on Thursday by the Bush administration signalling that it was resigned to seeing the deal go on the back burner.        
	The state departments deputy spokesman Tom Casey said on Thursday there would be opportunities in future (US) Congresses and with the future administration to move forward on the deal.        
	But certainly, we can only talk for ourselves and for this administration in terms of this arrangement...And frankly, regardless of whether this arrangement is passed in the next year or not, one thing that I dont think will change is the continuing strengthening and deepening of the US-Indian relationship that has begun under this administration, and we certainly hope will continue into the future, Casey added in what appeared to be a swan song for the deal.

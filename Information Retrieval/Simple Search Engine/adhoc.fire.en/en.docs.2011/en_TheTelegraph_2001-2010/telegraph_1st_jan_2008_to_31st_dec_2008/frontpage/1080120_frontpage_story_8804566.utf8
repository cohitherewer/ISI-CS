     LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI
               
	Perth, Jan. 19: Harbhajan Singh didnt have a role in arguably Indias finest Test victory overseas, but that didnt stop him from sprinting with a borrowed Tricolour.
    
	The off-spinners dash to the Waca square was actually his way of publicly thanking captain Anil Kumble and the rest for their unequivocal support after he got banned.
    
	The best response in sport is on the field and its understandable why Harbhajan got so emotional late this afternoon. Theyve done it for the country and, yes, theyve done it for me, he said.
    
	Harbhajan wasnt the only one who couldve shed tears of joy, though. 
    
	You couldnt win because (Steve) Bucknor wasnt here, mocked an Indian supporter as a couple of Australian players emerged from their dressing room.
    
	That wasnt called for, but in Team Indias finest moment overseas, nobody quite forgot what happened at the SCG a fortnight ago. With some luck, the bubbly couldve flowed there, too.
    
	Hundreds gathered in the vicinity of the Indian dressing room and there were as many near the team bus. It was, understandably, no different at the Hyatt Regency.
    
	Were used to hosting pop and rock groups and they do attract crowds, but its been different with the Indian team. Everybody seems a fan, remarked Carol Gorgievsai, the hotels petite duty manager.
    
	The loudest cheers were reserved for Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, MoM Irfan Pathan (a last-minute inclusion in the XI) and Virender Sehwag, who contributed with the bat and ball. With tips to Kumble as well.
    
	It was at comeback man Sehwags suggestion, for example, that Kumble gave the outstanding Ishant Sharma an extended spell, in todays first session, and the lanky teenager obliged by again getting rid of Ricky Ponting.
    
	The 72-run victory, of course, ended Australias desperate push for a 17th consecutive Test win.
    
	While the hosts couldnt better their own record, the Indians improved theirs  within four days in the third Test  and forever changed the generations-old script handed out to visiting teams.
    
	Sure Sydney wont be forgotten, but its the Waca which is the talking point as Kumbles team became the first from the subcontinent to force a victory in Australias bastion.
    
	Oh no, my mind didnt go blank when we got the last wicket (Shaun Tait, bowled by Rudra Pratap Singh).... I knew wed achieved something momentous, a drained Kumble told The Telegraph.
    
	Kumble didnt get the MoM award, but his impact was there for all to see. From having the courage to bat first to giving the new ball to Pathan to introducing Sehwags part-time spin on what became the last afternoon.... 
    
	Spot on, he was.
    
	It got closer than expected, with Australia reaching as far as 340 (chasing 413), but the Indians were in control once Ponting returned to the dressing room.
    
	The series cant be won even if we take the last Test, in Adelaide from January 24, but irrespective of that result, this Waca win wont get diluted.
    
	Indeed, from England to the West Indies, generations who left the Waca with battered limbs and bruised egos would surely have raised a quiet toast to Team India.
    
	Kumble dedicated the victory (its right at the top among wins overseas) to his team, but couldve included those who landed with high hopes but got bounced out.
    
	The past few months have been fantastic for Kumble. From a maiden Test hundred (at The Oval in August) to the captaincy (in November, at the age of 37) to a historic victory at the Waca.
    
	It couldnt have got better.
    
	Yet, Kumble has remained calm. It has been a tough and challenging time. Ive learnt to be calm and to ensure one takes the right decisions. The game is ultimately bigger than anybody.
    
	Ponting put up a brave face. We didnt underestimate the Indians (after the SCG). We knew they could bounce back.... Its disappointing that we couldnt get the record, but our brand of cricket wasnt good enough. Perhaps, we didnt withstand the pressure.
    
	The wicket, Ponting added, wasnt as quick as the think tank had anticipated. Clearly, Kumble read it far better.
    
	Nobody quite envisaged a finish inside four days, quite like the Australian win at the MCG, and so a full-fledged team celebration got put on hold for a day. Most of the boys had old commitments. Well have a team dinner tomorrow, said manager Chetan Chauhan.
    
	Till then, the bubbly will keep doing the rounds.

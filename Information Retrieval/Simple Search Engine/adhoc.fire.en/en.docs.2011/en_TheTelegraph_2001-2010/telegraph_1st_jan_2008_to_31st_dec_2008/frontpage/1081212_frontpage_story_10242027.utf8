          SANJAY K. JHA                             Players observe a minutes silence for the Mumbai attack victims before the start of the first India-England Test in Chennai on Thursday. (Reuters)                                       
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: At the end of a sombre days unanimity in Parliament on confronting the terror war India faces, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sent out a steely message to Pakistan and the world.        
	Nothing less than purposeful and sustained action to dismantle terror camps in Pakistan will satisfy us. We must galvanise the international community to ensure that action to wipe out the epicentre of terror in Pakistan, but let not our commitment to civilised norms be misconstrued as a sign of weakness.         
	India has responded with restraint, he said, but its faith and patience were running out. We cannot be satisfied with mere assurances, the Prime Minister said. This is time for the international community to squarely confront the use of terrorism as an instrument of state policy.                
	While Singh promised to ensure that the memory of their (the Mumbai victims) sacrifice does not get dimmed with the passage of time, home minister P. Chidambaram vowed that India would not get back to business as usual with Pakistan unless concrete measures were taken.        
	An angry Pranab Mukherjee warned of taking action India wont like if Pakistan failed to deliver. The foreign minister demanded that the terrorists named by Delhi be handed over, proof or no proof.        
	The territorial integrity of this country cannot be played with, cannot be ignored and nobody should dare attack us. If I am expressing my anger, this is the feeling of the Indian people, an agitated Mukherjee said.        
	Taking note of the steps taken by Pakistan under pressure from the international community, the Prime Minister said Islamabad needed to do much more and ensure complete dismantling of the terror camps. Indirectly referring to the mention of Kashmir, he said no cause was enough to justify terrorism and every perpetrator of the Mumbai attack must be brought to book.        
	Singh said the international community had praised India for showing restraint but Pakistans response should be sustained, effective and convincing. He hoped the political will of the global community would get translated into firm action but added that India was not depending on this option alone.         
	But Singh also sounded contrite  he began his intervention with an apology to the people of Mumbai  and conceded gaps in the nations preparedness to face such attacks and promised several steps.        
	The terror attack has had at least one positive fallout: Parliament, the den of partisan warfare, for once spoke in one voice. They all came together  the big and the smaller parties, the ruling combine and the Opposition  to demonstrate a firm national resolve to combat terrorism.        
	The debate was a rare display of sobriety and restraint, barring a few whimpers of fault finding, and in the end everybody came together to adopt a resolution which iterated Indias solemn pledge to defend its integrity and defeat the evil designs of enemies.        
	Unlike his predecessors in the home ministry, Chidambaram presented facts with surgical precision and clarity of thought, and pacified the Opposition by conceding deficiencies in the security and intelligence apparatus. He reached out to hawkish elements by asserting that India will act to safeguard and protect its people, however long and difficult that task may be.        
	Asserting that the finger of suspicion unmistakably points to Pakistan, he said: There is one thing that I wish to make clear: given the nature of the threat, we cannot go back to business as usual. In the next few weeks and months, it will be my endeavour to take certain hard decisions.        
	Chidambarams speech had a calming effect on the Opposition as L.K. Advani promised full co-operation with the government on any hard steps to fight terror. He stressed that a message must be sent out to the world and the terrorists that India was together in this war. The treasury benches, including Sonia Gandhi and Chidambaram, thumped their desks to hail Advanis gesture.        
	Advani recalled the moment when the quarrelling Kauravas and Pandavas had joined hands to face a third-party attack.        
	The BJP leader hailed Muslims for speaking out against terror but added: Religious Islam should be respected but political Islam must be conquered. He explained this by pointing to the jihadis claim that their purpose was more than challenging Indias authority in Kashmir and they wanted to establish Islamic rule in the subcontinent.

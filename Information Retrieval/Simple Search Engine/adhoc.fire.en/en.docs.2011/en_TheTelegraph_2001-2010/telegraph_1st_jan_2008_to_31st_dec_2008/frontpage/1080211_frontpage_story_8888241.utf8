The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Calcutta gets a new hero
                                                                                                        Calcutta gets a new hero
          SAYEED SANADI                            Chowrasia during the tournament in Delhi on Sunday. (Reuters)                                 
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia, who practised putts by candlelight, today scored arguably the biggest sporting triumph by a Calcuttan in an individual sport.        
	Chowrasia, son of the man who tended the course at Royal Calcutta Golf Club, beat top international golfers  including world No. 4 Ernie Els, Mark Meara and Thomas Bjorn  to win the $2.5-million Emaar MGF Indian Masters, a European Tour event.         
	The 29-year-old Class VI dropout bagged $416,660 (about Rs 1.6 crore) but more important, earned qualification for three years on the European Tour and moved closer to realising my dream of playing on the US PGA Tour.        
	Right now my mind is totally blocked Im not able to think about anything. Im just really happy to win, the diminutive, ever-smiling Chowrasia had said at Delhi Golf Club moments after his win. But he had added: I have now got the confidence to play against the best players.                  
	Calcutta hoped the feat would do for golf in the city what Sania Mirza has done for womens tennis in India.        
	He can be the ideal role model  humble, polite and always willing to learn, said Satbinder Singh, former golf convener of RCGC where SSP grew up, caddied, learnt his skills and became obsessed with the game.        
	The humility may be more surprising because of his humble background, felt Indrajit Bhalotia, head of the Protouch Golf Academy at RCGC, Calcutta Ladies Golf Club and Tollygunge Club.        
	Unlike many caddies-turned-players or even other golfers, success has not gone to his head. Hes probably made a couple of crores in the past 4-5 years and now has his own apartment (in Bikramgarh) but keeps a low profile.        
	Chowrasias father Ganesh Prasad was the green keeper at RCGC where SSPs eldest brother Vijay Prasad drives the tractor lawnmower.        
	The other brothers, Shri Govind and Om Prakash, take turns to caddy for him. Shri did it in Delhi while Om will be with him at the Indonesian Masters before the champion returns to Calcutta a week from now.        
	Jeev Milkha Singh and Calcuttas Arjun Atwal, too, have won European Tour events, but golfing circles feel SSP stands out in being a completely home-grown player.        
	After leaving school, the youngest of the four brothers had devoted his whole time to golf, caddying to earn some money and practising even at night as his family watched amazed at their modest home on the club premises, close to the ninth green.        
	He had always shown promise since he started playing at 14, Vijay Prasad said.        
	The first taste of success came in 1999 with a tied second place in the Indian Open. SSP made it to the Asian Tour in 2006 and after several near misses, held his nerve today.        
	I wasnt thinking too much about the win, said the man nicknamed Chip-putt Chowrasia for his exceptional short game.         
	When the last putt went in, the 2,000-odd fans went into a frenzy and SSP threw the ball into the crowd. I owe it all to Royal (RCGC) and God. I dedicate my victory to the people of Calcutta, Chowrasia said in Hindi, the language he is most comfortable speaking.        
	He is the brand mascot of our club and dons the club cap and logo on his T-shirt when he plays, said M.M. Singh, CEO of RCGC, which sponsors Chowrasias travel and accommodation during Asian circuit events.        
	Hes our pride. We call him Nepali and not SSP, said club caddy Rohit Naskar who grew up with the young boy with a big dream.        
	With inputs from Subhro Saha and Mohua Das in Calcutta

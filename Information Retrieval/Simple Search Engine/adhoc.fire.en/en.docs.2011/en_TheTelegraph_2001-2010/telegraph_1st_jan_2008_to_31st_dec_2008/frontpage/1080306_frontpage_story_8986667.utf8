	Nagaon, March 5: A senior BRPL official was rescued from the captivity of Bodo militants in Assams Karbi Anglong district late last night.        
	Nagen Chandra Nath, the superintending engineer of Bongaigaon Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited, told police that two youths abducted him from his official quarters at Dhaligaon in Chirang district on January 21.         
	They took him on a motorcycle to Bongaigaon, where they shifted him to an Indica and drove him to Baithalangsu via Guwahati and handed him over to five activists of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) the next day.         
	He has since been kept in an abandoned house in Borapani reserve forest under Hamren subdivision of Karbi Anglong.        
	Additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Nityananda Goswami said they received information about Naths whereabouts around 10pm and launched a search in the reserve forest.         
	When the police team reached the hideout, five Bodo rebels were guarding Nath. They were taken by surprise and three of them were arrested. Two managed to escape. No arms and ammunition were found on them.        
	The three arrested militants, identified as Sunen Narjari, Samon Goyari and Mintu Daimari, told the police that the two rebels who had brought Nath to them were inmates of the NDFBs designated camp at Borbori in Baksa district. The BRPL has been informed about the rescue. Nath is with us. He is fine except for some mental stress, a police official said.

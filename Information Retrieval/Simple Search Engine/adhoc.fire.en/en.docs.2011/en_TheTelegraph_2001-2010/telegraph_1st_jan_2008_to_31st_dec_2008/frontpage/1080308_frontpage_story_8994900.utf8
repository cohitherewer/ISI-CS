          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kohima, March 7: A mob today lynched a militant when his gang tried to prevent them from voting during repoll in Aghunato Assembly segment in Zunheboto district.         
	Police sources said the incident occurred around 10 in the morning when a sizeable number of voters had gathered to cast their votes. The source said three armed men arrived at the booth and started shouting at the voters, asking them to leave the area immediately.         
	 At this, an elderly man tried to reason with the group, asking the men not to create any nuisance and allow the people to cast their votes peacefully. One of the cadres then grabbed the man by the collar, dragged him a little distance but within earshot of the others, hurling expletives all the while, and then threatened to shoot him if he and the others did not leave.         
	As the voters watching the drama unfold with growing anger moved towards the men, they panicked. A woman suddenly slapped one of the men, sparking a scuffle. The mob pounced on the three and beat them up with whatever they could lay their hands on, mainly sticks.         
	It was then that a group of policemen intervened and rescued the trio from the mob. But by that time, one of them was already dead.         
	The two others were shifted to a nearby health centre where their condition was stated to be stable although they, too, had suffered grievous injuries.         
	 The police are still trying to identify the trio as they were not from the area.         
	 Naga armed cadres also burnt two vehicles belonging to an NPF candidate.         
	There were reports of largescale proxy voting in todays repoll in some of the constituencies. Repoll was held in 47 booths spread over nine districts owing to damage of EVMs and other irregularities during yesterdays elections. The turnout was around 85 per cent.         
	In Jangpethong constituency, a mob from the NPF camp this evening assaulted additional deputy commissioner of Monkolemba sub-division, Y.Y. Sangtam, at his residence. His condition is stated to be stable.         
	In Zunheboto, around 15 vehicles and several houses were damaged in a clash between the Congress and supporters of an Independent candidate.         
	In Suruhoto where re-polling was held in five booths, there were reports of clashes between the supporters of the Congress and an Independent candidate.         
	There were also minor incidents in Kohima between supporters of different political parties.               
	In Atoizu, armed cadres tried to make trouble but were prevented by a mob and security forces.         
	Elaborate arrangements have been made throughout the state for tomorrows counting which will begin at 8am.

          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                                    
	Ranchi, Aug. 29: JMM chief Shibu Soren today sealed his place as chief minister of Jharkhand, sailing through the confidence vote in the Assembly as expected.         
	Delivering a passionate speech about the future of Jharkhand, Soren sought a vote of confidence amid initial bedlam in the House over pending cases against 10 MLAs under the anti-defection law. In the end, the JMM chief won hands down.        
	While 42 MLAs voted for the government, 34 voted against. The Opposition BJP was left wondering why its MLA, Kunti Singh, was absent, while nominated member J.P. Gaulston  a BJP supporter  also stayed away.        
	The Speaker had already suspended the voting rights of two BJP rebels Vishnu Bhaiya and Manohar Tekriwal who had vouched support to Soren in violation of the partys stand. But that did not effect Sorens chances.         
	Though the Left has parted ways with the UPA over the Indo-US nuclear deal at the Centre, both CPI and Forward Bloc members voted for the Soren government along with the Congress and RJD.        
	And, perhaps for the first time, the CPI-ML (Liberation) voted against the confidence motion along with the BJP.         
	Seeking a vote of confidence, chief minister Soren, who isnt a member of the Assembly, said that gaining power was necessary to fight corruption. Pledging to work for the development of the state, he reminded the House that former chief ministers Babulal Marandi and Arjun Munda were all JMM graduates.         
	What will Shibu Soren do alone? After four decades of sustained struggle, Jharkhand was created eight years back. But, there has been no change in ground realities, he said, laying the groundwork for his argument.        
	This state accounts for one-third of the countrys mineral resources. More than 50 per cent people living here are below poverty line. Not to speak of our unirrigated lands, the dams and canals too have dried up despite having spent millions of rupees. I can change it soon with your support and help. I urge Opposition members as well to vote for me, Soren said.         
	Curiously, Soren remained tight-lipped about the JMMs demand for Greater Jharkhand by incorporating a few border districts of Orissa, Bihar and Bengal.         
	He, however, promised a relief package for the flood victims of Bihar and condemned the recent attacks on Christian missionaries in Orissa. Assuring the House that no such incident would take place in Jharkhand, Soren added that the Mahtos and Manjhis, too, were akin to tribals.        
	All are equal in Jharkhand. There is no dispute over insiders and outsiders. The term Diku refers to such people who constantly create trouble and force poor tribals to flee, he said.         
	The chief minister also declared that all the Independents sworn in with him would retain their ministries as changing portfolios of ministers wasnt a viable alternative.         
	Soren, who would be inspecting the flood-hit areas in Sahebganj tomorrow in the morning, is likely to meet the governor in the evening and distribute portfolios of ministers thereafter.         
	Soren was sworn in as chief minister on Wednesday with 10 members of the Koda cabinet  excluding Chandra Prakash Chaudhary  and FB MLA Aparna Sengupta.         
	As soon as the daylong special session of the Assembly began in the morning, Opposition members stormed the Well of the House demanding a reply from the Speaker on the pending cases against 10 MLAs under the anti-defection law. Opposition members sat on dharna in the Well of the House and shouted slogans, even as Speaker Alamgir Alam argued that the Xth Schedule cases could not be decided inside the House. He added that the members in question had been given 10 days to explain their stand.        
	Then, amid noisy scenes, parliamentary affairs minister Stephen Marandi moved the confidence motion.        
	However, later a note released by the Speakers office said only the BJP rebels Bhaiya and Tekriwal had been given 10 days time. The names of the others against whom cases under the Tenth Schedule were pending werent part of the list.        
	We demanded action against all the legislators, but the Speaker chose to only oblige the treasury bench. Todays protests were necessary to bring the issue in Assembly proceedings. We will soon approach the apex court for justice, said leader of the Opposition Arjun Munda.        
	Later, JVM (P) chief Babulal Marandi issued a statement demanding Soren should declare his under-hand dealings with the Congress and the RJD that helped him assume the chief ministers post. He also questioned the dubious roles of the CPI and the Forward Bloc.

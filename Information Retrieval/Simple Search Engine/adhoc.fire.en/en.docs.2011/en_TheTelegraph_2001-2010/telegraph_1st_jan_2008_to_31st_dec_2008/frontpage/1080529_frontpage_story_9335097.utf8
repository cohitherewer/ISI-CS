                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Africa robs Surat of diamond glitter
          BASANT RAWAT                             Local shine                                  
	Surat, May 28: Diamonds are fast losing their sheen.         
	Some African nations that control the majority of the worlds diamond production have decided not to supply the gemstones in rough form to firms outside their countries for cutting and polishing.         
	Surat is the worlds largest diamond processing centre with annual business of around Rs 70,000 crore. The city has more than 6,000 big and small diamond processing units which employ about 10 lakh workers, many of whom have been retrenched or are looking for jobs in other sectors.         
	The decision has come as a huge setback to the prosperous industry in Surat, which has already been hit by the rising prices of rough diamonds, delayed payments and misuse of the credit limit by several recession-hit US buyers of gems and jewellery. The US is the worlds biggest diamond jewellery consumer market.         
	To add to their woes, the De Beers Diamond Trading Company (DTC) has, over the past few months, cancelled the agreement with eight existing polishers who had sight-holder status. Sight-holders have an assured supply of diamonds worth around Rs 1 crore every month and are immune from market vagaries or policy changes of foreign governments.         
	Four of the firms are in Belgium but owned by Indians. Three are from Surat, while one is in Mumbai.         
	But the biggest whammy has been from African countries such as Botswana, Congo, Namibia, Angola and Tanzania which together account for 45 per cent of the worlds diamond production.         
	These nations have now taken a collective decision that rough diamonds would be cut and polished locally. Because of this policy decision, the supply of rough diamonds from African countries has declined, affecting the Surat diamond industry, said Chandrakant Sanghavi, regional chairman, Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council.        
	A senior Tanzania official, Teddy Goliama, who is doing a six-month programme at the Indian Diamond Institute in Surat, confirmed that the Mizengo Pinda government in Dodoma was encouraging foreign investors to set up processing units in the country to benefit local people. Other nations with high diamond yield have followed suit.         
	The immediate impact has been that approximately 1.5 lakh cutters and polishers in Surat have been rendered jobless, said Jivraj Dharukawala, a diamond magnate.         
	Those who could, have migrated to African countries. A huge contingent of skilled artisans, numbering around 10,000, has already shifted base to Botswana, Namibia, Angola or South Africa in the last few months. Others have gone back to Saurashtra, where they had come from, or switched jobs to sectors like textile and embroidery.        
	Many top Indian diamond companies  Rosy Blue, KGK Group, Suhashish Diamond and Euro Star among them  have set up units in Africa. They have called over workers from India, especially the skilled ones, but experts pointed out that they cant possibly employ all the retrenched labourers as the move would upset the respective regimes.        
	Also, many diamond traders are sceptical about the working environment in some of these countries which have a record of ethnic violence and lawlessness.

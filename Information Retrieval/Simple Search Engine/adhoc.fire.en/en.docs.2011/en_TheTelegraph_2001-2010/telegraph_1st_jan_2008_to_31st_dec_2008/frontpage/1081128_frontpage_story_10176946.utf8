	A Calcuttan who was locked up in his room in the Oberoi Trident, where he had checked in on Tuesday, gave his account of the siege when Chandreyee Chatterjee contacted him on his cellphone on Thursday afternoon. His name and the floor number are being withheld for security reasons.        
	2.15pm        
	I was in my room in the Oberoi Trident when I heard the sound of a blast. It was around 9.45pm. I stepped out into the corridor, there were a lot of people on the floor I was staying. I saw smoke coming from the ground level.         
	There was smoke everywhere. People started running around. Some of the hotel staff came and told all the people on the floor to step inside their rooms and keep their doors locked. We were asked not to go down or move. I have been in my room since 10pm last night.         
	Since then, I have no idea of what has been going on inside the hotel as the televisions have been disconnected. The only contact I have had with people outside is through my mobile phone as the landlines in the hotel have also been disconnected.         
	Since I locked myself in the room I have had no service. The only food that I have is what is stocked in the mini-bar.         
	I believe more than hundred people are stuck inside the hotel and I have also heard that some of the staff members have been hurt.         
	There is complete silence in the hotel and I dont know if the staff have left the building but there is not a soul in sight. Then around half an hour earlier (1.45pm on Thursday), I heard another blast but I have no idea where it happened or what caused the blast.              
	4.20pm        
	The Calcuttan responded to an SMS query.        
	Asked whether he knew anything about the evacuation of people at the Trident, he said that he had heard that some people had got out from the hotel.                    
	6.30pm        
	They did start evacuating people but I am still stuck in my room and have not been able to step out. I heard that people were being evacuated floor by floor but they have not reached my floor yet.         
	The floors above the 19th floor are safe. But there might be terrorists hidden in the floors below the 19th. I also heard that there is something wrong between the link passage between the Trident and the Oberoi.         
	I also heard a bomb explosion sometime back as well as sounds of gunfire. But it seems to have stopped.              
	7.48pm        
	Asked if he was okay, the Calcuttan sent a text message: Yes. Fighting and fire in The Oberoi.

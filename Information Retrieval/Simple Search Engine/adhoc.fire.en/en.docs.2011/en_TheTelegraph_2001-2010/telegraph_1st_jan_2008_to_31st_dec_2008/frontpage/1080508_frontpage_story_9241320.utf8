	Ranchi, May 7: The state government today approved a rehabilitation package drafted by Coal India Ltd (CIL) for around 67,000 families, paving the way for evacuating Jharia where an underground fire has been raging for over 90 years.        
	After high-level meeting chaired by chief secretary A.K. Basu, CIL chairman Partho Bhattacharya said the package would be worth Rs 6,358 crore, 50 per cent of which would be contributed by CIL.        
	As reported by The Telegraph yesterday, the package involved the relocation of 67,000 families to a safe zone after the creation of adequate infrastructure. It is part of the three-phased Jharia Action Plan which would include dousing the underground fire and relocating highways and railway tracks passing over the Jharia coalfields.        
	According to sources, the package would now be okayed by the state cabinet before being sent to the Centre.        
	At todays meeting, the state government relented to the CIL plea of approving the 2004 master plan  modified in 2006  instead of insisting on incorporating the favourable components of the national R amp;R policy. Since we are not opening any new mine, the national R amp;R policy should not come into the picture, Bhattacharya said.        
	Among the others who attended the meeting included state mines and geology secretary Jaishankar Tiwary, BCCL chairman and managing director A.K. Pal, North Chhotanagpur commissioner B.K. Tripathy and Dhanbad deputy commissioner Ajay Kumar Singh.        
	All agreed that the Jharkhand Rehabilitation Development Authority would execute the package. The authority, headed by the North Chhotanagpur commissioner, would acquire land to relocate oustees.        
	As for the socio-economic survey of the area, Singh was asked to look for a new agency to replace the Central Mining Research Institute that had been involved in the job earlier.         
	Bhattacharya said that the decision to finalise the package was significant for both the mining industry as well as the people of Jharia who have been risking their lives by braving the underground fire that has been raging since 1916. The state government has urged us to open a training institute so that local boys would be employable in the upcoming mining industries, he pointed out.        
	Bhattacharya clarified that fire fighting would begin only after evacuating the area  relocation sites had been identified north of Jharia.        
	According to the package, the oustees would get houses and compensation. Besides, they would get minimum agricultural wages for 500 days. Unauthorised homeowners would have the option of getting either a house or land in lieu of their houses.

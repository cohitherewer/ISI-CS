                                Not invited                            
	Beijing, June 4 (Reuters): Movie actress Sharon Stone will not be invited to next weeks Shanghai Film Festival, state media said today, as the row over her bad karma comments about last months earthquake shows no sign of going away.        
	Media reports had said the film festival would ban Stone from attending its events on a permanent basis, but an official from the organising committee said merely that she is not among the list of guests to be invited, the China Daily said.        
	The 50-year-old star of Basic Instinct attended last years festival as the image ambassador for the French cosmetic giant Christian Dior, which has since pulled advertisements featuring Stone.

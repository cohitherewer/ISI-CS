  - Centre plans 10 ultra-mega thermal power projects          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, June 12: Orissa, one of the major coal producing states, is all set for an ultra-mega thermal power project at an estimated cost of Rs 16,000 crore in Sundergarh.        
	Talking to reporters today, Union power secretary Anil Razdan said the state government has already identified 4,000 acres and allotted water source for the plant. After the land and required infrastructure is available, the bidding process would start.         
	We are close to the start. The project now depends upon the final clearance that would be received from Central Electricity Authority, said Razdan, who met chief minister Naveen Patnaik today.        
	The Union government has already sanctioned three ultra mega power plants that are to be set up in Sasan (Madhya Pradesh), Krishnapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) and Mundhra (Gujarat) and work has already began in all three, Razdan said.         
	State energy minister Surya Narayan Patro said the government would receive one-third of the power generated from the plant. The Centre will provide finance through the public sector, Power Finance Corporation, and has allotted a coal block for the project to be executed by a private player, selected through international bidding.        
	The Centre plans to have 10 ultra mega power projects in the country with a capacity of 4,000MW each, to meet the Eleventh Plan capacitys additional target. Razdan said: We have set a big target for the first year itself. I hope we will be able to expedite the projects and receive the states co-operation for them.         
	At todays meeting, the Union power secretary also requested the state to take strict steps to prevent cable theft, which, he said had hit rural electrification in Bihar. Razdan also expressed his unhappiness over the tardy progress in execution of rural electrification projects in Orissa under the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojana.         
	Orissa lags behind all eastern states  and Razdan directed completion of all work by 2009.         
	Patro, on his part, explained that the projects were being executed by three central government undertakings  Power Grid Corporation of India, National Thermal Power Corporation and National Hydro Power Corporation.         
	The minister further added that the state government was not to be blamed for the delay and saw scarcity of manpower and materials as reasons for the progress.

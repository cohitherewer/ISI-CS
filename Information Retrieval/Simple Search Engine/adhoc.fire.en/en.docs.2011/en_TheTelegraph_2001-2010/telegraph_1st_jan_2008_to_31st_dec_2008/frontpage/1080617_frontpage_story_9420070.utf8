  - Naveen offers land, Naxalites strike neighbour        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            COBRA would replace CRPF jawans in tackling Maoists                                        
	Bhubaneswar, June 16: In a move thats expected to add bite to Orissas fight against Maoists, a Counter-Insurgency Battalion for Resolute Action (COBRA) is likely to be constituted in parts of the state with central funds.         
	Union home minister Shivraj Patil is understood to have accepted the states proposal made by chief minister Naveen Patnaik at a meeting with him in New Delhi today.         
	Patil also requested Naveen to provide land for the battalion, keeping in view long-term requirements. The chief minister, in turn, promised land, free of cost, official sources said.         
	Naveen also requested the Union home minister to enhance the reimbursement amount under security related expenditure scheme to Rs 20 crore from the existing Rs 15 crore to continue with anti-Naxalite operations.         
	Naveen also sought for the deputation of 400 CRPF personnel to the state to strengthen the Special Operation Group, exclusively meant for counter-insurgency and anti-Naxalite operations in the state. The Union home minister agreed to consider the governments requests favourably.         
	Among other requests, the chief minister also sought a waiver of Rs 71.59 crore, charged by the Centre for reimbursement of expenses on deployment of CRPF in the state, arguing that the force was mobilised to deal with inter-state problems such as anti-Naxalite operations.         
	He requested Patil to depute six IPS officers to Orissa on short-term deputation in view of the large-scale vacancies in Orissa.         
	Naveen, who heads the home department, urged for the release of funds under the police modernisation scheme, while pointing out that Rs 22.11 crore was pending release by the Centre for the current fiscal.         
	Naveen also informed Patil of a project proposal to the tune of Rs 311 crore that has been submitted to the home ministry for the phase-II prison reforms programme.         
	Naveen demanded an immediate sanction of an ad hoc grant of Rs 25 crore to continue with the reforms.         
	Appreciating the satisfactory utilisation by the state under phase-I, Patil agreed for further release of funds, official sources claimed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Basmati bother for British curry
                                                                                                           Basmati bother for British curry
          AMIT ROY                             Curry Crisis?                                  
	London, Feb. 13: Britain is facing something of a curry crisis, it was reported today, partly because of the rising price of Basmati from India and partly because stricter immigration rules have led to a shortage of catering staff.         
	Moni Varma, the chairman of Veetee Rice and one of the acknowledged Basmati barons in the UK, revealed there was now an international squabble for Indian Basmati grown in Haryana, Punjab and parts of Uttar Pradesh  its sellers market.         
	Varma, who supplies rice to the Indian restaurant trade in the UK  80 per cent of the so-called Indian establishments have traditionally been staffed by Sylhetis from Bangladesh  said he was paying almost double for Basmati.         
	A year or so ago, I was paying Rs 13 a kilo for paddy, now that has gone up to Rs 24-26 a kilo, said Varma, who has a milling factory in India where the rice is de-husked before transfer to his UK plants where the grain is polished before being sold.         
	Although Indian farmers are paying much higher prices for electricity, fertiliser, water, petrol and other raw materials, many are nevertheless finding it profitable to produce Basmati, which comes only from India and Pakistan.         
	India produces 109 million tonnes a year of all varieties of rice, explained Varma, adding that out of 3 to 4 million tonnes of Basmati produced, only 1.5 million tonnes are exported.         
	Out of the Basmati that is exported, Britain buys 50,000 tonnes, with Saudi Arabia, the US and the rest of Europe fighting it out for the remainder. The shortage has been exacerbated with the entry of Iran as a determined buyer.         
	It has become a cliche to say that curry is now Britains national dish, with chicken tikka masala, a UK invention, topping the list of favourite foods.         
	How the rising price of rice, especially of Basmati, will affect the curry lover in Britain remains to be seen but Varma said: Curry will remain cheap compared to other foods  Japanese, for example, is 10 times as expensive. But curry lovers will have to get used to paying a fair price. It wont necessarily remain cheap and cheerful.         
	Restaurants generally tend to buy rice in bulk, typically 10 bags each weighing 20kg. A year or so ago, a bag would have cost 16 to 19.        
	That is going up to 26 a bag, Varma said.         
	For the consumer in the supermarket, the price per kilo for Basmati will go up from 2 to 3.         
	Restaurants will try and absorb the price increase and keep the cost of a plate of rice down to 2 to 3 but it may have to go up, predicted Varma.         
	His comment that worldwide there is a shortage of rice  India will also hold back more for domestic consumption  was backed by other sources today.         
	Alex Waugh, the director of the Rice Association, said prices were up 60 per cent year on year and the price of Basmati, one of the most popular varieties in the UK, had almost doubled.         
	Big producers like India and China had restricted their exports, along with Vietnam and Egypt, and there were now rapidly declining stocks in the world.         
	Waugh said: If you are a restaurant owner and you are buying a lot of rice, you either reduce your margins or you put your prices up. A cost increase of that magnitude is going to feed through and this will probably see the price of a curry increase.         
	Another problem is that the government has cut off the supply of catering workers from Bangladesh and wants the curry houses to employ immigrants from eastern Europe who can get in under free movement of labour in the EU. But experience has shown that east Europeans do not want to work in curry houses and also lack the necessary aptitude.

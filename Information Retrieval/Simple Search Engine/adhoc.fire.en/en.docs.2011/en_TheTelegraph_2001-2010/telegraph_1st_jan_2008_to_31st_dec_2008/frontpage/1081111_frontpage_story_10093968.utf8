	Washington, Nov. 10 (Reuters): President-elect Barack Obama visited the White House today for his first post-election meeting with President George W. Bush, a strikingly symbolic moment in the historic transition of power in Washington.        
	The outgoing President and First Lady Laura Bush greeted Obama and his wife Michelle with smiles and handshakes as they stepped from their limousine to begin a tour of what will be their new home after Obama is sworn in on January 20.        
	Later, in the Oval Office, the two men discussed the global financial crisis, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other challenges the Republican President will bequeath to his Democratic successor.        
	It was their first face-to-face encounter  a visit steeped in symbolism  following Obamas resounding victory over Republican John McCain in Tuesdays election. Obama is Americas first black chief executive.        
	The President-elect, 47, had repeatedly attacked Bushs failed policies on the campaign trail and once said he had a lot to answer for after eight years in office. The Illinois senator swept to power campaigning on a theme of change  specifically, change from the unpopular Presidents approach to economics and foreign affairs.        
	However, there was no outward sign of tension as the Obamas began their White House visit.         
	Presidents-in-waiting traditionally make a trip to the White House between Election Day and inauguration but usually wait longer than Obama did.

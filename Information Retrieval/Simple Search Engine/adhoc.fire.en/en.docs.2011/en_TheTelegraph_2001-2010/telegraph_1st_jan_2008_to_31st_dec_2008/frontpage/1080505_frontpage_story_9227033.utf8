	Chandigarh, May 4: Indias food bowl has been pitchforked from the frying pan to the fire.        
	Five lives have been lost and thousands of quintals of wheat destroyed in Punjab and adjoining areas in Haryana because of a series of unrelated fires in the middle of a global food crisis.        
	The fires  at least one was man-made  had broken out on Thursday in southern Punjabs Muktsar and Bathinda and soon spread over 25,000 acres. As many as 60 villages in Punjab and some in Haryanas Sirsa district have been affected.        
	As harvesting was over in some of the fire-swept fields, crop damage might be limited to 15,000 acres, officials said. However, going by the reported yield of 20 quintals an acre, it is feared the crop loss could touch 30,000 tonnes. The final assessment is pending.        
	The spark for the first fire was apparently lit when farmers set stubs ablaze to clear fields for the next season. In some places, sparks from overhead wires ignited the fire. Sandstorms helped carry the cinders and set fire to fields afar. The fires have been put out, officials said.        
	Some among the five burnt alive, who included a 12-year-old girl, were caught in the blaze while looking for scattered grain. Such fires were unheard of in Punjab, said Balbir Singh Rajewal, the leader of a union of farmers.

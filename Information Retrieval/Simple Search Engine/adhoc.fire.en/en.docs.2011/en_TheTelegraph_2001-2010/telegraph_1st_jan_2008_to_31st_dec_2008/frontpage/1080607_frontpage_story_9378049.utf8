	New Delhi, June 6: Cars and two-wheelers across India may soon be ranked to indicate their fuel efficiency, under a government plan to provide consumers data to make informed vehicle purchases and conserve fuel.        
	The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), a government agency with the ministry of power, will expand its programme of comparative labelling of products for their energy performance to cover four-wheelers and two-wheelers, government sources said.        
	The labelling programme provides information about a products energy performance, and covers air-conditioners, refrigerators and tubular fluorescent lamps.         
	The sources said the goal was to introduce labelling for cars and two-wheelers in six to eight months. The BEE is working with the Petroleum Conservation Research Agency to develop a set of fuel efficiency standards for cars.         
	Each product that offers itself for scrutiny will be ranked with stars  five stars for the most energy efficient model, and one star for the least. The BEE estimates about 200MW of energy has been saved through labelling of home appliances.        
	Its still unclear if labelling for transport vehicles will be voluntary or mandatory, a government official said. But mandatory labelling is likely to be more effective.        
	A senior official with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers said the industry was open to discussions on labelling. But any future rules would need to have safeguards to prevent unnecessary litigation from consumers, the official said.        
	The energy efficiency under test conditions could be different from what drivers get on city roads. The industry doesnt want to be dragged into unnecessary litigation.        
	Sources said the labelling programme was expected to drive manufacturers into refining their technologies to approach the best energy performer in the market.        
	In the same vehicle class, a car delivering 15 km/litre has a big advantage over a car giving 12 km/litre, a source said. The manufacturer with the poorer performance will be pushed into enhancing efficiency.        
	At present, fuel efficiency data of cars collected by a government agency are not made public. This forces consumers to rely on anecdotal experiences, automobile trade journals and pitches by car salespersons in deciding the car model to buy.        
	A spokesperson with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers said car manufacturers do not release fuel efficiency values because it was not mandated by the government.        
	The BEE also plans to expand labelling to ceiling fans, colour television sets, compact fluorescent lamps, computer monitors, water heaters, industrial fans and blowers, the sources said.

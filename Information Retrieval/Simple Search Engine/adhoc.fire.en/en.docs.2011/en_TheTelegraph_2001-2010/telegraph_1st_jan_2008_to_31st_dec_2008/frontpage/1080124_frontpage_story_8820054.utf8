 - Sensex stages relief rally but West sends ominous portent 
   OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
        
	Mumbai, Jan. 23: The sensex surged today after days in the dumps, drawing comfort from the US rate cut yesterday, but questions hung over the market whether the rally would hold, especially after markets in the West slid later in the day.
 
	Bolstered by buying in frontline stocks, the sensex opened 685 points above Tuesdays close of 16729.94. At the end of a brisk and volatile session, it closed at 17594.07, up 864.13 points.
 
	Market players called it a relief rally mdash; after seven successive days of declines mdash; but they agreed that the fears of a recession in the US hadnt receded with the Fed rate cut.
 
	Speculation in the US grew that Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke might consider another rate cut next week when the policy committee meets again. 
 
	The clamour for rate cuts at home grew with CII chairman Sunil Mittal saying this was the right time to end the competitive disadvantage that Indian companies faced because of rate disparities.
 
	The Dow Jones today opened 200 points lower, indicating a challenging day for domestic equities on Thursday as two key companies mdash; Apple and Motorola mdash; announced disappointing profit forecasts. 
 
	European stocks ended at their lowest close in one-and-a-half years on Wednesday as investors relief following a surprise hefty US interest rate cut quickly vanished. In Europe, shares of energy companies were among the biggest laggards, sinking along with crude oil prices on persistent worries over a US recession. 
 
	The big burning question is whether the Fed has done enough to stem the negative tide on the credit crisis, the housing market downturn and the risk of recession. Judging by the stock and credit markets response so far, they need to fill the gap some more, an analyst said.
 
	The BSE barometer has lost 4097.51 points or 19.67 per cent in the last seven days due to weak global cues. The foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have sold more than $2 billion in the past five trading sessions.
 
	However, investors saw the sensex surge after strong rallies on the Asian markets. The sensex opened higher at 17415.26 and consolidated its gains as the day progressed. It hit an intra-day high of 17997.11, a gain of nearly 1268 points over the previous close, which was its biggest single day gain.
 
	Analysts said attractive valuations of frontline stocks also contributed to the rally. Due to the turmoil in the past seven days, valuations of many stocks had come down to levels that were clearly not warranted. Therefore, there was strong buying. Significantly, the markets could also absorb selling from investors who were booking profits at higher levels. Stability seems to have come back to the markets, said Dhiraj Sachdev at HSBC.
 
	All the sectoral indices on the BSE ended in the green. While heavyweights witnessed good buying, many mid-cap and small-cap stocks also recouped their losses.
 
	Realty, power, oil and gas, and metal shares were some of the sectors that recorded the sharpest rise. The largest percentage gain was clocked by the BSE realty index which gained nearly 11 per cent. It was followed by the BSE power index which rose over 9 per cent.
 
	Market circles said that apart from retail investors and domestic institutions, FIIs also made selective purchases, albeit in frontline stocks.
 
	Kunj Bansal, senior vice-president, portfolio management services at Kotak Securities, felt that the crisis was now over. The stock markets should start stabilising from now on, he said.
 
	But everybody is keeping a wary eye on the West.

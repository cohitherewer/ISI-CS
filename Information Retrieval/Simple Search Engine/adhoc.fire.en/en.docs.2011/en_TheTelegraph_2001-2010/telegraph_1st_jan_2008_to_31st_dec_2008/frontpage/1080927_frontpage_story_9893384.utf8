  - Hopes dashed as receding water leaves paddy rotting          SUBRAT DAS                            A half-submerged home in Kendrapada. Telegraph picture                                        
	Pundilo (Kendrapara), Sept. 26: Harekrishna Tarenia shudders when he remembers the night of September 19.         
	I saw my concrete home being pulled down by the gushing floodwaters of Paika, he says. The 60-year-old stresses that he has never witnessed the tributary of the Mahanadi react with such intensity in his lifetime.        
	Never has the floodwater breached an embankment. When the rain began we did not panic, even when the administration sounded an alert about the possibility of a high flood. In the evening we heard a roaring sound and when we rushed towards the noise, we found that the swelling Paika had breached the embankment and was gushing towards our village, he says, letting out another involuntary shudder.        
	Soon, he and other residents found themselves surrounded by 6ft high water. The village remained cut off from the rest of the world for almost a week, as it was caught between the Paika floodwater on the left and the Chitropala on the right.        
	Villagers slept under the open sky on higher ground with their cattle, as more than 60 thatched homes were washed away.        
	Not a single polythene sheet was provided to us, said Nikunja Kishore Rout. The marooned villagers were left to fend for themselves with no officials visiting the village till date.         
	The sarpanch came on Sunday with 20 bags of chuda without gur. That was his last visit, said Ashok Kumar Nayak. In the past three days, the villagers were supplied eight bags of rice, vegetables and edible oil to run a free kitchen.         
	But thats far from sufficient for more than 1,200 marooned, said a ward member.         
	Though the village has more than 1,000 cattle and 4,000 livestock, not a grain of cattle feed was provided, alleged Prasant Kumar Mohanty.                                                                    
	Similar complaints are being heard everywhere. Madhusudan Rout, sarpanch of the neighbouring Palasudha panchayat, alleged that adequate relief had not reached six villages affected by the breach on the Paika. No relief officer was appointed for the area, he added.        
	The sarpanch said 3 quintals of rice, 50kg of lentils and Rs 1,700 cash was provided yesterday to start a free kitchen for 2,200 people. Mandarins at the secretariat, however, claimed that adequate relief had reached everywhere.State disaster management secretary G.V.V. Sharma said: Relief has reached all the marooned people. He added that for the 14.42 lakh cattle affected by the flood, 827 metric tonnes of feed had been distributed.        
	Local representatives blamed the irrigation officials for the breach of the river embankments. No official inspected the embankments in our area, Rout said. The villagers tried to protect the embankment on their own, said Rabindra Mohapatra, a former sarpanch of Tendakuda panchayat.        
	Agriculture being the mainstay for Kendrapara and coastal districts, the present flood has shattered the future of the farmers. Annada Prasad Mohanty of Madhusasan village under Garadpur block was staring at the damaged paddy on his field.         
	I was expecting a good yield this year. All my hopes have been dashed, said the 58-year-old, wo owns 2 acres.        
	Akrur Das, another farmer, said he used to earn an income of Rs 7,000 to Rs 8,000 per acre. This time, I will get nothing.        
	Uttam Charan Mallick, a landless laborer, is a more worried. We are share croppers. We will neither get any compensation for the damaged crop or bank loan for raising the next crop, he said.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today asked the agriculture department officials to prepare special package of assistance for the flood-hit farmers.

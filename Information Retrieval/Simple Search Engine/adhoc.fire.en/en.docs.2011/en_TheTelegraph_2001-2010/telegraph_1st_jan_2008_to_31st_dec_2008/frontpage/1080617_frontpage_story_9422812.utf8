  - Rushing to announce fuel relief, finance ministers want Centre to share burden        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	New Delhi, June 16: State governments had tripped over each other to slash fuel taxes after the price hike; now they want the Centre to pick up the tab for their generosity.        
	The states today asked Delhi to compensate them by Rs 4,000 crore  half the cost of their efforts to lighten the common mans burden after the Centre raised petrol, diesel and cooking gas prices on June 4.        
	The demand was voiced on behalf of the states by the finance minister of Bengal, which was first off the blocks with its tax cuts after the hike.        
	Several states have decided to reduce sales tax on petrol and diesel and cut value-added rate on cooking gas or to provide subsidy. We want 50 per cent of this loss to be shared by the government of India, said Asim Dasgupta after a meeting of state finance ministers at the VAT panel, which he heads.        
	Union finance ministry officials said the Centre was unlikely to accept the demand since it was already shouldering a loss of Rs 22,000 crore by lowering customs and excise on petro products.         
	But Dasgupta said: A wrong message is going to the people as if states are prepared to take this loss. States cant take this beating further. They have limited revenue-raising power and huge developmental responsibilities.        
	Dasgupta asked why the Centre was not using the rising forex reserves to foot the oil import bill. Our forex kitty is increasing. Why cannot a part of it be used to take care of the increasing oil import bill, which in any case is paid in dollars? he asked.        
	The way petrol and diesel is handled is not a state subject and (yet) states are being asked to take a burden.        
	Although Bengal, with an eye on political gains, had announced its tax cuts without any prompting, the Prime Minister had later issued an appeal to states to cut their fuel taxes. The states anyway had their own reasons  some half a dozen are headed for the polls.        
	Ten of the 35 states and Union territories have cut sales tax on petrol and 15 on diesel, with Congress-ruled states being generally prompt in announcing the measures and the BJP-ruled states the tardiest.        
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel, backed by airlines, too had urged states to reduce sales tax on jet fuel, whose price has doubled in the past year.        
	The states today said they needed the details of how aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices were fixed before they could take a call. The issue will be discussed between June 21 and 23.

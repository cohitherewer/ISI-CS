          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Prithvi II is fired in Chandipur. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 23: The army today tested a nuclear-capable missile with a range of 350km, experimenting with launching the weapon system in conditions simulating a war theatre.         
	The Prithvi II missile has already been inducted into the army  meaning that it is in use  but todays test was the first of the missile with a range extended from 250km to 350km with a payload of one tonne.         
	The test firing today was done by the army unit attached to the Strategic Forces Command, a tri-service force that is independent of the services headquarters in theory and reports to the Nuclear Command Authority.         
	Scientists of the Defence Research and Development Organisation were supervising the test firing.         
	The surface-to-surface ballistic missile was launched from the Interim Test Range at Chandipur on the Orissa coast at 10.26 this morning.         
	Taken from the routine production lot, the missile is launched with an improved Aided Inertial Navigation system and achieved high degree of accuracy, an official statement said.         
	Asked if it had hit the target, a DRDO official said the circular error of probability (the zone surrounding the target of the missile or CEP) was very small and we can assume that it hit the target.         
	The statement claimed that the missile has abilities to deceive ballistic missile defence systems.         
	This launch in effect confirms the capabilities and dependability of the Prithvi Weapon System in strategic role, the statement said.

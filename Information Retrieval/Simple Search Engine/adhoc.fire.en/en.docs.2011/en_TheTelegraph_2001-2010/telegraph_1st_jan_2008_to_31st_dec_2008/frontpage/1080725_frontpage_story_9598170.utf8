          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Kohima, July 24: The Nagaland Peoples Front today decided to expel MP W. Wangyuh Konyak for his indisciplined conduct in supporting the UPA government during the trust vote on Tuesday, in defiance of the partys directive.         
	Shilu Mar, associate press secretary of the NPF, said party president Shurhozelie Liezietsu would sign the expulsion order after he returned from New Delhi next week.         
	Before the trust vote, Shurhozelie had said his party would vote against the UPA to protest against the imposition of Presidents rule in the state last year, ahead of the Assembly elections.         
	We will convene a meeting on Monday or Tuesday to seal Konyaks fate, Mar told The Telegraph.         
	Konyak had yesterday said he had merely followed the instruction of certain leaders of his party to vote for the UPA.         
	Mar, however, rebutted Konyaks claim, saying it was fabricated and baseless.         
	The NPF had categorically directed him to vote against the UPA, he added.         
	The working committee of the NPF also accused Konyak of accepting a bribe from the Congress to cross-vote.         
	The NPF working committee condemned Konyaks action in using his position for personal gain, for damaging the principle and ideology of the NPF and for maligning the image of the party, Mar said.         
	Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio, too, indirectly accused Konyak of receiving a bribe from the Congress.         
	He said the Congress had to win the trust vote by bribing and luring the MPs to vote in favour of the motion or abstain from voting.         
	Konyaks action has also angered the BJP, which is a coalition partner in the Rio-led Democratic Alliance of Nagaland (DAN) government.         
	The BJP, which has two MLAs supporting the government, demanded immediate action against Konyak and said he should give up the Lok Sabha seat for having betrayed the people.         
	The party in a statement said Konyak has lost the moral right to continue as an MP, as he was elected as a DAN candidate.         
	The Opposition Congress was, of course, euphoric about the signs of a rift in the NPF.         
	Congress leader K.V. Pusa also hinted at Konyaks return to the party fold.         
	Konyak quit the Congress in 2003 and joined the NPF and later contested the lone Lok sabha seat as the NPF candidate in 2004.         
	The BJP had supported his candidature.

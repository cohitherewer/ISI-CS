	Mohali, April 25 (PTI): Mumbai Indians captain Harbhajan Singh and Kings XI paceman S. Sreesanth were tonight involved in a bitter row, following which the fast bowler was seen crying bitterly on the ground .        
	Harbhajan allegedly slapped Sreesanth after the paceman said something during the IPL match here.        
	The off-spinner, however, had a long chat with Sreesanth in the dressing room of the Punjab team and is believed to have apologised.        
	Harbhajan did not speak on the issue when he came to address the post-match media conference.        
	Can we have questions on just cricket? Harbhajan said, asked what happened between him and Sreesanth.        
	The winning captain Yuvraj Singh was upset by the unsavoury incident and termed it ugly.        
	This is really an ugly incident. You do not want to see such things off the field, especially after such a win. I am pretty upset at what has happened. This is totally unacceptable, he said.        
	Yuvraj said he did not know what transpired between the two. I do not know what exactly happened but one does not want to see such things happening.        
	Kings XI coach Tom Moody was also upset by the incident and termed Harbhajans behaviour unacceptable.        
	At the end of the day, players shake hands. But today saw more than that from Harbhajan and Sreesanth. It is unacceptable behaviour and I am sure officials will take note.        
	The positive thing is that Harbhajan had a long chat with Sreesanth. But I am not sure what ramifications this incident will have, Moody said.        
	Upset after his teams third successive defeat, the Turbanator also sounded unhappy with his teammates. When you lose, nothing seems to be okay. I wont bowl and bat for other people. They have to be captain of their own batting and own bowling. I cannot do others job.        
	He added: I dont like losing. When you lose, you dont feel happy.

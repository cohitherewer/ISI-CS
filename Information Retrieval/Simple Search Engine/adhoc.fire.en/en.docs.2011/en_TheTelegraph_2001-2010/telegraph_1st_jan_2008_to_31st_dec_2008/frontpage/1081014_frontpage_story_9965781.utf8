          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi was in a serious condition this evening at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences after his second heart attack in three months, doctors said.        
	Das Munshi had suffered a heart attack late in the night and was brought to AIIMS around 2.30am on Monday where he was diagnosed with complete left ventricular failure of the heart, institute doctors said.         
	Hes serious, but stable, D.K. Sharma, the AIIMS medical superintendent, said this evening. His vital (parameters) are maintained. Hes under close observation, and were monitoring his blood pressure, heart rate and urine output.        
	A PTI report said Das Munshi had been put on a ventilator. Sharma declined comment on whether Das Munshi was on the machine.         
	Das Munshi, 62, had undergone angioplasty with insertion of two stents to clear arterial blockages at a hospital in Calcutta in July this year. He was discharged on July 17, five days before the confidence vote the UPA government won.        
	He did not play any active role in the run-up to the trust vote but had been shuttling between Delhi and Bengal  he heads the state Congress frequently since then. The minister, a diabetic, was seen dancing during Puja.        
	In July, tests had revealed multiple blockages in his left coronary artery, a key blood vessel that supplies to the muscles of the left ventricle.         
	Left ventricular failure is a potentially life-threatening problem involving this vital structure of the heart, and a medical emergency. A severe restriction, or a temporary cessation, of blood flow to the muscles of the left ventricle because of a blockage can destroy a part of the muscles, leading to inefficient pumping.        
	This causes fluid to back up into the lungs, leading to breathing difficulty or frothy cough.         
	It has a spectrum of presentations  from mild to moderate to life-threatening. But left ventricular failure in relation to a heart attack can be bad, said a cardiologist who was formerly at AIIMS.         
	Cardiologists not associated with Das Munshis case said a heart attack followed by left ventricular failure within a few months of angioplasty raises the possibility of a condition called sub-acute stent thrombosis.         
	Doctors declined to say whether the political assignments Das Munshi had taken up soon after his angioplasty in July could have precipitated conditions that led to the second heart attack. But, they said, stress is a known contributing risk factor. A strict regimen of diet and lifestyle restrictions usually helps reduce the chances of a fresh attack.        
	Theres a high possibility of sub-acute stent thrombosis, a situation in which a clot forms in the stent region, said S.K. Gupta, an interventional cardiologist at Apollo Indraprastha Hospital, New Delhi. Stress can be a precipitating factor, but most of the time, we encounter such a situation when patients miss some doses of drugs theyre supposed to take after angioplasty, Gupta said.         
	AIIMS doctors declined to reveal the specific condition that might have led to the current complication. Right now, we first want to see him improve. Well work on the cause and future treatment after hes totally out of danger, Sharma said.         
	A cardiologist not familiar with Das Munshis case said the seriousness of left ventricular failure depends on the actual proportion of the muscle that has been lost during the heart attack. If more than 40 per cent of the heart muscle is lost, the situation will be critical, the cardiologist said.

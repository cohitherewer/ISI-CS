          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, July 7: The Planning Commission has criticised the Jharkhand governments unrealistic plans for agricultural growth wherein only 10 per cent of budgetary allocations were used for improving productivity while the majority of the funds was spent in publicity campaigns and field visits.        
	During their meeting with senior government officials, commission members Abhijit Sen and B.N. Yugandhar were shocked to find that the state did not have schemes for soil testing and enrichment. Most of the existing schemes, including distribution of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides or the post-harvest support to farmers lay in shambles.         
	At the meeting  deputy commissioners were also present  the members also expressed their unhappiness over the functioning of other departments as well.         
	Development commissioner Ashok Kumar Singh admitted the districts of Giridih, Koderma and Godda had fared poorly on the agricultural front. West Singhbhum and Bokaro, too, were bad. Some of these districts may even lose their backward region grant fund allocations, if the things do not improve, he added.        
	After the meeting, Singh spoke to Giridih deputy commissioner Vandana Dadel in person and advised her to chalk out fresh plans immediately by stressing on agricultural projects through NREGS and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana.        
	Singh will now direct deputy commissioners to adopt blocks and villages in their respective domains to identify families living below the poverty line, carry out plantations on barren land and set up nurseries in all the blocks. Agriculture is not possible on all available land. Where land levelling is not possible afforestation should be done. Horticulture needs to be taken up on mass scale, he said.

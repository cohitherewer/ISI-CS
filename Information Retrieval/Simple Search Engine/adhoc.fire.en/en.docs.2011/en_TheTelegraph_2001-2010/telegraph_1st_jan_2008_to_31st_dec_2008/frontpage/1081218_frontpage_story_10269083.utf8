          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Raju: Stonewalled                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 17: Satyam Computer Services, the countrys fourth largest software maker, has been pulled into the vortex of a raucous debate on abysmal corporate governance standards in India.        
	The Rs 8,473.5-crore infotech giant became the first target of shareholder activism that forced a beleaguered management to drop plans for a $1.6-billion takeover of two family-run companies.        
	The weird soap opera that began on Tuesday evening exploded into a farrago of questions, raising the possibility of a shareholder clamour for a new slate of directors and the likelihood of a hostile takeover.        
	The Satyam board of directors which cleared the proposal for the buyout of Maytas Properties and Maytas Infra  companies that were run by the sons of founder B. Ramalinga Raju  faced flak for failing to stonewall Rajus proposal.        
	Raju said the company had followed meticulous and highest corporate governance norms. But stakeholders and analysts were astounded by the manner in which the promoters  who owned just 8.6 per cent stake in the company  tried to ram through a proposal without seeking shareholders approval.        
	We would not be surprised to see a concerted effort in management change and a reduction in the board of directors, said a report by Kotak Securities.        
	There was no indication that foreign institutional investors, domestic mutual funds and insurance companies  which together own 61.57 per cent of the equity  were planning to gang up against the management.        
	But brokerages across the board have put a sell on the company. International brokerage CLSA said the harm done to Satyams credibility was likely to be long-lasting.        
	A report by JP Morgan said the transaction effectively tried to transfer all cash on Satyams balance sheet to Raju and the other promoters of the two companies. JP Morgan Asset Management has a small stake in the company.        
	We see this as a serious corporate governance issue and believe investors should avoid the stock, the report added.         
	Satyam has brought disrepute not only upon itself, but also on corporate India, said HDFC Securities.

	Ranchi, Nov. 26: Jharkhand High Court has directed the state income-tax department to look into the assets of ministers Bandhu Tirkey, Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Dulal Bhuiya, Kamlesh Singh and Chandra Prakash Choudhary, while hearing a PIL today.        
	Surya Singh Besra, a former MLA and leader of Separate Statehood Movement, today filed the PIL in the high court seeking an inquiry into the disproportionate assets of all leaders who have become chief minister of Jharkhand.        
	The ministers include present chief minister Shibu Soren, former chief ministers Arjun Munda, Babulal Marandi and Madhu Koda.        
	The court directed the income-tax commissioner to submit a report regarding the matter after the PIL pointed out alleged discrepancies in the assets possessed by the ministers.        
	A division bench comprising Chief Justice Gyan Sudha Misra and Justice D.K. Sinha issued the notice directing him to furnish the results by December 12, when the next hearing is.         
	The court also directed the state to produce the FIRs that a special judge of the vigilance court had asked the state government to register against urban development minister Hari Narayan Rai and rural development minister Anosh Ekka.         
	However, the vigilance bureau today failed to lodge the FIRs against both the ministers in pursuance of the courts directive. Inspector-general M.V. Rao, however, assured that his men were on the job.        
	Ekka and Rai, along with other four ministers and one former minister, have been arraigned in the case for possessing assets disproportionate to their incomes.        
	Arguing on the behalf of the state, senior advocate R.K. Dhawan argued that the vigilance court had no records or proof to prove the guilt of most ministers. The Supreme Court counsel further argued that allegation against Sahi and Bandhu Tirkey were baseless.         
	Dhawan argued the pending criminal cases against HRD minister and health minister were not substantial enough to attract CBI inquiry, as was sought for in the PIL.        
	Dhawan defended Sahi and Bhuiyan, who in the PIL, were accused of having procured lands in the names of their wives. The counsel protested that the purchase of property could not be seen as a criminal offence.         
	The advocate also stressed that since a vigilance case has already been registered against Ekka and Rai in this regard, there was no reason for a further CBI inquiry.        
	Arguing for the petitioner, advocate Ritu Kumar thwarted Dhawans contentions and cited Supreme Court decisions where CBI inquiry was directed in similar cases.

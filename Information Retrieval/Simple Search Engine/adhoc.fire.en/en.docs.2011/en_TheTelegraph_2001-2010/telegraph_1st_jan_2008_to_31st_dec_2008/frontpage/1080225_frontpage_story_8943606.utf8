	Feb. 24: The Bengal chief minister has invited all opposition parties in the hills for a meeting in the capital on February 26. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has refused to be part of the team although three of its leaders will be heading to Delhi.        
	They will meet the Opposition leaders and will seek an appointment with the Prime Minister, said Binay Tamang, the press and publicity secretary of the Morcha. He said the party had earlier attended a meeting with the state government in Calcutta and was interested in talks provided such a discussion was held in Darjeeling.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees invitation was conveyed to the hill parties by Darjeeling district magistrate Rajesh Pandey.         
	The Darjeeling situation is worrisome. I appeal to those who are on hunger strike to withdraw it. I also invite them for a discussion after they end the fast, said Bhattacharjee in Calcutta before leaving for the CPM politburo meeting in Delhi. Sources in the CPM said Bhattacharjee would like to meet the Morcha leadership after his return to the city.         
	At an all-party meeting convened by the BJP in Darjeeling yesterday, it was decided that representative of six parties, except the Morcha, would meet Bhattacharjee in Delhi.         
	G.S. Yonzone, president, BJP (hills), said the delegation would be apprising the chief minister on the situation in the hills and demand the scraping of the Sixth Schedule status bill. The GNLF and the CPM had not attended the meeting.        
	The BJP leader also said the team would protest against Asok Bhattacharyas unconstitutional remark. His statement is unbecoming for a minister and has created a huge uproar in the hills. We are Indians and have the right to democratically protest in any part of the country. We will demand that the chief minister ask him to apologise or else force him to resign, said Yonzone. The urban development minister had earlier said the protesters were trying to create problems among people of two different communities and the Morcha protest was equal to rowdism.On Friday, in an article that appeared in party mouthpiece Ganashakti, Bhattacharya, however, accused Subash Ghisingh of running the DGHC as his personal fiefdom.         
	But the Morcha demand for separate statehood is unacceptable, the article reads. The Morcha is against the Sixth Schedule status and wants Gorkhaland instead. The party has been demanding Ghisinghs removal as caretaker administrator of the council and in protest has called an indefinite shutdown in the hills. Morcha supporters had set up blockades across the hills to prevent Ghisingh from entering the hills after his return from Delhi on February 18.         
	After spending five days at Pintail on the outskirts of Siliuri, Ghisingh came to Calcutta on Friday. Today was his second day at Gorkha Bhavan in Salt Lake. He is expected to leave for Delhi tomorrow as the special status bill is likely to be discussed in the budget session of Parliament that begins tomorrow.

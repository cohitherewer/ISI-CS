          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kurseong July 1: The authorities of a school in Kurseong have passed a resolution to expel a contractual teacher allegedly for speaking against Gorkhaland and Bimal Gurung in class.        
	Rabin Tamang teaches geography in Panchawati High School at Selphu Bustee, 35km from Kurseong town. Like all contractual teachers, he is an employee of the DGHC.        
	The teacher spoke in class against Gorkhaland and our president Bimal Gurung on June 25. The matter came to light after the students told their parents about it. We gheraoed the school yesterday and pressured the authorities to expel him, said Ratan Thapa, the Sittong-Selphu area convener of the Morcha.        
	We asked the students and they told us that the teacher had spoken against Gorkhaland and Bimal Gurung. We have sent the resolution to expel the teacher to the authorities concerned, who will take the final decision, said school managing committee president Ambar Chettri.        
	However, the chief principal secretary of the council, Rajesh Pandey, said he had not received any information on the matter.        
	Tamang has been working in the school since 2000 and is the only earning member in a family of eight. I definitely delivered a lecture on Gorkhaland, but not against it. The students may have misinterpreted the whole matter, said Tamang, adding that he was teaching Class VI students.

	Islamabad/New Delhi, Dec. 8: Pakistani security forces have arrested the suspected mastermind of the Mumbai carnage, Lashkar-e-Toiba operations chief Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, after a raid aided by army helicopters on an alleged terror training camp.        
	Over a dozen people, including Lakhvi, were arrested in Sundays operation in an area northwest of Muzaffarabad (the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir), a senior official told The Telegraph.        
	According to Mumbai police, the lone arrested gunman  whose real name was today said to be Mohammed Ajmal Amir Iman (not Kasab)  had said he took his orders from Lakhvi and had trained for some time at a militant camp near Muzaffarabad. India had forwarded Lakhvis name to Pakistan.        
	The arrests are Islamabads first attempt to respond to mounting pressure from India and the US to act against the Lashkar, accused of planning the Mumbai attack. The troops exchanged fire with the militants for almost three hours and local people reported seeing army helicopters and hearing loud explosions, sources said.        
	The raid was condemned by Hafiz Saeed, co-founder of the banned Lashkar and head of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a supposedly charity India accuses of being a Lashkar front. Saeed claimed the raided compound, about 5km from Muzaffarabad, was a relief camp housing 2005 earthquake victims, and said the operation had shown the Pakistan governments weakness.        
	No civilian or military official has so far either confirmed or denied the operation, but the use of helicopters and explosions suggest Islamabad was eager for its action to be noticed.        
	Delhi and Washington, though, are unlikely to be satisfied unless Islamabad prosecutes those arrested and acts against other militant groups linked to attacks in India. We have seen the reports but are yet to understand the intent and the seriousness, a senior Indian official said. He added that in 2002, shortly after the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament, Islamabad had closed down some militant offices but allowed them to open afterwards.         
	Pakistan today rejected what it said was a demand by India to hand over three alleged terrorists and criminals, saying people found to be involved in terrorist activities would be dealt with under Pakistani law.        
	India says it has asked for 20 fugitives to be handed over, including Hafiz Saeed, but Pakistani officials deny this, saying Delhis request relates only to gangster Dawood Ibrahim, 1993 Mumbai blast accused Tiger Memon and Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Maulana Masood Azhar.        
	Sources said the security forces first ordered Lashkar members to surrender. When they refused, a military helicopter shelled the camp, prompting the militants to fire.        
	Residents of the area, Shawai Nullah, said the troops blew up buildings at the camp, which had an office, a seminary, a madarsa and quarters housing about 150 people. A BBC correspondent reported seeing 14 army vehicles leave the area after the operation.        
	A senior Pakistani official said the crackdown could be extended to other areas. PTI quoted sources to say several Lashkar activists, who had set up camps in Islamabad to collect hides of animals slaughtered during Id, had been arrested.

	Berlin, July 24 (Reuters): US presidential candidate Barack Obama urged Europe today to stand by the US in bringing stability to Afghanistan and confronting other threats from climate change to nuclear proliferation.        
	In the text of a speech to be delivered at the Victory Column in Berlins Tiergarten park, Obama said America had no better partner than Europe and cautioned the allies against turning inward. No one welcomes war. I recognise the enormous difficulties in Afghanistan, Obama said in the only formal speech he is to give on his week-long tour of Europe and West Asia.        
	But my country and yours have a stake in seeing that Natos first mission beyond Europes borders is a success. For the people of Afghanistan, and for our shared security, the work must be done. America cannot do this alone.        
	Obama, who is highly popular in Germany, spoke to a crowd one local official estimated at 100,000. The German media has compared his appearance to former President John F. Kennedys famous 1963 Ich bin ein Berliner address.        
	Obama did not break into German like Kennedy, but spoke at length of the historic ties between the US and Germany, touching on the Berlin airlift 60 years ago and the fall of the Berlin Wall.        
	The fall of the Berlin Wall brought new hope. But that very closeness has given rise to new dangers, he said. No one nation, no matter how large or powerful, can defeat such challenges alone.        
	He said Europe and the US needed to stand together to send Iran a message that it must abandon its nuclear ambitions and urged both sides to move beyond their differences over the Iraq war to help suffering Iraqis rebuild their lives.

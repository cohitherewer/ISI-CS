	Five theories are in circulation as pundits and players try to make sense of the darkest days in Indias stock market history. The theories and answers to some of the most frequent questions follow.
 
	Global cues 
 
	Immunity from overseas developments mdash; the comfort zone of Indian markets mdash; crumbled with the entry of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) as decisive players.
 
	Many used to think that the country was not integrated enough and it could decouple from the rest of the world in a moment of crisis. The proponents of this line point to the Asian market meltdown in 1997 when India wasnt as badly affected as the other Southeast Asian markets.
 
	But the current crisis proves that if America sneezes, India has little option but to catch the chill. All this talk of decoupling is just humbug, says Ambareesh Baliga of Karvy Stock Broking.
 
	Besides talk of a slowdown in the US, the other big worry is the sub-prime credit crisis in the American home mortgage markets.
 
	The crisis broke out about a year ago and arose because of loans to people with poor credit histories. Most of the mortgage lenders had covered their risks on the dodgy loans by securitising them mdash; in effect creating some more tradable paper whose value depended on these high-risk loans.
 
	The new paper was offered to the bigger players in the financial sector mdash; entities like Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, Citigroup and UBS. When people defaulted on these loans, everyone got hurt.
 
	The trouble is there is no sign that the crisis has blown over. Then came the write-downs. Citigroup recently wrote off $18 billion, Merrill Lynch $16 billion and UBS $13 billion. On Tuesday, Bank of America announced a writedown of $5 billion.
 
	The amounts as well as the players are huge and the ripple effect is now telling on markets like India. The writedowns have stoked fears that more trouble looms for the financial sector, which could be one of the reasons for FIIs to turn sellers here. In times such as these, they usually opt for traditional, safer markets but there is no clear pattern yet to suggest where the money is flying from India.
 
	Many investment banks saddled with valueless assets mdash; a legacy of the sub-prime credit crisis mdash; could also be selling securities before the situation worsens.
 
	When panic sets in, fear mdash; not fundamentals mdash; drives even hard-nosed bankers. 
 
	The Times, London, reports that some brokers have started worrying about a nasty financial shock mdash; possibly the collapse of a bank, insurer or a large fund manager. In such an atmosphere, everybody plays safe.
 
	FII selling
 
	FIIs, the prime movers of the Indian stock markets, are unlikely to have remained immune to the write-down haemorrhage. Many of the giants shaken by the sub-prime credit crisis have big fund-managing and broking wings whose operations here are certain to feel the heat.
 
	The FIIs have sold stocks worth over $2 billion in India over the past four sessions in tandem with what they did overseas. The FIIs are selling stocks across all Asian markets, which include India, says Hitesh Agrawal, head of research, Angel Broking. 
 
	The FIIs want to lighten up their portfolio till the US Federal Reserve makes some positive announcement. But we have started seeing the FIIs buying from the afternoon trading session (on Tuesday), adds Agrawal.
 
	The crisis has come at a time the FIIs had turned somewhat muted in India after Sebi came out with norms on participatory notes late last year. The watchdog tightened a mechanism that allows overseas investors to play the Indian market through FIIs.
 
	Relentless rise 
 
	The Indian stock markets had risen too far, too fast and did not correct when other markets did. This gave way to a brutal fall. The sensex has fallen over 25 per cent in nine trading sessions since January 10 when it hit a new high of 21206.77. Sometimes market bottoms are not made by specific events, but by exhaustion, says Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, but in reference to the slide in the US.
 
	Leveraged positions
 
	Over-excited investors borrowed money to buy stocks. The result: when stocks crashed, brokers asked for payment of additional margins. Some investors could not put up the cash; the brokerages chose not to wait and sold stocks they were holding for their clients fearing more carnage ahead. This had a domino effect on the markets. 
 
	Lack of liquidity
 
	The Reliance Power IPO saw bids worth over Rs 7.50 trillion. Had it not been for the IPO, some of this money would have come into the stock markets.
 
	Do state-owned financial institutions buy when the FIIs sell? Are they instructed by the government to prop up the market?
 
	It isnt much of a counter-weight. But Canara Bank, for instance, bought shares worth Rs 500 crore on Tuesday. Bank chiefs are likely to meet finance ministry officials soon to chalk out a strategy for the weeks ahead.
 
	Domestic institutions, including banks and the state-owned insurance companies, were net buyers at Rs 3,000 crore on Monday. Of this, insurance players bought stocks worth Rs 2,000 crore. On Tuesday, the domestic institutions bought stocks worth Rs 2,778 crore (according to Sebis provisional data).
 
	Is the US economy slowing down?
 
	The US economy is expected to grow by 2.3 per cent in the current year, compared with the earlier projection of 2.9 per cent. The downward revision has been attributed to the slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter of 2007. The US economy grew by only 0.6 per cent in the first quarter, 3.8 per cent in the second quarter and 4.9 per cent in the third quarter of 2007. The US economy had grown by 3.1 per cent in 2006.
 
	Who hurts most from a US recession?
 
	Everybody does. But markets choose to react differently. If it was India on Monday, it was clearly Hong Kong and China on Tuesday. The slump was evident across the markets in the Asia-Pacific region.
 
	Why does talk of a US recession hurt India? Are we globalised enough? 
 
	Thats the funny thing about this crash. Talk of a recession should have hurt markets in China and Japan more mdash; since they are the biggest exporters to the US. But markets follow their own logic. The sensex has fallen the hardest: 25 per cent since January 10.
 
	The share of exports in Chinas GDP is as high as 36.6 per cent. Exports to the US alone are as high as 21 per cent. But there is a view that slower exports will help the Chinese economy avoid overheating and check inflation.
 
	US accounts for a little over 13 per cent of all exports from India. In April-September 2007, exports to the US amounted to a little over Rs 40,000 crore (or $10 billion).

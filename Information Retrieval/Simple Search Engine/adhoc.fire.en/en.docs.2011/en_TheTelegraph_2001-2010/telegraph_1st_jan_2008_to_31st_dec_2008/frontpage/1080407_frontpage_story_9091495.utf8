  - 2.3 lakh extra visitors visit Nandan Kanan in last financial year          OUR CORRESPONDENT       
	Bhubaneswar, April 6: Even the soaring mercury has failed to disturb Nandan Kanans charm  at least that is what the rising number of visitors at the zoological park indicates.         
	The park has registered the highest ever visitor turnout this year.         
	Some 17.32 lakh people visited the park during 2007-08, an increase of 2.3 lakh over the previous year.         
	The highest turnout also saw revenue collection touching a record Rs 2.02 crore.         
	With increasing footfall, authorities have decided to augment amenities and add to the exhibition value.         
	This year an ambitious animal exchange programme is being pursued and the zoo is in middle of talks with its counterparts to secure new animals.         
	It is heartening to note that Nandan Kanan is becoming more popular every year. Keeping this in mind, high priority would be given in the coming fiscal to augment visitors amenities, said park director Ajit Pattnaik.        
	For the first time, Nandan Kanan authorities are procuring a giraffe.         
	By the end of May, the animal is expected to be here as talks with Alipore zoo is over. For the special guests the park has nearly completed a special enclosure.         
	Also in this year the park has also allotted Rs 15 lakh for the reconstruction and renovation of tiger enclosure and another Rs 20 lakh for the reconstruction of the perimeter wall of the lion safari.         
	Similarly, an enclosure for elephant, complete with a moat, and a breeding centre for vultures are on the cards.        
	These two would be built at an estimated cost of Rs 60 lakh.         
	Besides, a 6-acre meadow is being developed as a central park with sitting area, drinking water kiosks, trash cans and lavatories. The state tourism department is also supporting the zoo to develop the facilities.         
	For the zoos stars an online chlorination plant has been installed to supply safe drinking water.         
	The safe water would also be provided to the tourists along with the birds and animals.

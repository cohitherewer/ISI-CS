  - PCG meet at Mamoni house remains inconclusive          A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, June 28: After a brief ceasefire-induced lull, security forces have beefed up counter-insurgency operations against the B (Bravo) company of Ulfas 28 battalion that has its operational areas in Sivasagar, Lakhimpur, Jorhat (including Majuli) and parts of Golaghat.        
	Checkposts have been set up on all major roads in the districts apprehending subversive activities by the B company of the elite strike force to show its strength.         
	The company headed by Sujit Mohan had agreed to be part of the unilateral ceasefire declared by the A and C companies of the 28 battalion, but pulled out at the last moment.         
	Sources said Mohan and his deputy Ram Singh had fled to the outfits camps in Myanmar.         
	It will not be hard to identify the B company cadres since most cadres of the A and C companies have shifted to the camp in Sadiya, a senior army officer in Sivasagar district said.         
	Speaking over phone from Sadiya today, commander of the A and C companies of the battalion, Moon Borah alias Jiten Dutta, said: The B companys leaders said they would join the unilateral ceasefire declaration soon, but we have no information from them till now.         
	Dutta said efforts were still on to convince the leadership of other Ulfa battalions (27, 109, 709) to join the ceasefire declaration to facilitate the peace process.         
	We are also trying to convince their leadership to sit for talks in the interest of the state.         
	Sources in the home department said declaration of ceasefire soon by other battalions was just a matter of time because they will have no other option left.         
	Security forces have got a clear picture of the militants hideouts and the routes they use to enter the neighbouring states and Myanmar. From now on, operations would be specific, a senior home department official said.         
	General-officer-commanding of the Red Horns Division, Maj. Gen. Chander Pradesh, said the army would conduct a particular operation only on the basis of 100 per cent specific information regarding the presence of militants.         
	Unlike in earlier times, we will not go for a raid in a particular area based on suspicion. The information has to be specific, he said.         
	PCG meet: The Ulfa-constituted Peoples Consultative Group (PCG) today held threadbare discussions on the prevailing law and order situation in Assam and its own role in the botched peace process between the outfit and the Centre.         
	The nearly four-hour-long meeting at the residence of writer Mamoni Raisom Goswami, however, remained inconclusive.        
	Except jailed Hiranya Saikia and co-ordinator Rebati Phukan, the other eight members and chief co-ordinator Goswami were present at the meeting.         
	The PCG will meet again in the next couple of days to chart out its future course of action.

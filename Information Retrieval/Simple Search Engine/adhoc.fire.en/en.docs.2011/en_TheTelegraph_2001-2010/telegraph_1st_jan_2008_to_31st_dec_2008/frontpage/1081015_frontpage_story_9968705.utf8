	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 14: A CRPF jawan was killed in renewed violence in Kandhamal hours after chief minister Naveen Patnaik suggested that all was fine at the meeting of National Integration Council in New Delhi yesterday.         
	Talking to The Telegraph, Kandhamal superintendent of police S. Praveen Kumar said the body of Buxi Singh was recovered from a hilly stream in a forested area near Sisapanga village under Raikia police station, 221km from here, after an intensive search operation late last night.        
	Singh and one of his colleagues, who were put up at the Gundhani CRPF camp, were in Sisapanga to buy meat. Reportedly, they were attacked by a group of six to seven Hindu tribals.         
	While his colleague escaped unhurt, Singh was dragged to a nearby forest and hacked to death, said SP Kumar.         
	Later, a combing operation was launched in the area but no arrests were made till this evening.        
	The body of the deceased, who was working with Assam Delta 175 Battalion, was brought to Bhubaneswar and was later flown to Assam.         
	Though officers remained clueless on the reason behind the attack, locals have suggested that the violence was a fallout of the excesses of the paramilitary forces.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who returned from New Delhi this afternoon after attending the council meeting, repeated that stringent action would be taken against the perpetrators of violence.        
	He, however, remained non-committal on the allegations of excesses on paramilitary forces and stated the law will take its own course.        
	The Kui Samaj Samanwaya Samiti, an apex body of tribal organisations in Kandhamal that met at Phulbani today, demanded the immediate withdrawal of central paramilitary forces.        
	The group also demanded the release of innocent tribals. Samiti secretary Lambodar Kanhar threatened a powerful agitation if their demands were not met.        
	The Samiti also disapproved of the appointment of senior IAS officer, M.S. Padhi as the special administrator for Kandhamal branding him anti-tribal. With the death of the jawan, the official toll in Kandhamal has gone up to 37, most of whom are Christians.         
	Leader of the Opposition J.B. Patnaik, who was on a two-day visit to Kandhamal, visited relief camps and riot-hit villages.         
	He blamed the Naveen Patnaik government for the continuance of violence and appealed to all to maintain peace and harmony.        
	Union minister of steel, fertilisers and LJP president Ramvilas Paswan while reiterating his demand for a ban on Bajrang Dal, today sought the constitution of national screening committee to ascertain the nationalist credentials of organisations.

          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 25: Two months after the ethnic clashes in Khandhamal, the Orissa government today announced a special programme for the tribal-dominated backward district.         
	Khandhamal, with 51.96 per cent tribal population, is rated as one of the most backward districts of Orissa. It         
	witnessed an ethnic strife in the last week of December that claimed three lives and paralysed its economic development for months.         
	Khandhamal lies on a high-altitude zone with inaccessible hilly terrain and narrow valley tracts, an environmental factor, which guides the socio-economic condition of the area. The district shows an economic disparity, with 78 per cent of the total households living below the poverty line.         
	Considering the poverty, literacy rate and backwardness as underlying causes for the communal and ethnic disturbances in the district, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today finalised a special programme especially to promote horticulture and vocational education.         
	This will go a long way in promoting education, employment and economic growth in this district, said he.        
	According to the programme, a horticulture training and research institute will be set up in the district  especially considering the favourable agro-climatic conditions. The district is known for its organic agro-products such as turmeric.         
	Besides horticulture training and research, a nursery will be established to raise seedlings of vegetable, fruit, flower, medicinal plants and plantation materials.         
	The other area of focus in the special programme is vocational and higher education to create employment in the underdeveloped district.         
	A vocational training institute and a BEd college will also be established, official sources said, adding that professional training programmes would be conducted through the State Employment Mission.        
	Low literacy rate, poverty, small and fragmented land-holdings, poor connectivity and a near total absence of railway network and industrial infrastructure are some of the problems that plague Khandhamal. The district does not have a single major industry due to the lack of connectivity and the absence of major minerals.         
	Another disturbing factor is its proximity to Naxalism-hit areas. Maoists recently took shelter in Gosama forest located in Tikabali area of Khandhamal, from where a large cache of arms and ammunition were recovered. The rebels also used the dense forests as a safe escape route.

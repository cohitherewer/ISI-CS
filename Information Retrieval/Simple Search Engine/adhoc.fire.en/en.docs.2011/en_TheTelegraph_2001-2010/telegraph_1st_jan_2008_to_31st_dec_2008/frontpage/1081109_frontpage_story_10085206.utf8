          OUR BUREAU                              
	Nov. 8: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said no country could afford to turn its back on globalisation, eliciting a nuanced response from his party aimed at discounting suggestions of differences of opinion.        
	The financial crisis has reached our country. It is a serious development. But we cant come to the conclusion that globalisation will take a back seat. We cant afford to do it. Its a must, the chief minister told an industry meet.        
	Globalisation is the objective law of the world economy independent of any countrys decision, he said. If some country wants to avert globalisation, its future is sealed, Bhattacharjee warned.        
	In Delhi, the CPM leadership has been arguing that India was spared the brunt of the global financial crisis because the Left parties did not allow the government to liberate the financial sector.        
	Asked about Bhattacharjees comments, CPM chief Prakash Karat said: There is a difference between globalisation and finance-driven imperialist globalisation. The former is an objective process. The latter is unsustainable.         
	In September, Karat had written in party mouthpiece Peoples Democracy: Events over the decade of the 1990s have borne out the fact that financial liberalisation does not contribute positively to investment and economic growth. Countries which enthusiastically opened up their financial sectors in order to attract capital inflows often experienced enhanced volatility in their financial markets and speculative attacks on their currency.        
	When Bhattacharjee spoke, Congress minister Pranab Mukherjee was also on the dais. A Congress government had opened up the Indian economy in 1991 and has been pushing for reforms in its current term too.        
	Bhattacharjee today sought greater co-operation among countries. In the backdrop of this financial crisis, developing countries should come close, he said at a curtain-raiser to the Bimstec Summit 2008 organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.        
	But the CPM did not see a contradiction between the chief ministers support for globalisation and the party line against opening up the economy. The Left had vetoed liberalisation in the banking, insurance and pension sectors.        
	Politburo member Sitaram Yechury said the question was not whether there should be globalisation, but on what terms the integration with the global economy would come.        
	Bimstec is an organisation for technical and economic co-operation and has Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal as its members.

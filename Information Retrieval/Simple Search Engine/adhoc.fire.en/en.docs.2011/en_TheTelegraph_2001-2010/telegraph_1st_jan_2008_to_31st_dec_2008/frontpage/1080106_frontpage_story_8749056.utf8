The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Priest, families evicted from US temple
                                                                                                        Priest, families evicted from US temple
                                The Saraswati Mandiram temple in Epping, from where   the priest and the four families have been evicted                                  
	Washington, Jan. 5 (PTI): A Hindu priest and four families have been evicted from a temple by a Virginia-based lending firm, which claimed they had defaulted on a loan.        
	Hundreds of supporters had signed a petition hoping to stop the eviction of Pandit Ramadheen Ramsamooj, of the Saraswati Mandiram temple in Epping, and over a dozen others after the property was lost through foreclosure.        
	Ramsamooj was working in his office on Thursday and the other families were praying when the sheriffs deputies arrived.        
	This is a very sad day, the priest said as he sat in his van to keep warm shortly after being driven out of the property on the coldest day of the year.        
	The eviction came as no surprise to the temples attorney, Joshua Gordon. However, he said he couldnt understand why the move came on the coldest day of the season when temperatures had dipped below zero.        
	Chris Hilson, the attorney for lending firm G amp;G LLC, said the eviction had been scheduled beforehand and that it was the only day when the law enforcement agencies could be on hand to oversee the process.        
	We did not purposely do this on the coldest day of the year, he added.        
	An animal control officer was called in and arrangements were made to provide food and water to the four cows that remained in a barn on the property.        
	Ramsamooj said the sheriffs deputies told the families they had 10 minutes to grab their shoes and hat and leave. But Hilson said he believed they were given more than 10 minutes.        
	Nearly a dozen members of the temple from four families lived on the property. While they search for a new home, the priest said he was trying to find a new place to worship. Members of other temples in Massachusetts have offered to help.        
	The evicted temple staff have 28 days to remove all their belongings. The shrine occupied several buildings and had large statues and other religious artefacts on the property.        
	The legal fight began when G amp;G LLC took the temple to court in 2006, accusing its members of defaulting on a loan they had taken to improve the facility.        
	G amp;G won a $2.5-million judgment in a Virginia court that year. The temple then went bankrupt and in November 2006, the 100-acre property was sold during a foreclosure.        
	G amp;G Epping LLC, a separate entity created by G amp;G, eventually bought the property, but the temple has accused the firm of mortgage fraud and argues the property was illegally taken, the temples website says.        
	The members of the temple insist they should not have been forced off the property before the state supreme court had heard their case.        
	The temple had launched a series of unsuccessful legal battles in the Rockingham county superior court to get the land back. An appeal has now been filed at the state supreme court.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Will Delhi act on Bokaro Steel SOS?
          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                            Bokaro Steel: Future tense?                                  
	Bokaro, July 8: In the throes of a massive expansion, Bokaro Steel has pressed the panic button and written to the Centre to help it get mining leases for two West Singhbhum iron ore reserves since the state government had so far failed to deliver on its promise.        
	But given the extent of the Centres survival worries over the nuclear deal, it is anybodys guess how soon the ministry will be able to respond to the PSU steel makers SOS.         
	Set in motion by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh no less, the Rs 12,000-crore expansion plans of Bokaro Steel envisages an increase in capacity from the existing 4.5MT to 7.5MT. And a lot hinges on the lease on the iron ore reserves of Kiriburu and Meghataburu.        
	The modernised plant was to handle ore from these mines. But with the leases nowhere in sight, Bokaro Steel fears its new units would stay idle leading to huge losses. The modernisation work has already cost the PSU steel maker over Rs 2,000 crore.         
	Since the beginning of the project, steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan had requested chief minister Madhu Koda to hand over Chiria mines to SAIL. In return, he had said, the steel ministry was ready to set up five steel units in the state that would solve unemployment problems to a large extent.         
	At the time, the Jharkhand government had assured the PSU that the reserves would be handed over by the end of 2007. But with the forest department yet to clear the proposal, Bokaro Steel is hoping the steel ministry would do something before its too late.        
	A senior official of the steel majors PR department said: Even if we get the mining leases today we will need several months to decide several operational issues. If we get the mines a year later, the plan to increase production by 2010-11 will be severely delayed. There will be tremendous losses as a huge amount of money and resources have been invested in anticipation of ore from these mines.         
	Issuing a similar warning a month ago, Bokaro Steel MD V.K. Srivastav had said if the modernised units werent used to capacity, the PSU would have to pay a heavy price and incur huge losses.        
	Officials with the PSU justified their concern. At time of heightened competition  both ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel are moving in to set up plants  it is imperative for Bokaro Steel to got leases for Kiriburu and Meghataburu mines, especially when the lease on Chiria mines  a major source of ore  is not with SAIL anymore.        
	If the wait for Kiriburu and Meghataburu mines is indefinite and Chiria mines proves to be a mirage for SAIL, Bokaro Steel is staring at bad days, said a senior officer of the company.

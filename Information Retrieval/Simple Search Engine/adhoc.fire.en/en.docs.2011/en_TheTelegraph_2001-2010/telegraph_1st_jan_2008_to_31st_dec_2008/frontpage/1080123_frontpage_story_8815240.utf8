     OUR BUREAU
               
	Ranchi, Jan. 22: Jharkhand ministers today showed solidarity with chief minister Madhu Kodas leadership, as the latter advised Congress to refrain from mudslinging because their hasty moves are weakening the UPA.
    
	Albeit tactical in his public remarks, Koda clarified that he would not succumb to pressure tactics of Congress second-liners.
    
	That chiefs of leading parties supporting his government were free to take suitable decisions, he said would continue to function his usual way.
    
	Koda also confirmed that his government did not intend to urge the governor to dissolve the Assembly, even as the Congress kept threatening that a firm decision on the fate of the government will be taken soon after Simaria bypoll.
    
	Koda also advised AICC general secretary Ajay Maken and his associates to show patience. He also refused to buckle under Congress pressure to drop rural development minister Anosh Ekka from the council of ministers. I have neither sought more time from the Congress, nor have they fixed any time limit. The Congress leaders should not be doing anything that weakens the UPA unity in the state, he said.
    
	He, however, added that the Congress move had undoubtedly made my work more difficult. He also claimed that his report to the UPA central leadership on his governments performance were perfect and that he was ready to face inquiry.
    
	Meanwhile, it was after a long gap that ministers arrived for the cabinet meeting on time, except for the absence of Ekka and Dulal Bhuiyan. Five ministers arrived ahead of schedule, three others were available in their chambers and were seen coming out together to display unity.
    
	Let the Congress do what it feels like. We are firmly behind chief minister. The cabinet has faith in Kodas leadership, said health minister Bhanu Pratap Sahi.
    
	JMM chief Shibu Soren, on the other hand, today decided to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi in couple of days to apprise her of the states real picture. He said Makens stand on the Koda government was not in the interest of the state. RJD leader Lalu Prasad, too, is not in favour of toppling the government, he added.
    
	The Congress refused to react to Kodas outbursts that the party should stop humiliating him.
    
	Congress state president Pradeep Balmuchu said the partys stand was not directed against any individual. We are assessing the governments performance on the issues of bijli (power), sadak (road) and pani (water), he said.

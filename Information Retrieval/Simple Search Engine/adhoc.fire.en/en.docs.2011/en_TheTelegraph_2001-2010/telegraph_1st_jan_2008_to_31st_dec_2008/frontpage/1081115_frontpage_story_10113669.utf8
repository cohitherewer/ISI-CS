The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | India opens talks lines with Team Obama
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   India opens talks lines with Team Obama
          K.P. NAYAR                                         Albright, Ahluwalia: Credit crisis on table                                  
	Washington, Nov. 14: India yesterday opened discussions on the current global financial crisis with representatives of US President-elect Barack Obama, taking a medium-to-long-term point of view of the issues before a summit beginning here tonight.         
	Even as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was en route to Washington, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Indias ambassador to the US Ronen Sen met former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright and Democratic Congressman Jim Leach.        
	The meeting preceded a scheduled assembly of heads of state and government in the East Room of the White House this evening for a reception hosted by President George W. Bush.        
	Albright and Leach have been designated by Obama to meet Indian and other delegations attending the Washington summit to convey the President-elects views on the global financial crisis and be briefed by countries attending the summit.         
	Obama is himself staying away from Washington to avoid upstaging the lame-duck Bush who will give up office in just over two months.        
	Yesterdays meeting provided an opportunity to comprehensively put behind a controversy over the delay in Obamas phone call to Singh after the US elections.         
	Albright conveyed to the Indian officials that the President-elect attached high priority to the further strengthening of relations between India and the US, according to a media release from the Indian embassy here.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram, who is accompanying Singh to Washington, explained that Indias two-track approach in dealing simultaneously with Bush and Obamas representatives was because of New Delhis assessment that the resolution of this crisis will take us to a point of time well beyond January 20, 2009 when the US will have its new President.        
	We are going to take a medium-to-long-term point of view. And I believe the US will also take that view. After all, President Bush and President-elect Obama are reported to have talked about these issues at great length only two days ago. So I think the Obama input will be there in whatever Mr Bush presents. That is the stance that India will adopt, Chidambaram said.         
	Indeed, Chidambaram took the view that the crisis will outlast the term of the current Indian government. It will take us to a point of time well beyond May 22, 2009. So we will have to take a view that takes us well beyond these election deadlines.        
	Briefing Indian correspondents, Chidambaram underplayed the trans-Atlantic divide on how to deal with the current crisis and the curiosity on both sides about which side of the Atlantic India favours.        
	I dont think this is a question of taking sides, the finance minister said. In Sao Paulo, the French, the Americans and the British were all there and we did agree upon a communique. If an agreement could be reached in Sao Paulo, why doubt that an agreement can be reached at Washington?        
	His reference was to a Sao Paulo meeting of G20 finance ministers last week, at which Chidambaram represented India. Chidambaram said India would press for a new order of global oversight on financial matters at the summit here.         
	And this can come only by greater inclusivity in the international financial system. In many ways, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is unable to be an early warning system. The Group of 7 is too narrow and too small. A more inclusive system, we believe, can provide better global oversight and serve as an early warning mechanism.        
	He said a second point that the Prime Minister would make to other heads of state and government is that there are only a handful of economies that are driving world economic growth. Among them are China, India. So it is very important that the few countries that are able to drive economic growth should not suffer. Resources must be made available to these countries, including India, so that they can continue to grow and drive world economic growth.        
	The third keynote in Singhs discussions here will be that the crisis should not be an excuse to go into a protectionist cocoon. That would be the worst way to resolve the crisis.

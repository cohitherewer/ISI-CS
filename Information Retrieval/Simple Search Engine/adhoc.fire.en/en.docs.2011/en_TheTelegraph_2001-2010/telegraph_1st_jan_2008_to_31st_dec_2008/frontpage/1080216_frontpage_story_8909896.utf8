  - More security for national projects         A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, Feb. 15: A central delegation fronted by the countrys topmost bureaucrat today dissected Assams law and order failings with the focus on North Cachar Hills district, where militants have jeopardised even national projects like the East-West corridor and conversion of rail tracks to broad gauge.         
	Participants in the meeting were tight-lipped about whether reports of a hijack plan by Ulfa figured in the review. Sources confirmed that the topic was raised.        
	The meeting could have a bearing on the course of the peace process with Ulfa, grounded when the outfit targeted Hindi-speaking people at the beginning of last year. Cabinet secretary K.N. Chandrasekhar is likely to forward a note to the Prime Minister on the feasibility of resuming the process.        
	The top brass of the army, police and paramilitary forces and almost the entire pantheon of senior bureaucrats at the state level attended the meeting.         
	Chandrasekhar said Delhi was most worried over national projects in North Cachar Hills district being disrupted by militants. Northeast Frontier Railways gauge-conversion project and work on the East-West corridor, being implemented by the Union surface transport ministry, have repeatedly been affected by extortion and intimidation of officials and workers.        
	He asked the government to do whatever it takes to ensure that militants do not hold these projects to ransom.        
	The general-officer-commanding of the armys Tezpur-headquartered 4 Corps, Lt Gen. B.S. Jaswal, confirmed to the media later that the meeting focused on security at the sites of national projects and counter-insurgency operations. We worked out a strategy to deal with the situation, which I obviously do not want to discuss with the media. We discussed security for the railway and highway projects in North Cachar Hiils and general law and order in Assam.         
	The GOC said there was no discussion on shifting North Cachar Hills from the purview of the 3 Corps, based at Rangapahar in Nagaland, to the 4 Corps.         
	Speculation about the 3 Corps being relieved of that responsibility has been rife ever since chief minister Tarun Gogoi mooted the idea, citing operational convenience.        
	The GOC said he personally believed that the security requirements of the district were such that it was better to keep it under the 3 Corps.         
	The home department presented a detailed report on law and order to the central team, especially the crackdown on Ulfa and its sympathisers after an arrested rebel revealed that the outfit had planned to hijack an aircraft.         
	The inspector-general of police in charge of the Special Branch, Khagen Sarma, said after the meeting that 16 Ulfa members were involved in the hijacking plan.         
	The police have gathered information about the militants and are on their trail, he added.

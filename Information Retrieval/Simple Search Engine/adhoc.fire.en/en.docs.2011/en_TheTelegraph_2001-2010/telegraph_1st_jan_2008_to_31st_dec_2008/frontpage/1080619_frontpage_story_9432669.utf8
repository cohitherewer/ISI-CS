          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            More the merrier                                  
	Hyderabad, June 18: Andhra is guzzling by the crate and, for a government in search of money, more the drops the merrier it is.        
	Residents of the state consumed 72,602 litres of Indian-made Foreign Liquor and 5,35,520 litres of beer every day in the 2007-08 excise year.         
	The sale of beer has risen 28 per cent while that of IMFL has recorded an average increase of 15 per cent during the last four years.        
	According to an assessment of the excise and prohibition department, the daily sale of liquor and beer in the state could touch Rs 30 crore by the end of 2008.        
	Changing lifestyles, neo-rich families flush with dollars and increasing number of outlets available for sale and consumption of liquor are said to be the factors that have ratcheted up sales.        
	The Congress government in the state has set a revenue target of Rs 12,000 crore from liquor sale during the current year to fund populist schemes like Jalayagnam, a massive irrigation project, and Indiramma, a rural housing scheme.         
	The tenders for the state-wide auctioning of liquor outlets on Monday earned the exchequer a licence fee revenue of Rs 3,000 crore.        
	More than 92 outlets, including those in the IT corridor of Hyderabad and others along key national highways, yielded a revenue of over Rs 2 to 3 crore each. The licence fee from these outlets has gone up 50 to 200 per cent this year.        
	The highest bid price of Rs 2.07 crore was quoted for the outlet in Madhapur in the cyber corridor of the capital. The second highest was in the port city of Visakhapatnam near the harbour area at Rs 2.05 crore. Two other liquor outlets on the highway to Mumbai went for Rs 2.02 crore and Rs 2.01 crore.        
	The government has also hiked bar licence fees by 15 per cent. It aims to collect Rs 23.81 lakh per licence in cities with a population of above 7 lakh and the lowest of Rs 9.92 lakh for bars in areas with a population of 10,000 and less.        
	Retailing liquor has become a cottage industry in Andhra. Tens of thousands of outlets have sprouted while homes, auto-rickshaws and even parks have become venues of sale of liquor to augment revenues.        
	Excise officials confess that faced with a huge target to raise funds for the massive infrastructure programmes of the government, they had no alternative but to generate maximum revenue from liquor sales, particularly in summer. Liquor is sold at a premium of 30 per cent in villages and tourist resorts to cater to the demands of visitors and the rural neo-rich.        
	Excise commissioner Hiralal Samariya said there was no special drive to raise revenue from liquor sales. We are only catering to the growing demand in the state, which is now hosting a huge labour force for infrastructure projects, he said.         
	No wonder the government is keeping its eyes closed and ears shut about bars and belt shops (chain permit rooms) across the state. Every panchayat of 10 villages with a population of over 10,000 will get 10 liquor shop permits and licences for two bars and be rewarded with cash incentives if they meet targets, said a senior official in the commissionerate of excise and prohibition.         
	The Andhra Pradesh government also plans to promote production of 250 lakh bulk litres of beer during the year for meeting the heavy demand of the summer months to add to the existing capacity of 1,965 lakh litres.         
	In major towns and cities, drinking in parks and on roads is not questioned, much to the chagrin of womens groups and political parties like the Telugu Desam and Loksatta.         
	Loksatta convener Jayaprakash Narayan said: If this is the condition with the ban on country liquor, just imagine how liquor will pour in if the government withdrew the prohibition on arrack.

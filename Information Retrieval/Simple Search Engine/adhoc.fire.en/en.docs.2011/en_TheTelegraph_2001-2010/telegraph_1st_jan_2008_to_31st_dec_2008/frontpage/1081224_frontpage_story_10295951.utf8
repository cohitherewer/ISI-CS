	Dec. 23: Pakistan today washed its hands of Mohammed Ajmal Kasab and spoke of a response within minutes if attacked, prompting Delhi to ask Islamabad not to use war hysteria as an excuse for inaction.        
	If Pakistan sang an old tune on Kasab, citing the outcome of a fresh investigation, a strident note was attributed to army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the general India suspects of having tightened his grip over the civilian government in Pakistan.        
	Pakistans armed forces will mount an equal response within minutes if India carries out any surgical strike, Kayani was quoted as telling President Asif Ali Zardari by the pro-establishment The News daily.        
	Suspecting that Pakistan was seeking to deflect attention by playing on fears of an armed conflict, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in Delhi: The issue is not war. Nobody wants war. The issue is about Pakistan territory being used to aid and abet terrorism.        
	Asked about Indias options in the face of repeated denials by Islamabad of any complicity in the Mumbai attacks, the Prime Minister said: We want Pakistan to take objective efforts to dismantle the terror infrastructure. The government of Pakistan knows what it implies.        
	In the morning, the Prime Minister told a conclave of envoys that the situation was worrisome and asked them to present Indias case before the world.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, too, underscored the point that the real issue was not creating war hysteria. The issue is not creating war hysteria or raising accusing finger against others, Mukherjee told reporters.        
	Its a diversionary strategy. The issue definitely is not Pakistan or India. It is not about raising fingers at others. The pertinent issue is terrorism, of terrorism operating from land within Pakistan, of a terrorist attack in Mumbai. Why are they taking this diversionary approach when they should address the real issue that is terrorism?        
	Pakistans stubborn stand on Kasab  whose name apparently could not be found on the countrys famed identity database  was unwittingly aided by a declaration by Interpol that India had not yet shared information other than that available in the media.        
	We have checked the records of the National Registration and Database Authority and did not find any clue establishing Ajmal Kasabs identity as a Pakistani national, interior ministry chief Rehman Malik said at a news conference with Interpol secretary general Ronald K. Noble.        
	Malik claimed the database authority, Nadra, had never issued a national identity card (NIC) in the name of Kasab, the arrested terrorist that India claims is from Pakistan.        
	The Nadra, which according to Pakistan is an independent corporate body under the interior ministry, was set up in 2000 to create the Islamic worlds first centralised demographic database. The New York Times reported that the database was still incomplete.        
	An Indian expert said that with the Pakistan government holding the computer keys, it could manipulate its own database very easily. Its like holding the keys to your house, using it to steal something from it, and then telling the rest of the world its been stolen to claim insurance money, Subrata Sen, an independent software anti-hacking expert, said in New Delhi.        
	But sources in the Nadra said an entry could be deleted only on death of a person after following due processes. No one has administrative rights to otherwise delete an entry, an official said.              
	Deadline        
	A leading private geopolitical intelligence agency says that an Indian military strike on Pakistan is imminent a month after the Mumbai attacks. Stratfor said India had relayed through the US to Pakistan that it must take action on terrorist outfits by December 26.         
	The US came down hard on Pakistan behind the scenes, making clear that if Islamabad did not deliver, Washington would not be able to stand in New Delhis way... Stratfor said.        
	PTI quoted the state department as saying the US was pressing Pakistan every single day to track down and get off the street those responsible for the Mumbai attacks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dhonis boys let hair down
                                                                                                           Dhonis boys let hair down
                                Mahendra Singh Dhoni                            
	Melbourne: The victorious Indian squad spent a busy last day Down Under before boarding the home-bound flight with the captain and his men in a state of delirium.        
	The mood was one of anticipation and bracing up for the possible hysterical reception that awaits them.        
	It was a very busy day. The boys returned from the ground late and the celebrations continued in the hotel bar till early morning on Wednesday, said a visibly elated manager Dr Bimal Soni a couple of hours before the team was to board the Mumbai-bound flight.        
	Dr Soni and the rest of the team were preparing themselves for the hectic schedule in India.        
	The day after the historic tri-series triumph was an extremely hectic one for the champions, by all accounts. By the look of it, captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis wish for a quiet few days with his family would remain just that  a wish.        
	A swooning nation, though, is unlikely to provide the cricket stars with some private moments as more and more gushing experts join in to praise the teams achievements.        
	Although busy celebrating, a few other members of the team also spoke about the nerve-wracking final that went right down to the wire.        
	Irfan Pathan talked at length about the final over which he was asked to deliver.        
	Mahi (Mahendra Singh Dhoni), after the first two balls, told me not to worry: You are not as bad a bowler that you would be hit for three fours in as many balls, he said.        
	That gave me the confidence. I had gone for cheap runs in the game but it wasnt for bad bowling.         
	Some were overthrows, some streaky boundaries and all that, but my rhythm was good and I was able to swing the deliveries, the Indian left-arm pacer added.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, June 10: The boiler pipe leak in a turbine at Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Ltd (TVNL) that led to blackout since yesterday could only be repaired tomorrow morning.        
	TVNL chairman Aditya Swaroop said the turbine would be put into service later tonight or early tomorrow morning. Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) officials said the TVNL unit could be synchronised with the state grid only after repairing the leak.        
	The net power shortfall today was 400MW that left the board with no option but to enforce strict blackouts across the state for the second consecutive day.         
	Figures released by the board revealed that the lone generation came from Patratu where three units managed to generate only 117MW. Though Patratu has an installed capacity of 840MW with 10 units, only three of those are currently operational.        
	To meet the deficit, JSEB was drawing heavily from the eastern grid, particularly during the peak evening hours when demand rises to over 800MW.         
	We expect the unit to be alright after midnight, TVNL chief engineer P.N. Singh said.        
	JSEB officials added that they expected to run two units of the Sikidiri hydel power plant near Ranchi for at least two hours later tonight from where 100MW was likely to be available.        
	JSEB chairman Brij Mohan Verma said that the boards power generation came down to an all-time low since last afternoon.         
	A fire mishap at Patratu Thermal Power Station yesterday afternoon deteriorated the situation.        
	The most affected places were Gumla, Lohardaga, Simdega, Khunti, Chatra, Garhwa and even the outskirts of Ranchi where there was virtually no power for 18 hours at a stretch.         
	Meanwhile, another turbine, lying defunct for the past couple of years, woukd be recommissioned in TVNL in 72 hours, said Swaroop. He added that once the defunct turbine was put into operation, the power situation in the state would change.         
	With both the turbines properly put to place, TVNLs total generation capacity will be about 400MW, said Swaroop.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Congress loser in Shillong see-saw

	Shillong, March 19: Meghalaya has had an election, a hung House, a Congress-led government and a chief minister who quit moments before a scheduled floor test to make way for another coalition  all in just over a fortnight.        
	D.D. Lapang of the Congress today conceded defeat well before the game of numbers was to begin in the Assembly. His second consecutive stint as chief minister lasted a mere nine days.        
	Lapangs exit paved the way for the ascent of a former economics teacher, Donkupar Roy, who was deputy chief minister for a while in the previous Congress-led government. He has since shifted to Nationalist Congress Party leader P.A. Sangmas side.        
	Roy, 53, will head a coalition government in which the NCP will be the main player along with his United Democratic Party. The rest of the 31-member Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA) comprises the BJP, two Independents and the same regional parties that were with the Congress until the poll.        
	That Lapang would have to relinquish chief ministership, either voluntarily or after losing the floor test, had become clear when the Congress could muster no more than the support of three Independents to increase its tally to 28 legislators in the House of 60.        
	Sangmas alliance, on the other hand, retained its 31 members through a weeklong wooing game.        
	It took a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party in the morning to force Lapangs hand. Around 9am, he emerged from the meeting in the conference room of Sherwood, his official residence, to announce he would leave for Raj Bhavan shortly to resign.        
	However, he called the MPA a bundle of contradictions and said the Congress alone could ensure stability. Sooner or later, the MPA partners will come to us. We do not have to topple anyone.         
	Roy said his priorities were to ensure transparency in governance, prepare a documented common minimum programme reflecting the aspirations of all the coalition partners within two weeks and initiate a legal review of the controversial power deals signed by the erstwhile government.        
	Sangma, flanked by his wife and MLA sons James and Conrad, tried to stay in the background. Conrad was one of the six cabinet ministers sworn in along with Roy.         
	Another member of the ruling coalition, UDP legislator Bindo Lanong, is likely to be elected Speaker tomorrow.        
	The swearing-in at Raj Bhavan drew so large a crowd of family members, friends and supporters of the new ministers that security personnel were forced to remove the metal detector at the entrance to let everyone in.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta Sept. 26: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has written to Ratan Tata requesting him to wait for the Singur political storm to subside.        
	The letter represents a reasoned appeal from the chief minister to Tata, a source said. We are expecting either a face-to-face or some kind of communication between the two to take place, once Mr Tata returns from abroad, the source said, declining to speculate on the likely date.        
	The chief secretary said a meeting had been scheduled between the state government and the Tatas on Sunday.        
	But sources said tonight the government had not yet received confirmation from the Tatas on the date. If Sunday is too early, a meeting can take place in the middle of next week, they said.

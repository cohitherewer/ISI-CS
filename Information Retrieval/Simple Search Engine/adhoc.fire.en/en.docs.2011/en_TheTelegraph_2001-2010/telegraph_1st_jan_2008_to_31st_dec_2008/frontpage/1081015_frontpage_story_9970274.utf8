  - SP leader urges Bengal unit to sue industrialist for tag on Mamata        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Mamata Banerjee comes out of Rashtrapati Bhavan with Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Prada on Tuesday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 14: Amar Singh wants Ratan Tata taken to court for suggesting Mamata Banerjee is a bad M.        
	At a joint news conference with Mamata after meeting the Prime Minister and the President, the Samajwadi Party leader said: That Modi who burnt Gujarat is a good M and Mamata who lives in a hut and fights for the poor is a bad M.        
	Amar requested his partys Bengal unit chief, Vijay Upadhyay, to sue Tata. So what if she (Mamata) is not an SP leader, I request you to file a defamation case against Ratan Tata... if you win, you win against Ratan Tata. If you lose, you lose against Ratan Tata, he said.        
	After announcing that the Nano, driven out of Singur by Mamata, had found a new home in Narendra Modis Gujarat, Tata had said: I hope there is a bad M and a good M. We need that transition. He, however, did not name the Trinamul Congress leader.        
	Mamata was grateful for Amars support.         
	Accusing Tata of being abusive and vowing to fight him politically and legally, she said: Sometimes he says Despite Mamata, sometimes bad M, sometimes about financing.        
	In response to a question on the day he announced the pullout from Singur, Tata had said he wondered where some of the funds for Mamatas agitation against the Nano project came from.        
	Much earlier, at the launch of the Nano, the chairman of the Tata Group had joked that Despite Mamata was one of the names they had considered for the small car.         
	Mamata today said Nanos exit from Bengal would only hurt the CPMs party funds, not the state. At the same time, she shrugged off blame for the pullout, saying the government and the Tatas were responsible for it.        
	The Trinamul leader said she had told Tata Motors head Ravi Kant the car plant could have 700 acres and the vendors could move to another site close by.         
	Asked about the majority of farmers who wanted the Tatas to operate from Singur  around 11,000 farmers had willingly given their land, against the 2,000 who had not  Mamata said she was fighting only for the unwilling farmers.         
	She demanded the return of 400 acres and said she had asked the Prime Minister to intervene.

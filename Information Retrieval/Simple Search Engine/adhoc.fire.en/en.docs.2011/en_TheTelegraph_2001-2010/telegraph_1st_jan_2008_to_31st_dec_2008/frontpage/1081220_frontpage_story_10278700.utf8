          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 19: HDFC, the countrys largest housing finance company, today slashed its retail prime lending rate by half a percentage point, which will reduce the repayment burden on its existing floating rate borrowers.        
	Existing customers equated monthly instalments (EMIs) will go down by Rs 34 per month per lakh on a 20-year loan. The reduction is expected to benefit nearly 9 lakh HDFC customers who had opted for adjustable rate home loans.        
	The retail prime lending rate  or the benchmark rate  now stands revised at 14.5 per cent. The advantage of the cut will accrue to all existing floating rate customers over the next three months. The company follows a three-month reset cycle for its floating rate loans.        
	HDFC announced that it would reduce its deposit rates by 50 basis points across all maturities effective December 23.        
	The private sector firm is the first entity to pass on the benefit of a rate reduction to its borrowers after the Centre unveiled its recent economic stimulus package.        
	Several nationalised banks had cut interest rates on home loans by about 75 basis points  or three quarters of a percentage point  but the benefit was granted only to new borrowers.        
	ICICI Bank, the second largest financier of home loans, is also planning to trim the rates for its existing borrowers. Chanda Kochhar, the ICICI Bank joint managing director who will succeed K.V. Kamath as the chief executive officer next May, said there were clear signals of a decline in interest rates.         
	Announcing the rate cut, HDFC said it had introduced a new slab for loans up to Rs 20 lakh where new customers would have to pay an interest of 10.25 per cent. For loans above Rs 20 lakh, the rate has been revised to 11.25 per cent.        
	As in the past, HDFC has ensured that reduction in the cost of its resources translates into a benefit in terms of lower costs for both existing and new customers, said Renu Sud Karnad, the joint managing director of HDFC.

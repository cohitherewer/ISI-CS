The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Balance home and work, the B-school way
                                                                                                           Balance home and work, the B-school way
  - IIM plans classes for women                                Multitasking                                  
	Manage a family and bring up children, without ever compromising on career aspirations  thats the advice for women, not from feminist organisations, but from Indias top management schools.         
	The Indian Institutes of Management are planning to counsel girl students on specific challenges they are likely to face because of their gender in the male-dominated world of corporate executives.         
	Lady staff and women faculty members at the IIMs will also receive lessons on balancing life and work better, under the initiative conceived by the human resource development ministry.         
	Less than 15 per cent of IIM students are girls, according to estimates by top officials at the institutes. Independent studies by the Indian Institute of Applied Economic Research, the University Grants Commission and the Confederation of Indian Industry have shown that women continue to hold far fewer top jobs than men.         
	Studies at the IIMs have also shown that girls find it harder to balance family commitments with work once they give birth to children.         
	IIM Calcutta is holding its first session for women staff, faculty and students tomorrow, officials said.         
	IIMs in Ahmedabad and Bangalore are planning to start their special classes after the new academic session (2008-09) kicks off, sources said.         
	On the Joka campus in Calcutta, designated faculty members will speak on how the lessons they learn at home can often be used at work as well.         
	Team building and team leadership are key concepts we teach in management. But women in India learn these concepts at home, when they make decisions for their families. Women can take positive lessons from home to work... and vice-versa, IIM Calcutta professor Leena Chatterjee, who will address the session, told The Telegraph. She specialises in behavioural sciences.         
	Two years ago, the Centre first started budgeting for women. Each government body or institute has to keep aside a share of its funds for women. The finances for the programme will be drawn from these funds, sources said.         
	The government wanted us to organise programmes to recognise the presence of girls and women on campus, Chatterjee said over phone.         
	Girl students do have to face gender-based choices  in career and in life We hope to help them realise that they can find objective solutions to satisfy themselves at work and at home, she added.         
	A senior administrator at IIM Ahmedabad said girls would be urged to challenge the notion that top managers need to be one way, and thats the male way.

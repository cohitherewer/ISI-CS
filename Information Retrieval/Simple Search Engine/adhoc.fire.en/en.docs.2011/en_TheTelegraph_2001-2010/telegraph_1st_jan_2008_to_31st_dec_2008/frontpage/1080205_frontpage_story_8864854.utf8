	New Delhi, Feb. 4: Someones laughing all the way to the bank while Citu is crying foul. 
 
	A cyber fraud has left the CPMs trade union front poorer by Rs 24,000, and enraged Citu seniors now want the government to find the culprits and bring them to book.
 
	They have written to external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee and the Indian high commission in London, seeking urgent redress. 
 
	What made Citu register with an unknown organisation hosting a conference on global warming and climate change remains a moot question, though. 
 
	A while ago, Citu received an email invitation from an entity that called itself the International Development Organisation (IDO). It said the IDO was hosting the International Conference on Global Warming and Climate Change (GWCC 2008) in London from February 22-25, 2008.
 
	The venue: Hyde Park Hotel, 15 Sussex Place, Hyde Park, London W2 2SX, the United Kingdom.
 
	The contact person: Ms Stella Gray.
 
	The participation terms: register (at registrationidorg.org), wire a sum of pound;300 for board and lodge and the hosts would be pleased to send you a round ticket.
 
	The IDO has set up an access fund to support the travel costs and all-round air fare cost for participants who are unable to raise sufficient funds on their own. All participants, however, will be expected to fundraise for their hotel bills in the UK, which will not be waived, the mail said. 
 
	Citu responded with alacrity. Central working committee member P.K. Ganguly was nominated to participate and an amount of Rs 24,000 wired from the trade unions Canara Bank account on Delhis Bhagwan Dass Road.
 
	Someone smelt a rat when realisation dawned that the hosts were not sending a round ticket, only offering to reimburse the fare once the participants reached London. 
 
	First they said they would send the tickets to us. But a mail last week said they would reimburse the fare, Ganguly said. 
 
	We investigated and found that the whole thing was a fraud. 
 
	The trade unions boss, M.K. Pandhe, has now sent out a catch-them plea to the government, but it may be too late; the cash has already bolted from Citus coffers.

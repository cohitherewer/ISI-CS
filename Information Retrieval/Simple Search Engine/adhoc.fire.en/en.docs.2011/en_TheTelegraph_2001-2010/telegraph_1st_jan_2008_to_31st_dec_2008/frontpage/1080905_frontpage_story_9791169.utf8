        OUR BUREAU                             Ratan Tata at an auto-makers convention in Delhi on Thursday. The Tata Group chairman said it was up to others to decide if the Nano would roll out of Singur.   About the impasse, The New York Times quoted him as saying: This is something between two political opponents, and were caught in the middle. Tata said the Nano would try and meet the October deadline. Well do everything possible to come as close to the planned launch as we possibly can.

	Calcutta, Sept. 4: The chips are down.        
	The government has conveyed to the governor its inability to return land from the Tata project.        
	The Tatas have declined the governors invitation to take part in talks beginning on Friday.         
	Mamata Banerjee has turned down the governors request to lift the siege.        
	The night before the birth of the Singur dialogue in Raj Bhavans Council Chamber looked stormy as all sides braced for what looks like bare-knuckle bargaining.        
	At one point, sources said, the government made the suspension of the siege a condition for participating in the talks. But the claim could not be confirmed independently.        
	The clouds began gathering from the morning itself when governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi told industries minister Nirupam Sen the Tatas should be requested not to make any statement, they should be asked to downsize the project and they should be more supportive of Mamatas concerns.        
	The second and third requests  downsize and more supportive response  were seen as signals that part of the Singur project land should be handed back to unwilling landlosers.        
	Sen reportedly pleaded helplessness in returning the land, saying such a step would precipitate a Tata exit.         
	The governor later wrote to the chief minister, requesting him to reconsider the governments stand. In response, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee drove down to Raj Bhavan and explained to Gandhi the governments inability to return the land. The entire project will have to be scrapped then, a source quoted the chief minister as saying.        
	Bhattacharjee told the governor that a rehabilitation and compensation package could be discussed in detail with the Trinamul delegation. Rehabilitation will involve alternative land but not necessarily transfer of plots. Probably, land will be commercially developed for use by farmers.        
	Trinamul has reacted with indignation to the rejection of its demand to return land but it remains to be seen what its stand will be at the discussion table tomorrow or in the following days. It now depends on the Trinamul Congress. Chances of a breakthrough appear slim if the party is banking on the government and the Tatas to make further concessions, an official said.        
	However, in public, optimism was the buzzword on the eve of the talks. He (the governor) is looking forward to a meaningful dialogue tomorrow, Raj Bhavan said. We hope a solution will emerge at tomorrows meeting, Sen said, echoing Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee who felt that a solution is possible.        
	During the day, Ratan Tata is believed to have informed the governor that he would not like to be dragged into the political process. However, Tata promised to provide any information the governor needed.        
	After Sens meeting with the governor, an impression has gained ground in the government and among the Tatas that the Raj Bhavan initiative was tilted towards Trinamul and a solution had been decided upon before the formal launch of the talks.        
	During his preparatory meeting with the Trinamul delegation, Gandhi reportedly stressed on the need to lift the 12-day blockade and ensure smooth movement of traffic along Durgapur Expressway.        
	The Trinamul leaders informed Gandhi that party volunteers had taken it upon themselves to ensure the normal flow of traffic but expressed inability to lift the siege as it is a necessity. This morning, trucks were allowed to ply from 6 to 9.        
	According to sources, a solution may not come about at the end of the meeting tomorrow itself. But the deliberations are expected to continue as some players are still hopeful of a quick solution.        
	Sources said the government had initially informed Gandhi that it could offer only a small quantum of land within the complex.         
	However, industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said: If the proposal for alternative land comes up at tomorrows meeting, it can be discussed but I am not aware of any suggestion that land be given in lieu of that taken. There are about 47 acres of government land in the Tata project area that had been earmarked for rehabilitation purposes and some 15 acres for the West Bengal State Electricity Board. Barring that, I dont think theres government land around the project area.        
	WBIDC managing director Subrata Gupta said a market complex and training facility centre had initially been thought of on these 47 acres.         
	However, what will happen now cannot be said. Moreover, the 47 acres have now come down to some 38 acres because of irrigation work, he added.        
	Asked whether land opposite the Tata factory could be taken over, the industries secretary said: What do you do if owners of private land refuse? However, I dont know whether this possibility would be explored in the near future.        
	A petition was filed in the Supreme Court against the talks, saying the land issue was pending in the court, but legal experts said it should have no bearing on the talks.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 4: The State Commission for Women, which has taken up the sexual harassment charge by an assistant lady marshal of the Assembly against former Speaker Maheswar Mohanty suo motu, interrogated the accused today.        
	The commissions chairperson, Namita Panda, today went to Mohantys official residence and interrogated him (in picture) for an hour. Panda, however, declined to divulge the details of interrogation only saying she would come once again for further interrogation, if necessary.        
	Asked whether she would probe into the conspiracy angle, as alleged by Mohanty, Panda said if the accused persons were named, she would definitely interrogate them.         
	Responding to a query as to whether she would interrogate former minister Debasis Nayak, who was allegedly involved in the controversy, Panda said she would quiz Nayak, if necessary. Mohanty, accused of sexual harassment, alleged that a conspiracy had been hatched against him in which several influential persons were involved. It was also alleged by Mohantys supporters that Nayak had instigated the lady marshal to level the sexual harassment charge against the former Speaker.        
	Panda parried questions as to whether Mohanty had accused Nayak of being involved in the conspiracy and what the victim had told about Nayak during interrogation. Please wait for the final report. We have just taken up the matter for investigation suo motu even as the victim has not lodged any formal complaint before us, she said.        
	A team led by Panda earlier visited Kuhunda village, the native place of the alleged victim, yesterday and recorded her statement after the commission took up the case.        
	Though the commission officials were tight-lipped about the content of the victims statement, sources said the complainant had alleged that Mohanty used to hold her hands and tried to touch her while she was on duty.

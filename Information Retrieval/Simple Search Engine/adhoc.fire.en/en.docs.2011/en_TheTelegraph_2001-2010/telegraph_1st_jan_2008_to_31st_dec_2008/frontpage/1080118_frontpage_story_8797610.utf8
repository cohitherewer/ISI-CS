     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
              Mitchel C Welles
                 
	Bangalore, Jan. 17: A computer professional has been swindled out of Rs 1.75 lakh by cyber frauds who emailed him that he had won a 1-million lottery and a BMW car.
    
	The lone person held so far is Mitchel C. Welles, 35, who was arrested at a Noida ATM but claimed to be from Calcutta. She said she played a minor role in the duping of Muthu Kumar, 24, having only opened a bank account and transferred money according to instructions.
    
	Arrested on January 9 and brought to Bangalore, Welles was granted bail today.
    
	She says she is from Calcutta but has not given us an address, a senior officer said. The bank account has seen transactions of Rs 40 lakh in the last six months. Some money has been transferred online to the UK.
    
	Kumar, 24, who runs a computer sales and service facility in Bangalore, had three times been asked to cough up cash for the despatch of the BMW and lottery prize to him. He did so happily the first two times.
    
	The line is typical of Nigerian frauds who bait Net users with bogus claims that they have inherited property or won lotteries. Once the victim is hooked, the racketeers squeeze money out of him.
    
	Kumar had opened a link, sent in the name of BMW Automobiles, to his email account out of curiosity last July. Days later, he received a mail from Welles telling him about the alleged windfall and asking him to pay Rs 47,843 to a Citibank account in Noida as despatch charges.
    
	The young man paid up in August. A fortnight later, a second demand was made for Rs 1.29 lakh as shipping charges for the car. Kumar swallowed it again.
    
	He got suspicious in mid-September when another demand for Rs 3 lakh arrived with a reference to a minor problem with the UKs anti-terrorist department that was apparently refusing to clear his money and car.
    
	Kumar approached the cyber police but was told there was a jurisdiction problem since the email had originated from the UK and he had sent money to a Noida account. Kumar then filed a complaint of cheating against Welles at a Bangalore police station.
    
	The police traced the account but the Noida address Welles had given Citibank turned out to be false. The officers zeroed in on two ATMs she frequented and laid a trap.

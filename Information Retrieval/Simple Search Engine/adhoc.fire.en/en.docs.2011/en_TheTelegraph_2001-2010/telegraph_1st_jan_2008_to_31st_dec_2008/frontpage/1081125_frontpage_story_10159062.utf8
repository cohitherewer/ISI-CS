          RAJ KUMAR                              
	Ranchi, Nov. 24: A judge has directed the vigilance bureau to lodge FIRs against two members of the cabinet  rural development minister Anosh Ekka and urban development minister Harinarayan Rai  who are facing corruption charges.        
	The order of the special vigilance judge, A.K. Singh, comes two days before Jharkhand High Court is scheduled to take up a PIL seeking a CBI probe into corruption charges against six ministers, including Ekka and Rai. The government has already appointed Supreme Court lawyer Rajiv Dhawan to defend ministers, who include Kamlesh Singh, Dulal Bhuiyan, Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Bandhu Tirkey and former science and technology minister Chandra Prakash Chaudhary, besides Rai and Ekka.         
	The vigilance judges directive to lodge FIRs against Ekka and Rai under various sections of IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act, was based on a complaint lodged on October 25 by a resident of Jasidih (Deoghar), Kumar Vinod, alleging the two ministers had amassed huge properties, though their pay was barely Rs 40,000 per month.         
	The sections under which the vigilance directive has been issued included 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant), 420 (cheating), 423 (dishonest or fraudulent execution of deed of transfer of containing false statement of consideration), 424 (dishonest or fraudulent removal or concealment of property), 464 (making a false document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and section 13(2) (collecting disproportionate asset) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.        
	But legal experts are surprised at the timing of Vinods plea when a similar case was being heard in the High Court. The two ministers now can oppose the demand for a CBI probe on the grounds that an FIR had already been lodged by the state vigilance, pointed out a senior lawyer requesting anonymity.        
	Yet, he recalled, Patna High Court had ordered a CBI probe into the fodder scam even after the government lodged FIRs against dozens of animal husbandry officials

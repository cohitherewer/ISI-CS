	Jan. 30: Death came on wheels and claimed 24 lives in a rash of horrific road accidents on a bleak and bitterly cold day in Assam and Meghalaya.
    
	The first mishap occurred at a place 35km from Shillong around 3am and killed 11 people, all passengers of an Assam State Transport Corporation bus headed for Silchar from Guwahati. Barely half-an-hour later, 10 members of a marriage party died when a Tata Safari rammed into a truck coming from the opposite direction at Sirajuli, near Dhekiajuli on National Highway 52 in Sonitpur district. 
    
	The sequence of road tragedies continued till evening, this time on National Highway 37 at Amoni, about 40km from Nagaon town. Three persons were killed when the Alto they were in crashed into a truck.
    
	Most of the victims in the Meghalaya incident were fast asleep when the bus hurtled down a gorge between Mawryngkneng and Puriang. 
    
	Survivors told police and the media that the driver who was at the wheel had only moments earlier taken over from his colleague who drove the vehicle for the better part of the journey. 
    
	I was seated near the cabin. The first driver called out thrice to the second one to get up, but he was dozing. When he finally took over, he drove recklessly. We sensed something was going to happen, Totin Barman, an injured passenger, said at Shillong Civil Hospital.
    
	The bus rolled down 65 metres and most of the victims died instantly. Only three of them were identified till late in the evening. They are Rajkumar Sharma from Guwahati, Silchar-based BSNL employee Siddharth Shankar Das and S.U. Borbhuyan. 
    
	Frantic relatives scanned the wards of the civil hospital and the morgue throughout the day. Most broke down on seeing near and dear ones bruised and battered, but alive. 
    
	 We informed police stations in Assam about the accident so that people whose family members or relatives were on the bus could come to Shillong at the earliest and check on them, East Khasi Hills deputy commissioner B. Dhar said. 
    
	East Khasi Hills police chief A.R. Mawthoh said the driver was to blame for the accident, but the bus, too, seemed overloaded. 
    
	A large pothole caused the accident in Sonitpur. The circle officer of Dhekiajuli, Mahendra Saikia, said one of the trucks wheels fell into a pothole, resulting in the driver losing control and colliding with the Tata Safari. 
    
	Rina Bodo, one of the 13 injured in that accident, said she could not recall anything except hearing a deafening sound. Most of us were asleep and I only heard a bang. When I came to, I was in hospital, she said. 
    
	Rina and the rest of the passengers were returning to Manuhmari village, about 35km from where the accident occurred, after escorting the bride to the grooms house. The dead were in the age group of 13 to 25. 
    
	The victims in the third accident were headed for Guwahati from Tezpur. They were identified as S.L. Parikh, Bhagaban Mishra and Jatindra Choudhury.

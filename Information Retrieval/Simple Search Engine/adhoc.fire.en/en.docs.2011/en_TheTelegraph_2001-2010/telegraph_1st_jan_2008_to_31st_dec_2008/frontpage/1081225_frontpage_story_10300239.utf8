          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               Gupta (top), Tiwari				                                 
	Lucknow, Dec. 24: An engineer was beaten to death allegedly by a BSP MLA and his henchmen for refusing to contribute Rs 50 lakh for chief minister Mayavatis birthday celebrations next month.         
	M.K. Gupta, an executive engineer in the Uttar Pradesh public works department, was left unconscious outside a police station by his attackers around 5am today, state police chief Vikram Singh said.         
	Gupta, a father of two and said to be in his late 30s, was supervising the Ambedkar Gram Projects in Auraiya, 230km from here, where he had been posted for two years.        
	A police complaint filed by his wife Shashi said four persons barged into their house at Gail Vihar in Dibiyapur, Auraiya, early this morning and attacked her husband.         
	BSP MLA Shekhar Tiwari and his two associates, Manoj Tyagi and another surnamed Bhatia, had batons in their hand and began assaulting him, she said.         
	The engineer was declared dead on arrival in hospital.         
	Shashi said her husband locked her in the bathroom after the assailants broke in.         
	Gupta was from Lakhimpur Kheri in eastern Uttar Pradesh, where IIM graduate Manjunath was murdered in 2006. The Indian Oil manager had been fighting oil pilferage.        
	The slain engineers family said Tiwaris men had been demanding Rs 50 lakh for Mayavatis January 15 birthday, which Gupta had refused.         
	The BSP MLA was arrested in the evening. The police chief said two of his accomplices were engineers who worked under Gupta.        
	Cabinet secretary Shashank Shekhar Singh said an FIR had been filed against Tiwari.        
	He added: Chief minister Mayavati has nothing to do with the case.        
	Shivpal Yadav, brother of Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, insisted Mayavati should be held responsible and alleged she had asked ministers, MPs and MLAs to collect Rs 1,000 crore.         
	Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh said: Mayavati observes her birthday as extortion day.         
	The Samajwadi Party has called a bandh tomorrow.        
	Congress leader Digvijay Singh accused the BSP of ruthlessly collecting funds from the administration.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | More seats but not majority
                                                                                                           More seats but not majority
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Shillong, March 7: Meghalaya did not buck the trend for the second consecutive election, making the Congress the single largest party in the 60-member Assembly but stopping short of giving it the mandate to form a government on its own.        
	The fractured verdict makes it imperative for the Congress  despite three seats more than its 2003 tally of 22  to go back to the regional parties that partnered it in the previous government. The question is: will the pre-election acrimony allow a renewal of friendship?        
	The two parties that had hoped to push the Congress out of the frame bettered their previous performances, though not enough for a shot at power. Neither the Nationalist Congress Party nor the United Democratic Party can realistically stitch together a coalition unless everyone gangs up against the Congress.        
	Former Lok Sabha Speaker Purno Agitok Sangmas return to state politics was a successful one, but the margin by which he won the Tura seat  only 2,825 votes more than his nearest rival  will have disappointed him as much as the NCP falling short of its lofty expectations. Sangmas two sons, Conrad and James, were among the NCP winners.        
	The UDP won 11 seats  two more than in the previous election  but drew a blank in its stronghold, the Jaintia Hills. The regional partys loss was the Congresss gain in the Jaintia Hills. In all seven constituencies where the UDP expected to win, it was the Congress that emerged victorious. The remaining seat went to the NCP.        
	The Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement and the BJP won a seat each, one less than their previous tally. The Hill State Peoples Democratic Party (HSPDP) retained the two it had. Five Independents were elected and could go on to play the decisive role in government formation.        
	The Meghalaya Democratic Party was wiped out, the biggest loser being party president and sitting legislator Martle Mukhim.         
	The one seat that remains to be decided is Baghmara in South Garo Hills. Polling was countermanded following the death of the sitting legislator and will be held on March 22.         
	Several heavyweights, including former chief ministers Salseng C. Marak of the Congress and F.A. Khonglam of the HSPDP lost. The other losers are Deborah Marak, P.W. Muktieh and Scott Lyngdoh (Congress), Martle Mukhim (Meghalaya Democratic Party), Admiral Sangma and P.M. Syiem (NCP) and P.T. Sawkmie (UDP).        
	The big victors are chief minister D.D. Lapang, his deputy Mukul Sangma, Speaker M.M. Danggo, Friday Lyngdoh (all Congress), Donkupar Roy and former chief ministers J.D. Rymbai and E.K. Mawlong (all UDP), H.S. Lyngdoh (HSPDP) and Paul Lyngdoh (KHNAM). Of the 19 women in the fray, only one  Ampreen Lyngdoh of the UDP  was elected.        
	The new set of Congress legislators will meet on Saturday morning to discuss the probable combination of another coalition. We have successfully completed a full term as the leader of the Meghalaya Democratic Alliance and are not averse to renewing our alliance with the UDP and others, PCC chief .L. Nongtdu said.         
	At the Congress headquarters in Delhi, the mood was sombre. Congress spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan said the party would reflect on the comparative success in Meghalaya, alluding to but not mentioning the drubbing in Tripura.

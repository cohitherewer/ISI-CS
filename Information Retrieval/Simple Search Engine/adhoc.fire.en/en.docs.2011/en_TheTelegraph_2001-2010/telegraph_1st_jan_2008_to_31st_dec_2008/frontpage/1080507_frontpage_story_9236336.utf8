The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Muivah unhappy with Delhi
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Muivah unhappy with Delhi
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                    
	New Delhi, May 6: Unhappy and losing faith in the governments approach towards the Naga problem, Thuingaleng Muivah, the general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), met national security adviser M.K. Narayanan in Delhi yesterday.        
	We doubt the government of Indias sincerity, Muivah told The Telegraph today, a day after the meeting. We have been talking for 10 years now.         
	The talks had begun after the NSCN (I-M) entered into a ceasefire with Delhi in 1997.        
	Not disclosing the details of the meeting with Narayanan, the rebel leader only said that the government had not been sincere in finding a solution to the Naga problem.        
	The outfit appears peeved over a statement Narayanan had made after his visit to Nagaland a few months ago. The NSCN (I-M) understood the statement to imply that it was because of the outfit that the peace process had slowed down. UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhis statement during an election campaign in Nagaland that there was enough scope for a settlement within the Constitution did not go down well with the outfit either.        
	The NSCN had issued angry counter-statements following the two views from the government.         
	That is why perhaps the Congress lost the elections, Muivah said, adding that the government had time and again tried to embarrass the outfit in front of the Nagas.         
	Muivahs anger, although unexplained, seems to stem from the fact that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh refused to meet him even once as talks continue to be sluggish.        
	Muivah said the UPA government needs to build up on the welcome step taken by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government of recognising the uniqueness of Naga history and situation.        
	Muivah said the Nagas had come half way to meet the government, but the latter had not done its bit.                           
	Faced with inter-factional killings by the rival group, NSCN (Unification), at home and a hawkish security establishment in New Delhi, the outfit seems to be pushed to the wall.         
	Most rebel leaders in the NSCN (I-M) believe that the Khaplang and Unification factions of the NSCN are being encouraged by Delhi.              
	In fact, Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio called on home minister Shivraj Patil today to discuss the law and order situation in the state.        
	Muivah said the Nagas had come half way to meet the government, but the latter had not done its bit.               
	There should be trust for negotiation to proceed but how can we trust the government of India when no step is being taken, he said.        
	The rebel group wants a separate constitution for Nagaland and a special federal relationship with the Indian union, something similar to the former Jammu and Kashmir model, which had a Prime Minister and still has a separate constitution.        
	While the outfits demand for integration of contiguous Naga areas is a no-no for the government, the NSCN (-M) is uncompromising on a separate constitutionNone of the 29 demands of the outfit have been accepted as yet.         
	Within the government, the belief is of prolonging the peace process and to let the problem die a natural death.         
	Muivah said the Naga problem had persisted for 60 years and people were still fighting. He said the government should realise that the Naga problem was a political problem and not a law-and-order problem as it was made out to be.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bengalis lose it for Bengal
                                                                                                           Bengalis lose it for Bengal
  - Bangladesh lets Proteas best Pankaj-Vinoos record 413           OUR BUREAU                                          Mankad, Roy                                        
	March 1: Bengal has lost its only world record in any sport because another set of Bengalis had a poor day on the field.        
	Pankaj Roy and Vinoo Mankads Test opening stand of 413, after surviving 52 years, passed into history at Chittagong when South Africas Graeme Smith and Neil McKenzie stretched their stand to 415 today.        
	A revenge over the Proteas in tomorrows under-19 World Cup final  one of Super Sundays two mega clashes with India also taking on Australia in the tri-series first final  may soothe feelings somewhat, especially if Calcuttas own Sreevats Goswami does the star turn.        
	It may also be some consolation that the other world record held by a Bengali  Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful is the youngest Test centurion  still stands.        
	But the irony will not be missed. It is Ashrafuls team, who many believe got Test status prematurely, that has helped sink a record that outlived both its creators and survived the assaults of the Lawry-Simpsons, Greenidge-Hayneses and Hayden-Langers.        
	The worst of Bangladeshs play came yesterday, when their opponents ended with 405 without loss. At 10.13 local time this morning, skipper Smith pushed Shakib al Hasan for a single and then rushed to shake hands with his partner.        
	Bengals biggest cricket star, Sourav Ganguly, congratulated the South Africans but said the old feat was more praiseworthy since it was scripted against New Zealand, a better team.        
	It happened so long ago  on January 7, 1956, in Madras  that many may not remember that the Kiwis in those days were nearly as docile a bunch of whipping boys as the Bangladeshis are today.        
	Pankajs son Pranab, who played two Tests, was a little disappointed: Id hoped it would be broken by Indians some day.        
	That nearly happened in Lahore on January 13, 2006. Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid piled 410 versus Pakistan on a flat wicket before the Delhi opener played one impetuous shot too many.        
	Roy (1928-2001) and Mankad (1917-78) had beaten Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrooks 359 against South Africa, made in 1948.        
	It was by no means the best knock played either by Mankad or by Roy. Both were hesitant in making their strokes but there was no lack of concentration and determination. Mankad now and again played his rousing pull shot and the drive to the off but he rarely brought off his dazzling cuts, wrote the Indian Cricket Almanac.        
	The story goes that Roy received a slip from the dressing room asking him to hit every ball and got out soon after, but captain Polly Umrigar delayed declaration till several hours later. Roys 173 was his highest and Mankads 231 the best by an Indian for 28 years till Sunil Gavaskar overtook him.        
	The partnership record, however, stayed out of even Gavaskars reach. There have been so many great openers like Gavaskar, Greenidge and Haynes. In spite of it, the record was intact for so long, Pranab said.        
	If it seems unfair that the new record should bear the name of McKenzie, a middle-order batsman kicked up the order on his comeback from a four-year layoff, one may do well to remember that Mankad himself and Dravid were no different.        
	And Smith is the only batsman ever to have featured in four 300-plus opening stands, the first three partnering Herschelle Gibbs.        
	This was also only the second time a Test opening pair had both notched double centuries. Forty-three years after Australias Bill Lawry hit 210 and Bobby Simpson 201 against the West Indies  their stand of 382 threatening the Roy-Mankad record -- Smith smashed 232 and McKenzie grafted 226 in Chittagong.        
	In 1971, New Zealanders Glenn Turner and Terry Jarvis had put together 387, against a Caribbean team still a few years from developing its fearsome pace battery.        
	But the old record dies in good company. March 1 is the day when  50 years ago  Huttons 364 was eclipsed by a 21-year-old Garry Sobers, who snatched the record for highest individual score from the English and the Australians for the first time.

          SUJAN DUTTA                               
	New Delhi, March 10: Defence minister A.K. Antony has put deals with Israel for the Barak missile on hold after the CBI arrested suspected agents Suresh and Sanjeev Nanda on a bribery charge.        
	The Nandas are already being investigated for accepting illegal commissions on a missile deal struck during the NDA regime when George Fernandes was defence minister.        
	Antonys orders to go slow on more deals with Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) comes in the month the ministry was lining up a contract estimated at more than $300 million for an air force variant of the anti-missile missile.         
	Fernandes, and the former chief of naval staff, Admiral (retired) Sushil Kumar, are also likely to be questioned by the CBI in the case.        
	The cases were referred to the CBI by the ministry of defence in April 2005 when Pranab Mukherjee was defence minister.         
	The revival of the case with the arrest of the Nandas immediately puts the clock back in the armed forces drive for rapid modernisation.         
	We are not cancelling the deals, the bureaucrat said. But till such time as the investigations are on, what do we do? a senior bureaucrat in the ministry wondered aloud when asked about the status of the deals by The Telegraph. How can we go ahead when an investigation is on?        
	None in the ministry now headed by Antony, with his reputation as Mr Clean, will even dare suggest that the pending deals for the Barak and its variants be concluded. The navy chief, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, only dared to repeat a line that the navy has taken in the past  that the Barak missile system installed in his ships has performed well. He said that of 13 firings of the missile, only the first was a failure caused by human error.        
	There is no way the government can cancel or allow the shadow of malpractice in the Barak deal to cloud ongoing projects with Israel by blacklisting Israeli firms. Israel is not only the second-largest military supplier to India (after Russia), it is also involved in such a wide range of defence projects  from AWACS to fighter aircraft, tanks and ships to missile defence  that New Delhi cannot afford to run the risk of falling foul of Tel Aviv.         
	But the immediate fallout of the go-slow order means, apart from the air force project, a naval demand to procure about 200 more Barak missiles for $110 million is also unlikely to be cleared. Navy headquarters had first asked for the fresh supplies to be cleared two years back and is understood to have sent half a dozen reminders but they have not washed with Antony so far.        
	The Barak missile defence system is essential, the navy says, for the defence of its fleet because potential enemies are armed with Harpoon and Exocet missiles that can be used against Indian warships.

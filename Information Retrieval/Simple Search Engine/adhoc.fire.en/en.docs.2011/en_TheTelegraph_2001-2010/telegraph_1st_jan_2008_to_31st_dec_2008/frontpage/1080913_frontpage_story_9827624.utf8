  - Coalition partners deny toppling bid        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Shillong, Sept. 12: Putting up a show of unity, the coalition partners of the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA) tonight announced that they would stick together under the leadership of chief minister Donkupar Roy.         
	A meeting of all the five coalition partners as well as Independent legislators supporting the MPA government expressed confidence in Roy.         
	The meeting of the MPA was held at the residence of the chief minister to clear doubts that the Congress was trying to topple the government.         
	At the meeting, the coalition partners, the UDP, NCP, KHNAM, HSPDP, BJP and Independents have reiterated that the MPA would complete its full five-year term.         
	The members of the political parties supporting the MPA also made it clear that none of their members had been approached by the Congress to form an alternative government in the state.         
	There were reports that the state Congress, with the blessings of the party high command, had approached both the NCP and the UDP to join hands for a Congress-led government.         
	However, the leaders of both the NCP and UDP, the major coalition partners of the MPA, scotched the rumours saying it was the handiwork of the Congress to create confusion in the minds of the allies.         
	At the joint news conference attended by NCP leader P.A. Sangma, KHNAM president Paul Lyngdoh and HSPDP president H.S. Lyngdoh, chief minister Donkupar Roy said the government was stable and the coalition partners were united.         
	He said the common minimum programme of the MPA would be placed before the state cabinet so that the programmes and policies of the state can be implemented in a time-bound manner.         
	The MPA also stressed the need to strengthen the state vigilance commission for transparency and accountability in governance.         
	Sangma reiterated that the present coalition was committed to completing its full five-year term, come what may.

  - Unassuming golf champion lands and leaves for home unheralded          INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                            Chowrasia getting into the taxi at Calcutta airport on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                        
	Calcutta, Feb. 11: The queue in front of Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia at Calcutta airport today was not of fans hunting for autographs but fellow passengers looking for a pre-paid taxi.        
	The new golf champion arrived in his hometown unnoticed, stood in the queue and took a cab home.        
	But Chowrasia didnt mind.        
	Theres nothing wrong its okay. Ive done it all my life. I didnt ask anyone to receive me at the airport; I wasnt expecting anyone, said the 29-year-old who yesterday humbled top international pros to become the third Indian winner of a European Tour event.        
	Flight IC 401 landed a little after 9.30am, half an hour behind schedule. Not many would have known of Chowrasias plan to return today  the news had been he would fly from Delhi, where he won the Emaar MGF Indian Masters, to Indonesia straightaway to play his next event.        
	A handful of people stopped to take a second look at the unassuming young man who won the Rs 1.6-crore prize only when they saw him speaking to a TV channel.        
	M.M. Singh, the chief executive officer of Royal Calcutta Golf Club, Chowrasias sponsor, said he wasnt certain when the champion would arrive.        
	We werent sure of his homecoming. We didnt have the confirmation. I did ask him yesterday if he needed a car on arrival and he said no, Singh said.        
	Hes such a humble person. Hes only one of us. He called to inform me of his arrival only after he had reached home.        
	Dola Banerjee, who had received a grand welcome to the city after winning the world archery (recurve) final in Dubai last year, was surprised.        
	This shouldnt have happened. A good reception is always expected  it serves as an inspiration. I feel sad for him, she said.        
	The first signs of a welcome came before Chowrasias flat in Bikramgarh, where friends and neighbours had gathered with bouquets and rasogollas. The golfer looked a touch emotional as he stepped out of the cab.        
	In the afternoon, however, RCGC showered affection on its mascot. As he walked into the club, Chowrasia had to stop every few metres to shake hands. A band of admirers who saw him grow up on the club greens followed him about. Many shouted slogans.        
	This is home to me, Chowrasia said.        
	Chowrasia is special. Thats why RCGC has been sponsoring him. He is one of the most cool-headed sportspersons around, said former club captain Ashit Luthra.        
	Yesterday I was just confused. I couldnt realise the significance, things happened so fast, Chowrasia said.        
	After going through the papers this morning, Im now sort of getting the feeling. I know the weight of expectations is bound to rise.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Kokrajhar, March 5: Militant leader-turned-politician Hagrama Mohilary today offered to bury the traditional enmity between the armed group he led through rebellion and reconcilement and the one that has kept insurgency alive in Assams Bodo heartland.        
	Mohilary, now the head of the Bodoland Territorial Council that administers four districts, said he would gladly make up with the chief of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) for the sake of the Bodo community.        
	 If Ranjan Daimary (alias D.R. Nabla) wants peace in Bodoland, I believe we can sit and talk in the greater interest of the people. They want peace and development, he told the media in Kokrajhar.        
	Mohilarys Bodoland Liberation Tigers has long been disbanded, but its former members cannot seem to get over their rivalry with the NDFB. While the outfit continues to fight for an independent Bodoland, the BLT settled for an autonomous council. Mohilarys party has since even partnered the Congress in government, but a section of former BLT cadre continues to engage in occasional battles with NDFB militants.         
	The Bodoland area  comprising Baksa, Chirang, Udalguri and Kokrajhar districts  has witnessed several such incidents in recent times. A spate of killings in Baksa district in the past few days is believed to be the reason why Mohilary has finally offered to talk peace with Daimary.        
	A source said the chief executive member of the BTC was starting to feel the pulls and pressures of being an administrator. He now knows that the people are not going to remain mute spectators to killings. In a democracy, the ruler has to abide by the peoples wishes and Mohilary is learning it.        
	On Sunday, three persons, including a teacher, were killed in Baksa in separate incidents. An NDFB member, N. Muluksa, was seriously injured when gunmen fired at him at Aila Chowk in the same district on February 28. In Kokrajhar, the body of one Raman Singh Brahma was found yesterday near the Kalang river.         
	The All Bodo Students Union today slammed the BTC administration for the law and order lapses. Despite witnessing a series of killings, it is sad to see the administration doing nothing, Absu president Rwngwra Narzary said.

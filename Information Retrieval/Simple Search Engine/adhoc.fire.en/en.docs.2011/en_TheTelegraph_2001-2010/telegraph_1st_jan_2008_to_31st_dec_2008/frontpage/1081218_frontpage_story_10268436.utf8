          RAJ KUMAR                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 17: Five of the 11 alleged criminals arrested by Gumla police nearly a month ago in connection with the abduction of Sitaram Narsaria, a local trader, were today identified as hardcore members of All Adivasi National Liberation Army (AANLA), an outfit operating in Assam.        
	Police officers from Assam met Gumla superintendent of police Baljit Singh and showed him photographs of the AANLA members wanted in more than 100 cases of murder and abduction in Assam. Gumla police had informed them about the arrests and wanted to know their criminal antecedents. Singh said the arrested five had come to Jharkhand from Assam to recruit young blood.         
	According to police spokesman S.N. Pradhan, the masterminds of the outfit included Magra Oroan, alias Nirmal Tirkey, also known as David. He is the commander-in-chief of the outfit and a resident of Devidpur village at Merapani in Golaghat district.         
	The other one is John Kujur, alias Deepak Kumar who is also known as Prem, a resident of Santipur under the same area. He is the brain behind the explosion on the Rajdhani Express on December 13 last year at Chungajan under Sarupathar police station of Assam. Five passengers were killed in the attack.         
	Pradhan said the three others were Munna Nayak, a resident of Sonitpur, Rauni Lakra of Sivasagar and Arjun Oroan, alias Motu, a resident of Nalbari. Singh said they were inciting the youths by showing pictures of Jharkhand-based tribal women being tortured in Assam.         
	They wanted to spread their tentacles in the state and were committing crimes to meet their financial requirements, he added. Singh said all were highly trained and had access to weapons like light machine guns, M-16, AK-56, self-loading rifles, .303 rifles, carbines, mortars, rocket launchers, pistols, revolvers and grenades.         
	They demand Scheduled Tribe status for the Tea tribes of Assam. They have received training in explosives from the NSCN in Myanmar and rigorous training for more than six months at different places in Assam from the Kuki Revolutionary Army (KRA) and other terror outfits, the SP said.         
	According to him, the youths were also behind two encounters with police.         
	Singh said that Assam police would take the AANLA members on remand and had applied to the local chief judicial magistrate for it.        
	In July, the Jharkhand police had been informed by their Assam counterparts that AANLA rebels were being trained by Maoists in Jharkhand. Two AANLA members, Mikhail Bina and Raju Gaur, had surrendered before the Golaghat deputy commissioner around that time and revealed that a large number of cadres were undergoing training in Jharkhand.

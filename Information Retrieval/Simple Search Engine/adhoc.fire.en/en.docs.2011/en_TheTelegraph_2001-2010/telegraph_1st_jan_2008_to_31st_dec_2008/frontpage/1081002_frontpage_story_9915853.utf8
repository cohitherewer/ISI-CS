          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 1: Taking judicial note of the Kandhamal violence continuing for over a month now, Orissa High Court today directed the Centre to provide additional paramilitary forces to the government without delay to bring the situation under control.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice B.S. Chauhan and Justice B.N. Mohapatra issued the direction after the state counsel pointed out that chief minister Naveen Patnaik on September 25 had requested the Centre through a letter to provide 43 companies of central paramilitary force.        
	The court was hearing a petition filed by the Utkal Christian Council. We direct the Centre to take into consideration the chief ministers letter dated September 25 and take into account the current atmosphere and take steps to make paramilitary forces available as required by the government at the earliest, the court said.        
	The court also took judicial note of the councils counsel Prasanna Nandas allegation that the police had been instigating criminals into heightening violence. If any complaint is lodged against any police officer, the concerned superintendent of police shall investigate into the matter as to whether the said officer committed any kind of mischief or instigated the goons, the court specified.        
	Nanda also alleged in court that the riot victims had not been safe even in the relief camps because of inadequate police protection and no FIRs by the victims had been accepted also.

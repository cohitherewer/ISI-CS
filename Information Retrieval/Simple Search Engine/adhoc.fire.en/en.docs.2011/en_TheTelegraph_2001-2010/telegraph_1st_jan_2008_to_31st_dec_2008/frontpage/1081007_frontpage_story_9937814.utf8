	Mumbai, Oct. 6: After unveiling a spate of masterminds behind the serial blasts, police now claim they have in their dragnet the technological brain behind the computer-savvy Indian Mujahideen.         
	Mumbai police officials today announced that Mohammed Mansoor Asghar Peerbhoy, 31, a software engineer who hails from a highly educated Mumbai family and works for a multinational Internet service provider with an annual salary of Rs 19 lakh, is the elusive hacker of the homegrown terror outfit.         
	Peerbhoy, the police claimed, was the prime operative of the Indian Mujahideens media wing, which was also responsible for its cyber activities and disseminating information. They said he sent out the terror emails before the serial blasts at Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Delhi.         
	The police had earlier claimed that one Tauqeer, who was once associated with a leading Indian software company, was the technological mastermind of the organisation. Tauqeer, said to be from Mumbais Mira Road suburb, has yet to be arrested.         
	The police did not comment when asked about the confusing signals being sent out, but a source said this was natural since investigations were still on.         
	Last month, Mumbai police had claimed to have nabbed the mastermind of the serial blasts, though the forces in Delhi and Ahmedabad had identified different persons as the brain behind the terror strikes.        
	Apart from Peerbhoy, two other engineers have also been arrested.         
	Among them is Mobin Kadir Shaikh, 24, a technical support adviser with an IT firm, who was allegedly the co-sender of the mails along with Peerbhoy. Asif Bashiruddin Sheikh, a mechanical engineer, is said to have drafted the mails.        
	Two others, Ismail Chaudhary and Mohammad Atique, experts in timer devices, are also in the net.        
	With this, the total number of Indian Mujahideen members arrested by the police from Mumbai, Kochi, Gulbarga, Mangalore, Navi Mumbai and Pune over the last three days stands at 20.        
	The announcement was made by Mumbai police commissioner Hassan Gafoor Khan at a news conference in the city. Gafoor said the three engineers were top notch software professionals who hacked unsecured Wi-Fi networks and sent terror email warnings minutes before the blasts.        
	However, Riyaz Bhatkal alias Roshan Khan, the main accused and founder-member of the Indian Mujahideen, is still at large and known to have escaped to Pakistan, he said.        
	All the 20 arrested are in the custody of the Mumbai police crime branch. Khan said five laptops, including the one from which mails were sent, six CPU units and Wi-Fi detectors were recovered from the accused.        
	The operation was in progress since the last two months and the three wings of the Mumbai police  the anti-terror squad, special branch of the CID and the crime branch  were involved in the hunt to nab the terrorists.        
	Khan also said that interrogation of the arrested men had suggested they were planning a strike on Mumbai between Navratri and Diwali, around October 26.

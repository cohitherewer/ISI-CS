The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Extension ruled out for Ghisingh 
                                                                                                           Extension ruled out for Ghisingh 
  - Govt to take charge after March 24        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, Feb. 20: The Bengal government does not have any plans to extend Subash Ghisinghs term as Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) administrator.        
	 The government is not considering renewing Ghisinghs tenure. We dont have any such plans. After March 24, a government representative would be appointed as administrator of the hill council. I am announcing this under instructions from the chief minister, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya at Writers Buildings today.         
	A discussion with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had taken place earlier at the state cabinet meeting.         
	The announcement comes a few days after the urban development minister said there was no way the government could declare Ghisinghs removal immediately.         
	It is only after March 24 that the government can arrive at a decision, Bhattacharya said.         
	The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has been demanding the removal of the GNLF chief as caretaker administrator of the DGHC and has called an indefinite bandh in the Darjeeling hills from today to pressure the government.         
	Ghisingh was holed up in Pintail Village, 3km from Siliguri, for the third day today after Morcha supporters blocked all routes to Darjeeling to stop him from sneaking into the hills.        
	Morcha leaders claimed that only a handful of GNLF workers was left in Sukna as most have joined their party.         
	A major chunk, disgruntled over Ghisinghs inclination towards Sixth Schedule (instead of Gorkhaland), have joined our party, said Lalit Thapa, the Sukna branch president of the Morcha.         
	The GNLF office at Captain Ramsingh Thakuri Chowk in Sukna was closed throughout the day.        
	Since morning, Morcha supporters blocked NH55 at Salbari and Sukna, not allowing even bicycles to pass through. However, army vehicles, ambulances, school buses and vehicles carrying students were provided free passage.         
	Sukna was deserted while very few shops were open at Salbari till 12.45pm. Schools and colleges remained open.        
	In Salbari, 6km from Siliguri, some CPM supporters allegedly tried to force a section of shopowners to open their establishments. The Morcha supporters protested and police intervened to stop the two parties from clashing.        
	For Ghisingh, it was another day of rest. He took a walk on the campus and rested in his room, said I.N. Pradhan, the Kurseong branch president of the GNLF, who is among those keeping him company.         
	In response to the Morcha announcement that 11 of its supporters will sit on a fast in front of the subdivisional office in Siliguri from tomorrow, R.J.S Nalwa, the inspector-general of police, north Bengal, said the protesters would be arrested to prevent any law and order problem.         
	They will not be allowed to go on a hunger strike in front of the SDO office in Siliguri, the police official said.        
	The government today denied extension to D.T. Tamlong, the principal secretary of the DGHC. The district magistrate of Darjeeling will function as the interim principal secretary.         
	Bhattacharya blamed the delay in passing the Sixth Schedule bill for trouble in Darjeeling.         
	An early passage would have meant elections to the hill council. That could have solved the problem, the minister added.        
	On behalf of the chief minister, Bhattacharya also made a fresh appeal to the protesters.         
	The government does not want any confrontation. We have asked the district administration to initiate talks with them.         
	Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said adequate police arrangements have been made in the hills as the situation there was worrisome.

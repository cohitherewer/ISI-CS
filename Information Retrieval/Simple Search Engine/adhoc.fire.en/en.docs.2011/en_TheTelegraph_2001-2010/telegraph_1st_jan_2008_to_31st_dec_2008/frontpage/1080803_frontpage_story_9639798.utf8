                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Keira in battle to prove she has brains
          ANITA SINGH                            slight chip                                  
	London, Aug. 2: She has played some of the most famous heroines in literature, and her intelligent performances have been lauded by the critics.         
	But Keira Knightley has admitted that forsaking university in favour of a film career has left her with a chip on her shoulder over her lack of education.         
	The Oscar-nominated star of Atonement and Pride And Prejudice now battles to prove to herself  and those around her  that she has brains.         
	I am completely uneducated, said Knightley, 23. Not going to university did give me an incredible driving force because it leaves you with a slight chip on your shoulder. It makes me feel I am going to read absolutely everything so I can prove that I am not stupid.         
	Her current reading list is an impressive library which includes a biography of Albert Speer, a history of the Vietnam War, the treatises of Mary Wollstonecraft and Germaine Greers feminist text The Female Eunuch.         
	To add to her difficulties, Keira was diagnosed with dyslexia aged six and as a result can read only very slowly, she told Tatler magazine.         
	The actress dropped out of school at 17, before taking her A-levels, after landing her breakthrough role as Lara in a television adaptation of Doctor Zhivago. She found stardom that same year in Bend It Like Beckham and went on to play Guinevere in King Arthur, Cecilia Tallis in Atonement and Dylan Thomass lover Vera Phillips in The Edge of Love, as well as the blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean movies.         
	She recently signed up to play Cordelia in a film version of King Lear. Her next ambition is to appear on stage, but she will not be taking a starry role in the West End: I cant quite handle the idea of Screen Actress in Big West End Hit and all that. I would prefer to do something smaller, she said.        
	Everything scares me. The idea of doing theatre scares me in an exciting way but doing any part always terrifies me... It boils down to a fear of standing there in a wig and a dress and suddenly thinking: I feel like an idiot. You must not let your imagination see the absurdity of it and cause your performance to die.        
	While Knightley failed to complete her education, many of her fellow actresses have combined career success with university degrees. Rachel Weisz and Thandie Newton studied at Cambridge, while Kate Beckinsale, Emilia Fox and Emily Mortimer are Oxford graduates. Among those who did not go on to university, Kate Winslet shares Knightleys feelings, admitting to feeling intellectually insecure in the company of more educated actors.                             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

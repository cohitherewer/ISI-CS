Its the good old M
  - Guided by artistic instinct, an extra vowel creeps into Trinamul leaders signature          CHANDREYEE CHATTERJEE                            The part of the Christmas painting where the artists name is written Mamataa. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	Calcutta, Dec. 26: Ektaa, Shobhaa, Jayalalithaa Mamataa!        
	Mamata Banerjee has given herself a Christmas gift  a new name.        
	The Christmas tree canvas that she began on Tuesday and completed today nestled among potted plants and light bulbs outside her office, bearing the artists signature with a difference  Mamataa.        
	The extra a at the end was also conspicuous by its presence in Christmas greetings she texted to a select few and signed off as Mamataa.        
	The SMS and sketch gave the name game away, but Mamata blamed it on mere creative impulse. Just like my paintings are guided by instinct, so is my signature, she told The Telegraph close to midnight. I do try to sign my paintings with an extra a, but sometimes I slip back to a single a.        
	The latest painting to bear the artists signature touch is titled A Happy Peaceful Christmas 2008. It depicts a green tree with red starry flowers on a watery blue base.        
	But what can an extra a do for Mamata? A lot, claims Bollywoods busiest numerologist. Mamata to Mamataa will bring her name to 42, which is a powerful number. Shah Rukh Khan and Jayalalithaa share the same number. It can bring her success, says Sanjay B. Jumaani, who claims to have been contacted by her secretary when he was in town in September 2007 for a confidential meeting that never happened.        
	Since Mamata has always been in the Opposition, the change in name can take her to the seat of power, with time, patience and good karma, added Jumaani, dwelling on the good a and the better a.        
	One parallel the star numerologist flaunted may not exactly be a Christmas carol to Mamatas ears. Reema Lamba changed her name to Mallika Sherawat and became a number 42 for box-office glory with Khwahish and Murder.        
	The additional a does add another dimension to Indian politics botanical sisterhood. Jayalalithaa, whose partys two-leaf symbol carries shades of Trinamuls flowers and grass, had added an extra a to her name a few years ago.         
	But Mamata is unlikely to follow Jayalalithaa in another recent addition  an alliance with Prakash Karat.        
	So, is the study of the occult significance of numbers a new feather in the cap of the politician-cum-poet-cum-painter? No, no, laughs Mamata. In my childhood, my name was spelt Mamota, but then it became Mamata.        
	And now in the times of Nativity post-Nano, its become Mamataa.        
	Time for Tata to go Tataa?        
	With inputs from Karo Christine Kumar

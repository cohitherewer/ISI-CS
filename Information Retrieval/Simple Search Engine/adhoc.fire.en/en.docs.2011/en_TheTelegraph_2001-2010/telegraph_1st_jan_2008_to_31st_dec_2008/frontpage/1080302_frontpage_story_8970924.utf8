The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Duty to devour HPL cash
                                                                                                           Duty to devour HPL cash
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, March 1: A devil in budget details is threatening to give sleepless nights to Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL), Bengals showpiece project.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram has proposed a 5 per cent import duty on naphtha  the raw material used by Haldia Petro, the largest shareholder of which is the Bengal government. The duty will saddle the company with an additional expenditure of Rs 290-300 crore  or about 80 per cent of the profit projected by Haldia Petro this year.        
	The countrys two other big petrochemical players, Reliance Industries and GAIL India, will not be hurt by the duty. Reliance makes naphtha at its own refinery while GAIL uses gas as raw material. This means Haldia Petro will probably be the only big company to be affected by the levy.         
	The bolt from the blue has come at a time Haldia Petro, which makes polymer used by the plastics industry, is struggling to cope with a sharp spurt in the price of naphtha.        
	The impact of the duty began sinking in on a day Bengal politicians complained that the Centre, which is locked in a nuclear-deal standoff with the Left, had ignored the state in the budget ( ).         
	Sources said the state government was expected to seek a rollback of the duty on naphtha. State finance minister Asim Dasgupta could write to Chidambaram.        
	The duty has flummoxed Haldia Petro officials, all the more because Chidambaram himself had withdrawn such a levy on naphtha two years ago. It was reduced to 0 per cent from 5 per cent. I do not know what may have prompted the reversal of the decision, Swapan Bhowmik, Haldia Petro managing director, said.        
	Last year, the company had made Rs 580 crore as profit after tax, the highest ever in its history. However, the company has forecast a lower profit, around Rs 350 crore, this year.        
	If the duty is not rolled back, it will hit Haldia Petro in a year  2008-09  the company is planning a 75-day shutdown to expand capacity. The two unrelated factors are certain to tell on the profit next year, the sources said.        
	The company imports 1.4 million tonnes of naphtha a year and buys 300,000 tonnes from the domestic market. However, domestic producers usually raise prices when import duty is raised. This means Haldia Petro, which would have spent Rs 5,848 crore on the raw material next year, will have to pay 5 per cent more.        
	The farmer-friendly budget has exempt fertiliser makers from the naphtha duty. But Haldia Petro does not make fertilisers.

	Jaipur, June 30: A jumbo controversy has erupted over a village for elephants, which, experts say, could turn into another Fatehpur Sikri.        
	The first-of-its kind hamlet coming up on the outskirts of the city is designed to house over 100 elephants, mahouts (elephant trainers) and their families.         
	The village, spread over 36 hectares and being built at a cost of Rs 5.22 crore near Amer Fort, is slated for inauguration sometime next month and is tipped to become yet another tourist destination.         
	The first phase is nearing completion with enclosures ready for 51 elephants which will move in shortly. Separate quarters are being constructed for the mahouts with kitchen and bathrooms.        
	Elephants have been part of Jaipurs cultural ethos ever since the royal days. Earlier, the pachyderms were part of the kings cavalry and were a measure of the kings pomp and grandeur.         
	Now descendants of families that have been tending to elephants for generations are renting them out to tourists for the steep ride to the Amer Fort situated on a hilltop. These rides are a great draw for tourists, especially those from abroad. They continue to be used for weddings, with the rich and powerful grooms and their families riding to the mandaps atop elephants, showcasing their wealth.         
	Rashid Khan, secretary of the Elephant Owners Association, said: The project is a dream come true for the citys 116 elephants. Look at the condition in which they live in the narrow lanes near Amer Fort, with no space at all to move about. This project, whose idea was mooted at least 40 years ago, is finally taking shape with water bodies, spacious enclosures and even separate quarters for mahouts, which they could never dream of.        
	A veterinary hospital, a riding track for the elephants, a cafeteria and an exhibition centre are also on the anvil, which could make the place a tourist hotspot.        
	However, experts are sceptical. NGO officials described the village as a concrete township and said it could meet the fate of Fatehpur Sikri, the city Akbar built as his capital near Agra but was forced to abandon because of shortage of water.         
	A veterinary doctor associated with the NGO Help in Suffering (HIS), a partner of the London-based Elephant Family, said: There are no forest areas and natural surroundings which are a must for these animals. The elephant enclosures have been built in the traditional way measuring 21 by 17 feet, which are too cramped for an animal as big as the elephant. Though there are plans for water bodies, there is none available now. An elephant cannot do without water.        
	Elephant Family and Help in Suffering conducted a research of the site in 2005 and found that natural water supply was insufficient. Edwina Kinsella-Be van, project manager, Elephant Family, said: Water availability in Rajasthan is almost totally dependent on the monsoons and regularly there is water shortage and drought. Our tests carried out in 2005 showed that the natural water supply was insufficient.         
	Project managers are convinced theirs is a good plan. A.K. Sharma, project engineer giving shape to the village, said: The village has been planned in consultation with Mumbai architects. The views of elephant owners have been taken into account. The enclosures are 30 by 30ft with a height of 17ft. We got the biggest elephant and checked whether the place is cramped for it or not.         
	Sharma also dismissed fears of water shortage. Three water bodies have been planned. One of the largest in the first phase will be betel-leaf shaped and 14 feet deep. An anicut (small dam) has also been built to store excess water in case of heavy rainfall. Water harvesting techniques are being employed. At least 1,400 saplings were planted last year. The greening of the place will take some time but every project takes time to take shape.

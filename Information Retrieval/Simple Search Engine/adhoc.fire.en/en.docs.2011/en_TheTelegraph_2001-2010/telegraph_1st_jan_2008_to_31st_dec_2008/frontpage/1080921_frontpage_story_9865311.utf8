          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 20: Metro Cash amp; Carry India managing director Martin Dlouhy is likely to meet senior state ministers next week to try and end the stalemate over the German wholesalers EM Bypass store.        
	Dlouhy, to be accompanied by Henry Bir, Metros Hong Kong-based vice-president (international relation), has sought an appointment with agriculture minister Naren De, sources said. The Metro bosses may also meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, though such a meeting is yet to be firmed up.        
	When contacted, a Metro spokesperson only said: We are awaiting our APMC (agri-product marketing committee) licence in West Bengal, and our 350 trained local employees are eager to serve customers.        
	Metros 100,000sqft store, set up at an investment of Rs 140 crore, is complete but the company has been waiting for a licence from the states Forward Bloc-run agri-product marketing board. On Thursday, Metro had issued a statement saying it was evaluating our options in what appeared a veiled pullout threat.        
	It will be a crucial meeting. The companys future course of action will depend on the outcome, a source said. Its likely that Metro would seek a timetable relating to the issue of the licence, he added.        
	De, whom Dlouhy will meet, is now doubling as agri-marketing minister in the absence of Bloc colleague Murtaza Hossein. The licence, however, has to be issued by the agri-marketing board, headed by another Bloc member, Naren Chatterjee.        
	The Bloc, a Left Front partner, opposes the entry of big companies in retail but is yet to take a clear stand on the wholesale sector. It had issued a licence to Metro in 2005 and renewed it twice before abruptly withdrawing it last year, probably because Metro is an MNC. The company applied for a fresh licence last March but the board hasnt budged.        
	Today, the company tried to clear the air about its operations, insisting it would help small stores and in a way enable them to stand up to big retail. In an email to this newspaper, Dlouhy said Metro had trained small stores across the world to be competent and was committed to safeguarding their future.        
	Metro Cash amp; Carry conducts various training programs for small kirana shop owners. These programs include modules on cash management, modern merchandising and shelf-management methods etc that help improve their business. Metro Cash amp; Carry plans to launch the kirana training programs in India very soon, he said.        
	Metro has conducted such training in Turkey, the Czech Republic, Vietnam, China and several East European and Asian nations. It will also ensure efficient supply and quality products for small stores.

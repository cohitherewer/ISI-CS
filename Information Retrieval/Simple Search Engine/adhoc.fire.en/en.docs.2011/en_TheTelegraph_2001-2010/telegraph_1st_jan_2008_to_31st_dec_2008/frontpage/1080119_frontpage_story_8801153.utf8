 speak to judge

     A STAFF REPORTER 
                  
	Guwahati, Jan. 18: Adivasi student leaders intend to take along the girl who was stripped in public and another who was allegedly raped during the mob mayhem at Beltola to a hearing by the Justice (retd) R.K. Manisena Singh Inquiry Commission. 
    
	The All Adivasi Students Association of Assam confirmed only yesterday that it would make submissions before the retired judge. 
    
	Two leaders of the organisation, general secretary Joseph Minz and assistant secretary David Horo, today sought an appointment with the commission to produce witnesses to the cataclysmic chain of events on November 24. Justice Singh fixed January 30 as the date for the hearing. 
    
	Horo said later that all the Adivasi victims in the mob violence would be paraded, including the girl who was stripped and the 43-year-old woman who was raped. 
    
	They are the victims. Only they can say what occurred. We have requested the commission to give us dates so that we can produce the witnesses. He has been kind enough to agree to hear us on January 30. We cannot bring one and leave the other victims, the student leader said. 
    
	Justice Singh confirmed accepting the student leaders application to produce witnesses. 
    
	They had applied for permission to bring witnesses, which has been granted. I have told them to bring as many witnesses as they can, but to ensure that facts are not repeated. Otherwise, I will not be able to compile my findings and submit the report by the deadline, he said.
    
	The government has asked the commission to wrap up the probe latest by February 28. 
    
	Justice Singh was to have visited Beltola tomorrow, but postponed it. The retired judge said he would make the trip once he finished gathering evidence and hearing witnesses. I am duty-bound to go (there), but I want to receive everything and then decide on how to proceed. 
    
	Four persons, including one from the All Guwahati Students Union (AGSU), met Justice Singh today. But sources said not all of them were witnesses. 
    
	The AGSU handed the commission a video CD of the Adivasi procession and a representation based on media reports. 
    
	The union complained about alleged discrimination in payment of compensation to the victims and residents who lost property in the mayhem.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 12: Schools run by minorities will be required to implement quotas under the governments proposed law to make education compulsory for all children.        
	In the past, the Centre has routinely cited constitutional provisions to grant minority institutions immunity from quotas and other kinds of government control.        
	But the Free and Compulsory Education Bill, 2008, expected to be tabled in the Rajya Sabha next week, does not exempt minority educational institutions from its ambit, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	Among other things, it requires all private schools to reserve a quarter of their seats for children from the economically weaker sections.        
	Article 30 of the Constitution, however, says: All minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.        
	Article 29 allows minorities to conserve all aspects of their culture, language or script.         
	The articles, read together, effectively exempt minority educational institutions from any government order on seat reservation or admission policy, other than those about minimum quality standards.        
	But the education bill specifically states that Articles 29 and 30  both fundamental rights  will not apply to it. To counter critics, the government will argue that the right to education too is a fundamental right, and cannot be suspended by any other constitutional provision, sources said.        
	The bill also requires the formation of school management committees  made up by school officials and representatives from among the parents and the local government  to monitor the implementation of the law. So far, minority schools have been run solely by their trusts.        
	Sources involved in drafting the bill said they were concerned about the legal implications of not shielding minority institutions from the planned regulations.        
	The OBC quota law for higher education cites Article 30 to exempt minority institutions, who dont need to reserve seats for SCs and STs either. A few years ago, education minister Arjun Singh set up a National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions to ensure strict application of Article 30.        
	But government officials now argue that a law that aims to make education free and compulsory for all children between 6 and 14 cannot be held hostage to any exemptions.        
	The law aims to implement what is a fundamental right. We cannot achieve education for all if some institutions are not party to the law, an official said.   
	BITTER PILL  
	Curbs that minority schools must accept if the right to education bill is passed in its current form:  
	 Reserve 25 per cent seats for poor students (earlier exempt from all quotas)
    
	 Allow parents and local government officials say  in the running of school (earlier run solely by  minority trusts)  
	 Follow government  admission policy (earlier followed own policy)

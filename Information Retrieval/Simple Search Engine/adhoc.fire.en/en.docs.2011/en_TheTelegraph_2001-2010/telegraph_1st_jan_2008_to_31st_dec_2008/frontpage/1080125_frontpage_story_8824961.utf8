 - At Writers, with dagger 
     A STAFF REPORTER
                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 24: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today had a visitor who came with a bhojali (dagger) in his bag. 
    
	But the chief minister was not in office and the 30-year-old from Nandakumar in East Midnapore couldnt get past the last security checkpost at Writers Buildings. 
    
	Haripada Jana was caught when the metal detector beeped. He had sneaked past the plainclothes policemen on the pavement outside and the constables at the main gate.
    
	He was caught while crossing the last stage of our security system, an officer posted at Writers admitted. 
    
	When the metal detector beeped, the policemen stopped Jana. He told them CPM activists had ransacked his garage a few weeks ago and he had come to complain. 
    
	He said he had written a letter to the chief minister and wanted to meet him. We asked him for documents showing he had an appointment. But he failed, an officer of Hare Street police station said.
    
	Thats when the policemen decided to search the man, who was turned out in a shirt and trousers and carried a bag in his right hand. First we frisked him. But nothing was found. We then decided to search the bag, said the officer. There we found the bhojali wrapped in a newspaper.
    
	Jana had arrived at 4.30pm. The chief minister had left around 3.40pm to attend a meeting in Jadavpur and returned at 4.50pm, an officer said. 
          
	Jana was arrested. We have arrested him because he failed to tell us why he was carrying a weapon into Writers Buildings, a senior police officer said, requesting anonymity. 
    
	Later, Jana told interrogators: I wanted to commit suicide inside Writers seeking justice. I informed all the authorities concerned, from the panchayat to Writers, that injustice was done to me. But no one paid heed.
    
	Officers said they are in touch with East Midnapore police to verify his claim. He was arrested one year back while trying to enter Writers. But then e did not find any weapon on him. He was booked for trespass and freed on bail.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Monkeys roam free, people behind bars
  - Tourist footfall slips as Pachmarhi barricades itself against simian menace           RASHEED KIDWAI                            People look up at a monkey from behind a wire mesh in Pachmarhi                                         
	Bhopal, Aug. 9: In Pachmarhi, people live in cages while gangs of monkeys roam merrily around.        
	Monkeys rule over the entire town. We have shuttered ourselves behind iron bars, Father Prabhudas Tirkey, a priest in a local church, said.        
	Tourist footfall too has fallen in Madhya Pradeshs best-known hill resort, with the fear of the simians apparently outweighing the attraction of watching a zoo in reverse.        
	Anup Kumar, a software engineer from Gurgaon who recently visited Pachmarhi, said he saw monkeys snatch food from people.        
	The terror is everywhere  on roofs, dining tables, cars, trees, roads and in rooms. The issue turns serious when they bite and damage property, Kumar said, adding he would not recommend the hill station to anyone.        
	The town, 175km southeast of Bhopal, is located on the Satpura mountains. It is known for its green cover and the murmur of flowing waters that can be heard everywhere.        
	Pachmarhi derives its name from five ancient cave dwellings excavated from sandstone rock in a low hill. Legend has it that these caves, now protected monuments, provided sanctuary to the five Pandav brothers during their one-year agyatvas (hiding in exile).        
	Now it resembles more the Lanka of the Ramayan, besieged by an army of monkeys.        
	Many of the 15,000 terrified residents, living barricaded behind the doors of their houses, shops and offices, have suffered bites.        
	Local forest officials, who would be expected to tackle the problem, say they are flooded with complaints. The district administration has announced that monkey-bite victims can claim medical expenses from the forest department.        
	Forest ranger Pradeep Kumar Khatri, though, blames the tourists, saying the food they eat in the open and the scraps they throw about the place has attracted the animals. This isnt the first monkey invasion here, Khatri said.         
	Three years ago, experts were brought in from Mathura (Uttar Pradesh) to trap and take 300 monkeys out of the town, Khatri added.         
	Residents say the authorities have been slow to respond this time because of a territory dispute between the forest department and the civic body.        
	Pachmarhi is an army cantonment town and is governed by the cantonment board. The forest department wants the board to pay for the monkeys translocation while the board wants the forest department to split the costs.        
	State tourism managing director Ashok Lohani said a middle path was needed. Pachmarhi has an old problem of monkeys but we need to protect the tourists too, he said.        
	Lohani added that he wasnt too concerned about the fall in tourist inflow. We have not ascertained if its because of the monkeys, he said.        
	Pachmarhi was discovered in 1857, when Captain James Forsyth of the Bengal Lancers was galloping hard up the Satpura Range. He chanced on the saucer-shaped valley and recommended its development as a sanatorium and hill resort.

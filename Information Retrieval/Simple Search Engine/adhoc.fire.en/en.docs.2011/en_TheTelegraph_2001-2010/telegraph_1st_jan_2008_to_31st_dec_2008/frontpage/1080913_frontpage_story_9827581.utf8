  -Primer for touring legislators                                Nancy Pelosi: Handle with care                                  
	Indian MPs are being tutored how to deal with the power women of America.        
	Not with gun-loving Republican Vice-President candidate Sarah Palin yet, but with the US House of Representatives first woman Speaker, Nancy Pelosi.        
	A US-bound goodwill parliamentary delegation, led by parliamentary affairs minister Vayalar Ravi, is being coached so that its members are not caught off guard if Pelosi raises the Orissa violence against Christians.        
	The foreign ministry has also prepared a note  India-US relations in perspective  for the team of MPs and bureaucrats who will visit New York and Washington from tomorrow till September 21.        
	The team is expected to meet Pelosi and US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice on September 16 in Washington besides watching the proceedings at the US Congress  perhaps at a time it debates the nuclear deal. No advice of caution, though, has been given about the Rice meeting.        
	Pelosi, a Democrat from San Francisco, takes a keen interest in human rights and is known to air her views freely. Foreign ministry sources said the Indian team had been cautioned not to make any casual remarks that could lead to embarrassment.        
	It (Orissa) is a law and order issue. The vibrant democracy of India and its institutions have taken care of the issue. The pluralism of India has stood the test of time, an official said, perhaps providing a hint of what the MPs might say if cornered by Pelosi.        
	The US Speaker had, on her visit to India in March, ruffled diplomatic feathers by criticising China for its crackdown on Tibetan activists. She also visited Dharamsala to meet the Dalai Lama at a time local Tibetans were protesting against Chinese rule over their motherland.        
	Pelosi didnt mince words. She said Tibet was a challenge to the conscience of the world, and that freedom-loving people throughout the world needed to speak out against Chinese oppression or else lose all moral authority to speak on behalf of human rights anywhere in the world.        
	Beijing had reacted by saying she was a defender of arsonists, looters and killers.        
	The violence against Christians in Orissa can become diplomatically tricky for India, South Block sources said. The Vatican has condemned the attacks and Italy summoned the Indian envoy to register protest.        
	Indian dignitaries and officials travelling abroad are routinely given briefings and updates to prepare them for the visit, the sources said.        
	These delegates represent the country during the foreign trips, so they are given an overview of the relationship between the two countries and briefed on issues they have to be aware of, an official said.

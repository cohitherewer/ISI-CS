          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nagaon, Feb. 11: Four persons, including an Assam police battalion jawan, were killed and two more injured when militants belonging to the Jewel Gorlosa-led faction of the Dima Halam Daogah ambushed a convoy of Neepco officials 20km from Umrangsu in the North Cachar Hills district at 5pm today.        
	Another APBn jawan has been reported missing after the incident.        
	Police said three vehicles from Neepcos Umrangsu-based colony were on their way to the power house escorting senior mechanical engineer Bijoy Prakash and four other employees for their evening shift. The Neepco officials were in the first vehicle.         
	The third vehicle in the convoy carrying security personnel and the driver bore the brunt of attack from automatic weapons.        
	The APBn personnel, two security guards of Neepco and the driver were killed on the spot. Their names are not yet known. Two others, Branthon R. Marak, a Neepco security guard and Silnang A. Marak of the APBn were seriously injured in the attack.        
	The police later recovered the four bodies from the spot.        
	The two injured were admitted to a Neepco hospital. Silnangs condition is said to be critical. None of the officials or the security personnel in the first two vehicles came to harm in the attack.        
	This is the second such attack on Neepco officials by DHD(J) during the past month. On January 14, militants travelling in a Bolero opened random fire on the power house campus in which five persons, including two security personnel, were killed.        
	Todays incident came just an hour after the completion of a combing operation by NC Hills police and the CRPF in the Umrangsu area.        
	As the 20-km-long hilly route between the colony and powerhouse was marked as vulnerable after the January 14 attack, we are providing Neepco personnel with armed escorts, a police official said.

          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, March 15: Minorities, women and other deprived classes can soon turn to a national watchdog that will probe complaints of bias and ensure punishment.        
	The Equal Opportunity Commission, to be set up through a bill, will begin by looking at discrimination in employment and education in the public and private sectors. Its scope will later be widened to include housing, health and loan disbursal.        
	Madhava Menon, head of the experts panel that drafted the bill, said the commission would not just make recommendations but have enough legal teeth to redress grievances.        
	For instance, if it finds a company guilty of discrimination, it will post the probe results on its website and get in touch with the Centre. The punishment hasnt been worked out, but the government may refuse to renew the companys licence or threaten to stop funds, a source said.        
	To weed out frivolous complaints  such as when an employee from a deprived class has been disciplined for neglecting his duty  the commission will prefer complaints mentioning systematic rather than one-time discrimination.        
	The commission will look after all the weaker sections, including women, identifying the deprived classes on the basis of a deprivation index that takes into account indicators such as income, education and access to healthcare.        
	Such a commission had been suggested by the Rajinder Sachar Committee, which studied the social, economic and educational status of Muslims. The minority affairs ministry is expected to send the bill to the cabinet soon.        
	The seven-member body will have six offices  a headquarters in Delhi and zonal offices in the east, west, north, south and northeast.        
	The chairman and two others will be full-time members. The other four will be from the deprived classes and must include at least two women.

	In a separate incident, police picked up two National Democratic Front of Boroland militants  Khiranto Narzary and Gepo Narzary  from the outfits transit camp in Gossaigaon after Bodoland Peoples Front filed an FIR against them.        
	The Bodo belt has witnessed a series of clashes between the NDFB and BPF, leaving over 30 dead and many injured.

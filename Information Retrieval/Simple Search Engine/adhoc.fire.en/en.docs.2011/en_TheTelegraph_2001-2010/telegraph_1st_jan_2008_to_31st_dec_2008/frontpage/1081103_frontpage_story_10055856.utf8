The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Injured or hurt? Kumble retires
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Injured or hurt? Kumble retires
  - Gentle Jumbo listens to his body and says he is unable to take the grind any more           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Kumble with his daughter during the concluding ceremony on Sunday. (PTI)                                        
	Nov. 2: Nothing, it seemed, could keep Anil Kumble away from the 22 yards which make and destroy careers.        
	Neither a broken jaw in the Antigua Test six years ago, nor a finger which required 11 stitches in New Delhi the other day.        
	Nothing, indeed, could break the typical south Indian Brahmins resolve. Or dilute his passion.         
	Yet, years on, he may actually admit that the stinging criticism of the past few weeks (and Dilip Vengsarkars rather cold time is up comment in particular) broke his heart and played some role in this afternoons decision to quit Test cricket.        
	Kumble, 38, bowed out from ODIs last year. That was soon after the World Cup fiasco. I dont know whether I would leave after 600 or 700 (Test) wickets, is what hed stated then.        
	Kumble finished on 619.         
	Its a fact, of course, that Team Indias oldest cricketer had been struggling with his bowling shoulder (which went under the surgeons knife in 2001) and that hed just gone wicketless for as many as 84.4 overs.        
	Equally, less than a fortnight ago, India scripted a record-margin win over Australia under stand-in captain (now successor) Mahendra Singh Dhoni and that made the Ian Chappells call for continuity at the top.        
	For all that, few Kumble googlies caused as much of a sensation  shock for some  as his decision to retire. In sync with his 18-plus years as an India cricketer, the touch from the leg-spinner himself was clinical and not flamboyant.        
	Kumble said: It was not a sudden decision.... My body had been telling me that its time now.... Yes, its always tough (to take such a decision).... I had decided that this would be my last series.... I decided last night that I should quit.... Im not able to take the grind any more.        
	That this could be the stalwarts last series had been reported by The Telegraph on October 20.        
	On record, though, Kumble didnt say that hed been hurt by criticism.         
	Kumble said: See criticism is a part and parcel of life.... For me, criticism started 18 years ago when I started playing Test cricket.... Some said I was not good enough for even two Tests....         
	Boy, he played many more!        
	Kumble, in fact, appeared in 132 Tests and as a wicket-taker finished only behind Muttiah Muralidharan and Shane Warne. Add the 337 victims from 271 ODIs to his Test tally of 619 and you cannot but marvel at an extra-ordinary innings.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, who made his India debut just a few months before Kumble, probably paid the highest compliment. It has been an honour and a privilege to have played in the same era.... Such grit. Such respect.        
	Sourav Ganguly, who is bowing out after the Nagpur Test (which begins on Thursday), wasnt far behind in saluting Kumble. If you ask players in the dressing room, hell be remembered forever.        
	Sadly, after Nagpur, the Fab Five will be reduced to the Fab Three (including Rahul Dravid, who is struggling with a capital S).        
	His on-field achievements apart, Kumble will be hailed for staying clear of controversies and for taking such pride in wearing the India colours. A perfect role model, unlike the more gifted Warne, who cut a rather sorry figure off the field.        
	Circumstances conspired to ensure Kumble got the (Test) captaincy when in his 38th year, but his handling of the team in the days immediately after the Monkeygate affair in Sydney, this January, was a lesson in controlling even some of the uncontrollables.        
	The typical South Indian Brahmin bit notwithstanding, Kumble wouldnt really fit a stereotype. Neither on the field, nor away from it (remember he has married a divorcee, Chetana, a pillar of strength), and if the emerging generation is short on inspiration, it could knock on this engineer-cricketers door in Bangalore.        
	Little hype and a handful of endorsements Well, bottomline is that Kumble has to be judged very differently.

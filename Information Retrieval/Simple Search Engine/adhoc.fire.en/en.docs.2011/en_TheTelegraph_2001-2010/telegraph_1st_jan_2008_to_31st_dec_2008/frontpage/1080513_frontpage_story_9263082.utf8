          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Nagaon, May 12: The night train between Silchar and Lumding became a casualty in Dima Halam Daogahs latest cycle of attacks which claimed two more railway labourers in North Cachar Hills today.         
	Eight workers engaged in construction of railway quarters in Faiding, under the same police station as todays site of attack in Migrengdisha, were gunned down by the Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dimasa outfit yesterday afternoon.        
	The latest round of violence was triggered by an encounter between the outfit and the army on Saturday in which, according to the outfit, 12 rebels were killed.         
	The army, however, said it had not found a single body despite a massive search in the area after the encounter.         
	Continuing its killing spree, the outfit today opened fire on a team of labourers of Sachi Hitech at a construction site near Migrengdisha railway station.         
	An unskilled labourer, Dinesh Mahato, died on the spot, while his co-worker, Sanju Nunia, died of his injuries on his way to hospital.         
	Two others were admitted to Haflong Civil Hospital in a critical condition.         
	All the labourers were engaged in the construction of a channel near the railway station when they were attacked by the militants, said a senior police official in the district.        
	Following the DHD attacks, the railways decided to stop running night trains between Lumding and Badarpur through the North Cachar Hills district.         
	According to the railway sources here, the Cachar Express from Silchar to Guwahati via Lumding would steam off from the terminus at the Cachar headquarters at 4.40am every day till further instructions.         
	The Barak Valley Express will, however, continue to leave Silchar station every day at 8.25am.         
	A shaken Dispur rushed IGP (law and order) R. Chandranathan to review the situation.         
	An unconfirmed report said the outfit also sprayed bullets on a BSF camp in Umrangshu last night. There have been no reports of any casualty.         
	Not willing to take chances, Dispur posted commandant of the 2nd Assam Police Task Force Battalion, Prabin Chandra Saikia, as superintendent of police since the incumbent Dipak Kedia is on leave.         
	We are keeping the Centre posted about the developments because of the projects and the objective now is to ensure the projects are not hampered, a source said.         
	Union home minister Shivraj Patil, however, will bypass the killing zone of North Cachar Hills district when he arrives in the region on a two-day visit to Meghalaya and Nagaland tomorrow.         
	Home secretary Madhukar Gupta said the home minister would not visit Assam as he has a packed schedule in Shillong tomorrow.         
	Many visits have already been made to Assam but since there have been killings by militants the Centre is constantly in touch with the state. We will see if there is any need for a team to visit, said Gupta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Left issues fresh nuke ultimatum
                                                                                                           Left issues fresh nuke ultimatum
  - Karat seeks meet, Cong   cites national pride         JAYANTH JACOB                                           
	New Delhi, March 6: Another flashpoint on the nuclear deal between the Congress and the Left appears imminent after a relative four-month lull.        
	The CPM today cautioned the UPA government afresh against precipitating its downfall, saying any progress with the deal would be a gross violation of the majority in Parliament.        
	The Congress retorted hard, likening the deal to national pride and daring the Left to pull out.        
	The Left will have to explain to the people why they aborted the governments mandate on an issue of national pride, chief AICC spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said today, adding: The deal will have to happen. ( )        
	The message from the Left was blunt, though: proceed with finalising the IAEA safeguards agreement at your own peril. The warning came in an angrily worded, but unsigned, article in the CPM mouthpiece, Peoples Democracy: The Left parties will take all necessary steps to stop the government from taking such a step (operationalising the deal). It is for the Congress leadership to decide whether it wants to be seen as kowtowing to the pressure of the Bush administration. And this decision has to be a quick and clear one. The future of this government depends on the decision.        
	As reported by The Telegraph on Wednesday, the Left also set a deadline for a UPA-Left committee meeting to seek a clear answer from the government. After consulting Left allies, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat wrote to external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee seeking a meeting before March 15.         
	Ominously titled Turning Point Has Arrived, the Peoples Democracy article hit out at pro-US media aided by sources in the Prime Ministers Office and the external affairs ministry, saying (they) are busy fabricating another successful step forward in the Indo-US nuclear deal. If one is to believe these reports, after five rounds of negotiations, the Indian side has got a safeguards agreement which will overcome all problems posed by the Hyde Act and its 123 progeny. This is, to use an American term, pure baloney!         
	It also left nobody in doubt that the Left stood opposed to the deal, irrespective of what had been achieved at the IAEA negotiations.        
	It is unfortunate that the statement made by the minister of external affairs to Parliament on March 3, 2008, and the Prime Ministers reply to the debate on the Presidents address continue to harp on the governments efforts to go ahead with the nuclear deal. If the government thinks that after arriving at an agreed text with the IAEA on a safeguards agreement they can proceed to take the next steps for operationalising the agreement, they are mistaken, it said.        
	While the deadline for closing the deal is getting worrisome for the government, the Left parties have their own constituencies to take care of. Both the CPM and the CPI have party congress meetings this month and they want clarity on the issue before facing cadres.        
	Left sources said they wanted the governments position on the deal clarified before Mukherjee leaves for the US on March 23-24. Mukherjee is scheduled to discuss the nuclear deal with US officials, something the Left might want to now abort.        
	The Left parties feel that the UPA is taking advantage of the honourable exit route they provided the government by allowing them to go ahead with the IAEA negotiations last November. By not scheduling a meeting of the UPA-Left committee, the government may be seeking to buy more time while it goes ahead with talks on the deal with the US.         
	T.J. Chandrachoodan, RSP general secretary and member of the UPA-Left panel, added his own to the CPMs warning: We have issued a death-warrant to the UPA government. They either stop the deal or lose our support.

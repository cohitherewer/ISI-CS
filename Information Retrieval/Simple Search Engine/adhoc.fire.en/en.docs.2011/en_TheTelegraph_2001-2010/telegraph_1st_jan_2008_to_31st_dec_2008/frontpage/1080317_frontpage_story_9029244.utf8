          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR                            The Dalai Lama in Dharamsala. (PTI)                                  
	Shimla/Dharamsala, March 16: The Dalai Lamas restrained criticism of the Chinese crackdown in Lhasa has annoyed the Tibetan youth in India who now say his middle way has become irrelevant.        
	The Buddhist spiritual leader today said the Beijing Olympics should not be called off, keeping in line with the mildness of the international reaction that has so far avoided any threats of sanctions or a Games boycott.        
	The Olympics should not be called off as these Games will no doubt greatly impact the minds of the Chinese people, the Dalai Lama said. The world should, therefore, explore ways of producing a continuous positive change inside China even after the Olympics have come to an end.        
	Radical youth groups that want the Games scrapped right away reacted with disappointment.        
	The Dalai Lama has been compromising as much as he can but this has failed to change Chinas stand. So the middle way has lost sanctity and become irrelevant, said Tsewang Rigzin, Tibetan Youth Congress president.        
	The Tibetan Womens Association too said the middle way, which it backed till recently, had failed so far.         
	Both youth groups want an independent Tibet while the Dalai Lama today repeated his demand for autonomy. We want autonomy, not independence. Everybody except Beijing knows we are not seeking independence, he said.        
	He demanded a probe into the events in Lhasa, adding: Intentionally or unintentionally, somewhere cultural genocide is taking place.        
	At Dharamsalas main Buddhist temple, some 1,500 people, including monks, listened to exiled Tibetan leaders speeches. Chinese flags were laid out on the road outside, forcing cars and lorries to drive over them.        
	We are showing solidarity for the people inside Tibet. We are their last hope, said Sonam Dorjee, a protester leading a hunger strike near the Dalai Lamas home.        
	The 44 protesters who resumed the back to Tibet March yesterday reached Kantpur in Una district today, having covered 18km. Police had arrested an earlier group of 100 marchers.

                                                                                                           I succeed because I know I can fail 
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                        
	March 11: The launch of Kolkata Knight Riders brought the one and only Shah Rukh Khan to franchise captain Sourav Gangulys home turf.        
	Shah Rukh is, of course, the franchise owner (with close friend Juhi Chawla and her husband Jai Mehta being the other stakeholders).         
	Soon after the launch, the buzz-creating Shah Rukh spoke to The Telegraph for around 20 minutes. It was straight from the heart  Dil Se.         
	The following are excerpts:        
	 On getting attracted to the IPL        
	Ive been a believer that cricket in the country needed a full-fledged league system Also, that a bit of commerce needed to come into sport here I wanted to be a sportsman and my parents didnt stop me from trying to become one.         
	However, I didnt know whether I could actually earn a living by being a sportsman. In fact, when I was young, I couldnt have said with certainty that Id be able to earn a living from acting either. I just felt that with the Indian economy on the threshold (of a giant leap) with roti, kapda and makan having been realised with entertainment having begun to do very well, it was time for cricket and sports to become a profession. An option for youngsters.        
	I wouldnt say Im doing social work, but probably its a social obligation because I love sports I want my children (son Aryan, daughter Suhana) to love sports Im trying to give the IPL my best shot, lets see if I can pull it off.        
	 Whether a venture bringing together film stars and cricketers is guaranteed to succeed in India        
	I dont look at it that way. I own Kolkata Knight Riders because of the person I am and it has nothing to do with my being an actor. It just happens that Im one Im fond of cricket and sports and would like to be associated with a sporting activity. If theres a (cricket) tournament for the seniors, Id love to play. I know theres a 35-and-over event in tennis, but thats one sport I didnt play I wasnt rich enough then! Equestrianism is the other sport I didnt engage in.         
	 Whether his initiation to cricket was through gully cricket in Delhi        
	No No No I was quite a proficient wicketkeeper and was once selected for a coaching camp run by the late Lala Amarnath I wasnt great with the bat, though, and batted (right-handed) at No. 6 or No. 7 My school (St Columbas) had a good team Gurcharan Singh would coach us (After a pause) Id also play soccer and ruptured a back muscle during one of the matches at the Ambedkar Stadium Id play hockey too Ive been passionate about sport.        
	 His idols in sport        
	Sunil Gavaskar and P.T. Usha. Dont think anybody should ask, why them? They did so much to lift the image of Indian sport gave it dignity. I met Gavaskarsaab the other day and it was such a pleasure.        
	 Top five cricketers        
	Not in any order, but theyd be Gavaskar, (Gundappa) Viswanath, Kapil Devsaab, Sourav, Sachin (Tendulkar) I also quite liked the Karsan Ghavris, Yashpal Sharmas and Roger Binnys. They had an identity of their own. In more recent years, where players from overseas are concerned, Id be a big fan of Glenn McGrath.        
	 Disappointed that McGrath isnt in his team but will be turning out for the Delhi Daredevils?        
	No I mean Id love to have all and Id love not to have any of them At the end of the day, my team is what we have Its been chosen by the best minds and theres not even an iota of unhappiness on my part.        
	Favourites in other sport        
	Footballers Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Paolo Rossi, Michel Platini Perhaps, because of my hairstyle, theyd call me Rossi in school! I remember watching the 1982 World Cup soccer on the TV with my mother If Im not wrong, thats the first World Cup telecast live.        
	Shocked at the Indian hockey teams failure to qualify for the Beijing Olympics?        
	Disappointed, certainly Its not the end of the world and I must say Ive been a little disturbed at the over-reaction in the media. Why must we put so much pressure on our sportsmen? Why cant we see this defeat as a lesson and plan for the Olympics after Beijing? Why not aim for gold in London (2012)?         
	Im sure we can start planning and sort out the little problems. It could be recalling Sandeep Singh or whatever Surely, sportsmen dont play to lose, but it can happen Youve got to appreciate that sometimes ones best isnt good enough But that doesnt mean you write the players off.         
	(After a pause) My son and I actually woke up at 3 am on Monday to watch the qualifiers final against Britain We were praying for the boys to stage a comeback, but that didnt happen The opponents were, clearly, very well organised and determined not to give anything away. Least of all the lead theyd taken.        
	Chak De! India being the defining moment in his career        
	(Smiles) I always believe that the next film will be the defining moment As an actor there has to be invention, perhaps the redoing of things Of course, Im aware that if Im not commercially successful, then I wont be able to star in films like Chak De! India As it happened, it became a hit, but such films usually dont No romance, no dance, womens hockey Seemed the wrong kind, yet it did very well and Im delighted that I could reach out to so many who otherwise wouldnt be interested in hockey Its very satisfying.        
	 (After a pause) I feel Ive grown as an actor every five-seven years I felt that way after Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge Dil Se didnt do that well, but I felt that way again That same feeling came back after Chak De! India.        
	On not looking back        
	Yes, I dont I dont even watch my films once theyve been made, except at the technical trials.        
	Attending premieres        
	I dont Even if I do, its for a few minutes, like Chak De! Indias in London last August I wasnt in the theatre for more than 20 minutes.. Id like to watch my films when Im through (with acting)        
	Handling pressure        
	I dont think of pressure. Ive got friends around me who make me feel very humble that so many love me for no real reason --- Im just an actor after all --- makes me feel humble. Im not under any pressure. Youll find me happy and smiling. Im a doer and I succeed because I know I can fail any time. Im aware of that possibility. Im ready for failure, which is why I keep succeeding.        
	(After a pause) You know, in school, Id carry a banner which read Do your best and leave the Rest Thats it You could fail and, if you do, then get up and try once more. No harm in failing and no harm in trying yet again.        
	Whether hes God-fearing        
	Very much so. Why? Because 99 per cent of what I am is because of God. A lot of people are better than me, but I think God has been very kind. I pray to God every living moment of my life.         
	What if he hadnt become an actor        
	I couldve taken to teaching. I did my bachelors in economics and masters in masscomm. Why, I couldve become a coach...        
	Best way to describe himself        
	Im an okay kind of guy who works very hard and tries even harder.        
	The dos and donts for a role model like him        
	You need to be honest. Need to have a clean heart need to have integrity need to pay your taxes. Indeed, you need to do everything you believe in give life your best shot.        
	Whether he envies anybody        
	(Laughs) Do you think I need to? Im Shah Rukh Khan.        
	Finally, if theres something which remains to be achieved        
	Not really. Allah has given a lot in one lifetime. Ive got a great family life. Lovely kids and a beautiful wife (Gauri). I couldnt have asked for more. Ive already got so much love that if I live for 150 years, therell be much in reserve for that. Allah, this country and its people have given me so much. Its humbling.

	Calcutta/Darjeeling, June 27: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee ruled out the creation of a new state but told a Gorkha Janmukti Morcha team today that he had no objection to holding tripartite talks with the Centre on how to grant more powers to the hill council.        
	Before going to Delhi, the chief minister would like a few more rounds of bipartite talks but the Morcha said it was either Gorkhaland or nothing for it.        
	I told the Morcha that if we cannot sit together and work out a political solution to the problem in the hills, talks with the Centre would not be meaningful. So, I appealed to them to go back to Darjeeling and think again on my proposals for bipartite discussions, the chief minister said after the 50-minute meeting that was held at the Writers Buildings.        
	Bengal chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti were present at the meeting. Yesterday, both of them had ruled out the possibility of the state government agreeing to the demand for Gorkhaland.        
	The Morcha leaders, however, turned down the chief ministers appeal. The Morcha teams brief for the meeting  prepared by party chief Bimal Gurung  was to stick to the demand for tripartite talks on statehood.        
	The chief minister told us about granting more powers to the hill council. But we turned down his proposals and told him that we want Gorkhaland. So in that way our meeting was not successful, said Amar Lama, who headed the Morchas four-member delegation.        
	The chief minister did say that the Centre would not agree to our demand for statehood, but we categorically told him that the tripartite meeting should take place first and that it was our responsibility to convince the Centre, Lama added.         
	However, Bhattacharjee was not ready to entertain the demand for a new state and instead harped on the unity of Bengal.         
	I told the Morcha delegation that we have been staying united for so long and in a peaceful manner. So, why is the question of the states division being raised? What for? I had said this at an earlier meeting with the Morcha too, said the chief minister.        
	With todays meeting termed a failure by the Morcha, Lama said the partys central committee would take a decision on whether to continue with its indefinite bandh in the hills or not.         
	The hills are currently enjoying a bandh breather, but the shutdown is scheduled to resume on July 5.        
	We also informed the chief minister about the indecent behaviour that our students, mainly girls, had to face in Bagdogra on June 12 and he asked us to send him specific instances. He also said North Bengal University will have to conduct a re-examination for all affected students, Lama said.         
	Bandhs by the Morcha and by organisations opposed to the Gorkhaland demand had forced a number of students to miss university exams in the hills, the Terai and the Dooars recently.         
	In Darjeeling, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said: The demand for Gorkhaland is within the ambit of the Indian Constitution, which has provisions for the creation of separate states. We will carry on with our peaceful movement.

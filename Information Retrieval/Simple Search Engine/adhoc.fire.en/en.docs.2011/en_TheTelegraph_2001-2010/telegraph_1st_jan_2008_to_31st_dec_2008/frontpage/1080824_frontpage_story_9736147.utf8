	New Delhi, Aug. 23: Indias biggest-ever art trade fair is showcasing 400 artists, but the man who brought money into Indian art is missing.        
	M.F. Husain is banned from the three-day India Art Summit at Pragati Maidan despite a culture ministry statement expressing support for him on Thursday.        
	Organiser Hanmer and Partner, a PR firm, has asked the 35 Indian and foreign gallery owners to keep out the controversial painter on grounds of security, angering many in the Delhi art world.        
	The company says it cannot let the galleries put up works by Husain, forced into self-imposed exile since angering Hindutva groups with his paintings of Bharatmata and nude goddesses.        
	For the first time such high-valued art pieces are (being) displayed. We were required to seek permission to ensure that nothing went wrong, said Neha Kripal, associate director of the summit.        
	Security is our responsibility. Hence, the decision of not showcasing Husains works. It is not a hidden fact  everybody knows there is some sense of uncertainty attached to Husain in our country.        
	But artists today criticised the culture ministry of Ambika Soni  who inaugurated the fair yesterday  for not standing up for Husains freedom of expression.        
	The ministry, which has provided Pragati Maidan for the fair, had said on Thursday that while it has not been consulted regarding the artists whose works are to be displayed, it would be happy if Husains paintings were displayed.        
	To photographer Ram Rahman, this is little more than a dodge. The ministry should do something more than issue statements. Its a shame that a summit of such a large scale doesnt have Husains paintings, said Rahman, founder member of Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat), which is running a parallel exhibition solely of reproductions of Husains paintings.        
	He is the one who has commercialised Indian art and thats why we artists can demand a certain amount of money for our work. He is responsible for creating the world-market boom for Indian art. If the fundamentalists are a problem, the venue should have adequate security, he added.        
	Peter Nagy, a gallery owner, has expressed his displeasure by putting up a photograph of Husain. Some viewers were angry but I have stuck to what I believe, he said.        
	Gallery owners are particularly disappointed that the ban covers all of Husains works. I wanted to display three Husain paintings from the 1960s but wasnt allowed. None of those paintings was controversial, said Ashish Anand of Delhi Art Gallery.

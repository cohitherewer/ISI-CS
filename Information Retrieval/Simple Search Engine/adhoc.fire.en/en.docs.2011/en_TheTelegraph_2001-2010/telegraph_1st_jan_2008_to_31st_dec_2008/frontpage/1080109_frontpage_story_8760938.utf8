The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | KICK AND MAKE UP   Boot for Bucknor, tour on with rider

   Boot for Bucknor, tour on with rider          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                    
	Jan. 8: The International Cricket Council (ICC) today took big steps towards mollifying the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which is commercially indispensable for the sport.        
	Late in the evening, after a two-hour working committee meeting in New Delhi, the BCCI responded by announcing that the tour of Australia would, for now, continue.                  
	Accordingly, Anil Kumble and Co. will leave for Canberra at 10.30am (local time) tomorrow, 48 hours after their scheduled departure from Sydney.        
	A statement released included: The BCCI will review the tour and all other developments continuously. The BCCI is of the categorical view that the (Harbhajan Singh) matter will have to be finally resolved and the unfair (racist) allegation against an Indian player be set aside/withdrawn....        
	If thats not done, and expeditiously, then Team India will be directed to take the first flight home. Theres no ambiguity there.         
	Incidentally, Harbhajans appeal against the Mike Procter-imposed three-Test ban, may actually be heard by a three-man panel instead of just one appeals commissioner.        
	Confirmation should come within 24 hours.        
	The ICCs No.1 move centred around Steve Bucknor, who got removed from the third Test, scheduled in Perth from January 16. The Jamaican has been replaced by Billy Bowden, who isnt the most efficient either.        
	New Zealander Bowden, though, isnt controversial. In other words, for the Indians, he doesnt carry too much objectionable baggage.        
	The ICCs decision was made public eight hours before the working committee meeting. Enough time, then, for behind-the-scenes activity to ensure that Team Indias operations didnt remain suspended indefinitely.        
	Additionally, as was on the cards, the ICC accepted Harbhajans appeal against the Match Referee-inflicted punishment.        
	If the appeal-related hearing isnt completed by January 16 (as seems most likely), then the off-spinner will be allowed to play in the third Test.        
	Harbhajan, in fact, can turn out till his appeal is disposed of.        
	The BCCI didnt directly call for action against Procter, but the ICC cut him to size by appointing Chief Referee Ranjan Madugalle as facilitator between captains Kumble and Ricky Ponting in the lead-up to Perth.        
	Unprecedented, its actually a show of lack of confidence in Procter and it wont surprise if he cites personal reasons and goes home.                  
	The ICC explained its steps as practical and though chief executive Malcolm Speed claimed Bucknor hadnt been replaced because of a representation from any team or individuals, nobody needs to guess why.        
	Its the result of a dialogue between mature people both within the ICC and the BCCI, said a well-placed source of The Telegraph.        
	Its, perhaps, significant that the BCCI played a key role in ensuring that South African Ray Mali succeeded compatriot Percy Sonn as the ICC president when the latter passed away in May last year.         
	In a related development, the ICC has accepted Indias complaint against Brad Hogg and Australias No.1 spinner is in the dock for abusing Kumble and M.S. Dhoni.        
	The hearing will be held before the third Test and Hogg has been charged under the same provisions which applied to Harbhajan.        
	While the BCCI has reasons to gloat, it erred in only targeting Bucknor when Englishman Mark Benson made more blunders.        
	Benson doesnt have a role in the last two Tests, but could be back in an India match sooner rather than later. What then?

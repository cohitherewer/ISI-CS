	Tamar (Ranchi), June 30: Maoists fired upon a group of patrolling policemen, forcing their vehicles to drive onto landmines, leading to the death of a sub-divisional police officer and four others.        
	The incident occurred around 4pm near about Pundidiri village under Tamar police station  about 65km from the state capital  where search operations by a special task force were going on since the May looting of an armoured vehicle carrying Rs 5.5 crore in cash belonging to ICICI Bank.        
	Maoists fired upon the police team returning from the Lungtu forests moments after the six police vehicles crossed a bridge on the Karkari river and were negotiating a mud road.         
	Among those in the team were Bundu sub-divisional police officer Pramod Kumar along with members of the CRPF.         
	The landmines exploded immediately after the Tamar police station jeep crossed the road. Kumars vehicle which was next bore the brunt of the blast, killing him on the spot.                
	Four other policemen, Pramod Yadav, Arun Singh, Kanchan Bhagat and Kanhai Singh, also died  two immediately, while two others succumbed to their injuries on way to hospital.         
	Two other policemen, Ravi Yadav and Ignatius Toppo, were seriously wounded and have been admitted to the Apollo Hospital here.         
	Director-general of police V.D. Ram, Ranchi senior superintendent of police M.S. Bhatia and other senior police officers rushed to the spot the moment they heard of the incident.        
	Kumar, in his early 30s, was the youngest of three sons of a retired armyman from Mihijam in Jamtara. He was to get married in December. He is the fourth senior police officer to die fighting Naxalites in the state after Lohardaga superintendent of police Ajay Kumar Singh, Garhwa deputy superintendent of police Kamlesh Kumar and Chatra deputy superintendent of police Vinay Bharti. State police spokesperson R.K. Mallick said the police team was probably following the same route while returning. May be they could have avoided the route while returning from the Lungtu forests. Again, may be they had no other option, he said.        
	Home secretary Sudhir Tripathi said the special task force was conducting operations in the area ever since Rs 5.5 crore bank cash was looted by suspected Maoists in May. Prima facie it appears to be the handiwork of Maoists local area commander Kundan Pahan and his gang.         
	According to a senior police officer, since the last couple of days Maoists had been spotted travelling in two tractors in the Pundugi and Arki areas.        
	It now turns out they were purposely trying to attract the attention of the police as they had planted landmines on the route. It was a trap. They had planted bombs on the way and when the police jeeps crossed the path near the bridge, the mines went off, said the officer on condition of anonymity.

	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 20: The ruling BJD-BJP combine has swept yesterdays urban local body polls.        
	According to the results of 90 local bodies announced by the State Election Commission, the ruling BJD is in a position to form civic councils at 27 urban local bodies independently while its coalition partner was in a position to form councils in eight towns.         
	Besides, the BJD and BJP can form councils together at 20 urban centres if they come up with a post-poll alliance. This time, the coalition partners had opted for seat adjustments at 32 urban centres, while they were locked in a friendly fight at the remaining 59 places.         
	Opposition Congress secured the majority in 11 urban local bodies, while the Independents established their supremacy in five towns. The Samajwadi Party was able to form the council at Jajpur municipality.        
	However, there has been a fragmented verdict at 17 places, where no party or alliance can form the council on its own. Independents are likely to play a decisive role in these places.        
	During the 2002 civic polls, BJD had formed the civic council at 40 places and BJP at 25 places either on their own strength or with each others support. The Congress had occupied 30 urban councils.        
	Workers and supporters of the two ruling parties celebrated their victory and exuded hope that the results would be repeated in the coming general elections.         
	The BJD has established its supremacy once again, said chief minister and BJD president Naveen Patnaik.        
	BJP state president Suresh Pujari was happy that his party had improved its tally.

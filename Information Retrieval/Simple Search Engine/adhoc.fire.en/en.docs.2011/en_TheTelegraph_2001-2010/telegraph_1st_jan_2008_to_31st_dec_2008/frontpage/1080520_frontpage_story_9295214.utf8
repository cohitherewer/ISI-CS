                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Grains crisis over stock cap
  - Traders not to import, call shutdown        ARUN KUMAR THAKUR                                                    
	Ranchi, May 19: The state is hurtling towards foodgrain crisis as dealers and traders have decided to stop importing stuff.        
	As Jharkhand depends heavily on foodgrain import, the decision would create a serious crisis, Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI) members said.        
	The Licensing Requirements, Stock Limits and Movement Restrictions on Specified Food Stuff Order, 2008, was notified on April 17. In protest, traders in Dhanbad and Bokaro districts have already stopped buying foodgrain and within a week the food situation in those districts turned out to be alarming. If the government does not respond positively then rest of the state will follow suit, said FJCCI president Manoj Naredi.        
	Naredi added: This act has been re-imposed after a decade or so. Even a small trader will now have to run around the supply offices for a licence, which would be required only for six months. This makes no sense at all.        
	The act has been imposed  a state government step  after the Union government took measures to control price of essential commodities.         
	Ninety per cent of the states foodgrain requirements come from Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.        
	In 1984, the upper limit for stocks was 1,000 quintals. Today, 24 years later and with a three-fold increase in population, the upper limits have been fixed at 250 quintals for rice and 500 quintals for lentils (dal). Because of the failure of public distribution system and confining this system only to below poverty line families, the pressure on foodgrain traders has increased more, Naredi said.        
	Former FJCCI president Arjun Jalan said: Limiting the stock to as low as 250 quintals makes no sense at all. In other states it is quite high at 2,000 quintals. Besides, how can we tolerate being inspected and harassed by officials responsible for the deplorable condition of the PDS?        
	The association has also decided to shut shops on May 28 across the state if the order on stock limit is not altered.        
	Citing an FIR filed under Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act against a small retail shop in Chouka in Chandil, a senior association member said: The government might want to stop hoarding, but the step would usher in exploitation of the food and civil supplies department inspectors.        
	Naredi said the federation had sent a memorandum to the chief minister. Food and civil supplies minister Kamlesh Singh said that the demand would be placed before the cabinet to discuss relaxation in the provisions.

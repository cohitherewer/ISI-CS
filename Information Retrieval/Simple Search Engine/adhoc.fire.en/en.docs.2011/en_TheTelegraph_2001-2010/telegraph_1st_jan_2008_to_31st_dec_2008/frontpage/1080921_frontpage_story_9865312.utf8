	New Delhi, Sept. 20: A single module of 13 school friends from Uttar Pradesh had carried out the Delhi, Ahmedabad and Jaipur blasts, police claimed a day after killing two of them and arresting two.        
	The second youth arrested was Zeeshan Ahmad, a student of the Indian Institute of Planning and Management who was writing a management exam when five of his alleged comrades were engaged in a gunfight with the police at their rented Jamianagar flat. He was picked up late at night in Jhandewala, west Delhi.        
	Zeeshan was one of the 12 classmates, seniors and juniors that group leader Mohammed Atif Amin, who was allegedly inspired by Osama bin Laden, had recruited from Azamgarh, joint commissioner Karnail Singh said.        
	His (Atifs) laptop was full of material of al Qaida and Osama bin Laden. It also had some photographs of Laden, Singh told the media.        
	Atif and Mohammed Sajid alias Pankaj died in the shootout, and Zeeshan and Mohammed Saif, the alleged militant held after the battle, have been sent to 14 days judicial custody. Junaid and Shahzad alias Pappu fled during the shootout, officers said.        
	The police today released the names of six of the seven others in the module: Shadab Bhai alias Malik, Sajid, Mohammed Khalid, Arif, Shakeel and Ziya Khan Salman.        
	Some police sources, however, said the names could be fake  Singh himself told reporters that all the verification papers Atif had given his landlord were fake. The sources also questioned the claim about there being just one module behind all the blasts.        
	Saif told us he planted the bomb in Greater Kailash along with Junaid at 5.45pm. He had also been (involved in) the blasts in the courts of Uttar Pradesh (in November 2007), JCP Singh said.        
	He had gone to Jaipur on May 12 with Atif to do a recce and returned to Delhi soon after the (May 13) blasts. Then eight of them moved to Ahmedabad. They returned to Delhi rented this house and planned the (Delhi) blasts.        
	Other police sources said Goa was to have been the modules next target.        
	Officers had yesterday said Atif was the leader of the non-Simi arm of the Indian Mujahideen, with Safdar Nagori and Tauqeer alias Abdul Subhan Qureshi leading its Simi arm. Singh today said the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hizb-ul Mujahideen had brought the two arms together.

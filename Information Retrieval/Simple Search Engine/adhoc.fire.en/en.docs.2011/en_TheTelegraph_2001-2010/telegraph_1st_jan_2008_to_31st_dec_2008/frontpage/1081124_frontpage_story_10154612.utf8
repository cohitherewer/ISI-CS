                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Rs 5000 laptop soon: Murthy
          AMIT ROY                         Narayana Murthy in London on Saturday. Telegraph picture                                  
	London, Nov. 23: The Rs 5,000 laptop will soon be available in India, N.R. Narayana Murthy, founder of Infosys and one of the gurus of the IT industry, has told The Telegraph in an exclusive interview in London.        
	Murthy, who had come to address the UK chapter of TiE (The Indus Entrepreneurs) at the London offices of KPMG, one of the networking organisations principal sponsors, emphasised that despite the global economic downturn, the Indian IT industry and Infosys, in particular, would press on with cutting-edge research.        
	Murthy, who was one of seven persons who founded Infosys in 1981 by borrowing $250, stepped down in 2002 after 21 years as the behemoths CEO and is now its non-executive chairman and chief mentor.         
	The days when the laptop will be pretty cheap are not far off, Murthy said. Nicholas Negroponte, professor at MIT, has already introduced a $100 laptop at his media lab.        
	What would this mean in Indian terms?        
	Rs 5,000.        
	When?        
	Right now, it is not available (but) it will soon be available. Give it a year or so.        
	Now that the government has licensed 3G, the availability of mobile broadband would make it possible to run routine applications on laptops. You can watch live TV and listen to radio.        
	Waving his own mobile phone, Murthy provided an insight into where India was going. The focus will become even more pronounced on embedded systems  in small appliances like this (and) our telephones, radios, TVs, DVD players, white goods.        
	He went on: Thanks to miniaturisation, broadband, wireless, the reducing cost of computing and communication, virtualisation, you will see a coming together of both corporate applications and personal applications. So far, we have kept the two apart except email  BlackBerry is a good example of combining the corporate applications with the personal.        
	Again indicating his mobile, he continued: Tomorrow, what will happen is, I can use this to take a lot of my corporate decisions  I can download a lot of data on this; I can do lots of analysis; at the same time, I can connect with my son or daughter; I can hold a videoconference with them; I can connect via Internet and find out how my child at home is doing or I can start my TV recording at home, saying, now start this at this time, or I can enable the security at my home. That is where the future is. It can be called convergence or ubiquitous computing.        
	Later last night, at a packed TiE meeting in the spacious Atrium of KPMGs glass mini-palace just off Fleet Street, Murthy, whose company now has an annual revenue of $4 billion (Rs 20,000 crore), said: The only way society can solve the problem of poverty is through entrepreneurship because entrepreneurs create jobs, entrepreneurs create wealth.        
	Under gentle probing from Nish Kotecha, president of TiE UK, Murthy also revealed something about himself as a man.         
	Favourite food? I am a south Indian  clearly, south Indian food.         
	Favourite book? I read physics and mathematics primarily for my relaxation.         
	Favourite gadget? I have the latest iPod, the latest mobile phone, the latest MP4 player, MP3 player.        
	Favourite holiday? I dont go on holiday at all. On an average, I am travelling 20-22 days a month outside India, and the remaining seven-eight days in India I am very busy from morning to night. For me, the best way of relaxing is to sit at home and read a book.        
	Favourite city? I enjoy Paris the best.        
	Abiding memory as a boy? I got the fourth rank in my school finals. I went to my father and his only reaction was, what happened to the other three ranks, young man? Now I appreciate what he meant.         
	Did he have an arranged marriage? No, I knew my wife (an engineer by the name of Sudha Kulkarni) for three-and-a-half years before we got married. We had a wonderful time. We used to spend almost every evening together. But she had to be back in her hostel by 9pm. That was a great bottleneck. We used to go to a Chinese restaurant in Pune where for something like Rs 8, we both could eat well.         
	Did he have any girlfriends before his wife and does he still meet them?        
	(After a long pause) No, I didnt have any girlfriends.

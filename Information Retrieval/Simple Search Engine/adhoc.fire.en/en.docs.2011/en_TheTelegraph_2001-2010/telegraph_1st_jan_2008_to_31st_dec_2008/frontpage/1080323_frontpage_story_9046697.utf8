The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Plan to hike retirement age
                                                                                                           Plan to hike retirement age
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, March 22: The Union heavy industries ministry is drawing up a restructuring plan for HEC and has proposed increasing the retirement age for below-the-board employees 60.         
	In 1998, the then NDA government headed by Atal Behari Vajpayee had issued directions empowering the boards of PSUs to raise the retirement age of their employees from 58 to 60 years.        
	As the order was more of an advisory, most profit making PSUs, particularly in the oil, coal and steel sectors, promptly hiked the retirement age of all employees.        
	At HEC, the retirement age for board-level employees was raised from 58 to 60 but related benefits were not allowed.         
	The benefits were not allowed as the corporation was incurring heavy losses. HEC was put under the category of sick industries by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction.        
	Referring to the proposal to hike the retirement age, Union heavy industries secretary Satyanarayan Das said HEC is now making a complete turnaround. With this change, the ministry has initiated a complete capital restructuring of the corporation, he said during his maiden visit to HEC. The restructuring plan also has a proposal of increasing the retirement of below the board employees from 58 to 60.        
	HEC is now poised to record a net profit of at least Rs 5 crore in 2007-08. The corporation has surpassed the turnover target of Rs 360 crore, which was fixed by the Centre for the current fiscal. By March 31, actual turnover is expected to cross Rs 450 crore. HEC is on the brink of achieving a production target of Rs 1000 crore for 2008-09, Das said.        
	Under the circumstances, it was necessary to preserve HECs trained manpower for at least two more years so that employee expertise could be harnessed to help the company grow further, the Union secretary said.         
	At the same time, Das pointed out, fresh appointments would be made at entry levels to groom young minds and shape the future of HEC.

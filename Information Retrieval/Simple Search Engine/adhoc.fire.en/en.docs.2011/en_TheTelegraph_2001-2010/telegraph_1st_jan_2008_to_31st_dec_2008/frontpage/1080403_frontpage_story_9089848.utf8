The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Foreign rivals eat into   JNU pie
                                                                                                           Foreign rivals eat into   JNU pie
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, April 2: The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) has decided to stop holding entrance examinations in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, four years after the move was introduced to save students the hassle of travelling to India for the test.         
	A sharp decline in the number of applications from the two countries and other South Asian and Southeast Asian countries is behind the decision, officials said.         
	Over a hundred applicants who may have found it cheaper to travel either to Colombo or Dhaka for the entrance test will now have to come to India or Kathmandu in Nepal for the May examination.         
	According to the University Grants Commissions figures, foreign students form a larger fraction of the student population at JNU than at any other central university in India.        
	JNU had opened examination centres in Kathmandu, Colombo and Dhaka  its only test venues outside India  in 2004, to meet the demands of a growing number of aspirants from Saarc countries. Kathmandu will continue to hold the examination.         
	We have decided to stop holding our entrance test in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The decision was taken because of a drop in demand from these two countries, JNU vice-chancellor B.B. Bhattacharya said.        
	Foreign students, however, expressed dismay. If the number of students from Sri Lanka is decreasing, the answer is to offer more incentives to attract them, Rajalakshmi Weeraratne, a student from Kandy, Sri Lanka, said.        
	The officials explained the drop in demand as an indicator that higher education institutes in neighbouring countries were catching up with the standards maintained by Indian universities.         
	JNU is still one of the best universities in India. But others in the region are catching up, Bhattacharya said.         
	Officials also expressed the fear that China may be eating into Indias traditional dominance in higher education over neighbouring countries. But they admitted the absence of statistics confirming such a trend.         
	Informally, when we enquired with the Sri Lankan and Bangladesh high commissions here, we were told other countries in the region were attracting students. The only country that can possibly fit the bill is China, a source said.

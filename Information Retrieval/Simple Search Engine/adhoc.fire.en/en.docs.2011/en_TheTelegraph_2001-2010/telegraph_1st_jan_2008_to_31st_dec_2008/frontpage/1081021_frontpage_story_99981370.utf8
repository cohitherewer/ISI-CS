(AFP)                                        
	Mohali, Oct 21 (PTI): India relied on a stunning all-round display to record their biggest-ever Test victory by runs as they thrashed Australia by 320 runs with more than two sessions to spare in the second cricket Test and take a 1-0 lead in the four-match series here today.  
	With Zaheer breathing fire by claiming three quick wickets, India took just one-and-half hours and 18.4 overs overs to complete the formality against the Australians who were thoroughly outplayed in all departments of the game.  
	Australia needed well nigh a miracle to chase down the monumental 516-run target for an improbable win and with the top order blown away cheaply, their pursuit looked doomed right at the outset.  
	It was too much to expect the lower middle order batsmen and tail-enders to do what their front-line willow-wielders could not and Australia eventually folded for 195.
  Zaheer's triple strikes in the first hour maimed Australia and since then, their collapse was just a matter of time and formality, which was completed in due course.  
	This was India's biggest win against the Aussies, eclipsing the 222-run victory that came in Melbourne in 1977.  
	Michael Clarke (69) was the only face of Australian resistance in the face of some inspiring Indian bowling. But his knock didn't go beyond boosting his personal tally. Clarke's 152-ball knock included nine hits to the fence.  
	Sachin Tendulkar, who broke Brian Lara's record to become the highest run-getter in Test cricket and Sourav Ganguly, the fourth Indian batsman to cross the 7000-run mark, was felicitated here today during the prize distribution ceremony.  
	Punjab Governor General (retd) SF Rodrigues presented a trophy to Tendulkar while BCCI Secretary N Srinivasan handed another trophy to Ganguly after India won the second Test by 320 runs at the PCA ground.    
	Out of eight Tests played by India on this ground, the hosts have tasted success thrice. Tendulkar also became the only Indian player to have played in all the eight Test matches here.

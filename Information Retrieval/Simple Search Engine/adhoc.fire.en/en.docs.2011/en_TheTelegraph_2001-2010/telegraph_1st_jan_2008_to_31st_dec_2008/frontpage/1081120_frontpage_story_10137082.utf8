The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Flat prices fall off eight-year perch
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Flat prices fall off eight-year perch
          SAMBIT SAHA                                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 19: Real estate prices have come down in most zones in Calcutta after eight years of an uninterrupted rise.        
	Residential rates have slipped by 10-15 per cent in many areas. Rajarhat is among the worst hit with the prices diving by 20 per cent.        
	The slump is an upshot of the general sense of gloom in the wake of the global financial crisis and fears of a possible economic downturn.        
	The fallout has become more pronounced in real estate because prospective buyers have started postponing purchases in the hope of a further slide in prices.         
	The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) appealed to its 3,500-plus members to reduce residential prices, a day after the finance minister nudged the industry to do so.        
	In Calcutta  as in many other parts of the country  developers are not only deferring the launch of projects but also reworking the size of flats to make them more affordable to buyers.        
	A big project in Rajarhat, being developed by a troubled Delhi-based real estate firm, has postponed the handover by a year.        
	I do not see any pick-up immediately. Next year will be flat. In some areas, like Rajarhat, prices may come down by another 10 per cent, said Jitendra Khaitan, the director of Pioneer Property Management. Pioneer is a real estate marketing firm in the city working with developers like Unitech, DLF and Keppel.        
	Rajarhat is among the hardest hit as it is an investors market  buyers hope to make a killing when prices go up, rather than live in the flats.        
	Investors who were most active in Rajarhat projects have either stopped buying or cancelled bookings.         
	Those who bought at a lower price when a project was at a nascent stage are cashing out. The early birds are selling flats at a price higher than the rate at which they sealed the deal but lower than that offered by the developer now.        
	There is also reluctance from actual buyers (those who buy for residential purposes), anticipating a further reduction in prices, said Kumar Shankar Bagchi, the managing director of Bengal Peerless, a joint sector housing company.        
	As a result, sales have halved. Pioneer was selling 175 units a month but the number came down to 75 to 80 in October. The trend has persisted this month, too.        
	Some developers, who were refusing to cut prices in the fear that it will trigger a bottomless crash, have started to relent. In other cases, the impact of the resale prices is being felt on the ground.         
	In areas like Alipore and Ballygunge Circular Road, prices that had rocketed to Rs 14,000-15,000 a sqft a month ago have dipped to Rs 9,000-11,000.         
	A section of developers is trying to tailor the flats to the size of the buyers shrunken pocket. Bagchi said he would reduce the size of the flat to make it more affordable.         
	In our existing project at Rajarhat, we are selling flats at Rs 42-85 lakh in the high-income category. Sales are slow now. Going forward, I will think 10 times before building any flat over Rs 30 lakh, Bagchi said.        
	Some are pinning hopes on the possibility of banks cutting interest rates. If interest rates go down by another 2 per cent, demand will pick up, said Abhijit Das, the managing director (Calcutta) of property consultancy Jones Lang Lasalle Meghraj.

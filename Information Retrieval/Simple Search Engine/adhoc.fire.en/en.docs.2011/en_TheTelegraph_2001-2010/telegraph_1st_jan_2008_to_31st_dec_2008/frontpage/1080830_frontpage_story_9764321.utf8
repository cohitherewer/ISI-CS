   Fresh bid after CMs all-issue draft hits wall          OUR BUREAU                            Singur youths employed at the Tata Motors plant protest against the siege on Friday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 29: Mediators in different parts of the country have begun what appears to be a last-ditch attempt to rescue the Singur small-car project.        
	The frenetic drive came against the backdrop of inactivity at the Singur plant that declared a forced holiday after a day of blockade and intimidation by supporters of Mamata Banerjees siege.        
	Our workers have not come to work today, a Tata Motors spokesperson said.        
	Sources said the Tatas were assessing the situation and officials were worried. Asked whether the project would be relocated, a source said: Fifty-fifty.        
	The final decision is expected after Ratan Tata, who is now in Singapore, returns to India by the weekend.        
	The latest peace initiative, which involves interlocutors in Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai, seeks to persuade the government and the Tatas to agree to locating outside the main complex some ancillary units that have not been set up yet. But Trinamul sources said they havent yet got any indication from the government that ancillaries would be shifted.        
	Higher compensation could also be offered. The government is working on a package for future land acquisitions, too.        
	An official in the chief ministers secretariat said tonight that another letter might be sent to the Trinamul leader.        
	Mamata sought to distance herself from Thursdays strong-arm tactics that seem to have pushed the fate of the project to the brink, saying people associated with an NGO had appealed to some workers not to report for work. The NGO chief said she would continue to sing songs in front of the factory gates if the workers turned up for work again.        
	Abused and heckled, few workers are expected to return in a hurry. Some siege supporters had camped outside the gates from early morning to block the workers. Around 11am, most of them returned to their respective camps, having learnt that the management had asked the employees not to turn up.        
	The fresh round of back-channel mediations followed the collapse on Thursday of an unpublicised initiative to get Mamata to agree to have a dialogue with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on the assurance that the stage would be set after accommodating her concerns.        
	We renew the appeal for a peaceful settlement of the Singur imbroglio by way of a meeting with you. In the course of the meeting (between the chief minister and Mamata), all the issues that you have raised will be fully discussed, said a draft letter from the government side that reached Mamata on Thursday afternoon.        
	She was then seated on the dais at Singur, surrounded by leaders and workers of her party and its allies. Initially, Mamata, who is said to be amenable to a negotiated settlement and looking for some breathing space, was keen on interpreting the draft in a positive light.        
	But Mamata allowed herself to be influenced by those around her  several belonging to fringe groups  who began to punch holes in the draft, Trinamul sources said. The allies pointed to the absence of the key phrase they were looking for: 400 acres.        
	The government responded quickly, asking Mamata to insert all the issues raised by her so that both sides can discuss them. However, by then, Mamata had slipped back into the familiar aggressive mode.

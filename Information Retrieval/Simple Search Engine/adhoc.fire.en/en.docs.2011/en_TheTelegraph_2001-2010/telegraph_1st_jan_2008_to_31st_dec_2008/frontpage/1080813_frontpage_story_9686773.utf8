	At least 14 people died on Tuesday in police firing in Kashmir. Muzaffar Raina, The Telegraphs special correspondent in Srinagar, answers questions the rolling protests have thrown up.              
	 The number of protesters is running into thousands and, in some cases, over a lakh. Is this unusual?        
	Yes. The turnout has taken everybody, including the separatists, by surprise. The separatists are cashing in on the anger on the street but their earlier attempts to do so over fake encounters and a sex racket targeting minors did not evoke a similar response.        
	The ongoing agitation has run for weeks on its own and, on several occasions, there were shutdowns with nobody giving a call.        
	What is at the root of this spontaneity? Wasnt normalisation supposed to be setting in?        
	Normalisation is a word not many would like to use here. No doubt violence has declined sharply over the years. Five factors were behind this: counter-insurgency operations, massive inflow of central funds for development and job creation, plummeting support to militancy from across the border, absence of strong leadership and fatigue after 20 years of continuous struggle.        
	But an undercurrent of discontent was always there. Interference in daily life by security forces, human rights violations or occupation of more and more land are some factors that kept the discontent alive.         
	Statistics, too, are tilted against normalisation. Only three persons have died in Jammu  against the 28 so far in Kashmir  in police firing during the Amarnath agitation.        
	Although the agitation started over Amarnath land, the pro-freedom sentiment is overshadowing everything else now.        
	Are the protesters young?        
	Most look young, in their teens or early twenties, born either after the height of militancy or just a few years before it. There is a feeling the agitation has baptised them into the separatist cause.         
	How many security forces are deployed?        
	Five lakh soldiers and paramilitary jawans are on call. Plus over a lakh police personnel. Srinagar city alone has over 40,000 people in uniform and over a lakh on security-related assignments.        
	How do the streetfights break out?        
	Copycat strikes resembling Palestine clashes. Most skirmishes take place in localities with an array of lanes and bylanes. Blocked and chased, the protesters throw missiles and melt into the labyrinth.        
	Srinagars old city is made for such cat-and-mouse games, its numerous houses appearing as if they are woven together. Efforts had been made to widen the roads, apparently to shift people to the outskirts and remove a source of dissent.         
	A key difference with West Asia is the choice of weapons: Kashmiris use stones, not petrol bombs.              
	*Are all protesters fruit growers who are hit by the alleged blockade?        
	Of the population of around six million in Kashmir, around a third are associated directly or indirectly with the industry. Many others, including traders or other ordinary people, have rallied behind the growers. The separatists, who have returned to centre-stage, have so far successfully channelled the discontent.               
	*How long will the Amarnath season last? Will the protests die down after that?         
	The two-month yatra will be over on August 16. The killings have changed the complexion of the protests. Unless some steps are taken to convince Kashmiris that they are not under siege, the protests could drag on.        
	*Are there any tourists left in Kashmir ?         
	Some 5.5 lakh have so far visited Kashmir this year, about twice the number in the same period last year. Few are coming now but July and August are off-season months. The next season begins in September but many fear tourist arrivals will be hit, although no visitor or pilgrim has been attacked during the current agitation.

	Mumbai, Oct. 6: Actor Shakti Kapoors son Siddhant and the daughter of Aditya Panscholi and Zarina Wahab, Sana, were picked up with about 240 others from a nightclub early this morning on the charge of possessing or taking drugs.        
	Siddhant is a DJ at the nightclub and discotheque, Bombay 72 Degree East, owned by another Bollywood personality, film-maker Prakash Mehra. Mehra, suffering from a host of ailments and confined to home, could not be reached.        
	Among those held are eight alleged peddlers, one of them a woman and another an Israeli citizen. About 100 Ecstasy and LSD tablets, charas and other drugs were seized, police said.        
	Officers said a rave party was being held at the nightclub in honour of an Israeli DJ, who calls himself Technodrome. The 26-year-old, whose real name is Shay Ben Haiun, was allegedly caught with cocaine on his person.        
	The families and friends of the detained youngsters, mostly call-centre employees, said the party was organised by a group called Scratch Entertainment. The invites had been sent out to select people through social networking website Facebook.        
	Drugs were being peddled and used freely at the party. Many people were found with drugs on their person. Some others were high, said V.N. Patil, deputy commissioner of police, anti-narcotics cell, Mumbai.        
	All of them have been sent to city hospitals for routine urine and blood tests to check for narcotic content. Cases will be registered after that.

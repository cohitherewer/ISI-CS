	London, Dec. 14: Prime Minister Gordon Brown has given some indication of how the 6 million (44 crore Indian rupees) Britain is giving to finance a new UK-Pakistan pact against terror will be used, though details have yet to be worked out.        
	Speaking in Islamabad, he offered British support in bomb disposal and airport security, and the programme to tackle the causes of radicalisation through education and to strengthen the democratic institutions of Pakistan.        
	Through these measures, Brown explained, we hope to do more to break the chain of terror that links the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan to the streets of the UK and other countries around the world.        
	Since taking over from Tony Blair last year, Brown has had a number of briefings from UK security authorities who have convinced him that Pakistan is now the centre of world terror, a concept adopted by the British media too.         
	Of equal concern is the use of Pakistan by a growing number of young UK-born-and-bred Pakistanis  more accurately, Britons of Pakistani origin  for training, indoctrination and logistical support before attempted operations on British soil.        
	For example, the suicide bombings in London in July 2005 were linked to Pakistan. There have been several other cases since, including a plot to blow up several transatlantic planes simultaneously.         
	So when India said the Mumbai attackers were from Pakistan, it fitted in with what Brown was being told by Scotland Yard.         
	The British Prime Minister was unusually blunt today at his news conference in Islamabad.        
	I told President (Asif Ali) Zardari that three-quarters of the most serious terrorist plots investigated by the British authorities have links to al Qaida in Pakistan, he said.         
	Browns language was far from diplomatic when he declared: The time has come for action and not words and I want to help Pakistan and other countries to root out terrorism.        
	In return for Islamabads co-operation, Brown said, Britain will continue to expand its counter-terrorism assistance programme with Pakistan.         
	It will be more than ever the most comprehensive anti-terrorist programme Britain has signed with any country, he added.        
	We will act specifically to develop Pakistani bomb-disposal capability, to provide scanning equipment, particularly to help detect car bombs, to act in concert to improve Pakistani airport security  (and) to help with legislation, where necessary, against terrorism, to strengthen information-sharing between our police forces, including on forensics and on crisis response he said.        
	I can also announce we will develop a 6-million programme to tackle the causes of radicalisation and to strengthen the democratic institutions of Pakistan.         
	Brown said the reason he was emphasising the help Britain was offering Pakistan was we have been able to talk in detail about a number of areas where the Pakistan government would appreciate specific help immediately so that they could step up its counter-terrorism capacity.        
	That is why, he added, there is a comprehensive list of things that we are prepared to support financially to make sure that the global problem of terrorism can be attacked from Pakistan.         
	It was Browns way of saying that Britain considered Pakistan the centre of world terror.        
	He believes that an effort should be made to reach out to the young  he doesnt have much of a choice because British Pakistanis have right of abode in Britain and cannot be expelled.         
	There is educational material, there is information material and there is the possibility of dialogue particularly with young people, Brown said.        
	Let me just emphasise why we in Britain have an interest in making Pakistan more secure, Brown said, anticipating questions on the 6-million programme.        
	People in Britain know that what can happen in the mountains of Afghanistan and Pakistan can affect directly what happens in the streets of our cities and towns, what can happen in Afghanistan and Pakistan can end up with people in Britain.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                            Court Sheath                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: The Supreme Court today stayed a Madras High Court order that told condom-makers to keep their packaging and advertisements free of lurid pictures in the name of Indian culture.        
	The high courts August 24 order had also asked the Advertising Standards Council of India to lay down norms for condom ads and packaging.        
	Unless the council certifies that the standards of advertising in packages of condoms marketed are compatible with the constitutional norms of preserving our cultural heritage and prevailing laws private manufacturers cannot market their products indiscriminately or dilute the composite heritage of our culture, the high court said.        
	The order, which also applies to state-owned Hindustan Latex, the maker of Moods condoms, came on a petition by Madurai-based businessman C. Ravikumar.        
	According to Ravikumar, he had noticed during a trip to Thailand that Durex condom packages there carried no obscene pictures, and there was no reason why Indian condom packages should.        
	He said Indian condom-makers give publicity by printing obscene sexual pictures on their packages and sexy publicity in the media.        
	He made a representation to the Centre, the Tamil Nadu government and the Madurai district collector and, when they did not respond, approached the high court.        
	The Centre sought a stay on the technical ground that the high court had wrongly described the advertising standards council as a government-controlled body.        
	The apex court stayed the order and issued notices to all sides.        
	Among the condom-makers who are party to the case are J.K. Ansell, which makes Kamasutra condoms, TTK-LIG Limited (Kohinoor condoms) and Pashupati Seohung Limited (Pleasure condoms).        
	The high court had asked these companies and Hindustan Latex to get their packaging cleared by the council before they released their brand for sale. It had also asked the censor board to ensure that lurid condom ad films were not released.

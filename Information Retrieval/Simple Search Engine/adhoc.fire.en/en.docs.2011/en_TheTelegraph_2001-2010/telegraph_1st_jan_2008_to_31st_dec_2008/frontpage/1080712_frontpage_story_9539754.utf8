The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Age row points to teacher crunch
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Age row points to teacher crunch
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                             Mission hurdle                                  
	New Delhi, July 11: The National Council for Educational Research and Training may lose a fifth of its faculty to potentially crippling retirements by 2009 at a time it is expected to help implement Indias pledge to universalise secondary education.         
	Forty-one senior faculty posts are likely to be vacant next year, unless the Centre raises the retirement age at the council from 62 to 65, its officials have warned.         
	The Centre has decided to rethink an earlier decision allowing a retirement age hike at NCERT, sparking fears that the countrys apex curriculum-drafting agency may be left bereft of many of its most experienced minds.         
	Sixteen faculty members retired in 2007-08 and another 25, mostly from its headquarters in New Delhi, are to follow suit this year, statistics obtained from the NCERT show.         
	The council has around 600 members of the teaching staff spread across Delhi and four regional centres, but only 200 seniors hold the posts of reader or professor.         
	Minutes of meetings between the NCERT and the human resource development ministry  copies of which are available with The Telegraph  over the past year indicate the Centres approval for the superannuation age hike.         
	At the August 2007 meeting of the NCERTs constituent board, and subsequently in a letter to the council, the ministry had stated that the council could decide for itself whether it wanted to implement the age hike.         
	The assurance had come in response to pleas from the NCERT that it be allowed to raise its superannuation age in keeping with a March 30, 2007, notification on the hike that specifically mentioned higher education institutions.         
	Although the NCERT is primarily engaged in developing school curricula, its faculty have always been selected and paid according to University Grants Commission guidelines. The council has also benefited from the hike in superannuation age  first from 58 to 60 and then from 60 to 62  along with universities, documents show.         
	But the NCERT did not implement the hike after the August meeting, and the Centre has now decided to review its decision, sources at the council and the ministry said.         
	The superannuation age hike issue came up again when the NCERT sought OBC quotas for its teacher training courses. We have told them to implement the quotas, but are rethinking the age raise matter, a source said, adding that the ministry was in-principle not opposed to the hike.        
	The finance ministry last week cleared a massive scheme to universalise secondary education, ministry sources said. The NCERT is likely to draft the curriculum for schools implementing the scheme.

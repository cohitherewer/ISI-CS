          JAYANTH JACOB                                      
	New Delhi, May 5: Big brother CPM is also the poor little brother. Its no match for the CPI when it comes to collecting donations.        
	So the Election Commissions data, based on party declarations, show.        
	Surprise II: the CPMs six big donors are all from Andhra and none from Left-ruled Bengal, Kerala or Tripura.        
	And Surprise III: the partys total earnings from Rs 20,000-plus donations  those are the ones the EC lists  was just Rs 2 lakh in 2003-2004, that is, the financial year before the last general election.        
	The CPI totted Rs 725,148. A.B. Bardhan played a captains knock to thrash Prakash Karats party, contributing Rs 2.9 lakh by himself. This came, of course, not from his own bank account. This was money he raised for the party from smaller contributors.        
	Theres no Surprise IV, though. The Left twins didnt fight the May 2004 polls with a combined kitty of Rs 9.25 lakh. The EC document merely shows the regular yearly donations above Rs 20,000 and does not reflect the campaign fund-raising.        
	The communist parties also raise huge sums through small and large contributions by every member  from the party MP to the foot soldier.         
	Bardhan figures thrice on the CPI list of 18, with entries of Rs 2.2 lakh, Rs 50,000 and Rs 20,000. Party leaders Atul Kumar Anjan (Rs 96,408), Amarjit Kaur (Rs 73,740) and D. Raja (Rs 50,000) follow him.        
	On the CPM list, five donors are from Hyderabad. Mohamood Ali of Maheswari Complex and Orient Longman forked out Rs 50,000 each. Venkat Reddy of Ranga Reddy district gave Rs 40,000, and Rs 20,000 each came from realtors Pragathi Homes, Sanghamitra School in Nizampet X Road, and VVS Pharmaceuticals.

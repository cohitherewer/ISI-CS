          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                        Singh and Karat	(below)			                                             
	New Delhi, June 20: The economy is diagnosed with a double-digit affliction and the chief executive is laid low by a viral infection, the maladies striking together in the middle of a political crisis.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh neither ventured out of his home nor did he meet anyone today, fuelling feverish speculation on a day it was announced that the country had slipped back to 11.05 per cent inflation after 13 years and a stunned Congress appeared having second thoughts on pressing ahead with the nuclear deal at the cost of early elections.        
	Such was the swirl of rumours in the capital that the Congress formally dismissed as baseless speculation suggestions that the Prime Minister had resigned.        
	Singh went into a shell after Pranab Mukherjee, the governments point man on the deal, told him last night that the Left had refused to budge, insiders said.         
	The sources would not say if this was because of a viral infection he had caught on Thursday afternoon. But those claiming to know the workaholic Prime Minister well said he has in the past chaired meetings and met callers even when he was ill.         
	Today, all his engagements were cancelled and he refused to meet anybody. The weekly cabinet meeting on Thursday had also been called off.        
	If the allies lukewarm response to early polls  despite their support to the nuclear deal  had sowed seeds of doubt in the Congress last night, the inflation rate announced today sent a shiver down the partys spine.         
	A coincidence: the last time inflation was above 11 per cent, Singh was the finance minister, and the then Congress-led government, like this time, was preparing for general elections which it lost. However, at 11.11 per cent on that May 6, 1995, Singh had actually brought the inflation down  it had vaulted to 17 per cent in March that year.        
	Price rise, the factional showdown at Sonia Gandhis rally (in Mumbai) and the Karnataka defeat dont add up to anything positive. The deal is not going to mitigate the negatives, not by a long shot, a pro-deal general secretary said today.        
	For the Congress  which heads into a crucial phase of state elections in October and general elections thereafter  it has become imperative to temper inflation and head off voter angst. The Opposition BJP said it would make rising prices a key poll issue in the Assembly elections.        
	The Congress general secretary said a resolution on the nuclear deal would not be that simple: the party might have to pick between Singh, Sonias first and only choice as Prime Minister, and continuing in power.         
	Sources said Singh had told the Congress chief on Tuesday that he would not back off from the deal under any circumstances.        
	The Left was unmoved by the rumours that the Prime Minister had resigned. Mukherjee held a series of meetings with Left leaders to convince them of the need to go to the IAEA, but made no progress.        
	 Sources said CPM general secretary Prakash Karat reminded Mukherjee that it was agreed in November last that the government would not proceed without taking the committees findings into account.         
	Mukherjee told a TV channel in the evening: All I can say is there is no deterioration, no improvement, only standstill.         
	The external affairs minister has delayed his departure to Australia tomorrow  he was to leave in the morning but will now go at night.        
	Sources said it was a tougher call for Sonia this time than last year when the UPA first faced the deal-or-government question. The time to clinch the deal was longer and Singh then seemed more amenable to a compromise.        
	Congress sources said they trusted their presidents political judgement over everybody elses. We are sure she will persuade the Prime Minister to understand how important it is for the secular forces to stick together, a general secretary said.        
	Singh had bigger challenges, he said, such as containing inflation and making more big-ticket announcements for the aam aadmi.         
	That a climbdown on the nuclear deal was an option also came through. There is no loss of face for anyone. If the deal is in national interest, the survival of the government is also in national interest, Union minister Shakeel Ahmed said.

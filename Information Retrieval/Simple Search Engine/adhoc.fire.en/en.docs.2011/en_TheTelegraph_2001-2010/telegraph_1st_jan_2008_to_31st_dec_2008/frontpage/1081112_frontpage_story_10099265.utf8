The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | First flight of   a former cricketer
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   First flight of   a former cricketer
  - Salute begins from tarmac          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                          
	Nagpur/Flight 6E 403/Calcutta: As the Airbus A320 took off, on the dot at 5.20pm on Tuesday, Sourav Ganguly gave Nagpur, the city which gave him such a rousing send-off, one last look.        
	Sitting on 1B, flanked by Dona and Sana, Sourav turned towards the window for a minute or so before closing his eyes.        
	Sourav remained that way for around 30 minutes, till Sana, who wasnt able to open a cola can, woke him up. For the next hour, Sourav chatted with friends from the media, some of whom had been part of his 12-plus years journey as an iconic Test cricketer.        
	In between, there were requests from co-passengers (and the all-women cabin crew) for autographs. One gentleman, mumbling something, took as many as three.        
	It wouldve made the season for him.        
	Earlier, at Nagpur airport, there was mild commotion once word got around that Sourav had arrived to board his first flight as a former India cricketer. Doesnt sound odd... I am a former cricketer now, Sourav said.        
	A very special one, though, going by what teammates wrote on a T-shirt when it was taken around by Dona during Mondays dinner in his and Anil Kumbles honour.        
	Sachin Tendulkars was the most emotional message, but pretty touching was the one from Rahul Dravid  It was a great journey with you, buddy.        
	Rahul and Souravs Test careers, it may be recalled, began in the same match (Lords, 1996).        
	Back to Nagpur airport        
	Additional personnel had to be called to maintain order and, when Sourav was clearing the security check, the CISFs H.S. Thakur shook hands. His smile suggested even a promotion probably wouldnt have made him happier.        
	As for the relaxed Sourav, he tried to play a prank, wanting to pocket a friends BlackBerry from the x-ray tray. He ought to have been a shade quicker, for the owner pipped him by the proverbial whisker.         
	It wasnt a guard of honour, like the one given by teammates on Monday morning, but the private carriers staff gathered on the tarmac and applauded Sourav as he got off the bus to board the aircraft.        
	He was moved.        
	Once inside, Sourav was greeted by first officer Gur Kamaljit Singh. Hes been one of my favourites and I couldnt have sat in the cockpit without wishing him. Its sad that Souravs retired, but its a decision which has to be respected. Only he couldve known when to leave, Singh told The Telegraph.        
	The Airbus touched down in Calcutta on schedule (6.50pm) and Sourav was overheard saying home is always home.         
	Dona and Sana deplaned first and, when Sourav stepped on the tarmac, he was greeted by minister Asok Bhattacharya and elder brother Snehashish.        
	For security reasons, Sourav and family drove home from the tarmac. That dozens of security personnel and airline staff, whod been keeping fingers crossed in the arrivals terminal, were disappointed, would be an understatement.        
	Footnote: Sourav will, within days, start his innings as a columnist. Hes been signed up by Sunil Gavaskars Professional Management Group for articles during the soon-to-begin ODIs and Tests against England.

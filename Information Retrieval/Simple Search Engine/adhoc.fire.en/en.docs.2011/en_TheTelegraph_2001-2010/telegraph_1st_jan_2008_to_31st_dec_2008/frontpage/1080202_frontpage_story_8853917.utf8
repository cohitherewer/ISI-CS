	London, Feb. 1: The main Indian arts centre in Britain, Watermans in Brentford, west London, may have to close because its funding is being cut off, it was announced today. 
    
	The Arts Council of England has told The Telegraph that it is stopping its annual subsidy of nearly 500,000 to Watermans from the end of March because it is unhappy with the venues performance. 
    
	Watermans is one of several organisations whose funding is being cut off by the Arts Council which has conducted a radical  and savage  review of its annual spending. 
    
	This is a huge blow to Asians, especially Indians, for whom Watermans is the major arts centre in the country. 
    
	Watermans will challenge the decision and take the Arts Council to court, a spokesperson for the venue said. 
    
	The organisation was given prior warning about the decision and time to lodge an appeal, which has now been rejected. 
    
	If Watermans has to close  and it is hard to see how the venue can struggle on indefinitely without official funding  it will mean art and theatre groups in India will find it that much more difficult to find a home for their performances in the UK. 
    
	The Watermans spokesperson pointed out: Bollywood stars Shabana Azmi and Farooque Sheikh held the international premiere of their two-hander Tumhari Amrita here in 1993. Anupam and Kirron Kher also did their show, Saalgirah, here  both were directed by Feroz Khan. 
    
	She recalled: Neelam Man Singh Chowdhurys The Company, based in Chandigarh, performed a Punjabi version of Lorcas Yerma in 1995. Prime-time productions showcased here have been Dance Like A Man in 2003, Womanly Voices in 2005 and Partap Sharmas Sammy! A word that broke an Empire last year. Alyque Padamsee did a workshop here  with British Asian actors  of his play Begum Sumroo, also written by Partap Sharma. 
    
	Watermans, which is on the Thames, staged a version of Macbeth, brought from Manipur, which featured candlelit boats. 
    
	The Arts Council has said its proposal not to renew funding should not have come as a shock to the management of Watermans, which it has supported for over 15 years. 
    
	Over a period of time it had advised Watermans that it was unhappy with its artistic performance, poor audiences (which it claims was often less than 50 per cent) and failure to raise extra funding. It felt taxpayers money could be used better elsewhere and had decided not to throw good money after bad any longer. 
    
	Against this is the view from Watermans that over 100,000 local people use Watermans every year; local people who come to the cinema and childrens theatre will be losers; it will no longer be able to provide the same services to the West London Mental Health Trust; it has run the largest club for people with learning disabilities in Europe; and that this will rip the heart out of the plan to regenerate Brentford Town Centre. The whole of West London will lose out. Watermans has been the beacon in West London for most of the Greater London Assemblys cultural programmes from Open Rehearsal through India Now to The Big Dance. 
    
	The Arts Council will receive 417m from the government in 2007-08. By 2010-11, this will go up to 467m. When funding from the National Lottery is added, the Arts Council has to make the best use of about 1 billion a year. Its largest beneficiary is the Royal Opera which receives 26m a year. 
    
	There was an angry reaction today from Jan Lennox, the director of Watermans, who said: The Arts Councils decision is a blow to Hounslow and the whole of West London. Watermans is the only organisation to provide such a range of services across a number of London boroughs including Hounslow, Ealing, Hillingdon and Brent. 
    
	All are areas with large Indian populations. 
    
	In a strong letter to the Arts Council, Peter Thompson, the Tory leader of Hounslow Council, commented: This is an outrageous decision. We are extremely disappointed, but this is not by any means a done deal and we will be supporting Watermans in their appeal and other legal measures to have this decision overturned. I am personally seeking a meeting with the chair and chief executive of the Arts Council to demand an explanation. 
    
	The Arts Council chairman, Christopher Frayling, has defended the redistribution of money, pointing out that though many organisations have lost their grants or had them reduced, others have gained. 
    
	This is a radical plan but one I firmly believe will help to make the arts in England even stronger, Frayling said.

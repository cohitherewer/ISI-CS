	London, March 30: Little more than a week after his divorce was granted by the high court, Paul McCartney is enjoying a romantic Caribbean holiday with American socialite Nancy Shevell.        
	The former Beatle and the 47-year-old American are staying at the exclusive resort of Jumby Bay in Antigua, and have been spotted riding bicycles around the tiny island, according to local sources.        
	In November, the couple were photographed kissing in the back of his pick-up truck. They were also pictured walking on the beach and dining at the exclusive US Hamptons beach resort near New York.        
	Shevell is legally separated from wealthy lawyer Bruce Blakeman, and is a long-term friend of Paul. She is known as a powerful figure in the east coast business world, and in American political circles.        
	A spokesperson for Paul, 65, declined to comment on the former Beatles friend.         
	Earlier this month, Sir Paul emerged from his acrimonious divorce battle with estranged wife Heather Mills with his estimated 387 million fortune largely intact. Mills, 40, had sought 125 million from her four-year marriage to Paul, but was awarded just a fifth of that figure  24.3 million.

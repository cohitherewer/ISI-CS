	Los Angeles, May 27: Nasas ambitious mission to discover if Mars was ever habitable has encountered its first hitch  the protective sheath covering the robotic digging arm of its Phoenix lander has failed to fully unfurl.         
	The malfunction means the elbow joint of the 7.7ft long arm, which much of the $420 million venture hinges upon, remains covered.         
	Mission controllers, however, sought to downplay the fault, saying it was more snag than problem and they expected to be able to wiggle the arm free of the bio-barrier, designed to stop contamination of the Martian environment. That manoeuvre was due to take place ahead of an attempt to extend the robotic limb tomorrow.         
	This is a minor inconvenience, said Deborah Bass, deputy project scientist at Nasas Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Were going to have to do a little bit of disentangling.         
	Overall the Phoenix team remains highly confident about the crafts ability to fulfill its mission, a three-month digging operation to scrutinise the soils beneath the Martian arctic in search of the building blocks of life.         
	Nearly all the initial feedback from the three-legged lander shows it to be functioning well in its new home, the flat, barren plains near Mars north pole where the temperature is about minus 33 degrees Celsius.         
	Phoenix has already sent back crystal clear images of the unexplored area, which had never been seen up close. They reveal a pebble-strewn floor marked by depressions and cracks forming polygon shapes similar to those seen at the Arctic regions of Earth.         
	Mission scientists believe the markings are caused by subterranean ice thawing and refreezing causing the surface to expand and contract, such as occurs on Earth.         
	The mission aims to discover if the ice believed to lie about a foot beneath the Martian surface has or does ever thaw, creating water that may once have sustained basic life. The probe will use its arm to dig down into the soil and analyse samples of ice in its onboard laboratory to find out if it contains organic compounds that may indicate a capacity to support some form of life.         
	Phoenix executed a flawless touchdown yesterday after its 422 million mile, nine-month journey from Earth culminated in a nail-biting decent using a parachute and rocket thrusters.        
	To the amazement of mission controllers, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which was 470m away from the Phoenix and travelling at 7,600 mph, managed to photograph the landers parachute phase. It marked the first time one spacecraft has taken an image of another craft during landing.

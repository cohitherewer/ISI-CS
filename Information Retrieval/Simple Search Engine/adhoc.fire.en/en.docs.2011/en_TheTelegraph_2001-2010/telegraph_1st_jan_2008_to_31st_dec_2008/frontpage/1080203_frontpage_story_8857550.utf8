 - What Bhajji mayve told Symonds is not unparliamentary
     SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY, RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND SUJAN DUTTA
                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Teri maa ki... the abuse Harbhajan Singh is reported to have spat out at Andrew Symonds  is not on the list of unparliamentary phrases compiled by the Lok Sabha secretariat. But teri baap ki is. 
    
	Monkey  what Symonds thought Harbhajan had called him  is unparliamentary in English, Hindi (and in Australian). 
    
	Narendra Modi said Sonia Gandhi abused him when she called him a merchant of death in the Gujarat election campaign and figured that the Congresss brains trust was on a Roman Holiday. The Election Commission came down heavily on both. 
    
	Indira Gandhi found Ram Manohar Lohias description of her as a gungi gudiya (dumb doll) insulting, but it did not count as slander under Indian law. 
    
	None of the phrases quoted above is illegal though they were all meant to hurt, insult and humiliate. But who is to decide whether teri maa ki hurts less than monkey or tere baap ki? 
    
	In verbal exchanges peppered with injurious words, abuse hurts only when it is understood for what it is. 
    
	Symonds thought Harbhajan had called him a monkey  in a derogatory reference to his non-white descent  when the Indian bowler had probably used a phrase to sully his mothers name (unless, of course, like Alice Pattens character in the film Rang de Basanti, he meant to say teri maa ki aankh (your mothers eyes). 
    
	Much depends on the cultural, local context, says Supreme Court lawyer Kamini Jaiswal. The only thing akin to racial abuse  the charge that was first brought against Harbhajan  and punishable by Indian law is under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. 
    
	This means that if the tables were turned and if Symonds, playing in India, had called a Scheduled Caste Indian player a chamar or a Harijan it would be treated on a par with racial abuse. 
    
	If a harsh word spat out in haste appears to sting less in India than in the West, it is because the law of tort - law of civil wrongs  is not well developed in India, says constitutional expert T.R. Andhyarujina. In developing societies, few have the time and the inclination to go into costly litigation over propriety.
    
	The touchiness of language is most delicately revealed in the compilation of parliamentary and unparliamentary phrases. We followed the practice of the House of Commons to start with, says former Lok Sabha secretary-general Subhash C. Kashyap. Later on, we developed our own lists based entirely on the discretion of the Lok Sabha Speaker and the Rajya Sabha chairperson.
    
	The Speaker may consult his officials to rule if usage is scurrilous, abusive and derogatory. Apart from ensuring that the remarks are expunged from the records, there is little the Speaker can do. The member may be asked to withdraw the words but in the era of live television coverage this counts for little. 
    
	Even liar or lie may be unparliamentary. When Rajiv Gandhi was the PM, he used the word lie against a member. When the member objected, Rajiv quickly amended it to say what he meant was the member had made an incorrect statement, Kashyap recalls. 
    
	Rajiv Gandhi could have been more creative. A British parliamentarian who was asked to withdraw the word liar from his speech said of an opponent in the House that he had as much regard for the truth as a tomcat for marriage licences.
    
	Evidence of such imagination in the Indian Parliament is scant. But sporting grounds have proved more fertile, from Mohali to Sydney. 
    
	Kashyap got a volume of unparliamentary expressions compiled in 1999. The list was updated in 2004 after surveying the rulings in Parliament and in state legislatures. It is probably difficult to make the list exhaustive given the daily innovation in language. But surely teri maa ki... has been used before?

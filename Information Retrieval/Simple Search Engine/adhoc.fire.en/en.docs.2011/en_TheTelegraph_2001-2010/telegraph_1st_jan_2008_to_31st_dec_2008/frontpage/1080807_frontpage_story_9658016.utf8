The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | I wont step down: Koda
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I wont step down: Koda

	Deoghar/Ranchi, Aug 6: A confident Madhu Koda today ruled out stepping down as chief minister, thereby making it all the more difficult for Shibu Soren to assume the coveted post which the JMM leader claims he has been promised for helping the UPA government tide over the trust vote.        
	With the blessings of Lord Shiv, my government is quite stable and there is no question of (me) stepping down for Guruji, he told reporters after visiting the Lord Baidhyanath temple.        
	Asked about the JMMs claim that he would have to step down to make way for Guruji, Koda ruled out such an eventuality. Such gossip is generated by the media, he said.         
	Koda, who landed at the Deoghar airstrip around 11.10am, rushed to the temple immediately. He was accompanied by wife Geeta and two ministers Chandra Prakesh Choudhury and Bhanu Pratap Sahi, besides RJD MLA from Sarath Chunna Singh.         
	Koda spent 15-20 minutes inside the sanctum sanctorum. Earlier, I missed the opportunity to visit the Lord because of my engagements in New Delhi. Today, I prayed before the Lord for the welfare of the state, for my government and for the people of Jharkhand, he announced.         
	Kodas prayers seem to have been answered as the road to the states leadership looks riddled with unforeseen hurdles. Yesterday, Soren met the Prime Minister and JMM MP Hemlal Murmu only said that Manmohan Singh responded positively. The Congress, too, is playing for time; its general secretary Digvijay Singh indicating that the party would have no objection to Soren as chief minister provided he could enlist the support of others in the UPA.        
	The Congress has thus deftly thrown the ball back in Sorens court asking him to get the nod from Lalu Prasad and at least nine Independent MLAs said to be supporting the Koda government.

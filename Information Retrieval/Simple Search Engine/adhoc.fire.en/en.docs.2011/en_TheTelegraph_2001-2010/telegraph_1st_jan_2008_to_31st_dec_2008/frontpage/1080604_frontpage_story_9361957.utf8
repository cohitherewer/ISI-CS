          ANITA SINGH                            Actress Sarah Jessica Parker in the Nina Ricci creation at the Sex and the City premiere in New York. (AP)                                  
	London, June 3: Sarah Jessica Parker has been left fuming after the evening gown she wore to the Sex and the City premiere in New York turned out to be less than exclusive.         
	Despite assurances that the silver Nina Ricci creation designed by Olivier Theyskens had never been worn on the red carpet before, socialite Lauren Santo Domingo wore the very same dress to the Met Ball last month  and was accompanied to the event by Theyskens himself.        
	Parker has branded the behaviour of the luxury fashion house unethical and disappointing. To add insult to injury, actress Lindsay Lohan wore the dress in an advertising campaign for Disney several months ago.        
	Look, my affection for the dress hasnt changed, but what they did was so short-sighted, Parker told the New York Times. Its just unethical and disappointing that they would allow the dress to be worn again.        
	Parker said she had remarked to Theyskens during the fitting that it was a surprise to find the dress had never been worn before. He assured her it had not.        
	He didnt say: Well, actually, I just escorted Lauren down the red carpet at the Met. I just wish it had been handled differently and they had been straight about it, she continued.         
	In the big picture, this is not important, but there is a relationship between the entertainment industry and fashion.        
	Mario Grauso, president of the fashion division at Puig, which owns Nina Ricci, said Domingo was not an A-lister so had not been mentioned to Parker.        
	The strapless gown was one of 40 outfits which Parker wore for the international premieres of the Sex and the City movie and the accompanying press junkets.

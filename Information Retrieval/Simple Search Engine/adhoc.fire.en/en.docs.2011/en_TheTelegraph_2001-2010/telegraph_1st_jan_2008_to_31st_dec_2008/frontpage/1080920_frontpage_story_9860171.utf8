	Calcutta, Sept. 19: Forward Bloc secretary Asoke Ghosh today sought a meeting with the CPM leadership, a day after Metro Cash amp; Carry said it might pack its bags if its Calcutta launch remained frozen.        
	Ghosh apparently made the request in a letter to Biman Bose after the Left Front chairman urged him to look into the controversy.        
	Yesterday, CPM minister Kanti Ganguly had taken up the German wholesalers case with the Blocs Naren De, who is now running the agri-marketing department in the absence of his colleague Murtaza Hossein.        
	The Bloc has been opposing Metros entry into Bengal on the grounds that it is an MNC. Metro claims its licence was unilaterally cancelled in June 2007 and that there has been no word on the fresh application it made this March.        
	Ghosh has declined comment. But a leader close to him said the Bloc would continue to oppose big companies, both foreign and domestic, in retail as well as in wholesale business in agricultural products.        
	Since the chief minister is putting pressure on us, let the CPM clarify its position. We will press for discussions in the Left Front if necessary, he said.        
	He, however, conceded there were certain grey areas on the Blocs policy on Metro, which requires explanation.        
	There is a difference between our general opposition to big capital in retail since it will mar the livelihood of lakhs of small shop-owners and vendors. Metro is insisting it will not enter the retail market and will restrict itself to catering to bulk consumers like hotels and hospitals, the Bloc leader said.        
	Although chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has tried to persuade the Bloc to make room for Reliance and Metro in agri-business, there are divisions within the CPM on the matter.        
	CPM leaders have cited the central committees guideline opposing FDI in retail and called for a regulatory regime for big domestic players.        
	There is a possibility that Metro will gradually control the bulk business in agri-products and that its rivals will demand entry later citing its case, a CPM state secretariat member said.        
	He said the party was also worried whether Metro would restrict itself to wholesale. Common consumers may shop in bulk at the Metro outlet. This will happen at the cost of para shops and vendors, which we cannot afford to promote.

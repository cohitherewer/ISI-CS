          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 17: A mentally challenged woman was today found clinging to the body of her mother, who appeared to have died a couple of days ago, in the apartment they shared with her father in upscale Ballygunge Circular Road.        
	Asoke Kumar Kinra, 66, got suspicious after a stench came out of the room where his wife Suman, 64, and daughter Ambica, 33, lived, police said.         
	Kinra, who retired as an engineer six years ago, told police he did not have any interaction with his wife and daughter, both of whom were mentally challenged and under psychiatric treatment.        
	The cook would bring their meals every day to their room, right above the ground-floor showrooms and shops at the six-storey Anusuya Apartment. The police are trying to trace the cook.         
	Kinra said his wife and daughter would often skip meals for a couple of days and the food would spoil. He thought thats what had happened again, said Ballygunge OC Tapas Basu.        
	But the stench got worse. He opened the door and saw his wife lying motionless on the cot and his daughter clinging to her.        
	When four policemen arrived to take the body away  a case of unnatural death has been registered  the daughter resisted. Why have you come here? My mother is perfectly well. Please leave, Ambica was quoted as saying.        
	The room was littered with rice, dal and vegetables. Plates lay unused, Basu said.        
	Deputy commissioner (south) Rajesh Subarna said the body was decomposed and it appeared the woman died at least two days ago. We have sent the body for post-mortem.        
	Neighbours said the Kinras kept to themselves. The mother and daughter rarely came out; they always kept their door shut. The cook served food separately to Asokebabu and the two women. I have never seen the two talking to Asokebabu, an elderly neighbour said.

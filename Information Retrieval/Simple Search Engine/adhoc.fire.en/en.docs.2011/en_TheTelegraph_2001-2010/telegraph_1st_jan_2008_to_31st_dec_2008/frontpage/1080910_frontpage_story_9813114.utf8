          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Jaya Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan                                 
	Mumbai, Sept. 9: Jaya Bachchan today apologised in a newspaper interview for inadvertently hurting Marathi sentiments with her pro-Hindi remark but Raj Thackerays party rejected it, demanding a retraction at a public forum.        
	On Sunday, Jaya had said that since she was from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtrians should forgive her if she chose to speak Hindi instead of Marathi. It prompted Raj to ban the release of films featuring the Bachchans and call for a boycott of any product they endorsed, leading Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) activists to tear off film posters and advertisement hoardings across Maharashtra.        
	I am very sorry if I have hurt the sentiments of Marathi-speaking people in Mumbai and Maharashtra, Jaya, 61, said in remarks published by a morning newspaper today.        
	I never thought my innocent remarks would create such a negative impact. I am comfortable in Hindi. Thats the language I think in, and thats the language I prefer to speak in. Let me also say that I speak Marathi and I speak it quite well. Like I said, if Ive inadvertently hurt anyones sentiments, I regret the hurt caused.        
	MNS general secretary Shishir Shinde, however, said: We will not accept the apology expressed in an English paper. She should speak in front of the entire media, especially the regional media.        
	His partys activists today launched fresh attacks on film and advertisement posters and hoardings featuring Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek, Aishwarya Rai and Priyanka Chopra.        
	Aurangabad police provided security to a theatre screening God Tussi Great Ho, which stars Amitabh and Priyanka, after MNS activists stopped the 9pm show yesterday. Idea Cellular posters featuring Abhishek were torn in Satara and effigies of the Bachchans burnt in Wardha, Vidarbha.        
	Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said the government would prevent the MNS from disturbing law and order. We will also examine Raj Thackerays statement and take action if it violates any legal provisions, he said.        
	Bollywood sources said the Bachchans would make their next move after Amitabh returned to Mumbai from Paris in a couple of days.        
	Mumbai police rounded up over 350 MNS activists this evening as a precautionary step and posted pickets to protect Idea Cellular hoardings.        
	The Shiv Sena, too, has picked up the issue. Its mouthpiece Saamna criticised Jayas remarks, saying penniless migrants came to Maharashtra and gained wealth, but stuck to their regional identities.        
	It also targeted Shah Rukh Khan who had recently scoffed at the anti-north Indian campaign run by the MNS.        
	He (SRK) intermittently says he is a Delhi-wallah. If you are a Delhi-wallah, why did you come to Maharashtra? For earning wealth, you come to Maharashtra. When their bellies are full, they burp their regional identities. If you can be proud of your regional identities, then what is wrong if we remember (ours) too? an editorial said.

How we miss the noise
  - Hyderabad airport shut, sound of silence spoils sleep          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                        The airport when it was functioning				                                       
	Hyderabad, April 8: Maisammas ears cant stand it. The sound of silence is as unbearable as it is unfamiliar.        
	Since the Begumpet airport closed down two weeks ago, the elderly woman in the neighbouring Bowenpalli slums cannot sleep at night. Nor can young schoolteacher Pratibha in Motilal Nehru Bagh, just off the runway.        
	I miss the drone of aircraft landing and taking off all day. The eerie silence is worst at night. The aircraft have left, and taken my sleep away with them, Maisamma said.        
	The feeling is echoed round the 18 middle-class colonies in M.N. Bagh, Rasoolpura and Sannatnagar, where the daily routine once revolved round the flight schedule.        
	I could tell the hours by the drone of the planes, said Pratibha, 25. My grandfather used the days first take-off, the 5.30am flight to Mumbai, as an alarm clock to wake up in the morning.        
	So did Maisamma. If any of us overslept, she would shout, Get up you lazy devil, the fifth flight has already landed, said one of her grandchildren who works as a maid. The closure of the airport has taken a part of her life away.        
	Three decades of bustle and din had ended on March 24, when the old airport was superseded by the new one at Shamshabad, 25km away.        
	A change in the environment can indeed affect sleep patterns, a Chennai-based specialist said.        
	We call it mind-training. Some people need time to get used to a new environment -- whether its noisier or quieter, said Nagarajan Ramakrishnan, director of the Nithra Institute of Sleep Sciences.        
	The residents also miss the fun. Whenever any VIP landed, be it Sonia Gandhi or Amitabh Bacchan, we got a very good look from our balconies as they stood on the tarmac, said Swapna, 18.        
	When the rest of the city cursed the traffic snarls caused by VIP motorcades, M.N. Bagh stood on its terraces and watched the stars.        
	Sometimes we invited our friends, too, said Rajesh, 21. Now the airport has fallen as silent as the graveyard across the road.        
	The graveyard, which houses the tombs of the Paigahs, past rulers of the Deccan, is better maintained and draws visitors, though.        
	At the old airport, garbage piles up around the vast premises. The trolleys, weighing machines and other equipment have gathered a layer of dust. Recent showers have left dirty pools on the tarmac and runway, where hardly five defence aircraft landed in the past two weeks.        
	With the electric fencing gone, buffaloes, donkeys and dogs sometimes stray in. Last Sunday, the half-a-dozen guards chased away slum children playing cricket on the runway.        
	The airport is dead but Maisamma needs to get her life back. Ramakrishnan suggested it may take her weeks  even months.        
	(Its also possible that) a person may never get used to a new environment, the specialist added, citing how a bride could not sleep normally in her in-laws city, forcing the husband to move to her hometown.        
	With inputs from G.S. Mudur in New Delhi

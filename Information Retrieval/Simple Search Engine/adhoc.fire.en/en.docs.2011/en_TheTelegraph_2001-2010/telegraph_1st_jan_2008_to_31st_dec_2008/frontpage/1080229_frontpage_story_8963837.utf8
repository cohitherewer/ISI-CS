The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hardev rides land boom
                                                                                                           Hardev rides land boom
          GAJINDER SINGH                                        
	Chandigarh, Feb. 28: Everything looks new in Hardev Singhs house: the DVD player and the television, the Alto and the Honda motorbike. They are.        
	Less than three years ago, the 61-year-old was struggling to make ends meet with his schoolteachers salary, supplemented by the vegetables he grew on his five acres. Today, the resident of Bhago Majra, 14km from Mohali, is struggling to decide how best to invest his crores.        
	The 1990s economic reforms didnt change Hardevs life straightaway. But the construction boom they unleashed lifted him on its crest in 2005. Around that time, Punjabs Amarinder Singh government had decided to let promoters buy farmland on the city fringes and build complexes of flats and villas.        
	The builders  DLF, Emaar-MGF and others  came in hordes. An acre, which fetched only a few lakhs, was suddenly worth well over a crore. I sold half of my five-acre land, the retired primary sports teacher says. He made over Rs 3.6 crore.        
	But prices are still rising. I have a second plot, about three-fourth of an acre, next to a highway half a kilometre from my home, and have leased it to a dhaba owner. I have been offered Rs 3.5 crore for it. Its because the promoters of the plot behind it think the dhaba will spoil the view, he adds with a chuckle.        
	Hardev has added rooms to his old house, which now sprawls 3,000sqft in a neighbourhood that will boast posh colonies with names such as Mohali Hills and Unitech. He has built a huge gate, painted the house and crammed it with expensive gadgets.        
	I have married my daughter Rupinder into a good household and sent my elder son Satbir, who is 32, off to Germany, he says.        
	Satbir used to help me on the farm; he is now doing odd jobs in Gutengel. My younger son Dalbir helps me till my remaining 2.5 acres.        
	But Hardev wants more and grudges the rise in land prices elsewhere, too. He would have sold his remaining farmland and moved to Mohali, but prices there are about Rs 10,000 a square foot.        
	My dream to have a small house in the city can never be fulfilled. I have had problems investing my money, too. I had to buy land near Chamkaur Sahib, 40km away, because property prices have skyrocketed here, he rues.        
	The former teacher is eager to find fault with the changes that benefited him.         
	The village will no longer be the same once the colonies come up. Already, with most farmland barricaded by the builders and nothing being grown, the climate has changed, he complains.              
	There has been no mist for the past two years despite severe winters. Dust storms are beginning to take place.        
	But Hardev knows he has been lucky: I struggled to pay for my wifes treatment when she was suffering from cancer. I wish she were alive to see how I have been able to give the children a better future.        
	Sometimes, he spares a thought for the poor.        
	The Centres policies do not help the common man but only industrialists and businessmen, Hardev says. And its grants never reach the poor.

          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                             File picture of Harbhajan with Sreesanth                                   
	Mumbai, April 30: Bhajji has been banished in more ways than one  the cricketer banned for 11 Indian Premier League matches no longer features on the Mumbai Indians website and the team is pulling down giant hoardings featuring him.        
	The posters have come off in and around Colaba, Nariman Point and Churchgate, but Harbhajan Singhs face continues to stare down from hoardings in the suburbs.         
	The current hoardings featuring Bhajji and Sachin, Jayasuriya and Pollock were put up in the run-up to IPL, because they were the big crowd-pullers. But a decision had also been taken that as IPL progressed, we would give exposure to the younger lot by turning them into recognisable forces through the hoardings, said Tushar Pania, media manager of Mumbai Indians, claiming the current exercise was part of that move.         
	Pania added that with Harbhajan not available to play, it is only fair that the team does not use his face on hoardings to pull in the crowds.         
	But we hope this will be a temporary arrangement. Mumbai Indians hope to reach the finals, and god willing if that happens, Bhajji will be free to play in that. He will be back on the website and hoardings then, he said.         
	Till then, Harbhajan has to be on vanvas (exile).         
	Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray, who yesterday called for bhangra dancers and singers to replace the cheerleaders, compared the Bhajji-Sreesanth fracas to the estranged relations between him and cousin Raj.        
	At an informal chat with reporters, Uddhav did not name Raj but suggested Harbhajan behaved like him. Whatever happened between Sreesanth and Harbhajan was not good for the spirit of the game. Harbhajan first slapped him and then said he was like his brother, he said repeating the word brother several times and asking reporters if they understood who it meant.

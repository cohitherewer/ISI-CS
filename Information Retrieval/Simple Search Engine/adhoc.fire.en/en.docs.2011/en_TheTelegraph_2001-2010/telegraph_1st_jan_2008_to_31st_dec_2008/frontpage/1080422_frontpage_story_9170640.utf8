  - Revealed: Heart patient tragedy after Delhi run          MANDIRA NAYAR                            Aamir Khan carries the Olympic torch during the relay in Delhi. (Rajesh Kumar)                                        
	New Delhi, April 21: What the protesters couldnt do the protectors nearly did  disrupt the Olympic torchs journey through New Delhi.        
	On its way out of India on April 17, the torch got trapped under the only thing Delhi police never expected it to  the weight of its own foolproof security.        
	A massive traffic jam caused by that security paraphernalia held up the torch and its Chinese escorts on the streets  within striking distance of the evening crowd  for over an hour and a half on their way to the airport.        
	For the Tibetans and ordinary Indians, the funny side would be hard to miss had not the jam held up an ambulance, too, killing a critical patient.         
	The Delhi police, in their search for watertight security, had arranged for a decoy torch. The dummy  an exact copy  was whisked away by the security agencies after the super-short relay ended at India Gate. It reached Delhi airport in record time.        
	The real torch  driven in a nondescript car to avoid attracting attention  found itself stuck in a snarl created by the police blocking off arterial roads for hours to ensure a smooth Olympic torch run.        
	As the car inched its way across one of Delhis newest flyovers, passengers of other cars would have been unaware that they were so close to that symbol of the Olympic spirit they had been kept away from just hours ago.        
	The security officials were in a dilemma, a source said. They were escorting the real torch and couldnt get it out fast because they were in an ordinary car.        
	The officials who had reached the airport with the dummy torch got worried as they saw the special flight sitting on the tarmac beyond the 7.30pm take-off time. It finally left after 9pm. The torch is now safe in Malaysia.        
	Getting to the airport was a nightmare for all passengers flying out after 7pm. Stranded endlessly on the road, they were seen hauling their heavy bags and walking.        
	A passenger from Chennai  who made it in time to the airport  had a heart attack. He was given first aid and put in an ambulance to be taken to the nearest hospital. The ambulance couldnt get out of the traffic and he died.        
	One question is still to be answered, though. Did Aamir Khan  who may have been saying a silent prayer for Tibet  run with the real thing or was he only carrying the dummy?

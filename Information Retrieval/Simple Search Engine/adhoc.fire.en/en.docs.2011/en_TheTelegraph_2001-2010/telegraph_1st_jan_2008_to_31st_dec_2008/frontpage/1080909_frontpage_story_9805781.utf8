          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 8: The Orissa government is preparing a counter-affidavit on the situation in Kandhamal and on measures taken by the state to provide relief to the riot-hit people  in response to an affidavit submitted by the Christian community.         
	The affidavit would be submitted in the Supreme Court on Wednesday, while a copy would be sent to the governor. Our affidavit would be a response to the writ petition filed in the Supreme Court by the Christian community, the hearing of which has been fixed on Thursday, said home secretary T.K. Mishra.        
	The governors office has also sought inputs on the prevailing situation in Kandhamal, Mishra added. The governors office has asked for legal provisions prevailing in other states relating to regulation of law and order in scheduled areas.         
	Last week, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had apprised the governor regarding the situation in the district.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Moviemakers wake up to scary tale 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Moviemakers wake up to scary tale 
  - Bolly to bling business, tough times begin to tell on the ground           SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Akshay Kumar: Will he have to take a pay cut?                                        
	Mumbai, Nov. 12: When Wall Street shivers, Bollywood freezes.         
	The worlds largest film industry has begun feeling the heat of the global meltdown with producers holding back launches and the biggest stars taking a cut in their fees.        
	People are only finishing projects in which they have already invested money. There is a severe funds crunch. Film production is drying up. There are absolutely no new project launches. The story is over for small budget films and producers. Only the biggest will survive, but they too will take a severe beating, said Anil Nagrath, president, Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association.        
	Nagrath said the real picture will start emerging after the ongoing projects finish and get released in the next six months.        
	You will not see more than one film releasing every month. Now, around three to four films release every week. The ongoing cine workers strike for higher wages has also affected producers badly. Usually, my phones dont stop ringing when such strikes occur with anxious producers wanting to know when they can begin work. This time there is hardly anyone calling. Simply because hardly anyone is making films, he added.        
	The reason, says Shailendra Singh, managing director of Percept Picture Company which has given hits like Hanuman and Jannat, is a severe funds crunch and the stock market swing.        
	Bollywood is an industry which runs on upfront payments. The advance culture stretches from artistes to technicians and production facility vendors. With a sudden funds squeeze, both from banks and non-traditional funding sources, there is no money to fund films. The stock market crash has left big listed producers like Studio 18, UTV and even Reliance ADAG in bad shape. Unlisted big banners like Yashraj Films and Percept are having to deal with over-inflated pricing  in every aspect of film-making. It is like a ton of bricks falling, said Singh.        
	Subhash Ghais musical Yuvvraaj starring Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif is one of the first big-ticket flicks which is said to be feeling the heat. Eros International was to have distributed the film. But as the meltdown started affecting cash flows, it backtracked and sold Yuvvraaj to Shri Ashtavinayak Cine Vision for a reported figure of Rs 30 crore, said Nagrath, adding that the deal has run into some hurdles.        
	Sources said the two sides were trying to rework the deal. A source in Shri Ashtavinayak said a series of recent flops coupled with the market mayhem has affected the production house which hit the jackpot last year with the Kareena-Shahid starrer Jab We Met.         
	Of course, we are going through difficult times. So is Eros. Why would they have sold off a Salman-starrer for Rs 30 crore otherwise? But these are all hyped figures which worked in boom times. In the present market scenario, prices have to become realistic. If they do not like our present offer of Rs 18 crore, there will be negotiations and a middle path will be found, said the Ashtavinayak official.        
	A Salman-starrer produced under a big banner like Mukta Arts would, under normal circumstances, command a price of at least Rs 45-50 crore.        
	As of now, things havent been sorted out so the release date of the film might not be November 21 anymore. It might be pushed to a later date, said a source in Mukta Arts, the production house owned by Ghai.        
	Ghai, however, said the film is on track. I am in the final mixing stage. Yuvvraaj is releasing on November 21.        
	Eros, meanwhile, has decided not to take up any new projects. Ditto with Adlabs.        
	An official at Adlabs, which has seen its share prices plummet to Rs 200 from Rs 1,500, said they were rethinking all new projects in view of the current economic scenario.        
	Corporate producers like UTV, Pritish Nandy Communications and Studio 18 are also reviewing their decision about acquiring rights of new films and getting into multi-movie contracts with stars and directors.        
	Akshay Kumar, the reigning superstar with a string of mega-hits, was reportedly made an offer of Rs 71 crore by UTV Motion Pictures to do a film with them after the success of Singh is Kinng.        
	UTV later denied having made such a massive offer. But whatever the offer, Akshay has reportedly been asked to take a cut on it now.        
	Akshay-Vipul Shah (the director of Akshay-hit Namastey London) were expected to get together for a project with us. But now he has been asked to review his asking price by UTV. He has not responded yet. The project may have to be shelved as nobody has big funds to splash now, said an UTV official.        
	Studio 18 has backed out of Shahs Salman-Ajay Devgan-starrer London Dreams for the same reason, said a top official in the production house.         
	Sources said even Shah Rukh Khans Red Chillies has shelved a project to make an FX film Ra.1 with Anubhav Sinha because of the meltdown.        
	With inputs from Pratim D. Gupta in Calcutta

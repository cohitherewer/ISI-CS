          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 18: A person declared dead by RG Kar hospital gasped for breath half an hour later in another hospital and died in another 30 minutes, relatives and a doctor said.        
	Dilip De, 42, the owner of a video library in Lake Town, was grievously injured on the head and chest when a tree fell on his car during the storm this evening. His wife and son suffered minor injuries.        
	The accident occurred in front of the Lake Town swimming pool at 6.35pm. He was trapped inside the car for more than an hour as the tree could not be removed, said Rajiv Bhattacharya, a friend of De.        
	Police officials from Lake Town reached the spot with a crane but it failed. Eventually, people in the neighbourhood cut the tree and brought him out, Bhattacharya said.         
	De was then rushed to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital where the emergency medical officer pronounced him brought dead.        
	His relatives then insisted that the hospital use a defibrillator to revive him. But the doctor pleaded helplessness saying they did not have the machine, said Anjay Ghosh, another friend. If there was a defibrillator, there would have been a chance, he said.         
	The doctor had started to write the death certificate when his family members said he was alive and insisted on getting him admitted, said U. Dutta, principal, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.         
	Since the doctor was sure that he was dead and continued writing the death certificate, the family members and those accompanying them forcibly took him away, Dutta said.         
	The doctor had even sought intervention from the police outpost at the hospital but the force allegedly refused to intervene. The doctor called me up and said the relatives had taken away the body, Dutta said. De had spent around 15 minutes at RG Kar hospital.        
	Around 9.30pm, De was taken to the emergency department of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital on the EM Bypass.        
	According to the hospital authorities, De was gasping for breath. De was alive when he was brought into the emergency. Doctors tried their best to save him by resuscitation (artificial breathing) but he died on the way to the ICU, said Arijit Bose, in charge of medical administration, Apollo Gleneagles Hospital.        
	He was alive for half an hour after he was brought to the hospital. Despite the best efforts by doctors, he died. The death was because of severe head and chest injury, Bose added.         
	Des family members said they took him to Apollo in desperation. His wife Nabanita, 30, and son Ayush, 5, were treated at the hospital.

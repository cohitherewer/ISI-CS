  - Team to visit three states to study NREGS          SANTOSH K. KIRO                            Jean Drze during a public hearing in Chhatarpur. File picture                                        
	Ranchi, June 2: With a recent social audit now confirming what was widely feared  that there are massive irregularities in the implementation of the Centres showpiece job scheme, the state government has decided to act.        
	In order to work towards a methodology to clamp down on irregularities, largely centred around the muster rolls, the state government would implement the system of mate that has been introduced to good effect in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.        
	According to the system, one person was deployed permanently at each site of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to keep tabs on workers attendance and see to it that genuine beneficiaries signed muster rolls.         
	A team of officials will soon be sent to three states to study the system. We have heard it is rendering good results in making the muster rolls more authentic, said Amitabh Kaushal, the state NREGS commissioner.        
	NREGS officials believed the implementing agency of the NREGS was not filling up muster rolls daily because of which the social audit teams found fault.         
	Last month, a team of students of GB Pant Institute of Social Science, Allahabad, led by economist Jean Drze, had revealed several anomalies in the muster rolls in Chhatarpur and Chainpur blocks of Palamau district.         
	The team found that all 36 names in a muster roll of Cheeru village in Chhatarpur block were fake. Some were not even present in the village at the time of work, said the teams report submitted to the NREGS commissioner.                                
	At a public hearing in Chhatarpur held in the wake of the murder of his associate Lalit Mehta, Drze told government officials in front of thousands of angry villagers that the Palamau district administration had flouted all norms of the NREG Act and that middlemen had usurped all benefits.        
	Most complaints regarding NREGS related to irregularities in muster rolls. In some, even non-resident villagers were being shown as beneficiaries so that middlemen could have a free, undisputed run in capturing the wages meant for workers.        
	Kaushal said he had ordered inquiries based on the findings of the social audit team in Palamau. The government will not tolerate any irregularities in the implementation of NREGS. Prompt and unbiased action would be taken on any complaints, he said.        
	While Drze report may have highlighted widespread corruption, it held out a ray of hope in some areas. As many as 68 per cent labourers have said they did not have to sleep hungry as NREGS provided them with some work, the report said.         
	Yet, the report highlighted the fact that 16 per cent of villagers did not have job cards.         
	This year, the state government received Rs 1,035 crore from the Centre for implementing NREGS. Last year, it spent Rs 1,075 crore.        
	Presently, the state had over 30 lakh job card holders, of whom 21 lakh have opened accounts in banks or post offices. Officials believed that if payment of wages were ensured through savings accounts, the corruption in NREGS could be eliminated entirely.

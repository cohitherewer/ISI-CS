                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tata OK but 400 bye-bye: Mamata 
  Subtle shift before talks          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	Calcutta, Aug. 19: Mamata Banerjee today announced her party would attend a meeting on Singur at Writers Buildings tomorrow with the one-point agenda that 400 acres be returned to unwilling farmers, but behind the bluster was a subtle shift in stand.        
	Let the Tatas build their factory on 600-650 acres and let ancillary units be relocated somewhere nearby, she told industry leaders at the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.        
	This is the first time the Trinamul leader has said the 400 acres need not cover land on which the Tata Motors small car plant is coming up. Trinamul leaders described this as a softening of her position. So far, her stand was that land taken from unwilling farmers would have to be returned no matter where it fell.        
	I dont want the Tatas to leave, I dont believe in Tata bye-bye, but simultaneously want the government to be fair to the farmers, Mamata said.         
	The Trinamul leader also revealed that she had received a letter from Tata Motors on their Singur project, the first time the company has got in touch with her directly, but refused to divulge its contents saying it was marked confidential.         
	I would not be unethical by disclosing contents of the Tata Motors letter. However, on the basis of what they have written, I can say that they need 650 acres for the small car plant and not 1,000 acres.        
	Moreover, the ancillary units coming up in Singur would not only supply materials to Tata Motors but also other companies across the globe. So, why did the government issue the notification that 1,000 acres would be required for the Tata project? she asked.        
	It is learnt that the letter was written by Tata Motors MD Ravi Kant.         
	She was also unhappy that industries minister Nirupam Sen, and not chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, would be meeting her partys representatives tomorrow.        
	The chief minister should have realised that acceptance or rejection of our demand for the return of 400 acres at Singur would be a policy decision and his presence at tomorrows meeting was a must.        
	Actually, his intention is to drag the issue and persuade us to defer our agitation so that the Tatas can roll out their small car by October. So, tomorrows meeting would be a meeting without results, Mamata said.         
	She appealed to the chambers to persuade the government that the Tata small car project does not need these 400 acres. Unless the land was returned, her partys August 24 agitation at Singur would start and continue, she warned.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose iterated the government line that land already acquired could not be returned for practical and legal reasons, and asked her to offer a realistic solution.        
	Mamata, who said she was happy to get a letter from the chief minister inviting us for talks on Singur, holds that the return of 400 acres is the only solution we can offer.        
	After Bhattacharjee invited her for talks yesterday, Mamata wrote back this morning to say her representatives would attend the meeting. The chief minister sent another letter today praising her for agreeing to hold a dialogue and confirming that Sen would meet Trinamul leaders at 4.30pm.

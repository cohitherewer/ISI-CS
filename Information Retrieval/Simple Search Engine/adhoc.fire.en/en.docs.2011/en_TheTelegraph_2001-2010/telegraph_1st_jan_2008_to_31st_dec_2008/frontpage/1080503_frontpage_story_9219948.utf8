          JAYDEEP BASU                              
	Jaipur, May 2: Sourav Ganguly and Shane Warne were today reprimanded and docked 10 per cent of their match fees after the Indian pressured the umpire in yesterdays game and was pilloried by the Australian at the post-match media conference.        
	Umpire G.A. Pratapkumar has been suspended for a game with match referee Farokh Engineer ruling he had no reason to accept Souravs plea to refer a catch claimed against him to the TV umpire.        
	Engineer also ruled that Souravs act of asking the umpire to refer the decision  the Kolkata Knight Riders captain denies doing that  amounted to dissent and a Level I offence under the ICC code.        
	Warne was held guilty of flouting Section 1.7, which deals with public criticism of, or inappropriate comment on, a match-related incident or official.        
	The Rajasthan Royals skipper had accused Sourav of disregarding the spirit of cricket by refusing to walk off after Graeme Smith claimed a catch. TV umpire Asad Rauf had found the pictures inconclusive and ruled not out.        
	If an international captain like Graeme Smith said it was a clean catch, Sourav should have accepted his word. But he asked the umpire, the Indian umpire, to go to the TV replay, Warne said.        
	Thats not in the spirit of the game, so I was very, very disappointed with Sourav.        
	Sourav hit back to say Warne had no moral right to lecture him. All you need is to look at his career and the incidents he was involved in. I just want to laugh at what Warne is saying, Sourav said, adding sarcastically: I didnt know that taking a dropped catch was in the spirit of the game.        
	He denied asking the umpire to refer the decision. All I told him was that the catch was not taken cleanly. Referring it was his decision.        
	Warne went up and spoke to Pratapkumar and Sourav after the incident, and the Knight Riders skipper was seen flashing a smile. He was out the next over for 51 as his team tumbled to a 45-run defeat, its third straight loss.        
	The catch was cleanly taken... the replay also suggests the catch was clean, Smith said.        
	I have a good relationship with Smith, Sourav said. I dont want to drag him into it. But often the fielder does not realise that he had actually taken a dropped catch.        
	Warne also accused Sourav of wasting time. Our batsmen were waiting five minutes but the other team was nowhere in sight. And when we came out in the field, we were waiting for Sourav.        
	The umpires have not told me anything, so I dont know what Warne is trying to say, Sourav shot back.        
	The Knight Riders Pakistani fast bowler Umar Gul raised another controversy, appearing to suggest at the same media conference that Souravs captaincy in Twenty20 had a long way to go.        
	This format is new for Ganguly. He is finding it difficult, Gul said. He has to learn a few more tricks.        
	Coach John Buchanan said Gul had been misinterpreted. Its a new form of the game and how to best play that was what he meant, he said.   
	What happened during the Jaipur match  
	 Sourav Ganguly tells umpire that Graeme Smith did not take his catch cleanly. Umpire refers it to third umpire who rules ldquo;not out rdquo;  
	 Shane Warne says Sourav asked for the referral to third umpire mdash; which the Knight Riders deny mdash; in violation of the law. Also says Sourav violated ldquo;spirit of the game rdquo;
  by questioning the word of ldquo;an international captain like Graeme Smith rdquo;. Warne and Smith claim catch is clean  
	 Warne adds that Knight Riders were late to come out in both innings. ldquo;Our batsmen were waiting five minutes.... And when we came out in the field, we were waiting
  for Sourav rdquo;

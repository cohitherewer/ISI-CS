                                                                                                           Lapang at helm, minus majority 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Shillong, March 10: Meghalaya today got a Congress government with neither the majority nor the confirmed support of the regional parties that had partnered it in its previous term.         
	The Purno A. Sangma-led Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA) was left screaming murder of democracy and contemplating a Supreme Court litigation after Governor S.S. Sidhu invited D.D. Lapangs Congress, which has only 25 legislators in a House of 60, to form the government. He gave Lapang 10 days to prove his majority.        
	No one was more surprised by the turn of events than Sangma, whose Nationalist Congress Party had stitched a coalition with the United Democratic Party and paraded 30 legislators at Raj Bhavan earlier in the day. The former Lok Sabha Speaker, who is making a comeback in state politics after a long stint as a Lok Sabha member, told Sidhu that the coalition had 31 members and the support of three Independents.        
	The governor hurriedly convened a news conference in the afternoon to defend his decision. Sidhu said he studied the relevant constitutional provisions and consulted legal experts before inviting Lapang to form the government. The MPA, he argued, was not the outcome of a pre-poll alliance and hence did not deserve precedence over the single-largest party.         
	Only Lapang was sworn in today since he could not immediately hand the governor the list of legislators supporting him. The Congresss partners in the previous government were the UDP, the Meghalaya Democratic Party  it failed to win a seat in this election  the Hill State Peoples Democratic Party and the Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement.        
	The NCP won 14 seats this time. The UDP has 11, the Hill State Peoples Democratic Party two and the Khun Hynniewtrep one.         
	A BJP legislator and five Independents make up the rest of the Assembly.         
	The one seat that remains to be decided is Baghmara in South Garo Hills. Polling was countermanded after the death of the sitting legislator and will be held on March 22.                                             
	Sangma claimed that Independent legislators A.T. Mondol, Ismail Marak and Limison Sangma were to join his group, but the Congress had kept them under house arrest.                                      
	The MPA will file a writ petition in the Supreme Court on Tuesday with former solicitor general Soli J. Sorabjee as its counsel. Sangma cited the apex courts verdict in a case challenging the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly  Rameshwar Prasad and others vs Union of India  as reason to hope that justice would be done.        
	If a political party with the support of other parties or other MLAs stakes claim and has the numbers to form a stable government, it cannot be refused the opportunity because of the governors subjective assessment that the majority was cobbled together by illegal or unethical means. No such power has been vested with the governor or President. Such power would be against the principles of democracy, the Tura legislator, who also resigned from the Lok Sabha today, said.        
	Sangma said the consequences of the governor acting like an autocratic political ombudsman would be horrendous.         
	The UDP chief, Donkupar Roy, said even if the Supreme Court were to rule against his and Sangmas alliance, Lapang would be defeated on the floor of the House.         
	The other regional parties iterated that they were with the MPA despite speculation about them switching allegiance to Lapang.

	Tokyo, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Australian actress Nicole Kidman wants to improve her work-life balance  by making films that her children can enjoy.         
	The five-months pregnant Kidman, a mother of two, was in Japan to promote her latest big-budget fantasy film The Golden Compass and said she had deliberately chosen the child-friendly script.        
	My Bella and Connor are 13 and 15. So they have seen the film and they loved it... my child inside wont see the film for a long time, she told a news conference.        
	But I think once you have children you want to balance the work you do because they give up so much of you to your work. So occasionally you want to make films that they can take their friends to, they can go to the premiere of, that they celebrate, she added.        
	Directed by Chris Weitz, The Golden Compass also features newcomer actress Dakota Blue Richards who beat off 10,000 girls to play the films central role of Lyra. An adaptation of Philip Pullmans novel Northern Lights, has been an international hit.

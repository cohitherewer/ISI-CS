										                              Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf abruptly cancelled his plan to attemd the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games report agencies. The cancellation is supposed to be a reaction to the reports that Pakistan's ruling coalition could be finalising a move to impeach him.  Foreign Office spokesman Mohammad Sadiq confirmed that Musharraf, who was due to fly to Beijing today, had called off his visit though he did not give any reasons for the decision. Yesterday, coalition allies Pakistan People's Party and Nawaz Sharif's PML(N) had talks to discuss Musharraf's fate.  Sources say that Musharraf cancelled his visit after the coalition leaders agreed in principle to impeach the President. The impeachment move has been a bone of contention between the two coalition partners for some time. The decision to impeach Musharraf was apparently taken during a marathon meeting yesterday between PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif.  Both parties have been tight-lipped about the meeting and did not issue any statement on the talks.

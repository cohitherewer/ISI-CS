	Patna, Sept. 22: The Kosi may have swallowed millions of homes, but it has not been able to wash away the thin thread of hope, for a normal life, from the hearts of lakhs of people who have been affected.        
	Sanjay (22) and Darun (19) who got married in the presence of thousands of homeless people at a relief camp in Madhepura in flood-ravaged north Bihar is one such example of courage during a difficult time.        
	Sanjay hailing from Ketwan village of Madhepura and Darun, from a Saharsa village, both swam to the relief camp about a month ago after the Kosi swallowed both their homes and villages. They, along with their families, are now tenants in two makeshift huts in the Bihar government-maintained mega relief camp set up on the Gheral Middle School premises.        
	As neighbours the two Dalit families became intimate, sharing their grief and happiness  and their shared history of loss and hope made them kindred spirits. Soon, the families became so close, that Daruns parents proposed her marriage with Sanjay, which his family readily accepted.         
	As the relief camp women sang traditional wedding songs, Sanjay and Darun solemnised their marriage followed by a feast of lentils, rice and vegetables, everyday fare sponsored by the government.         
	The chief guests at the proceedings, officer in charge of Madhepura police station Sanjay Kumar and Madhepura block development officer Rahmatullah, sat by the bride and grooms side, while the pundit chanted mantras. The formation of a new family unit brings hope in these troubled times, said Kumar, smiling. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, too, called on the newly wedded couple on Sunday. Both Sanjay and Darun touched Nitishs feet. You have united in a time of crisis and it is for both of you to lessen each others sorrow, he said, before directing the magistrate to provide financial assistance to the newlyweds. The couple has been given a new hut in the camp.

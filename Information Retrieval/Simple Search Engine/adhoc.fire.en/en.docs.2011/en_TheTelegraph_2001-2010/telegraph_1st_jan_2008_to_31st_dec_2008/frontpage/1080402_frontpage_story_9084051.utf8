	Jamshedpur, April 1: After Tata Institute of Social Sciences and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, it is now the turn of a national-level mathematics institute from the house of Tatas.         
	The steel major has decided to come up with an advanced institute in mathematical studies in Bhubaneswar. To be called Tata Institute of Mathematics, the project is being launched in association with Utkal University in Orissa.        
	The decision behind coming up with the institute was development of pure mathematics as a research subject and also to arouse interest among youngsters for the subject, said H.M. Nerurkar, the chief operating officer of Tata Steel at Jamshedpur today.        
	Scheduled to be opened in two months, the centre is based on the lines of institutes of mathematics located in Pune and Chennai. Once functional, it would work in areas like fundamental research in frontier disciplines of the mathematical and physical sciences: mathematics, theoretical physics among others.        
	The institute has been envisaged with the vision of promoting advance studies in different mathematical faculties and practices. It will offer postgraduate and post-doctoral research programme in different mathematics disciplines, said Nerurkar, adding the place would be an architectural delight with the design by Vadodara-based Karan Grover and Associates.        
	Utkal University officials were keen on establishing such an institute for quite some years now. So when they approached us we decided to go ahead with the project, he added.         
	To be owned by Tata Steel, Utkal University would take care of matters related to acad emics. Swadhin Patnayak, head of the department of mathematics at the university, will take charge of the institute.        
	The centre will also conduct special courses for schoolchildren to help them develop interest in mathematical studies.

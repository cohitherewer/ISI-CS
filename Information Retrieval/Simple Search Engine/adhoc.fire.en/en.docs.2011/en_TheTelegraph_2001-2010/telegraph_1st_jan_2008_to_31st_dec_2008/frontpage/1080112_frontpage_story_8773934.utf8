 Edmund Hillary, the ultimate conqueror with Tenzing, is dead

	Jan. 11: Edmund Hillary, the last of the first known conquerors of Mount Everest, is no more.
    
	Among the greatest adventurers of the 20th century and the most famous men alive, Hillary, 88, suffered a heart attack and died in New Zealands Auckland on Friday. He had been suffering from pneumonia for some time.
    
	Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became household names in 1953 by becoming the first to scale the 29,035-foot mountain.
    
	To this day, millions of children continue to learn about their feat, a triumph against adversity that endures in an era in which exploration, travel, tourism and the Internet have so thoroughly shrunk the world, making Everest comparatively familiar. It has become easier terrain, too, aided by tents, sleeping bags and climbing gear.
    
	But on May 29, 1953, Hillary, then 33, and Tenzing, 39, summited amid sub-zero temperatures, unpredictable winds and daunting crevasses, and with a grade of equipment now considered primitive. 
    
	Such was the sense of unassailable mystery and menace surrounding the tallest peak on earth that no one really knew till Hillary and Tenzing reached the summit whether it was humanly possible to do so.
    
	In the annals of great heroic exploits, the conquest of Everest ranks with the first trek to the South Pole by Roald Amundsen in 1911 and the first non-stop trans-Atlantic flight by Charles A. Lindbergh in 1927.
    
	Well, weve knocked the bastard off, Hillary famously said upon his return.
    
	In his autobiography Nothing Venture, Nothing Win, Hillary said: Everest represented the ultimate in achievement; the supreme challenge for flesh and blood and spirit.
    
	Word of the Everest expeditions success reached England the night before the coronation of Elizabeth II, resulting in a memorable newspaper headline the next morning: All this and Everest too! 
    
	Hillary was knighted while Tenzing received the George Medal, the second-highest civilian award for gallantry.
    
	Global heroes overnight, they were greeted by huge crowds in India and London. Then came a daunting test: a controversy over whether Hillary or Tenzing had been first to stand on the summit.
    
	In a remarkable testimony to the brotherhood of the rope  Tenzings grandson told The Telegraph that the rapport struck deep roots over time after the climb  both dismissed the issue as irrelevant.
    
	To Tenzings eternal credit, he refused to relent  even when the king of Nepal announced that the Asian had been the first to summit  and took the secret to the grave. Hillary eventually confirmed he was the first, but after the death of Tenzing in 1986.
    
	Hillary, who was high commissioner to India, enjoyed enormous goodwill in Darjeeling and Nepal where his philanthropy has helped the Sherpas.
    
	The relationship between Hillary and Nepal has an almost fateful ring to it, his most enriching as well as shattering experiences unfolding there. In 1975, he lost his wife Louise Rose and their teenage daughter Belinda in a plane crash in Kathmandu. Years later, he married June Mulgrew, the widow of his climbing partner Peter Mulgrew who died in a plane crash in Antarctica.
    
	Hillary and Tenzing never tried to climb Everest again. But in 2003 as crowds gathered for the 50th anniversary of the first climb, Hillary added his voice to the lament against commercialism and circus atmosphere surrounding expeditions to his beloved peak.

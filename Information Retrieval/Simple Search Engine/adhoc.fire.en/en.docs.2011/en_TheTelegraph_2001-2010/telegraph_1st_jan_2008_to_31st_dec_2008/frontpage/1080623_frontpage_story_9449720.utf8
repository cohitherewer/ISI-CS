                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Second PCG member arrested for Ulfa links 
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, June 22: Police today arrested senior Peoples Consultative Group (PCG) member Hiranya Saikia from his shop at Christian Basti, on charges of his alleged link with Ulfa. Saikia is the second PCG member to be arrested within four months.        
	The police arrested another PCG member, Lachit Bordoloi, in Dibrugarh on February 11.         
	Additional superintendent of police Debojit Deori said a case was registered against Saikia under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (case number 18/08) last night.        
	He was arrested this afternoon around 3.        
	Another police official said the arrest was made on the basis of a confession made by an important functionary of the 28 battalion of Ulfa, Ashim Goala, who was arrested by Gorchuk police last night.        
	Goala reportedly told the police that he had come to Guwahati for instructions from Saikia on developing the network of the battalion. The arrest comes after a spat between the PCG, constituted by Ulfa to pave the way for its parleys with New Delhi, and the state government, over the peace process. The PCG had questioned Dispurs sincerity in finding a political solution to the Ulfa problem.        
	Saikia, known for his extreme views, had also recently flayed the government for not being able to rein in the army which, he had alleged, had been killing members of Ulfa in fake encounters.         
	Another PCG member Dilip Patgiri said the arrest has vindicated the PCGs view that the state government was trying to sabotage the peace process. The arrest has struck a severe blow to the peace process with Ulfa, he said.         
	The PCG also demanded that both Bordoloi and Saikia should be released immediately to restore peace in the state.         
	Saikias arrest comes at a time when the police were finding it difficult to answer as to how senior Ulfa leader Mrinal Hazarika, former commander of the outfits 28 battalion, got bail in one case after another to finally walk out free last evening.         
	Hazarika, who was lodged in Dibrugarh Central Jail, stepped out last night after a district court granted him bail in a case registered against him at Bordubi police station in Tinsukia district.         
	It was the last of the 15 cases in which he got bail.         
	Immediately after his release from jail, Hazarika left for his residence in Dibrugarh. Soon after, he left with two of his companions, telling his family, whom he met after 18 years, that he had some work and would return within a few days.

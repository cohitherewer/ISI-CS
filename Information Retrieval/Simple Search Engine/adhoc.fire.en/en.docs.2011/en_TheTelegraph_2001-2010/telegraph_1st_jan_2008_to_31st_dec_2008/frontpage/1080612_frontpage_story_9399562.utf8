	Ranchi, June 11: Union home minister Shivraj Patil today said the state governments should frame a surrender policy for Maoists to bring about an early end to Naxalism through mutual talks.        
	To curb Naxalite activity, the Centre had also proposed to take on pilot projects in Palamau and Chatra as model districts  Patil visited these districts today  with emphasis on speedy implementation of development schemes, particularly rural roads, irrigation, health, education and food security.        
	In Chatra, Patil held a meeting with state government officials and also spoke to villagers in Lawalong, known to be a rebel den. However, he could not formally meet Palamau district officials because of paucity of time though he had an interactive session with CRPF jawans on duty there.        
	Providing security to people and ensuring social justice to all through positive developments are primarily the responsibilities of state governments. We are here to lend them necessary support. But, we cant force our decisions on duly elected state governments. We are not averse to Maoists contesting elections, but nothing can be allowed to happen at gunpoint, he added.        
	He said that the government was ready to hold talks with the rebels. But it should be a two-way traffic. He even went to the extent saying that the Maoists did not have international support or bases in different countries which worked in proper co-ordination with each other. At present, there is no need for the Centre to intervene directly. Instead, the states need to work in proper co-ordination with each other, he said.        
	Patil was accompanied by Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, chief minister Madhu Koda and senior officials from both the Union and state governments.        
	The morale of our jawans is quite high. We are lending them all possible support in terms of workforce, modernisation and creating conducive environment. But it is more important for the state government to make proactive efforts through dialogue and mass contact. Proper implementation of welfare schemes too is equally important, he said.        
	Patil said he would not fully accept the Planning Commissions observations on challenges of development in rebel-hit areas. He would consult the finance ministry and other ministries before arriving at a final decision.        
	He also claimed that the number of Maoist casualties has gone up while that of civilians and jawans has declined in the recent past. He added that most of these incidents and casualties were the outcomes of battle of supremacy among different factions of Maoists.        
	Though he did not provide statistics, police records say Jharkhand had accounted for 157 casualties in 482 incidents in 2007, compared to 124 casualties in 310 incidents of Maoist violence in 2006.        
	On the murder of NREGS activist Lalit Mehta, he said that it was for the state government to take necessary steps. The Centre will examine the case, if necessary, Patil added.

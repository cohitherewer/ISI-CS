The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Apex court blow to Sangma coalition
                                                                                                           Apex court blow to Sangma coalition
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY AMP; E.M. JOSE                                    
	New Delhi/Shillong, March 12: The Supreme Court today turned down the Purno A. Sangma-led coalitions plea to reduce the 10-day period granted by the Meghalaya governor to D.D. Lapang to prove his majority in the Assembly.        
	The decision coincided with seven legislators of the Congress-led Meghalaya United Alliance, formed only yesterday, being inducted into the new government. Lapang was the only one to be sworn in on Monday.        
	Sangmas Nationalist Congress Party and its allies in the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA)  including the United Democratic Party, which partnered the Congress in the previous ministry  had contended that governor S.S. Sidhu flouted the norms of democracy by inviting Lapang to form the government and giving him 10 days to muster the numbers required to survive a floor test.        
	Rejecting the suggestion that the Congress had been given time to indulge in unfair means, the apex court posted the MPAs petition for a second hearing on March 24, by which time the floor test will have been held.        
	Lawyer Soli J. Sorabjee had argued that the norm was to give a chief minister who did not have the majority a minimum of five days and a maximum of seven to prove he had the requisite support to retain charge.         
	But the court said it would be unfair not to give Lapang and his team the benefit of the doubt. We are proceeding on the basis that the members are honourable men. Why are you assuming that they can be bought? If you are sure of your men, you dont have to worry.         
	The MPA had paraded 31 legislators before the governor, but he followed convention and called Lapang instead  the Congress is the largest single party with 25 legislators  to form the government.         
	The court said it would not interfere with Assembly proceedings unless extreme situations warranted such a step. Of the seven legislators who were sworn in today, Lapang gave cabinet rank to five. All three Independents who joined the Meghalaya United Alliance were rewarded with berths in the ministry, A.T. Mondal even getting cabinet rank. The two ministers of state are Ismail Marak and Limison Sangma.        
	Those from the Congress who were sworn in are Mukul Sangma as deputy chief minister and M.M. Danggo, R.C. Laloo and Prestone Tynsong as cabinet ministers.        
	By the end of the day, it was clear that Lapang was finding it difficult to balance the aspirations of the Independents supporting him and his own flock. There were quite a few unhappy faces in the Congress camp, though the chief minister did assure them that their needs would be taken care of once the government survived the floor test.         
	The trio of Independents inducted into the ministry did not look happy either. I was asked to come to Raj Bhavan for the swearing-in and I agreed for the time being, Mondal said.        
	He and the other two Independents are mainly worried about the possibility of being dropped from the ministry once it passes the floor test.         
	Since Meghalaya cannot have more than 12 ministers, the challenge for Lapang is to keep his saviours happy without offending his Congress colleagues.

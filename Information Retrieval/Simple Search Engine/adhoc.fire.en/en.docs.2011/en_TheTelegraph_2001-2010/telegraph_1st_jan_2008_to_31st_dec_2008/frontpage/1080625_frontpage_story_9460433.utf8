          OUR BUREAU                              
	June 24: Gorkha leaders today deferred their indefinite hill blockade till July 5 after the Centre agreed to tripartite talks if needed after a meeting later this week between the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and the Bengal government.        
	The assurance is understood to have come from Union home minister Shivraj Patil, who met a four-member Morcha delegation in the capital.        
	In Darjeeling, Morcha media and publicity secretary Binay Tamang said the organisation had received a letter from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee welcoming its decision to send emissaries to Calcutta for talks on Friday.        
	Sources said the Morcha might also have softened its stand realising that Delhi, preoccupied with the nuclear standoff, would have little time to spare.        
	Morcha boss Bimal Gurung hinted as much. We have to look to Delhi and Calcutta while going ahead with our movement. We must not make a mistake for our ultimate aim is to attain statehood. At the moment, we do not know whether the UPA government can survive the nuclear imbroglio, he said in Darjeeling.        
	The Morcha team, which met Patil, demanded statehood for Darjeeling district and contiguous areas in the Dooars and also handed over a map of their proposed Gorkhaland.        
	There has to be a political solution to a political problem. The Centre is positive towards having a tripartite meeting, general secretary Roshan Giri, who led the delegation, said after the meeting.        
	A home ministry release said: If any co-operation is needed, the Union may help the state and others also if such co-operation is asked for.        
	Sources said tripartite talks might be held next month, depending on the outcome of the Morcha delegations meeting in Calcutta.        
	The Centres nod for tripartite talks followed worries over the impact on Sikkim if the Morcha, which was to resume its indefinite bandh from tomorrow, were to again block NH31A, the Himalayan states lifeline.        
	Union defence secretary Vijay Singh and home secretary Madhukar Gupta were in Siliguri today with Bengal chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb to review the situation.        
	In Darjeeling, Sangay Tshering, who heads the Darjeeling Gorkha Hotel Owners Association, said it was perfectly fine for tourists to come to the hill station. We are already getting inquiries but the footfall will be thin as the season has almost drawn to a close.

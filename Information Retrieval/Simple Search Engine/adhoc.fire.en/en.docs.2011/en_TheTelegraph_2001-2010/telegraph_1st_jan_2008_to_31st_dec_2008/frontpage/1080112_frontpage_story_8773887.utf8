	New Delhi/ Chennai, Jan. 11: Pongal will have to be celebrated this year without jallikattu, after the Supreme Court today refused to lift the ban on the sport that pits man against bull.
    
	There can be no confrontation between men and animals. We cannot allow such a barbaric sport. It is cruelty against animals, cruelty against human beings, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said. Men should be known by their civilised behaviour.
    
	A single-judge bench of Madras High Court had imposed the ban in 2006 at the instance of the Animal Welfare Board, which also wanted other sports involving animals such as bullock-cart races to be outlawed. 
    
	Later, a division bench ruled that a complete ban was not feasible and said jallikattu could be held during the festive season under state supervision. For 800 years, the sport has been part of Pongal celebrations. (See chart)
    
	On appeal by the animal board, the Supreme Court stayed this order of July 27, 2007. The state government then applied for the stay to be lifted just for Pongal that falls on January 15 this year. 
    
	The Supreme Court bench headed by the chief justice rejected the appeal. 
    
	Tamil Nadu counsel T.R. Andhyarujina argued that no casualties would take place if the sport was held under strict supervision. The state would ensure that spectators are barricaded to avoid injury. 
    
	To this, the chief justice said: What about the participants? Hundreds of them will be taking part in it. The enraged bull will be let loose on them. Then they will try to control the animal. What about the animal? 
    
	Andhyarujina said the state was alive to the issue of cruelty to animals. The court then asked if the state could guarantee that no one would be injured. In that case, we may lift the ban, Balakrishnan said. 
    
	The government argued that peoples sentiments were involved. But the chief justice dismissed the plea, saying: Let it be bullock-cart races or something like that. 
    
	Tourism department sources said they did not expect the ban to impact flow of visitors. 
    
	However, groups like the Dalit Panthers of India that see themselves as guardians of Tamil culture could fan trouble.

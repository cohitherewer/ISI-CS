          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 8: Mumbai-based K. Raheja Group proposes to set up an IT hub near Bhubaneswar at an estimated cost of Rs 1,000 crore.         
	A delegation, led by group president Neel C. Raheja, met chief minister Naveen Patnaik at the secretariat today and presented their offer.         
	Orissa IT minister Surya Narayan Patro said the delegation presented its profile and gave an offer to set up an IT park in a joint venture with the Orissa government.        
	The Raheja Group, which has successfully ventured into the real estate sector, hospital and IT businesses, has already set up an IT city in Andhra Pradesh and has established IT hubs in Gujarat and Maharashtra.        
	The delegation requested the chief minister to provide 100 acres near Bhubaneswar to set up the park and another 30 acres in the city to establish an IT incubator.         
	But, the Orissa government has already engaged 700 acres for a second Infocity (Infocity-II) being set up between Bhubaneswar and Khurda. Patro offered the Raheja group land in Infocity-II.        
	Bhubaneswar already has an Infocity-I, the states premier IT hub where Infosys has its development centre, and Infocity-II is on its way.         
	Bhubaneswar is fast turning into a major IT destination next to Bangalore and Hyderabad with major IT companies including Infosys, TCS, Satyam, Wipro and MindTree setting up centres.         
	Talking to journalists, chief executive officer of the Raheja group B. Dhamal said they were ready to invest Rs 1,000 crore in the IT project if the required land was available. The group, which has also set up hotels and convention centres across Mumbai with enhanced facilities for business and leisure needs of both international and domestic travellers, has also shown interest to construct hotels in Orissa.         
	The group, which has emerged as one of the top infrastructure developers, also offered to set up a 750MW power plant and take up road projects on public-private partnership mode.         
	Naveen welcomed the offers and asked the chief secretary to co-ordinate with the works, IT and energy departments and study the feasibility of the proposals.

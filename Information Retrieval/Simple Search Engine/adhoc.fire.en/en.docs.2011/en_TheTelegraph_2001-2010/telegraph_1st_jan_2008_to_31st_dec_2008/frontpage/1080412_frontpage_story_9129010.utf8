The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Centre cant digest quota without cream
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Centre cant digest quota without cream
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, April 11: The Centre is likely to challenge the exclusion of the creamy layer from the 27 per cent quota for Other Backward Classes in central higher educational institutions.        
	Sources said the government would go through the motions of filing a review petition because of pressure from UPA partners, although it was likely to be trashed unless heard by a bench larger than the five-judge team that gave the verdict.        
	Parties from Bihar and Tamil Nadu today questioned the rationale of keeping out the creamy layer  families with an annual income above Rs 2.5 lakh  and the purpose behind the quota that excludes them.        
	We have won the battle and lost the war, a Congress minister said.        
	The sources said the Centre did not have much space to make a case for including the creamy layer but had noted the anomalies in the courts observations.        
	For instance, it has recommended a marginally lower cutoff for OBC students but directed the government to fill up vacancies under the quota with students from the general category.        
	At least a concession could have been made so that applicants from the creamy layer could have filled in the vacancies, the minister said.        
	He said the Centre could, at best, tweak the creamy layer criteria by raising the income cap to Rs 5 lakh so that candidates from not too well-off homes got some kind of a level playing field.        
	Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss of the PMK raised the matter at a cabinet meeting. After congratulating HRD minister Arjun Singh, who was unusually bubbly and energetic, he asked if the Centre proposed to let the creamy layer issue pass.         
	Ramadoss was backed by the DMK, the RJD and the Lok Janshakti Party.        
	The Prime Minister said the government would have to read the judgment closely before responding. The Congress was non-committal, but its 30-odd OBC MPs looked set to stand by colleagues from other parties.        
	Just because three or four of us have done well for ourselves, can we overlook the discrimination and suffering most of us were subject to for centuries? Congress MP V. Hanumantha Rao asked.        
	RJD leader D.P. Yadav said: The creamy layer is an iron grille gate for the OBCs, it will shut us out of reservation. It means four or five of our boys and girls might make it to the IIMs and medical colleges while the rest will continue to plough the field and work the cattle.        
	Sources said the Centre would be asked to spell out its stand on April 15, the day the House reconvenes. The Centre may move the court tomorrow.

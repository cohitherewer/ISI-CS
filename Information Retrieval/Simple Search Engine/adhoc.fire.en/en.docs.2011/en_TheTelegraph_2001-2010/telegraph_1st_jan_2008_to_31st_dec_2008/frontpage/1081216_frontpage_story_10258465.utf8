	Ranchi, Dec. 15: The income tax (I-T) department today told Jharkhand High Court that it was aware of the assets acquired by ministers of the state that were disproportionate to their incomes.         
	I-T officer Ranjit Kumar Lal, in an affidavit, said his department had the information of the properties acquired by ministers Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Kamlesh Singh, Bandhu Tirkey, Dulal Bhuiyan and former minister Chandra Prakash Choudhary  and maintained that an investigation to find out the sources was on.         
	Lal further stated that more documents had to be scrutinised before a consensus could be obtained.        
	Earlier, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Gyan Sudha Mishra and Justice Ajit Kumar Sinha had directed the I-T department to file a status report in the matter and inform the court of the developments. A similar order was directed to the vigilance department to probe into the income and assets of Hari Narayan Rai and Anosh Ekka. The vigilance report would be discussed on January 22, 2009.        
	The case of disproportionate assets of ministers began with a PIL filed by one Durga Oraon. Oraon, in a supplementary affidavit, had revealed properties acquired by water resources minister Kamlesh Singh in the name of his wife Madhu Singh and children Surya Sonal Singh and Ankita Singh in Edalhatu on the outskirts of Ranchi.         
	Singh allegedly also owns property in prime locations across the state capital  including a duplex in Aastha Regency Apartment at Piska More and three acres at Katahal More in Ratu Block. Most of the properties are registered in the names of his family members.        
	Oraon has also named former minister Chandra Prakash Choudhary of acquiring assets worth crores in Ramgarh. The affidavit alleges that Choudhary has floated a construction company with an Ahmedabad link and is allegedly funding real estate projects.        
	Health minister Bhanu Pratap Sahi has also been accused of amassing assets in Uttar Pradesh and Gurgaon. Oraon has alleged that Sahi has purchased land at Rapasganj in Sonbhadra district of Uttar Pradesh. Sahi is also said to be constructing a shopping mall in Gurgaon and is pegged to have property over Rs 100 crore.        
	Oraons PIL also mentions former chief minister Madhu Koda and his friend Binod Sinha as owners of properties beyond their disclosed income. Both Koda and Sinha have properties in India and abroad that have been purchased through illegal means  the PIL alleges.

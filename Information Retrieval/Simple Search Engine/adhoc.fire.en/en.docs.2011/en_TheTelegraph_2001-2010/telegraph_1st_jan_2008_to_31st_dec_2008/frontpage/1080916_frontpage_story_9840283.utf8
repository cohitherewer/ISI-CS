          ANIL BUDUR LULLA                            A policeman chases away a protester in Mangalore. (AP)                                  
	Bangalore, Sept. 15: A Sangh parivar activist was stabbed this evening in Mangalore, a day after suspected bike-borne Bajrang Dal gangs raided churches simultaneously.        
	Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa, arriving in the communally charged town after a gentle reminder from the Prime Minister to protect minorities, promised to restore law and order. His assurance capped a day in which police struggled to control Christian groups who took to the streets against the raids.         
	Deepak, a Bajrang Dal man, was walking down a square when he was allegedly chased, beaten up and stabbed by the protesters before police rescued him.        
	The Bajrang Dal owned up to yesterdays mayhem that saw a Holy Cross being damaged, sacred figurines smashed and other structures torn down.         
	The admission came with a clarification, though: only Pentecostal prayer halls whose missions were allegedly converting people by force  and not Catholic churches -- had been targeted.         
	We had observed them (Pentecostal members) for many Sundays. They were distributing anti-Hindu literature, local Bajrang Dal leader Mahendra Kumar said.         
	None of the 20 youths picked up since last night for questioning was from the saffron outfit. The police today said 15 prayer halls had been stormed, revising the figure from yesterdays 10.         
	Father Adolf Washington, president of the Indian Catholic Press Association, said he feared a rerun of the Orissa turmoil. These groups (Bajrang Dal and the VHP) have been blatantly targeting minorities.         
	Washington suspected a strategy to split the Church between new-life groups and Catholics but said the designs would fail as we are one body and believe only in Jesus Christ.

  - Resentment in MPA over portfolios        E.M. JOSE                                           
	Shillong, March 22: Rumblings have surfaced in the five-day-old Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA) government over allocation of portfolios.         
	The major cause of resentment is the allocation of plum portfolios to newcomers. Chief minister Donkupar Roy, in an apparent bid to keep his wafer-thin-majority regime afloat, has kept next to nothing for himself.         
	Ministers and legislators disclosed that the resentment surfaced right after the portfolios were allocated on Thursday night. Several heavy and critical portfolios were handed over to first-time MLAs like Conrad Sangma, son of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader P.A. Sangma, E.C. Bamon of the NCP, Adviser Pariong of the Hill State Peoples Democratic Party (HSPDP) and Independent Donkupar Massar.         
	 Most legislators felt the NCP (with 14 MLAs) had cornered most of the coveted portfolios. The HSPDP, too, has raked in the moolah, given that it has only two MLAs. The party has a deputy chief minister in Hopingstone Lyngdoh, in charge of crucial departments like home (police) and PWD (roads) and Pariong with health and family welfare, horticulture, reorganisation and elections.        
	An MPA minister said the majority felt that at least the finance portfolio should have gone to the chief minister, who is also the president of United Democratic party (UDP). But this was not taken into account by the NCP.         
	Finance has been bagged by Conrad Sangma of the NCP along with four other important portfolios, while Roy has been left with planning, personnel and minor portfolios not allotted to anyone else.         
	A former minister in the previous government said Roy, besides having been their deputy chief minister, had always held the finance portfolio. Despite many reshuffles, the Congress never took away finance from Roy as he was well versed in the subject.         
	 One UDP member commented that Conrad Sangma appeared to be the de facto chief minister as Roy was without any major portfolio. Another UDP leader said P.A. Sangmas proclamation of sacrifice for the sake of unity was only for public consumption.         
	A Congress legislator told this correspondent that talks were on with some UDP leaders who were concerned about Sangmas dictatorial attitude. NCP sources defended the allocation of portfolios saying they were the single largest party and had got only three berths like the UDP, which has 11 members.         
	The UDP was initially undecided on whether former chief minister J.D. Rymbai, should be made a minister. Those in favour of J.A. Lyngdoh argued that Rymbai, a former Congressman, was a newcomer.         
	With Rymbai out, there is no representation in the ministry from Ri Bhoi district. There is also no representation from South Garo Hills.

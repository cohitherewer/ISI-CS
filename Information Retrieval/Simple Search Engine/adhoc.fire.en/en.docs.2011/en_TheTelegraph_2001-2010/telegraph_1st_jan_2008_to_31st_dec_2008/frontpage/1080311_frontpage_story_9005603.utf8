          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gangtok, March 10: The Sikkim Legislative Assembly today adopted a resolution that demanded smooth flow of passenger and goods traffic on NH31A as well as compensation for frequent hold-ups on the highway.         
	The resolution comes in the wake of the recent bandhs that plagued the Darjeeling hills and the plains in Siliguri. The protests often spilled onto NH31A  Sikkims only direct link with the rest of the country, as there are no railways or airports in the state.         
	Sikkim urban development and land revenue minister D.D. Bhutia, who introduced the resolution, cited the recent indefinite shutdown called by the Morcha in the Darjeeling hills. Sikkim has suffered loss of hundreds of crores since the agitation (for Gorkhaland) began in Darjeeling in 1985. This loss to the state deserves to be compensated, Bhutia said.         
	Bengal chief secretary A.K. Deb said he would not comment on the possibility of the state government coughing up a compensation for frequent hold-ups on NH31A. However, an official in the secretariat said a resolution can be passed by a House but it cannot be binding on any government. Jurist Arunava Ghosh agreed. No state has the right to ask another to compensate it for disruption of traffic on the highway. Neither is such a resolution binding.

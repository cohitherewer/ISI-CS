          RUDRA BISWAS                              
	Ranchi, June 5: A three- member delegation of the Jharkhand Petroleum Dealers Association will meet finance minister Stephen Marandi tomorrow to press for rationalisation of taxes on petroleum products.        
	The move comes in the wake of a sharp reduction of taxes on petrol and diesel by the Bengal government and an assurance by the Bihar government not to impose taxes on the increased prices.        
	A three-member delegation, including president Ashok Singh and general secretary Sharad Dudani, will meet Marandi and submit a petition to follow the Bihar and Bengal models and provide relief to consumers, said association spokesperson Kalika Sah.         
	Petrol pumps located in areas bordering Bengal and Bihar were pushed on the backfoot because of higher rates of taxes in Jharkhand.         
	As a result, vehicles coming into the state prefered to refill in Bengal and Bihar.        
	To add to the losses, he said, the hike in prices have forced dealers to invest more in the same quantity of petrol and diesel. For a single tanker, added investments are in the range of Rs 60,000 to Rs 1 lakh. The dealers are losing money with oil companies refusing to hike dealer commission.        
	Marandi only said the government was keeping a close tab on the situation and would take appropriate steps once the prevailing unrest all over the country subsides and a final stand by the Centre becomes clear.

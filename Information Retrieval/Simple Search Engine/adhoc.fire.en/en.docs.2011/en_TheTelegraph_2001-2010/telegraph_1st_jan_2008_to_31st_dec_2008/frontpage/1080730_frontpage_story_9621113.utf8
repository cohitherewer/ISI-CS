          LYNDSEY LAYTON                            Health first                                  
	Washington, July 29: Congressional negotiators agreed yesterday to a ban on a family of toxins found in childrens products, handing a major victory to parents and health experts who have been clamouring the government to remove harmful chemicals from toys.        
	The ban, which would take effect in six months, would have significant implications for US consumers, whose homes are filled with hundreds of plastic products designed for children that may be causing dangerous health effects.        
	The rare action by Congress reflects a growing body of scientific research showing that children ingest the toxins by acts as simple as chewing on a rubber duck. Used for decades in plastic production, the chemicals are now thought to act as hormones and cause reproductive problems, especially in boys.        
	It also signals an important crack in the chemical industrys ability to fend off federal regulation and suggests that the landscape may be shifting to favour consumers.         
	The movement to ban the toxins accelerated last year when California prohibited their use in childrens products.        
	Earlier this year, the countrys largest retailer, Wal-Mart, the biggest toy seller, Toys R Us and Babies R Us told their suppliers that they will no longer carry products containing the chemicals, known as phthalates, as of January 1, 2009. Toys containing these chemicals, however, will still be on many retail shelves during the holiday season.        
	White House spokesman Tony Fratto said that President Bush opposes the ban but that it is too early to say whether he will veto the measure, which is part of popular legislation to reform the Consumer Product Safety Commission.         
	Among other things, the legislation would ban lead in childrens products and would give consumers access to a new database of complaints or accident reports for goods. The measure also allows stiffer fines for violations and enhanced enforcement of consumer safety laws.        
	Under language finalised yesterday, House and Senate lawmakers agreed to permanently ban three types of phthalates from childrens toys and to outlaw three other phthalates from products pending an extensive study of their health effects in children and pregnant women.        
	Phthalates make plastics softer and more durable and also are added to perfumes, lotions, shampoos and other items. They are so ubiquitous that in one 1999 study, the Food and Drug Administration found traces in all of its 1,000 subjects.

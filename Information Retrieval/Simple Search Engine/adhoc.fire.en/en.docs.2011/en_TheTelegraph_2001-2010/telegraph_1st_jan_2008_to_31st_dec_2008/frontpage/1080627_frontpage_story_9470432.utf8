  - Chiang Mai conclave has no effect on warring groups          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Kohima, June 26: Eight cadres of two NSCN factions were killed in gunbattles in the Dimapur area while their leaders discussed peace and reconciliation at Chiang Mai in Thailand.         
	Three cadres  two from the NSCN (K) and one from NSCN (I-M)  were killed at Doyapur near Dimapur when the Khaplang faction attacked the hideout of its rival at 1am today. Eight hours later, a 100-strong contingent of the NSCN (I-M) swooped down on a camp of its rival at Vihokhu, 10km from Dimapur, leaving five dead and several injured. Two members of the NSCN (I-M) were injured in the gunfight.        
	The men also torched scores of vehicles in the camp. We torched around 40 vehicles and all the houses, except the church, said Vikiye Sumi, deputy kilonser (minister) for ministry of information and publicity of the NSCN (I-M).         
	Several top leaders of the NSCN (K) were in the camp when NSCN (I-M) attacked it. But they escaped the onslaught, leaving behind incriminating documents and the vehicles.         
	Witness said all the vehicles were set ablaze and the camp, which had around 50 houses, was razed. Only the church was left standing.         
	NSCN (I-M) leader Sumi said the cadres of rival group have scattered. Some surrendered to the NSCN (I-M) but Sumi could not furnish the details.         
	Later this morning, the Assam Rifles, India Reserve Battalion personnel and officials of the Dimapur district administration reached the area.         
	The NSCN (I-M) has withdrawn from the area. We have withdrawn our boys from the area, Sumi said. The outfit also recovered some arms from the camp.         
	After the incident, several Naga organisations also visited the spot.         
	The turf war coincided with efforts by the World Baptist Alliance and the UK-based Quakers Group to broker peace and reconciliation between the warring Naga factions.         
	Wangtin Konyak and Lhokuto Sumi are representing the NSCN (K) at the Chiang Mai meeting.         
	NSCN (I-M) chairman Isak Chishi Swu had spoken to Khaplang and also written to Khole Konyak, commander-in-chief of the rival group, for peace and reconciliation.         
	Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio, reacting to the factional clashes, said good sense should prevail among the Naga factions on the sidelines of the Chiang Mai meeting, which had recorded positive development.         
	NSCN (K) leader Khugalu Mulatonu, who claimed to have been in the camp when the attack took place, vowed to avenge the assault.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph from an undisclosed location, he said the NSCN (K) would continue to resist, what he termed terrorism on Naga soil.         
	We will not allow terrorists to remain in Nagaland, the rebel leader said.

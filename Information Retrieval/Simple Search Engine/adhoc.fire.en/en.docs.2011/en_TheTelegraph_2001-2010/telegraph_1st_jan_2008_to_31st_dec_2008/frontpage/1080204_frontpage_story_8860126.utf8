     OUR BUREAU
               
	Bhubaneswar/Jharkhand, Feb. 3: Orissa government has objected to the Centres directive to cull poultry in a radius of 5km in the districts bordering avian influenza-hit Bengal.
    
	The Union agriculture ministry, in a notification issued on Friday night, directed Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and Assam to cull uninfected poultry birds to prevent the spread of the H5N1 virus to create an immunity belt between the bird flu-hit districts of Bengal and its neighbouring states.
    
	But the state government is not willing to undertake culling of healthy birds. 
    
	Its inhuman to cull our healthy birds, said veterinary department director Bishnupada Sethi. It would lead to a scarcity in Orissa, he said. 
    
	The problem is in Bengal. Its unwise to look for solution for avian influenza in Orissa. The Centre should look into the happenings in Bengal.
    
	The veterinary department director said the state government was going to write to the Centre requesting it to ensure culling or seizure of infected birds and those available in the markets of Bengal first. 
    
	Poultry farmers in Orissa have also objected to the Centres directive to undertake chicken culling in states adjoining Bengal fearing that it would lead to an influx of infected birds into the state.
    
	The Balasore district administration has clamped Section 144 on Friday evening in at least five blocks to check the entry of poultry and its products. The ban has been imposed in Bhogarai, Baliapal, Jaleswar, Sadar and Bahanaga. 
    
	Earlier, it was in force in 72 border villages in the district.
    
	Steps in Jharkhand 
    
	The East Singbhum administration is taking several precautionary steps in the wake of the bird flu scare in Bengal.
    
	The administration has acquired personal protection equipment (PPE) essential for on-field personnel. It has also stocked up medicines to be used during emergencies, East Singhbhum civil surgeon P.C. Hembrom said today.
    
	Veterinary doctors had been asked to visit villages on the border daily and collect samples from birds to be sent for testing. The doctors have been trained to react in case of an emergency, he added.

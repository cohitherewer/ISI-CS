                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Junket gift for Koda allies
          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, April 13: The chief minister is caught in the cobweb of coalition politics even as his days are apparently numbered. His latest unity move is to take as many MLAs as possible on junkets abroad.        
	Although Madhu Koda cancelled a scheduled trip of the mines and geology department to Beijing for a two-day iron ore summit, a nine-member team is ready to represent the state at Hannover Messe, an international trade fair in Germany, from April 21 to 25.        
	The nine-member team to China  of which Koda was part  included Annapurna Devi (RJD), Champai Soren (JMM) and state Congress chief Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu, besides principal secretary in the chief ministers office Sukhdeo Singh, chief ministers personal secretary Harendra Singh, director (mines) B.B. Singh, mines and geology department secretary Jaishankar Tiwary and director (geology) K.S.P. Singh.        
	However, the worldwide protest over Tibet issue prompted Koda and his team to refrain from going to China for the April 28-29 summit. Sources close to the chief minister confirmed the cancellation of his China visit. This is not the right time to go to China, said one of the officials.        
	In fact, formal clearances from the Centre were not received for the China trip, unlike that of Hannover.        
	In the other scheduled foreign trip to Hannover  it includes a two-day stopover in Zurich, Switzerland and a Paris visit on the way back  the state would be represented by two deputy chief ministers Sudhir Mahto and Stephen Marandi. But the Koda government has ensured that other UPA partners arent left out. They include Manoj Yadav (Congress), Girinath Singh (RJD), state khadi board chairman Jainandu and odd man out, JD(U) MLA Radha Krishna Kishore, who makes it to the team despite being part of the NDA camp.        
	Three others include industry secretary K.K. Khandelwal, director (industry) Sunil Kumar and industry special secretary Dhirendra Kumar.        
	I am certainly going to Hannover. Last time my chances of a foreign visit was ruined by one of my party colleagues who was at the helm of affairs, said Kishore, adding that he had already packed for the trip starting April 17.        
	Girinath sounded jubilant while speaking over phone from Garhwa. My visa has been cleared forGermany.        
	But government sources said that no seminar would be held exclusively for Jharkhand at Hannover Messe. We will put up a pavilion at the fair. ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel are expected to co-partner the state in showcasing its mineral base, said an official.

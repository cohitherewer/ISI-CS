                                                                                                        Hesh amp; Lee clash over party
          JAYDEEP BASU                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi today found a new issue to disagree in public  whether team-mate Prakash Amritraj was right to go to a late-night party the weekend before a Davis Cup tie.        
	At the evening media briefing, Bhupathi said it was merely a birthday party and he, too, might have gone.        
	Yesterday, Paes had alleged that Amritraj had been unprofessional in attending the party last Saturday.        
	Next day, he took ill and was throwing all over, the non-playing captain had said after leaving the young player out of yesterdays opening-day singles against Uzbekistan on the ground of fitness.        
	Bhupathi was sitting next to Paes today  after he and Rohan Bopanna had put India 2-1 ahead by winning the doubles  when he was asked to comment on the controversy. He did not duck the question.        
	What I know (is that) it was merely a birthday party and I was also invited, he said. I could not go. No alcohol was involved. We are all professionals and know where to draw the line.        
	Paes continued to insist that Amritraj should not have gone but denied accusing him of drinking, as hinted in a newspaper.        
	I said it was indiscipline to go out for a late-night party but it was conjured up as if I had called him an indisciplined guy. Things about drinking, smoking... I never said all that. I know he is a good boy and I told him that.        
	Amritraj was quoted in the media as saying he had been fit, but Bhupathi came to his juniors defence again.        
	How can we blame Prakash? He was flooded with calls from the media and was asked all sorts of ridiculous questions on drinking and partying. You try to ignore it but have to react at some point.        
	Bhupathi added: Everyone has an opinion and he had the right to express himself.        
	Paes said: I am not upset about him (Amritraj) going to the media. He has the right to feel the way he felt. The whole thing has been blown out of proportion. I had a half-an-hour chat with him and everything has been settled.

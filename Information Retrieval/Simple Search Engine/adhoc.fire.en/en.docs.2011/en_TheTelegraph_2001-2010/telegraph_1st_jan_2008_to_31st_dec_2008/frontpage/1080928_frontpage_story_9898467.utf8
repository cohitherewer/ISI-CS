          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 27: Nine in 10 persons in Indias four metros support the proposed ban on smoking in public and workplaces from October 2, anti-tobacco activists have claimed after a snapshot survey.         
	The survey, commissioned by the Healis Sekhsaria Institute of Public Health, Mumbai, found that 92 per cent of respondents favoured smoke-free public spaces and workplaces, and 99 per cent agreed that restaurants must be smoke-free.         
	And 95 per cent believe the right of non-smokers to breathe smoke-free air in workplaces and public places is more important than the right of smokers wishing to continue puffing away, according to the survey which questioned 1,030 people.         
	This tells us that the public overwhelmingly wants smoke-free public places and workplaces, Monika Arora, convener of the Advocacy Forum for Tobacco Control, a non-government organisation lobbying for tougher anti-tobacco laws, said yesterday. The tobacco and hotel industries whove gone to court are working against peoples desires, Arora said.         
	The health ministry has notified the ban in all workplaces and public places, including shopping malls, open auditoriums, hotels, pubs and restaurants, from October 2.         
	Sections of the tobacco and hotel industries have challenged the move. The cases will come up for hearing in Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court next week.         
	These rules are specifically aimed to protect non-smokers from second-hand smoke, Arora said. The survey has shown that 84 per cent of respondents believe that exposure to second-hand smoke is a serious health hazard. Studies have shown that second-hand smoke can harm the health of non-smokers.         
	Ireland, Italy, New Zealand and the UK are among countries that have introduced smoke-free rules.         
	There is evidence that such steps reduce the risk to non-smokers and to smokers, said K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi.         
	Public health specialists believe that the new rules will significantly reduce the available space for smoking and prompt a number of smokers to reconsider each time they want a smoke. We expect the proportion of those who quit to go up as the new rules come into effect, said Arora.         
	Under the new rules, only hotels and restaurants with more than 30 seats will be allowed to have smoking zones with appropriate physical barriers.        
	Three years ago, a review of 115 studies from Australia, Canada and the US showed that smoke-free legislation does not have a negative impact on sales, revenues and employment of restaurants, bars and hotels over the long term.

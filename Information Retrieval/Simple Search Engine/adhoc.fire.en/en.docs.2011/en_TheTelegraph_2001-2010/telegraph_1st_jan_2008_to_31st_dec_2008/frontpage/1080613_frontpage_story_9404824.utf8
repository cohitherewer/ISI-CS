	Jaipur, June 12: The hustle is back in the walled city, but the fear remains.        
	The narrow lanes and alleys of Jaipurs fabled pink city bustle with shoppers and shopkeepers trying hard to put behind them the nightmare of May the 13th, when 66 people perished in a series of explosions. But behind the friendly smile lurks suspicion and distrust, the result of the first terror attack on the tourism hub.        
	A month on, life has almost returned to normal in Chhoti Chaupar, Badi Chaupar, Tripolia Bazaar, Chandpole Bazaar, Johri Bazaar, Hawa Mahal, Chaura Rasta, Bapu Bazaar, Nehru Bazaar and Hanuman Mandir, the areas worst affected by the blasts. The terror taint, however, remains etched in the minds of residents and shopkeepers.        
	Says Ahmed, a descendant of the legendary Kadar Bux, whose Jaipuri razai is famous the world over and who has rows of shops in front of Hawa Mahal: The serial blasts have really scared us. We are now always on the lookout for somebody suspicious, especially unknown faces who come and park their bicycles or scooters nearby. In the past several decades, never did we ever feel the need to keep vigil or think something like this could happen here.         
	Shopkeepers say sales have dropped and so have visitors. Even if the tourists come, Ahmed says: They invariably ask us about the blasts and where they happened. We cannot even assure them of total safety. The fear of repeat blasts, and last months blood and gore still haunt us so what can we tell the tourists?         
	Although police patrolling has gone up in the area with the headquarters situated just behind Hawa Mahal  the landmark structure of the pink city  shopkeepers try and keep their eyes open.         
	Roadside vendors, who have been selling their wares for years, have become more vigilant and watch out for strangers. Youth groups have been formed in different areas to monitor and gates are being put up in residential areas.         
	Says Ashok of Lal Chand Ashok Kumar, who has a general merchandise shop in Chhoti Chaupar: With thousands converging here for business and trade every day, it is difficult to keep track of anybody suspicious. We are concerned, nothing much has improved since the blasts, there is still the parking problem with rickshaws, cars, camel carts, cow carts, cycles, two-wheelers all jostling for space, which is hard to find.         
	Over 10,000 shops crowd at least 16 bazaars, spread over a radius of 5km. The encroachments on the footpaths leave little space for pedestrians.         
	Add to that heavy traffic and limited space for parking. Police say it is practically impossible to keep track of anybody dubious or anything fishy.         
	These problems were precisely what helped the terrorists meticulously plan the May 13 mayhem, which took place within a span of 13 minutes and within a radius of 5km, leaving 66 dead.

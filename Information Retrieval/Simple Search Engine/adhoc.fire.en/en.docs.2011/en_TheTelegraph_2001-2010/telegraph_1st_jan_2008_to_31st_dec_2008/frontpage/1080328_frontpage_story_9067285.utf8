	Lucknow, March 27: A Holi milan party has landed an Uttar Pradesh MP in trouble, with police alleging that he had got scantily-clad bar girls to perform obscene dances well into the unholy hours.         
	Amroha MP Harish Nagpal said the entertainment was of a pure kind. But the Moradabad deputy inspector-general, Badri Prasad Singh, said the dances continued beyond the 11pm curfew without police permission.         
	The dance programme crossed all the levels of decency. We have got photographs and video footage of the MP himself dancing, a police officer said.         
	Singh told reporters today the Independent legislator had thrown the party at his three-star Meridian hotel on March 24 in Amroha.        
	A case has been registered against Nagpal, who is now untraceable, and the hotel.         
	According to the police, at least 12 bar dancers were brought from Mumbai to entertain Nagpals 40-odd guests. They walked into the dining hall of the hotel in the western Uttar Pradesh town, some 300km from Lucknow, around 8pm. The partying continued till midnight.        
	Nagpal is close to the Samajwadi Party. His wife is a Samajwadi MLA.         
	Two years ago, he had allegedly hired girls from Uzbekistan for a party and got booked. Nagpal, however, dismissed these as canards being spread by opponents.

	Calcutta, Feb. 29: Income-tax payers are among the biggest beneficiaries of the budget with some standing to add over Rs 45,000 to their annual savings.        
	The finance minister has proposed to increase the basic exemption limit as well as realign income slabs with different tax brackets.         
	However, the saving in tax liability will not be the same for all. The benefit will be the least for individuals who are 65 years or more and the maximum for men below 65 years and earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh a year.         
	The basic exemption limit for men below 65 years will be raised to Rs 150,000 from Rs 110,000  an increase of Rs 40,000. The hike is only Rs 35,000 for women (below 65 years) to Rs 180,000 from the current Rs 145,000.        
	The increase is still lower for senior citizens (65 years or more for tax purposes)  from Rs 195,000 to Rs 225,000.         
	The differential increases in threshold income limits for different categories partly explain why the reduction in the tax burden of senior citizens (65 years or more) would be less than that of a male or a female (who are less than 65 years) taxpayer having the same annual income.         
	The realignment of slabs, too, helps those below 65 more. At present, annual income between Rs 1.1 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh attracts a tax rate of 10 per cent. The next bracket (till Rs 2.5 lakh) is 20 per cent and the last (above Rs 2.5 lakh) is 30 per cent. After the realignment, the 10 per cent rate will be extended to Rs 3 lakh. Income up to Rs 5 lakh will attract 20 per cent, instead of the current 30 per cent. Above Rs 5 lakh, the tax will be 30 per cent.        
	The realignment reduces the tax liability more for men below 65 years and the least for senior citizens because the basic exemption limits for senior citizens and women below 65 years are already higher than that for men below 65 years.         
	However, at each income slab, senior citizens will pay less tax than individuals below 65 years.         
	Beyond Rs 10 lakh, the reduction in tax burden will be less because income above this continues to attract a surcharge of 10 per cent.         
	Annual premium up to Rs 15,000 paid for medical insurance for parents will also qualify for deduction under Section 80D. This is in addition to the existing deduction of Rs 15,000 available to the taxpayers and the immediate familys (spouse and children) medical insurance.

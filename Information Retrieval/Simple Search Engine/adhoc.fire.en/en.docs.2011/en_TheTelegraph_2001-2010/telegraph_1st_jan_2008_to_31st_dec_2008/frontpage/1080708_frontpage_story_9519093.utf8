          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, July 7: Three pro-peace leaders of Ulfas 28 battalion were expelled from the outfit for anti-organisational activities and initiating talks with colonial India.        
	In a statement, Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa said Mrinal Hazarika, Moon Borah alias Jiten Dutta and Joon Sonowal alias Joon Bhuyan have been expelled from the primary membership of the organisation from today.         
	He said all the activities carried on by the pro-talks leaders in the name of Ulfa were illegal and unconstitutional and appealed to the existing members of the outfit and the people of Assam not to extend any co-operation to the group in its initiative.         
	The Ulfa chairman, however, was silent on the other members of the outfit who have also joined the peace process.        
	The expulsion seemed to have had no effect on the 28 battalion leaders, with a defiant Moon Borah asserting that they would take the process to its logical end, come what may.         
	We are in the midst of receiving feedback from the people and our mission will end only after informing our central leadership what the people want. If after that our leaders want to hand us even death penalty, well accept it, Borah said, adding that the chairman had no authority to expel anybody and only the central committee could do so.         
	We are not here to cause a split in the organisation or show disrespect to our leadership, Borah added.        
	He said irrespective of the expulsion, they would continue to work as Ulfa members. If we have defied the organisations constitution, then so has the chairman.         
	Borah said the peace process was begun by two companies of a battalion and their cadres and the outfit cannot brush aside the move as an initiative by just a handful of leaders.         
	The people of Assam are craving for a solution to the vexed problem and the initiative of the two companies was to honour the wishes of the people, Borah said. No organisation can be above the people.         
	He appealed to the Ulfa leadership not to take any step which would be inimical to the peace process.         
	Such a step will only poison the atmosphere necessary to restore peace and normalcy in the state, Borah added.         
	Army troops, on the other hand, apprehended two Ulfa militants of 27 battalion, Prasanna Bora and Hiranya Bhuyan, from Balipara in Sonitpur district on Monday evening.

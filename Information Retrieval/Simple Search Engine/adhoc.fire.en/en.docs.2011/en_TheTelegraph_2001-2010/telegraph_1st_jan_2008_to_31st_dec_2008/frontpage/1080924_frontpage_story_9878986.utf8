          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                            Jagannath Mahto                                  
	Bokaro, Sept. 23: Inspector- general (coal belt) Bibhuti Bhushan Pradhan today declared that he would take stern action against policemen, including senior officers, for having failed to execute an arrest warrant pending against JMMs Dumri MLA Jagannath Mahto since 2003.        
	Mahto, who is wanted in connection with a murder case that dates back to 1985, has been attending the ongoing Assembly and has said the matter (of his pending arrest) wasnt important and that he was consulting lawyers on his next move.         
	Today, he was the star attraction at a gathering of over 1,000 people when he garlanded the statue of one of the founders of Jharkhand, Late Binod Behari Mahto, at Bhandaridah about 55 kmfromhere around 10 am. Girdih MP Teklal Mahto was also present.        
	Pradhan had asked Bokaro SP Priya Dube to take necessary action after she was ordered by Bokaro district judge B.B. Mangal Murthy to execute the permanent arrest warrant issued against Jagannath Mahto on 3 April 2003 by additional district judge of the Tenughat fast-track court.         
	Dubey had then claimed to have issued instructions to the officer in-charge of Chandrapura police station. But the police have cut a sorry figure as none was able to arrest the MLA even though he has been regularly attending public functions, often in the company of VIPS, and has been fairly accessible to the media.        
	According to high-level police sources, Dubey was learnt to have recently told the IG that the MLA had promised to surrender before the Tenughat court on 23 September and that there was no reason to disbelieve him.         
	Pradhan said he had asked Dubey to take action against those who had been assigned the task of arresting the MLA but had failed to do so. She was also asked to assign a fresh group of policemen for the task, he added.         
	Mahtos supporters claimed their leader whom they call Tiger Jagannath was ready to go to jail and had gone to Ranchi today to meet party boss and chief minister Shibu Soren. While Mahto made himself unavailable after the morning function, his supporters apparently called up a few local journalists to offer thema ride to Tenughat if and when their leader surrendered.

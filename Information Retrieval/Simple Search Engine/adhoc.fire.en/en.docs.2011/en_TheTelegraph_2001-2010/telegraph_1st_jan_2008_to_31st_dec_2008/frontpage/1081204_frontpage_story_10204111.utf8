  - Peeved rebels may strike again, say cops          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Guwahati/Nagaon, Dec. 3: Dispur today beefed up security and sought additional forces for Karbi Anglong apprehending more attacks on the Hindi-speaking population after an anti-talks Karbi militant group gunned down two persons of the community in the district yesterday.        
	Police said there could be more attacks on the community as the outfit was peeved at the governments alleged indifference to its demands.        
	The police have also stepped up security along the railway tracks and stations in the district in view of the economic blockade clamped by the outfit, which had warned the government against running of trains during the period.         
	The first day of the economic blockade yesterday saw the death of five persons in the two attacks. Suspected Karbi Longri National Liberation Front (KLNLF) cadres planted a timer device on the Lumding-Tinsukia passenger train which exploded as soon as the train arrived at Diphu station. While initial reports said three persons, including a five-year old boy, were killed and 35 passengers injured in the blast, the NF Railway tonight claimed that only two persons were killed. The third person who was said to have been killed was, in fact, admitted to Dimapur Army Hospital with serious injuries, it added.        
	NF Railway chief public relations officer Samir Goswami said while Raj Debnath and Kamal Singh Teron died in the explosion, a woman, 26-year-old Moni Debnath, was under treatment at the army hospital.        
	However, Karbi Anglong additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Nityananda Goswami iterated that three persons had died. He added that besides Raj and Kamal, Namita Debnath was also killed in the blast. All the three bodies had been claimed by the relatives, he added.        
	A senior police official said since the district was the largest in the state, more security personnel were needed to cover the vulnerable areas. There were no reports of any fresh incidents today but tension was palpable among the non-Karbis living in the interior areas.                          
	Goswami said operations against the militants involved in yesterdays train blast were on but no arrests had been made.                    
	We are continuing patrolling on the railway tracks, he said. Vehicles plying on National Highways 36 and 39 were also being provided with police escorts, he said.        
	The Karbi Anglong district administration today wrote to the railways seeking two more trolleys for patrolling the tracks to ensure night-running of trains through the district adjoining Nagaland.        
	The terror attacks in the volatile district figured prominently in the weekly security review meeting chaired by chief minister Tarun Gogoi at his residence this evening. The chief minister cancelled a trip to Delhi today in view of the situation.         
	Gogoi took feedback from all sources and asked those in charge of security to take necessary action to prevent a repeat, a source in the chief ministers office said.         
	The Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council chief executive member Mangalsingh Engti iterated that the council was always keen to create a peaceful environment for paving the way for a political dialogue between the KLNLF which claimed responsibility for the train blast and the government.         
	Engti requested the militant outfit to withdraw the indefinite economic blockade in the greater interest of peace, harmony and development of the backward hilly district. If they (militants) are interested in a political negotiation they should come out openly. I assure them the necessary help for a peaceful settlement of their demands.

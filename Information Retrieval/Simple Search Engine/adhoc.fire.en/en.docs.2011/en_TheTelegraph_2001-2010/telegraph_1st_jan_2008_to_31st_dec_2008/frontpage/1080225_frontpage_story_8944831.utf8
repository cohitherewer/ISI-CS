The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Power crisis to persist
                                                                                                           Power crisis to persist
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 24: The residents of the state will have to persist with prolonged power cuts till the end of this month.        
	Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) today conceded that there was an acute power crisis following a complete collapse of the states premier thermal power generation unit at Tenughat.         
	In a public appeal issued by JSEB, it was pointed out that the board was trying its best to purchase power from external sources even at a huge cost of Rs 10 a unit.         
	During daytime, power is available for Rs 8 to Rs 10 per unit. However during the peak evening hours, the availability of power is severely restricted, the power board appeal stated.        
	Expressing solidarity with the thousands of students who are due to appear for their school-leaving exams beginning later this month, the electricity board appealed to residents to switch to CFL to conserve power. Make your friends and your neighbours realise the need to conserve power at this juncture, the JSEB appeal stressed.        
	Beginning February 21, most parts of the state plunged into darkness after a technical snag forced a complete shutdown of Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited (TVNL). Though TVNL sources had confirmed that they would require a prolonged shut down of at least 10 days, JSEB had claimed that normalcy would be restored latest by February 23 and asked its consumers to bear with it.        
	But as there was no respite from prolonged black outs even after February 23, JSEB was forced to concede today that the present power crisis in the state would continue till the end of this month.         
	Meanwhile, TVNL chief engineer P.N. Singh told The Telegraph that their engineers were working round the clock to repair the damaged unit at the earliest.

	Calcutta/New Delhi, March 29: A 74-year-old pensioner with a fractured hip lay alone and abandoned at Calcutta Medical College Hospital for nine days, denied food and treatment and left to relieve himself in his clothes.        
	Satyendra Mohan Roychowdhury was in so much pain he couldnt make it to the bathroom on his own. But the hospital, which said his condition didnt merit admission, ordered the widower to go home, where he lives alone with none to look after him.        
	There was no one to take me home. If I were only able to get up from bed, I would have taken a cab, Satyendra said from his emergency ward bed where he lay since a taxi knocked him down on March 20.        
	His ordeal ended this evening when, after The Telegraph enquired about him, the hospital hurriedly admitted the patient.        
	Hospital authorities said they didnt admit patients with a hairline hip fracture beds were scarce and there were patients in greater need. Satyendra had been prescribed a pelvic band and pain-killers and asked to report at the outpatient department after a month.        
	The hospital cited a second reason for not admitting him  Satyendra had no relatives who could sign the papers or look after him in the ward. Exactly the reason, Satyendra says, why he couldnt go home to Naktala.        
	We sent police to Satyendras home but the landlord said he couldnt come to the hospital or look after his tenant, hospital deputy medical superintendent A.N. Biswas said. We requested a few voluntary organisations to take care of him but they refused. We admitted him this evening on humanitarian grounds.        
	A patient is allowed to sign the papers and get himself admitted, said Sanchita Bakshi, director of health services, contradicting the hospital.        
	Tonight, hospital superintendent Anup Roy said: If the patient was unable to stand, he should have been admitted. Ill find out why he was not.        
	Calcutta orthopaedist C.S. Dhar, too, said the patient should have been admitted but some other senior doctors agreed with Biswas that admitting Satyendra would have meant depriving a more critical patient.        
	Beds should be offered only to those who cannot be treated as outpatients, said Samiran Nundy, Delhi-based surgeon and former editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics.        
	Doctors said Satyendras nightmare reflects the lack of publicly or privately funded institutions in India that would care for the sick who have none to look after them. Many western countries, where the aged often live alone, have a social security network that looks after them, especially in sickness.        
	Satyendra said: Every time a doctor came near me, he or she asked me to leave and would not do anything to relieve my pain.        
	A few CMCH staff and policemen from the hospital outpost sometimes brought him food. Sometimes I begged from the other patients.        
	Satyendra, who retired as a Group D employee of the state government in February 1993, lost his wife in 1998. He has no children and his cousins live in Bangladesh.        
	He was hit by a taxi at BBD Bag on his way home from Writers Buildings, where he had come to sort out problems with his monthly pension of Rs 3,000. Someone brought me to the hospitals emergency ward and left me there, he said.

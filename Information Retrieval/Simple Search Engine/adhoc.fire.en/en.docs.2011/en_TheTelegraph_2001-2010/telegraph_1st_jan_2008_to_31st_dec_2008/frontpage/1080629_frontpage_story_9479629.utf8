          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Sonia                                  
	New Delhi, June 28: Sonia Gandhi today gave general secretaries in charge of states an end-August deadline to put the party organisation in order and prepare for Assembly and Lok Sabha polls.        
	At her residence this morning, she told them to reconstitute the state units, appoint new office-bearers wherever necessary, fill vacancies and plug organisational gaps within the next two months.        
	Sources said that although the Left-UPA standoff over the nuclear deal and the chances of an early election were not discussed, Sonias timetable to her colleagues indicated she was preparing them for the big fight anytime after August.        
	The Congress presidents directives match the governments tentative calendar for clinching the remaining processes for the deal before it is put to vote in the US Congress.        
	If the government sticks to its timetable and the Left withdraws support, the UPA may be reduced to a minority by August-September.        
	This meeting was about poll preparations; the Lok Sabha elections were also discussed. The party has to get ready for the polls and everybody has been asked to draw up programmes and submit them at the next meeting, general secretary (organisation) Janardhan Dwivedi said.        
	Sources said the next meeting could take place as early as next week. Sonias assignment list included:        
	Feedback from general secretaries on the state of organisational preparedness in the states under their charge, and an action-taken report on the tasks they had earlier been set. They had been told to hold meetings to publicise the Centres pro-poor achievements . Sonia is understood to be upset with her colleagues for not doing enough to air the UPAs social initiatives.        
	Short-listing of poll candidates so that their names can be declared well in advance.        
	Drawing up a campaign strategy and identifying poll issues.        
	In a separate move, M. Veerappa Moily, general secretary and head of the Congresss media cell, tried to answer the charges levelled by Prakash Karat in CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy.        
	Terming the Lefts objections ideological and absurd, Moily said the Iran pipeline was not an alternative to the deal. If Russia and America, China and Pakistan are all busy signing nuclear deals, should India forgo pursuing its interests? he asked.

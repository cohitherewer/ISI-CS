  - Make one more effort,   partners tell govt        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                                            
	New Delhi, June 19: Most UPA allies are learnt to have conveyed to the Prime Minister that they are with him on the nuclear deal but one more effort should be made to avert a breakdown of ties with the Left.        
	External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee took the allies message to Manmohan Singh tonight, highly placed sources said, capping hours of parleys and a speech resembling an election spiel by Sonia Gandhi.        
	The government did not give any indication through the day that it would hold back from taking the Indo-US nuclear deal to the IAEA. Many allies, too, publicly stood by the deal, prompting the Left to renew a threat to reconsider support.        
	However, the sources said late tonight that the allies were keen on making one more effort to find a way out of early elections. The sources claimed that in case no breakthrough could be achieved even then, the allies had agreed to go by what the Congress decided.        
	The Congress has shrugged off its initial reluctance and is standing by the Prime Minister with vigour. But differences between those who insist on pressing ahead with the deal at any cost and others advising caution on early elections are yet to be reconciled.         
	If the Congress eventually wants to pull back from the brink, it can now cite the allies reluctance. It is not a Congress government. It is a UPA government. Whatever decision we take on the nuclear deal will have to be taken by all the alliance partners together, a leader said.         
	Among the allies, Lalu Prasad was the most forceful in his support. Governments come and go. Nuclear power is a requirement and assets must be created for our next generation, he said.        
	The Congress-led government is keen to seek the International Atomic Energy Agencys approval for an India-specific safeguards agreement. Once this is done, an exemption from the Nuclear Suppliers Group and passage of the 123 Agreement in the US Congress will operationalise the deal.        
	The Left parties are counting on Sonia, hoping that saving the alliance with them will be a priority for the Congress president.         
	But Sonia, who was in Maharashtra, kept everyone on toes with a speech that sounded like a poll pitch. We have fulfilled almost everything that we had said in our manifesto, and we have strictly adhered to the Common Minimum Programme. In the history of Independent India, no other coalition government has achieved what the UPA government has achieved, she told a meeting.         
	Mukherjee, who is also convener of the UPA-Left committee on the deal which will sit again on June 25, met allies through the day to gather their views before calling on the Prime Minister at night. Later, he met national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon. The Left, too, held meetings with UPA allies.         
	Sharad Pawar supported the deal but appeared unwilling to go against the Left and invite early polls that his party, the NCP, is ill-prepared for.        
	The DMK said it was with the Prime Minister. CPM general secretary Prakash Karat spoke to DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, but did not appear to have cut much ice with him.         
	Mukherjee also made another overture to the Left, speaking this time to the moderate Sitaram Yechury.        
	One concession the government might offer the Left is to take the sense of Parliament before going ahead, although it is not required to do so, legally and constitutionally.        
	The Congresss plan is to isolate the Left in the House and get the other parties  CPM ally Samajwadi Party, in particular  on its side. The BJP, which earlier blew hot and cold, has softened its stand.

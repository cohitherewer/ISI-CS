  - Hills demand explanation, party dishes out one          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            The crowd that had gathered at Chowrastha for the rally. Picture by Suman Tamang                                         
	Darjeeling, June 25: The extension of the relaxation of the indefinite bandh to July 5 has not gone down well with a section of people in the Darjeeling hills and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha had to do an explaining act at Chowrastha where a rally was planned today.        
	Such was the dissatisfaction that immediately after Morcha president Bimal Gurung announced the breather yesterday, a poster appeared in Chowk Bazar seeking an explanation from the party. The poster was immediately torn.        
	This was the first time that a poster had come up against the Morcha ever since it was formed on October 7, 2007. The difference of opinion also led to skirmishes between Morcha supporters who are in favour of the partys decision and those against it at the town committee office here late in the evening.         
	We must understand that strikes do not only mean closing down shops for an indefinite period. The purpose of calling bandhs is to force the government to come to the negotiating table and fulfil our demands. What has happened yesterday (referring to the poster) was not right. We will take action against the people who are not disciplined, Alok Kant Mani Thulung, the president of the Gorkha Janmukti Yuva Morcha, told the crowd at Chowrastha this morning.        
	Thulung, who is considered a hardliner within the Morcha, however, admitted that there was a positive side to yesterdays incident. We must be happy that people opposed our relaxation. This shows that they are committed to the cause, he said.         
	Dinesh Gurung, adviser to the Morcha town committee, justified the public response but added that everyone had to be disciplined to achieve a goal.                     
	We know that people sold even their gold ornaments to stock up on foodgrain. We respect their commitment and the outburst that followed, Gurung said, before announcing a revamp of the town committee. Pasang Tshering Moktan has been made the new convener while D.K. Pradhan and Pemba Tshering Ola will function as the town units political advisers.         
	D.K. Pradhan, a central committee member, argued for the relaxation saying that the situation in Delhi must be taken into account. We must also understand that Bengal is looking for an excuse to curb our movement, Pradhan said hinting that now was not the time for intra-party bickering.        
	Many in the crowd seemed to have understood the Morchas compulsion but there were some who felt let down. There was no pressure on the Morcha from the people. We should have carried on with the strike until we achieved something concrete. Moreover the announcement could have been made in the morning itself so that we did not have to go in for panic buy throughout the day, said Rajesh Tamang, a Morcha supporter who had participated in todays rally.

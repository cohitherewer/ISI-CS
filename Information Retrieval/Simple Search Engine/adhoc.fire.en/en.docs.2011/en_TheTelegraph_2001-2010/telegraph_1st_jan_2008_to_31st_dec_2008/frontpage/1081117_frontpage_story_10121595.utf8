                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Students recover, cops still clueless
          RAJ KUMAR                              
	Ranchi, Nov. 16: Even four days after food poisoning killed five children at a Bero school, police are yet to make any headway in the case.        
	We havent made any progress, said superintendent of police (rural), Kuldeep Dwivedi. Deputy police superintendent of crime investigation department (CID), Jyoti Udya Tete, who is heading the probe, remained tight-lipped.         
	Students admitted to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) and Apollo Hospital, meanwhile, made steady recovery.         
	The final batch of nine, admitted to RIMS on November 13, was released today. Head of paediatrics, RIMS, Arun Kumar Sharma said: The boys were released this morning after thorough check-up.        
	Reports from Apollo Hospital were encouraging too. The 10 children who were there from RIMS are stable. Apollo superintendent P.D. Sinha said the young patients would be released once their blood test reports come in.         
	Students who were admitted to the ICU have been shifted to the general ward. We will release all the others after their blood tests are done, he said.         
	Out of the 10 children, the condition of Raman Bedia, Rohit Oraon and Dhaneshwar Oraon was critical. But, they have recovered, said a source at the Apollo.        
	While the Ranchi district administration is struggling to crack the case, the Opposition has started mounting pressure. A BJP team, under the leadership of chief whip C.P. Singh, visited the Adivasi Residential School for a reality check.         
	There are only two hand pumps and three bathrooms for more than 248 students in the school. The kitchen is dirty. Children are not provided proper clothing, Singh said.         
	Former chief minister and Opposition leader Arjun Munda squarely blamed the government for the November 13 incident and said he would raise the matter in the Assembly once a committee report is submitted.         
	It is the governments duty to collect food samples and get it tested from every school. I would like to know how many times the government has done this, he said.

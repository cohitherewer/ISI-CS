	September 22: Militants explode a hand grenade in the residence of Manipur rural development minister Md Allauddin Khan in Imphal East district         
	September 28: Grenade attack on a private nursing institute after an extortion demand of Rs 20 lakh by Kangleipak Communist Party. The institute attacked twice earlier on September 26 and 19.               
	Imphal, Oct. 1: The residents of Khurai where the grenade attacks have been taking place during the past month have had enough. Every time militants lobbed a grenade, Khurai held a sit-in.         
	But last night, minutes after a grenade was thrown at the residence of a government official, the residents, alerted by the sound of the explosion, ran out and grabbed one of the militants. The other fled.         
	Police said the residents of Khurai caught and beat up the militant who exploded a hand grenade at the residence of a superintending engineer of power department, Khagokpam Khamba.         
	The residents also beat up the cadre, who identified himself as Mairenbam John, a member of the Kangleipak Communist Party (City Meitei) group.         
	The police said two youths came to the house of the engineer at 7.20 last night. When they wanted to meet the engineer, they were told that he was not at home. The cadres then forced all the family members outside the house and exploded a hand grenade inside. No one was injured, but property was damaged.         
	The police recovered another unexploded Chinese hand grenade this morning.         
	The injured militant is now undergoing treatment at Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital here.

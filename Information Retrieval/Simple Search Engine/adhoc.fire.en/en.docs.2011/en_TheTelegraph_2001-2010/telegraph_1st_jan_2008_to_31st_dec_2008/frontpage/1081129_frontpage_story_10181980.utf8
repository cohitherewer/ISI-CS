	Those alive through luck and grit               
	Sir Gulam Noon        
	The British Curry King did not duck when he first heard gunfire from his Taj suite. We thought we were hearing wedding fireworks. Later, locked in his room, he had to decide whether to brave the whizzing bullets or face being overcome by smoke from the burning floors.        
	The air conditioning went off. The room became very hot. We couldnt open the windows, they were sealed. His mobile still worked and his family rang to warn him of a fire on the upper floors.        
	The army were amazing, they were running up and down the corridors but they werent interested in getting the guests out. They were trying to find the terrorists. We were told, Dont come out because the commandos could shoot you by mistake.         
	We could see the bodies coming out. After several hours a fireman broke the window and took us down in a crane. At the bottom, the general manager of the hotel was waiting to greet us with a bottle of water. The staff were amazing, they stayed all night, risking their lives.        
	Raghu Deora        
	In the kitchen of the Chambers at the Taj, chef Deora hid under a table. Four gunmen found him. What do you do? they asked in Hindi, and then they ordered him to stand up and turn around. They shot him from behind, his wife Nandita said. A bullet entered through one side and came out the other. But he survived.        
	Deepak Kuntawala, 35        
	The Englishman was having a snack at the Tajs first-floor restaurant when I saw this particular boat which seemed overweight, he said.        
	It was full of these young guys in casual clothes. Moments later, I noticed everyone running away from the waterfront and I heard some shooting. I thought it was a parade at first, then a fight. Then they started coming up the stairs into the hotel. He escaped by climbing down a rope made from curtains.        
	Harnish Patel        
	The chartered surveyor from Britain was shot at Leopolds Cafe. I was so lucky. The guy just took one look at me and showered the whole side of the bar  chairs and table and everything. He just let loose. Its unimaginable.        
	Luckily he didnt keep his finger down because if he did, Id be gone. When he was shot in the leg, it just seemed a tingly feeling. I think it was the shock.        
	Mark Abell        
	The London lawyer said after his release from the Oberoi: Eventually I got a call from the in-house system saying they were coming to get me. In about half an hour there was a knock and there was an entourage of heavily armed military, hotel staff, the police.        
	I think these people have been fantastic. All the Indian authorities and military and police. The hotel staff. They were there for us and I think they are a great advertisement for their country.         
	Ronny Quireyns, 44        
	At cafe Leopold, the Bollywood-loving Belgian was seated upstairs with friends  film extras just coming from a shoot. When the terrorists struck, the waiters pulled the cover off an air-conditioning vent and guided him and about 15 other foreigners to climb inside. Later, when the waiters gave the all-clear, the foreigners fled the restaurant. Police took them to a nearby station to spend the night.        
	Gary Samore        
	The director of studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York was staying at the Taj with his wife and daughter, squeezing in a family holiday with a lecture tour on the nuclear challenge facing Barack Obama. They were in their room. The TV was not working. He had no local phone.         
	Friends kept sending email messages to his BlackBerry. At 3.30am, the US consulate called to say the hotel was on fire. The family collected their passports, made a set of wet towels to help them get through a smoky corridor and found their way to a second-floor terrace from where they could summon soldiers. My BlackBerry, Samore said, may have saved our lives.        
	Paul Bean        
	The UK businessman lay flat on his stomach under a restaurant table in the Taj for six hours. Rescuers later put up a ladder to the restaurant window and he climbed out.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 16: Near-normal monsoon has been forecast at a time the country is struggling with rising prices and the highest inflation rate in three years.         
	The country will receive 99 per cent rainfall during 2008, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said today.        
	In a departure, the IMD took into account a number of experimental predictions, along with its own traditional statistical method, to issue the forecast for all-India rainfall during the 2008 monsoon season: 99 per cent of the average of 89cm.         
	Large tracts of India are rain-fed. A good monsoon will mean good agricultural output, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said.        
	Todays forecast will be updated twice over the next two months. A forecast in May will specify the date of monsoon arrival over Kerala, and a forecast in June will predict rainfall for July and deliver quantitative predictions for rainfall in north-west, north-east, south and central India.         
	The IMD this year used the same statistical technique it had introduced in 2007 but which had failed to deliver a correct forecast. It had predicted 93 per cent, or below normal, rainfall, but actual rainfall was 106 per cent  above normal.         
	To improve long-range forecasts, the IMD has now taken into account experimental predictions by researchers at academic institutions in India and five European and US-based weather research centres.         
	Weve qualitatively considered their effects, said Madhavan Rajeevan, a senior scientist at the IMD National Climate Centre, Pune, who led the forecasting effort.         
	The dynamic forecasts from the other research centres predict normal or above normal rainfall, Rajeevan said.         
	The behaviour of the 2008 monsoon is being regarded as crucial for the government which is struggling with 7.4 per cent inflation.        
	The IMD this year has also redefined monsoon performance. Rainfall between 96 per cent and 104 per cent of the average will be near-normal, 90-96 per cent will be below normal, 104-110 per cent will be above normal, below 90 per cent will be classified as deficient, and above 110 per cent will be excess. Until now, rainfall between 98-102 per cent was dubbed near-normal.

                Nicholson as The Joker in Batman
              
	Los Angeles, March 3 (AP): He was The Joker in Batman, but Jack Nicholson says he was not fooling around when he said in A Few Good Men that there was nothing sexier than saluting a woman.
    
	Nicholson, who is backing Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for President, took his endorsement to the Internet on Saturday with a humourous collection of clips that put his support into the mouths of his most film famous characters.
    
	And now folks, its time for who do you trust. Hubba, hubba, hubba. Money, money, money, Nicholson, as The Joker, asks his audience in the video titled Jack and Hill.
    
	 Then he goes on to make it clear he puts his in Clinton. He also makes it clear he isnt happy with the current administration. 
    
	Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better, Nicholson, as frustrated writer Jack Torrance, tells Lloyd the bartender in The Shining. In the movie, Nicholsons character then goes on a murderous rampage. In the video, a message flashes onscreen saying Clinton has a plan to deal with the nearly 47 million Americans without health care.
    
	She will also end the Iraq war and restore Americas credibility abroad, the video says after Nicholson, as angry Colonel Nathan Jessep in A Few Good Men, shouts: Maybe we as officers have a responsibility to this country to see that the men and women charged with its security are trained professionals.

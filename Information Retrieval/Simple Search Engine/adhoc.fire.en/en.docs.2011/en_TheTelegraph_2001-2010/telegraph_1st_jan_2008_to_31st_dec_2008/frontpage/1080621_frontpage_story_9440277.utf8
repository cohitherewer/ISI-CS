	Bhubaneswar, June 20: Schools remained closed and shop shutters were pulled down in Rourkela and Sundergarh after residents woke up to find hand written posters put up by Naxalites across the districts.        
	The posters, threatening the government with dire consequences, were pasted in and around towns and villages by People Liberation Front of India (PLFI) demanding immediate action against the recent price hike and the blame placed on Naxalites for the murder of civilians by the auhtority.         
	The rebels also demanded that the government release innocent comrades lodged in jails.         
	After the posters were spotted, schools, banks and panchayat offices were closed for the day fearing a backlash. We read these in the morning and informed the police, said a resident. Incidentally, Rourkela was without a superintendent of police till Santosh Bala joined this afternoon.         
	Last evening, administration officials of Jharkhand and Orissa conducted a meeting in Rourkela to discuss ways to combat Naxalite menace.         
	The panic was visible at Soroda where 15 schools, the State Bank of India branch and panchayat offices were closed throughout the day and people preferred to stay indoors.        
	Posters were also visible in Udada, Baribela, Jaraikala, Banki, Bisra, Danga, Rulabeda, Luharam, Chata, Kuha, and Biramitrapur villages.        
	Special Operation Groups have been pressed into service and for now they are busy removing posters.         
	The personnel have been directed to move in bikes fearing landmine blasts.         
	Sundergarh superintendent of police Narsingh Bhol stressed that not many parts of Sundergarh were affected. The PLFI had called for a bandh today in Jharkhand and had pasted posters in bordering villages, he said.

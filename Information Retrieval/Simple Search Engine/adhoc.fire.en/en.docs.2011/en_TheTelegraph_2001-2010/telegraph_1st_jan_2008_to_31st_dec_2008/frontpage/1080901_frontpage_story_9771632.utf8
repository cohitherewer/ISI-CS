                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Talks break Jammu jam
  - Deal allows shrine temporary land use, agitation put off          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                                
	Srinagar, Aug. 31: Talks have helped achieve a breakthrough of sorts in Jammu at a time the lack of such engagement is prolonging the Singur crisis.        
	The two-month-old pro-Amarnath agitation ended today after the government allowed the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board temporary use of 40 hectares at Baltal.        
	It said this would be only for the duration of the Amarnath yatra including the period of making the required arrangements and winding up, but did not specify the period.        
	The government also agreed to withdraw all bailable cases against the Jammu agitators and review the rest, and blamed some of its own decisions for creating misunderstandings which led to controversy and agitation and the loss of many precious lives. Four persons died during the Jammu agitation and 38 in the Valleys counter-protests.        
	Todays breakthrough came at 4.30am after nightlong talks between agitation spearhead Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti and the four-member government panel led by governor N.N. Vohras adviser, B.S. Bloeria.        
	This is a major victory for us, said Brig (retd) Suchet Singh, who headed the Samitis talks committee.        
	In Jammu, people burst crackers and beat drums on the roads but the government imposed curfew in the district, preventing a victory rally. Sources said the curfew was clamped to prevent celebrations that could spark a Valley backlash, and also to protect those celebrating from militant attacks.        
	Some militants have recently infiltrated Jammu and there was a threat to people joining a rally, Jammu police chief Manohar Singh said.        
	Till late evening, the Valley had not reacted apart from a few expressions of disappointment.        
	It is intriguing that the government has not specified the yatra duration but what is more disturbing is that the land has been virtually handed over to the board by giving it user rights. Our co-ordination committee is meeting and will issue a statement, said Main Abdul Qayoom, who had led the nine-day agitation in Kashmir that forced the government to cancel the land allotment.        
	Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti said the unilateral decision on the land showed disrespect for Kashmirs sentiments.        
	The government shall set aside for use by the board, exclusively, the land at Baltal. The proprietary status/ownership/title of the land shall not undergo any change, reads the agreement, made public at a joint news conference by Bloeria and Samiti convener L.K. Sharma.        
	The board can erect temporary, pre-fabricated accommodation, toilets, langars (kitchens) and related facilities for the yatras duration. One condition is that only permanent residents of the state can be involved in jobs like setting up the temporary shops and arranging the lighting, unlike earlier.        
	The board stays responsible for the overall arrangements on both routes, via Pahalgam and via Baltal, in keeping with the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Act, 2000. The government had never opposed this demand of the Samiti.        
	A major concession to the Samiti was that all cases of non-serious nature (linked to the Jammu protests) which shall mean bailable and compoundable will be withdrawn.        
	The remaining cases will be reviewed, on the merits of each case, by a committee headed by Anil Goswami, principal secretary (home), within 60 days. Till the completion of this process, no action will be taken in such cases, the agreement reads.        
	This provides relief to hundreds of agitators who allegedly destroyed property, attacked political parties and police, and blocked the Srinagar-Jammu highway.        
	The government will examine the rest of the Samitis 14 demands within a fixed timeframe. These include compensation for families of the dead and injured as well as Jammus transporters, traders, horticulturists, hotel owners and tourist operators, hit by the agitation that began on June 30 and shut down large areas for 39 consecutive days.        
	A working group, led by the chief secretary, will address all compensation issues relating to both Jammu and Kashmir divisions, the agreement says.        
	The two sides issued a joint statement recognising the warmth with which the people of both Kashmir and Jammu have welcomed the yatris over the decades.        
	After the governments compromise formula reached it last night, the Samiti convened its emergency core committee around midnight to discuss the proposals and seek legal opinion. It then resumed talks with the government and gave up its demand for outright transfer of the land.        
	We have suspended our agitation, Suchet Singh later announced. He used the word suspended because the Samiti wants the government to accept some other demands, such as action against the Samba superintendent of police and the Poonch deputy commissioner.        
	The Valley remained in the grip of curfew for the eighth straight day. Curfew was relaxed for a few hours but was re-imposed after clashes broke out.        
	The demonstrators, however, were mainly chanting pro-aazadi slogans unlike the early days of the Valley agitation against the land allotment.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 20: The Kandhamal nun, undergoing trauma counselling at New Delhi, has agreed to attend the test identification parade anywhere in Orissa  apart from the strife-torn district, where she was raped on the night of August 25.        
	Sources in the state crime branch who are responsible for the case confirmed that she had expressed her willingness to appear for the parade. However, sources added that she was completely reluctant to travel to Kandhamal where a mob attacked her and a Father at K-Nuagaon.        
	Inspector-general of police (crime) Arun Roy said the date and venue for the parade has not been decided. We would decide only after the investigating team returns from Delhi, he said.        
	The nun, CID sources said, has also requested the police team to place their questions away from media glare, at a private location.        
	On Tuesday, she faced the first phase of interrogation when the state team, headed by officer Dillip Mohanty, questioned her at an undisclosed location in New Delhi.         
	At the meeting, the woman reconstructed the sequence of events, said a senior CID officer. Her latest statement corroborated her earlier version given at a Delhi news conference on October 24 and her written complaint lodged on August 26, a day after the incident.         
	The team also spoke with Father Thomas Chellantharayil, who was an eyewitness to the incident.        
	The victim was taken to the All India Institute of Medical Science for her blood sample that was sent to the forensic laboratory at Calcutta for a DNA match.         
	Earlier, samples taken from the main accused and five co-accused were sent to the Calcutta lab for DNA mapping.        
	Previously, the woman had turned down all offers to appear for the test identification parade, stating she did not wish to be victimised by the Orisssa police any further. However, she agreed to co-operate following a Supreme Court advice.

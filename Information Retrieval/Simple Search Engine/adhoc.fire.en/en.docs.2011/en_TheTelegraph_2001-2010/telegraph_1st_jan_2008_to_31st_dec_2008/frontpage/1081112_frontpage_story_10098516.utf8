          CHANDRAJIT MUKHERJEE                            Chief secretary A.K. Basu at his office. Telegraph picture                                  
	Ranchi, Nov. 11: A high court directive to the Jharkhand government regarding an unfair tender process carried out in 2006 has come as a blow to chief secretary A.K. Basu, who will now have to stay out of any committee finalising future state tenders.        
	Jharkhand High Court today directed the state to give an undertaking that it would not allow in future tendering committees officials in the drinking water and sanitation department who had awarded the tender to interested parties instead of the one who had qualified legitimately.        
	Basu, who as principal secretary in the department, was part of the tendering process initiated in 2006 to install 17,000 tubewells, 22 districts, will therefore be part of the censure. The court directed the state to take remedial action against the tainted officials who were guilty of favouring private individuals while allocating government tenders. It also deprecated the role of these officials in flouting rules and conditions while awarding the tender.        
	Among the other members of the tender committee were chief engineer Surendra Prasad Singh, superintending engineer Nirmal Kumar Kedia, internal financial advisor Shashikar Samanta and regional chief engineer D.K.Bhagat.         
	Birendra Kumar Singh, the petitioner, challenged the process in the high court alleging he was denied the tender unfairly. His counsel, Abhay Mishra, alleged he was declared the lowest bidder and was even asked to sign a consent letter by the department.        
	 However, before the consent letter reached him, the tender was allotted to other private parties and work orders issued.         
	The court ruled in Singhs favour on 3 August, 2007 .         
	Since substantial work had already been done, the court did not cancel the tender process citing public interest. But it criticised officials of the department and those in the tender committee for handing over the work to interested parties instead of the one who had qualified to bag the tender, Mishra said.         
	Singh then appealed before a high court division bench since despite the criticism, no action was taken to cancel the tender process. On July 23 this year, the bench directed the petitioner to name all members of the tender committee so that action could be taken against them as per law.        
	The petitioner accordingly impleaded all the government officers including Basu.         
	Today, the court asked the government to give an undertaking forbidding the officials to participate in any future tender finalisation process.        
	Advocate general P.K. Prasad refused comment as he said he was yet to receive the court order.

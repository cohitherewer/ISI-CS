The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bengal touch to French opera 
                                                                                                           Bengal touch to French opera 
          AMIT ROY                            Artistes rehearse for the Paris show                                  
	Paris, March 14: Sanjay Leela Bhansali and his choreographer, Tanusree Shankar, were today putting last-minute touches to a radical Indo-French production of Padmavati, hours before the first night of the opera-ballet at the imposing Theatre du Chatelet in Paris.        
	The best bits in Padmavati have all come from Calcutta, quipped Rajesh Pratap Singh, who did the wardrobe for Bhansali in Saawariya and has been engaged by the Bollywood director to design the 300 costumes required for this lavish production of Padmavati.        
	The classical singers and the choir in Padmavati are French while the production team and especially the dancers are Indian.         
	But they are not Bollywood dancers, Rajesh stressed. All the dancers have come from Calcutta from Tanusrees school.         
	On a clothes rack were lined the costume changes for the dancers each with her name tag  Sumana Ray, Nilanjana Dutta, Debashree Tewary, Sujata Chowdhury and Piali Sen.        
	I plan to invite her (Tanusrees) ballet back to Chatelet, pledged Jean-Luc Choplin, the director-general of the 2,500-seat Theatre du Chatelet.        
	Padmavati has been performed only twice before  in 1923 and 1947. It was written by the French composer Albert Roussel. He went on honeymoon to Rajasthan in 1909 and came across the story of Padmavati, the Rajput queen of Chittor who led the women folk into a funeral fire rather than submit to the designs of the invader Alauddin.        
	Her husband in the opera is the very Bengali sounding Ratan-Sen, which is what Roussel probably thought he heard instead of Ratan Singh. Alauddin becomes Alouddin, the Muslim invader from Delhi who issues an ultimatum to the husband once his lustful eyes have settled on Padmavati  she would have to be handed over to him or else he would lay siege to Chittor. Which is what he did.         
	Ratan-Sen is wounded in battle but it is his wife who stabs him to death in a final act of love so that she can mount his funeral pyre and, thereby, deny Alauddin his ultimate prize.        
	History wasnt quite like this, Bhansali demurred, but he has stuck faithfully to Roussels storyline.         
	 It was Choplins brave decision to revive Padmavati with Bhansali as director after he had seen a DVD of Devdas and was hugely impressed by what he considered its classical dance form. He also saw the very theatrical Black, which confirmed Bhansali was his man.         
	Devdas was one of the best Bollywood films I have seen, Choplin told The Telegraph today after a tour of the stage. I did not choose him for Bollywood: the dancing in Devdas was Bollywood but for me it was more than Bollywood dancing. It was great classical dancing. I wanted to bring together a team of great Indian artistes, including Madam Tanusree Shankar. She is a great choreographer.        
	Bhansali took some persuading but finally agreed to Choplins overtures. Soon, he wanted an elephant. The theatre obliged him and got him 22-year-old Baby from a famous circus called Bouglione. Bhansali wanted a tiger on stage and has been given one  a five-year-old called Perle from the same stable.

          LUCY COCKCROFT                            Johansson: Unhappy                                  
	London, Dec. 16: Scarlett Johansson has threatened to sue UK Cosmopolitan magazine for allegedly fabricating an interview which contained quotes about her marriage to actor Ryan Reynolds that were completely made up.         
	According to Johanssons publicist, Marcel Pariseau, the magazine had claimed the four-page interview, headlined Why I HAD to get married, had taken place in August, yet the actress only tied the knot in September.         
	It is claimed that the article was an amalgamation of quotes she gave to US Cosmopolitan in August, snippets lifted from interviews she gave years ago.         
	Johansson, who starred in Girl with a Pearl Earring, told US Cosmopolitan in August last year that she was planning to take the normal celebrity route and not talk about personal topics.

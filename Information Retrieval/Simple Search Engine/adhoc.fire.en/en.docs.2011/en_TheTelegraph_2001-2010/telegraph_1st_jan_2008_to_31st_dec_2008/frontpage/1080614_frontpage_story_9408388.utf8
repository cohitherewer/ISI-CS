          OUR CORRESPODENT                              
	Ranchi, June 13: The final shape to the states resettlement and rehabilitation policy would be given at a UPA meeting on June 18.        
	At this meeting, it would also be decided whether the proposal needed to be sent to the cabinet co-ordination department for approval or an all-party meeting was to be convened for consensus.        
	After detailed discussions with ministers and bureaucrats today, chief minister Madhu Koda decided on the UPA meet.        
	Koda, however, promised that the policy would be finalised by the end of this month or in the first week of July. He argued that the process was being delayed only to ensure that the policy did not run into rough weather after being passed by the cabinet. He even claimed that all the ministers would be satisfied with the draft policy.        
	Deputy chief ministers Stephen Marandi and Sudhir Mahto, human resource development minister Bandhu Tirkey and land revenue minister Dulal Bhuiyan were among others who participated in todays deliberations with Koda.         
	It was agreed that all the alliance partners supporting the government should be consulted once more before taking the final decision.        
	I see no reason, why its approval would be delayed further. The committee that has worked out the policy comprised representatives from all the leading parties supporting our government, said Sudhir Mahto.

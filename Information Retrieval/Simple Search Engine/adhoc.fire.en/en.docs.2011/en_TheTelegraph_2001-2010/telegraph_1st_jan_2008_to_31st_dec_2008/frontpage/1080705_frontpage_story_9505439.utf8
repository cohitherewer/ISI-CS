  - UN-backed food atlas reveals why prosperous Jharkhand is lagging behind in most human development indices          SANTOSH K KIRO                                    
	Ranchi, July 4: In what was not entirely unexpected, 17 of 24 districts of Jharkhand have been found to be food insecure with Dhanbad being the lone food secure district.        
	This was revealed today in the Food Security Atlas of Rural Jharkhand prepared under the aegis of the UN World Food Programme and the Institute of Human Development (IHD). It was unvelied here at a formal and well-attended function by Planning Commission members Abhijeet Sen, B.N. Yugandhar and B.K. Chaturvedi (see chart).         
	There is more: While Chatra, East Singhbhum and Giridih districts were extremely food insecure, eight others  Gumla, Garhwa, Lohardaga, West Singhbhum, Palamau, Pakur, Deoghar and Bokaro  were severely food insecure. Also, Sahebganj, Ranchi, Koderma, Hazaribagh, Dumka and Godda have been found to be moderately insecure.        
	The report, however, was silent on the newly created districts of Ramgarh, Khunti, Seraikela-Kharsawan, Jamtara, Latehar and Simdega districts. The study has also revealed that less than 20 per cent of the villages in Hazaribagh, Giridih, Gumla and Koderma districts have access to safe drinking water.         
	Several top intellectuals, including 13th Finance Commission member Atul Sharma, Ranchi University former vice-chancellor Ram Dayal Munda, Jawaharlal Nehru University professor Ashok Mathur, development commissioner A.K. Singh and eastern regional centre of IHD director Harishwar Dayal attended the programme.         
	The report aims to relate the food atlas findings to various human development parameters like child mortality rate, underweight children, access to food, availability of food, rural connectivity, per capita expenditure, among others. While 63 per cent of children below five years are underweight in Giridih and Sahebganj, it is 45 per cent in the best performing districts like Bokaro, East Singhbhum and Ranchi, the report said.        
	Districts like Gumla and Garhwa have extremely high mortality figures  130 and 156 out of 1000 childbirths  which can even be compared to under-five mortality in Sub Saharan Africa (160), it pointed out.        
	The report also noted that most districts labelled food insecure had poor road connectivity. Only Dhanbad had good rural connectivity  around 44 per cent of villages were connected. In other districts, less that 30 per cent of villages had such access. In Chatra and Deoghar, only 13 per cent villages had access to paved roads. Though funds are available from the Centre, Jharkhand does not have enough personnel to prepare a detailed project report, said Chaturvedi. He said in the last four years, the state had taken up only 20 per cent of road projects facilitated by the Centre.         
	He also noted that the power scenario in the state needed urgent attention. The Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited is doing pretty badly, he observed and advised the state government to identify some sectors which could become the backbone of the states economy. As Jharkhand has huge prospects in horticulture, it could focus on it for economic development of its rural areas, he suggested.        
	Singh agreed with Chaturvedis observation on the states poverty and backwardness, but said the scenario could change with concerted efforts. Jharkhand has been faced with huge number of lacunae in development work. But as the region holds out lots of promises, things would change for the better once the right steps are taken, he said.    
	Food Security Atlas: A comprehensive researched  document analysing the multiple dimensions of food  security at the state level and to suggest policies and  strategies appropriate to the local context  
	Food Security Index: It has been defined as the food  availability, food accessibility and food absorption   all clubbed together. Food may be available but the  villagers may not have the access to it due to lack of  purchasing power. Food absorption, on the other  hand, includes availability of safe drinking water and  public heath care and the like																								   
	Food Insecurity Index: It measures the lack of food  availability, food accessibility and food absorption  
	FINDINGS    Only food 'secure' district: Dhanbad
      Extremely food insecure: Chatra, East Singhbhum and Giridih
      Poor road connectivity: Only 30 per cent villages connected
      Irrigated land: Only 9 per cent of total farmland
      Access to safe drinking water: Only 20 per cent villages in  Hazaribagh, Giridih, Gumla and Koderma districts

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 21: The UPA top brass went into huddles to find a way to control the price spiral a day after inflation touched a 13-year high, with Sonia Gandhi summoning P. Chidambaram and the Reserve Bank of India governor calling on Manmohan Singh.        
	Sonia, the UPA chairperson and Congress chief, called the finance minister and the chief ministers of Delhi and Haryana to strategy meetings.        
	Monetary policy is likely to be the first line of attack, with the RBI governor expected to announce increases in overnight lending rates for banks. This would make all loans  home, car and those for factories  dearer, reduce demand and help cool down prices.         
	The governor held separate meetings with Singh, who held the RBI top job from 1982 to 1985, and Chidambaram.        
	Yesterday, the government revealed that inflation had touched 11.05 per cent in the first week of June. It is expected to rise for a few more weeks and could top 13 per cent.         
	Sources said the government would use its foodgrain stock  22 million tonnes of wheat and 26 million tonnes of rice  to force prices down. Wheat has climbed to Rs 11 a kg and ordinary rice to Rs 22, 40 per cent up from a year ago.        
	Last week, the RBI had raised its benchmark repo rate  at which banks borrow from the RBI for the short term  to a six-year high of 8 per cent.         
	Since April, it has twice increased the cash reserve ratio  the sum banks must keep with the RBI  to suck out excess money from the economy.        
	Rising prices are being blamed partly for the Congresss losses in recent Assembly elections. The party faces six state polls this winter and the general election thereafter.        
	Chidambaram said the government will take appropriate measures to contain and moderate inflation. A statement he issued added the Centre would explore options for deeper tax cuts. It has already reduced import duties on many goods and, sources said, could now consider cutting excise or manufacturing taxes.        
	Sonia is likely to talk to other Congress chief ministers as well to ask them to ensure the public distribution system, which sells foodgrain and sugar to the poor, works properly and also reaches out to the urban middle class.

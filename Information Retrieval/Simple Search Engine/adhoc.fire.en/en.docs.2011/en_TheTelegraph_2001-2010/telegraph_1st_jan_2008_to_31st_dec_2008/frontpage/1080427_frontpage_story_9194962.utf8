          RASHEED KIDWAI                            Rahul Gandhi at the news conference in Chhattisgarh on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	April 26: By Rahul Gandhis admission, there are two Indias within India: one urban, prosperous and on the path to development, and another struggling with poverty, want and poor delivery system. Likewise, are there two Rahuls, too?        
	One in Delhi who is generally reticent and often diffident; and another in rural settings who is energetic, candid, charming, witty and leader-like?        
	Rahul has been the epitome of his rural self during his ongoing visit to Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh visit, giving candid and comprehensive replies to all queries and snubbing both opponents and in-house sycophants.        
	Asked how he felt being called yuvraj (heir apparent), pat came the reply: I feel the word yuvraj is insulting. India is a democratic country and this word has no meaning today.        
	Rahuls comment came a few days after a furore in the Rajya Sabha over Congress MP E.M. Sudarsana Natchiappan calling him yuvraj. The BJP had risen up in protest, saying only members of the royal family could be given such titles.        
	Next Rahul was asked what he thought about Mayavatis comment that each time he interacted with Dalits, he took a shower and washed his clothes with special soap.        
	The young Amethi MP, perspiring in the soaring Chhattisgarh heat, stood up and showed his kurta to the Kanker audience. Look, does it look like it is being washed by some special soap? he asked.        
	The candid repartees did not end there. Asked about Arjun Singh and others projecting him as future Prime Minister, Rahul sought to clear the air over Manmohan Singhs continuation beyond May 2009.        
	Manmohan Singh is my leader and the most able person for the PMs chair.        
	Rahul said he fully supported incumbent Manmohan Singh as he was the most capable Prime Minister.        
	Rahuls Chhattisgarh visit showed his deft handling of intra-party feuds. At Bastar, he refused to be drawn into any debate on whether the Salwa Judum should be disbanded.        
	Citing the recent Supreme Court order that the peoples movement against Naxalites has to be respected, he said: The Supreme Court has given its order. It has to be respected as it is the countrys apex court.        
	Told that Congressmen had divergent views, Rahul said: There are different views. It is for the states people to decide. As far as I am concerned, I respect the Supreme Courts views.        
	Asked about the Naxalite problem, Rahul claimed the Chhattisgarh and Orissa regimes had been unable to reach the poorest of the poor as the benefits of welfare schemes were not percolating downward.        
	This certainly impacts Naxalism, he said.        
	To drive home the point, he said the benefits of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and Indira Awas Yojana had not reached the needy.        
	Earlier, Rahul was seen freely interacting with the tribals of Jamawada village, 12km from Kanker. Why are you not migrating in search of work like the rural people from Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh who migrate to big cities, he asked.        
	The tribals said they were scared because they did not know any language but their local dialect.        
	Told that only four youths had passed the Higher Secondary exam since Independence in the village of 3,000, he asked: Why are you so backward in studies? Why are you not mustering courage to air your grievances?        
	Again, a tribal replied: Hame dar lagta hai (we are terrified).         
	Rahul was given a traditional welcome in every village he visited. Last night, he was offered mahua, a local brew, but he politely declined.        
	In Raipur and Bhopal, senior BJP leaders kept a hawk eye on Rahuls visit but claimed they were not at all worried.        
	The BJP has no objection to Mr Gandhis study tour. The political miracle caused by his visits to Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and some other states has already been observed, BJP leader Ravishankar Prasad said in Raipur.

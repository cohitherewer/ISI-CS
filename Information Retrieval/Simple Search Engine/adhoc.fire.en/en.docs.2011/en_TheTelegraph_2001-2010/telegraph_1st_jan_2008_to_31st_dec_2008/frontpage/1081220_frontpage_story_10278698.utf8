          NASIR JAFFRY IN ISLAMABAD AND OUR DELHI BUREAU                              
	Dec. 19: Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today raised a lone voice against the tactics adopted by Islamabad to deny Mumbai attacker Mohammed Ajmals Pakistani nationality, saying we too need to set our house in order.        
	The Opposition leader criticised the way the government had barricaded Mohammed Ajmal Amir Iman Kasabs alleged village, Faridkot in Punjab province, and barred the media from it.        
	It has been said this individual named Ajmal Kasab hails from Faridkot village. I have seen and I personally got this checked (that) the village and its surrounding areas were cordoned off. His parents are not being allowed to meet anyone, Sharif told the Geo News channel in an interview.        
	What was the need to do this? If (Ajmal) is not involved (in the Mumbai attacks), then he is not involved. People should be allowed to meet everyone in that area. All this points to the fact that we too need to set our house in order.        
	A stung Pakistan government termed Sharifs comments unfortunate at a sensitive time when the country needs national unity and consensus. The spokesperson for Sharifs party, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), later stressed that the former Prime Minister did not say Ajmal was a Pakistani but had only criticised the government policy of cordoning off the area.        
	Sharifs statements coincided with a wider attack on President Asif Ali Zardari, with whom he fell out soon after the Pakistan Peoples Party-led government was formed.        
	Sharif told Geo News the governments functioning was making Pakistan look like a failed and ungovernable state and that the country needed a new road map.        
	Indian observers feel there is a pointed political objective in Sharif challenging the politico-military establishment in Pakistan. He is trying to project himself as a gutsy democrat at home and a reasonable statesman on the subcontinent.        
	The carefully calibrated statement could be intended at rallying anti-military sentiment around him. At the same time, it will locate him in the international eye as the only prominent Pakistani leader willing to seek out the truth.        
	Buoyed by a sterling show in the February election, Sharif has consciously sought to distance himself from both the Zardari government and the powerful, though shadowy, military-intelligence complex.

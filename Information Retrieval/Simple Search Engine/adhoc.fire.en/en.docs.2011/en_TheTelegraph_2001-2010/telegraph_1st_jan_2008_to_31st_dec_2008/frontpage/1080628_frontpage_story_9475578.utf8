	Jaipur, June 27: Michael Douglas has worn many hats in his brilliant Hollywood career: ruthless Wall Street player to swashbuckling adventurer to President of America.        
	But the one hat he is too scared to touch is the colourful Rajasthani turban.        
	Now location-hunting in India for his 30-million thriller Racing the Monsoon, Douglas travelled in and around Jodhpur today before leaving for Delhi in the afternoon.        
	The film, a Hollywood-Bollywood co-production, is expected to be shot in Mumbai, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Calcutta and will feature Douglas, wife Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon and several Indian actors.        
	According to sources in Jodhpurs Umaid Bhawan palace where the actor had checked in last evening, Douglas made queries about the coloured and patterned safa, the traditional Rajasthani turban.        
	He was told that not wearing a turban is considered the ultimate in bad taste in traditional Rajasthani society but when he was offered one, refused to wear it. He said he respected Rajasthani traditions but would not be able to carry it off himself.        
	Douglas, however, looked engrossed as he took in the information that the turbans, apart from adding colour to a mans appearance, may denote his hometown, profession, station in life and other personal details, the sources said.        
	He learnt that each region of Rajasthan prides in its own distinctive way of tying a turban. Some groups wear turbans of one particular colour or design, but those who can afford it sport different designs and colours depending on the season and occasion.        
	The actor, who arrived in Mumbai on Tuesday, flew into Jaipur on Wednesday and spent the night at the Rambagh Palace before travelling to Jodhpur the following day on a chartered flight.        
	Last night, he watched the traditional dances of Rajasthan, such as Kalbeliya and Terah Taali, at Umaid Bhawan. This morning he visited the Hotel Taj Hari Mahal and took a look at a special suite, probably as a possible location for shoots.        
	With his four-member crew, he then left for the picturesque Balsamand lake, about 5km from the city. The lake is an artificial reservoir built in the 13th century to provide drinking water to the city.        
	Overlooking the lake is the Balsamand Lake Palace, a red-sandstone structure typifying the ornate Rajput architectural style, set amid lush green surroundings and the tranquil lake.        
	Douglas is said to have also visited Osian, an ancient village 65km from Jodhpur on the highway to Bikaner, to soak in its rustic charm. Osian is famous for its cluster of ruined Brahmanical and Jain temples dating from the eighth to the 11th century.        
	Sources said he dropped in at the railway station since his adventure movie tells the story of a diamond heist on an Indian train.        
	However, the Meherangarh Fort, contrary to expectations, got the cold shoulder, as did the media who were kept out by a cloak of security.        
	The shooting begins early next year. Sources said Douglas wanted a Bollywood-style song-and-dance routine in the film, being co-produced by Indian production house Percept Picture Company and Douglass Further Films.        
	The actor is said to have been so impressed by Indias rising visibility in culture, design, fashion and films that he was keen on an Indian setting for the second sequel to his superhit 1984 movie, Romancing the Stone. The first sequel, the Jewel of the Nile (1985), had been unimpressive.        
	Racing the Monsoon was once touted as Aishwarya Rais possible Hollywood debut, but sources said the Indian actress was dropped because the film needed someone with a global appeal and Zeta-Jones fitted the bill better.        
	Zeta-Jones, in an interview to The Daily Telegraph sometime ago, had said: Michael and I are developing a script that will be set in India. We will take our kids and all of us will come there, set up camp in India and shoot a film. I am looking forward to be in India.

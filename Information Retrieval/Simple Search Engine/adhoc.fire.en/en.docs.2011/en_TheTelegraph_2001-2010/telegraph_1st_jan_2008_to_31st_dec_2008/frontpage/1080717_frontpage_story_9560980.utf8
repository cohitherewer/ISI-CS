          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Ranchi, July 16: The state cabinet today approved the rehabilitation and resettlement (R amp;R) policy, but chief minister Madhu Kodas reluctance to pass a legislation to this effect in the Assembly has led to fears over its longevity.         
	For, Koda himself discarded the R amp;R policy passed by the cabinet of his predecessor Arjun Munda. The R amp;R policy passed today could also meet the same fate in case there is a change of guard even though the chief minister cited other reasons for not passing the legislation right now.        
	The policy prepared by my predecessor had several loopholes. We have plugged them. Our policy has a close resemblance to the national policy. If need be, we will get a legislation passed by the Assembly, said Koda.        
	Our policy is much better than any other similar policy in the entire country. It is mandatory for the industrial houses to give compensatory jobs to land donors.         
	This apart, they will be given houses nearby and other basic amenities. A maintenance allowance of Rs 1,000 per month will be given for 30 years. The land-less people displaced by the new projects will also be given houses, said the chief minister.        
	According to the policy passed today, compensatory jobs would be given to a member of each of the nuclear families losing household or agricultural lands, or both, as per their qualifications and skills.         
	In the event of vacancies in future, the displaced families would be given priority. The investors would have to organise technical or vocational training programmes to enable the land donors avail maximum benefits.        
	The rehabilitation and resettlement commissioner, in consultation with gram sabhas and industrialists, would be responsible for preparing the list of candidates ought to be given jobs on priority basis. Ten years age relaxation would also be granted to qualified candidates.        
	The new incumbents, too, would have to give similar benefits to the original land donors.         
	If the companies sell of their land to third party, 80 per cent of the net earnings would go to the original land donors.

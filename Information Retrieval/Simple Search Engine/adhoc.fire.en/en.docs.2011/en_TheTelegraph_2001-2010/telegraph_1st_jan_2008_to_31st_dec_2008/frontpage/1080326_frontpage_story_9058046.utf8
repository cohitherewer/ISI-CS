	New Delhi, March 25: China has taken up with India the security of its mission in the capital in the wake of protests outside the embassy and sought to know whether Vice-President Hamid Ansari was planning to meet the Dalai Lama.        
	A few Tibetan protesters had entered the Chinese embassy complex  the largest such facility in the capital  after scaling the boundary wall on March 21.        
	The Indian ambassador to China, Nirupama Rao, was summoned by Chinese foreign ministry officials on the same day.         
	More than 70 protesters at the Chinese embassy in New Delhi were arrested and are now lodged in Tihar Jail. Sources said China expressed concern over the security breach on its embassy premises. India assured China that its position on Tibet remained consistent and that Delhi would not allow its territory to be used for political activities.        
	Describing the protesters entry as unfortunate, India said it accorded top priority to the safety and security of the Chinese mission.         
	Even as Beijing criticised India for the embassy breach, several Tibetan protesters were stopped in Sikkim while trying to crossover to Tibet. Another batch of marchers who started from Dharamsala has reached Chandigarh.         
	Guarding the Dalai Lama from the controversy, the Tibetan government-in-exile said he had always appealed for non-violent forms of protest and adherence to the law of the land where they reside.         
	His Holiness has always sought a mutually beneficial solution to maintain the unity and stability of China, Tenzin Takhla, the secretary to the Dalai Lama, told The Telegraph from McLeodganj.        
	India has also conveyed to China that no meeting was planned between the Dalai Lama and Ansari as reported in sections of the media. Officials in the Vice-Presidents office, too, clarified that no meeting was scheduled.        
	But the Dalai Lamas office in Dharamsala did not deny that such a meeting was planned. The exiled leaders office said it had no comments to make on the issue.

	Ranchi/Dumka, Aug. 30: Fresh from his victory in the trust vote in the Assembly, chief minister Shibu Soren today made an aerial survey of flood affected areas in Sahebganj district and assured its residents that he would ensure relief wasnt delayed.        
	Dont worry. Now I have come. Erring officials will be taken to task. Relief work has always remained neglected in this area. But, things will be set right now, he said.         
	Soren, who was accompanied by Rajmahal Lok Sabha member Hemlal Murmu and the states agriculture secretary, D.K. Tiwari, met the flood hit people of the district and said he had ordered the states disaster management team to stay prepared for any eventuality. Though the flood scenario in Sahebganj wasnt as grim as in neighbouring Bihar, the chief minister advised people not to worry since his government was ready to take care of their problems.         
	Soren lamented that despite specific directions form the state headquarters in the past, most of the officials were sitting idle. Also, he added that though the water levels in the Ganga had receded during the last 24 hours, soil erosion due to the flooding posed a big threat to NH-80 linking Sarkanda with Manglaghat.         
	Back in Ranchi in the evening, Soren refused to comment on the death of 11 policemen in Ghatshila in a landmine blast triggered by Maoists  his aides said he was waiting for a detailed report from state DGP V.D. Ram.         
	Soren was also scheduled to meet the governor, but could not do so as Syed Sibtey Razi was away in New Delhi. The chief minister was likely to go to Deoghar tomorrow.

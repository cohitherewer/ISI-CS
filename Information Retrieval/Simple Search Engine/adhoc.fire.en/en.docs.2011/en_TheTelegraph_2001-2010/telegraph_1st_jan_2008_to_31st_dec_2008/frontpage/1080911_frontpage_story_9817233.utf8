  - Cottonians skip sports day for ghat        A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Guwahati, Sept. 10: Three students who decided to skip their schools annual sports meet and enjoy a swim instead were swept away by the Brahmaputra from Sukleswar temple ghat around noon today.         
	Jyoti Kalita, 17, Labajit Sarma, 17, and Diganta Rajbongshi, 18,  all first year higher secondary students of Cotton Collegiate Government Higher Secondary School at Panbazar  were among a group of six who came for the late morning swim.         
	Police found schoolbags, uniforms and shoes on the bank but could not trace the boys.         
	Witnesses said the six in school uniform chatted on the bank for a while.         
	Then five of them jumped into the river.         
	One sat on the bank keeping an eye on the schoolbags. Suddenly one of them went deeper into the river and drowned, Mohammad Shahid Ali, a witness, said.        
	Seeing their classmate in trouble, two of them rushed to his aid. In the process, they got swept away by the strong undercurrent of the river, which is in spate because of heavy rains, Ali said.        
	Soon after the mishap, city police, river police and members of the National Disaster Response Force raised by the BSF, personnel from civil defence and homeguards began a rescue operation, which continued till late evening.         
	Boats and divers were also pressed into action.         
	The operation will resume early tomorrow morning, a river police officer said.        
	Three boys may have drowned. Chances of rescuing them seem remote now. We have also alerted the police stations downstream to watch out for the boys, he said.        
	Padumi, Jyotis mother, wept inconsolably at Panbazar police station, where she had rushed for information about her son.        
	Labajit, son of Ranjit Sarma, was from Narikal Basti, while Diganta, son of Kartik Rajbongshi, lived in the Geetanagar locality.        
	The officer said they were unsure of the identities of the other three students who went to the ghat with the victims. They apparently got out of water and fled the scene.        
	The sport meet at the boys school was cut short when news of the drowning arrived.         
	A shocked Pabitra Kumar Deka, principal of Cotton Collegiate School, said he was not sure if the boys went to the ghat from school or straight away from their homes.        
	I am not sure. We did not take attendance today because of the sports meet, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Inside a Democratic booth
                                                                                                           Inside a Democratic booth
  - Voting system is too modern and ballot is outdated                                 I voted                                  
	Lubica Hauswaldova, who has been staying in the US since 2000, wrote the following first-person account for The Telegraph from Chevy Chase, Maryland, which held the Democratic presidential candidate primary on Tuesday.              
	I voted. Yo vot.        
	A poll worker put a sticker with the US flag and those words both in English and Spanish on the lapel of my coat as I was leaving the polling station. Except on election day, it is a lecture room and an occasional concert hall. The chairs were removed. On Tuesday, the grand piano was pulled to a corner and that space was filled with electronic voting machines.        
	I did not really vote. I am not a US citizen. I accompanied my neighbour, an elderly lady, to help her cast her very first Democratic primary vote. She votes regularly in the general elections but, like a majority of American voters, she does not bother to vote in the primaries.        
	This time is different! A historic opportunity to vote for the first viable female or African American candidate is not an occasion to miss.        
	However, the historic vote  for the country as well as for my friend  has its challenges: I dont want to vote for the delegates! she says.        
	During a short walk to the polling station, we have a quick course in political literacy. I explain to her that during primaries, voters choose delegates for the Democratic and Republican National Conventions and the delegates in turn will choose the nominees for the general elections. Therefore, she has to vote for her chosen candidate as well as his eight delegates from our congressional district.        
	Everybody would recognise the polling place. There are lawn signs with names of the candidates in front of the building. Campaign volunteers circle around. And then there is a sign with No electioneering beyond this point and we enter the building.        
	It runs efficiently inside. This is a precinct in an upscale area and the polling station is well equipped and well staffed. The short line of voters moves fast.        
	First, we approach the registration table. Unlike in poorer areas where polling workers flip the pages of voter rolls, my neighbour just tells her name and date of birth to the woman behind the computer screen, a quick click-click and she is handed a memory card. Now we can go to vote.         
	Because she is accompanied by another person, we have to get special permission from the election judge. My friend fills out a small form with her name and address and the same for me.        
	Finally we go to our booth. It actually is no booth. Here in Maryland, in Montgomery County, it is a stand with a touch-screen voting machine with covered sides for privacy. There are plenty of them in the hall. I can see that the young vote in no time. However, older folks need time and often guidance and assistance of election workers to navigate the challenging world of electronic voting.        
	So does my friend. First, we have to insert the memory card into the machine. I notice that it is one of the infamous Diebold machines that have already caused a lot of concern and distrust here in the US for alleged low security and voting integrity risk. Voters in Maryland do not like the fact that these machines have no paper trail and, therefore, there is no way for a proper recount in case of challenged election results.        
	We quickly read the instructions on the display and proceed to the actual ballot.        
	Ha! What is this? There are only two candidates left in the Democratic race: Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. But our ballot still has the names of all the original candidates, including those that have already withdrawn from the race.        
	My neighbour is confused. Then comes the ballot with the names of those delegates. First men, then women. Absolutely unknown names.         
	How shall I choose? she whispers. I tell her to choose those with the name of her candidate in the brackets behind their names. Done.        
	The vote for the Democratic candidate for Congress, some local judges and candidates for the educational board still remains. Done. Done. Done.        
	Not yet. A page pops up to review the entire choices and make changes. Then the ballot is cast.        
	We get our stickers and leave. My neighbour suddenly needs reassurance. She voted for Obama but now she has doubts. Is he a Muslim? Did he study in a madarsa?        
	Her questions are the result of a series of gossip mailers spread around the country by post or by the Internet because Obama has the little-used middle name Hussein. Low-information voters, and there are too many of them, are susceptible to this kind of canard.        
	In the evening, we are watching the election results of the so-called Potomac primaries, two states along the Potomac river: Maryland and Virginia and the nations capital Washington. Obama sweeps all three of them with high margins.

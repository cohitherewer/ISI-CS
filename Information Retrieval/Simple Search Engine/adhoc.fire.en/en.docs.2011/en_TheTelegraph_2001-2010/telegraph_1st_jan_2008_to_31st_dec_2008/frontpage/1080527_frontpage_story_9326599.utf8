          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Chakraborty, Salim                                 
	Calcutta, May 26: The patriarch and the panchayat polls have made the CPM kinder.        
	Subhas Chakrabortys 37-year wait ended today with the party announcing his elevation to the state secretariat. Mohammad Salim has also been inducted into the powerful council, keeping in mind the minority backlash partly blamed for the panchayat election setback.        
	The berth has been eluding Chakraborty, the transport minister who rarely shies off a controversy, since 1971, despite the vocal support of Jyoti Basu who risked the partys wrath by publicly seeking his acolytes inclusion in the central committee and the state secretariat.        
	The central committee enjoys a higher grade in the party but in practical terms, the state secretariat wields enormous power.        
	A fresh  but this time discreet  appeal by Basu last evening to general secretary Prakash Karat is believed to have eventually prompted the party to fulfil the veterans wish.        
	 Usually not susceptible to tugs at the heartstrings, the CPM has been going through an emotional roller-coaster with another patriarch, Harkishen Singh Surjeet, in hospital.        
	Chakraborty also has been going out of his way to be in the good books of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who was earlier averse to the maverick ministers induction.        
	Its eagerness to keep a lid on dissent in the wake of the rural polls and ahead of the general election might also have made the party accommodate Chakraborty.        
	The transport minister has been waiting for the promotion since 1971 when he was inducted into the state committee, a prerequisite for elevation to the secretariat.         
	A happy Chakraborty thanked Basu. No one can deny Jyotibabus importance in the party, he said. The minister also offered an olive branch to Bhattacharjee. Industrialisation is a must and land has to be acquired. But we have to take people along with us.        
	Salims elevation underscored the partys efforts to arrest the erosion of its support base among Muslims.        
	Salim, who was made a regular member of the state committee hours before the promotion, can speak Bengali, English as well as Urdu and has the ability to communicate with both moderate voices and religious organisations.        
	Mohammad Amin, who made it to the politburo, has been relieved from the secretariat to help him focus on central affairs.

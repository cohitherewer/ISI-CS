          OUR BUREAU                               
	Mangaldoi/Kokrajhar/Guwahati, Oct. 25: The two rape victims from Rowta were examined by a two-member team from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Mangaldoi Civil Hospital this morning.This was the third medical test they underwent within a week.         
	Dr P. Garg and Dr N. Malhotra from AIIMS conducted the tests on the two women to find evidence of rape. They left for New Delhi in the afternoon.        
	The two women were checked twice earlier, first at the Mangaldoi Civil Hospital and then at Gauhati Medical College Hospital yesterday.        
	A civil hospital source said the AIIMS doctors examined the duo and slides of specimen collected from them during the first test on October 23.         
	The AIIMS doctors submitted a confidential report to the additional superintendent of police, S. Parashar, the investigating officer, from Udalguri district and left thereafter. The two women were taken to Udalguri, police said.        
	Udalguri police today reiterated that the interrogation of the three CRPF men identified by the alleged victims was on and the report would be released tomorrow.         
	Local organisations however were not impressed, saying the repeated tests were nothing but dilly-dallying tactics by the government.         
	The All Bodo Students Union, Bodo Women Justice Forum and All Bodo Women Welfare Federation termed the government decision of re-examining the women by the AIIMS doctors as meaningless.         
	The ABSU said it would move Gauhati High Court against police inaction in arresting the culprits after the court reopens on October 29.         
	The government has resorted to a tactic to delay proceedings. The re-tests has no meaning after so many days of the crime and the victims destroying all evidence, having taken a bath and washing the clothes they were wearing at the time of the alleged assault, ABSU vice-president Promode Boro said.         
	Bodo Women Justice Forum president Anjali Daimary said the victims have already identified the culprits and they should be arrested immediately, she asserted.        
	Even while the rape case dominated discussions in Mangaldoi and Udalguri, members of the Bhumidhar Barman-led cabinet sub-committee today visited the clash-hit Udalguri and Darrang districts to discuss the rehabilitation, relief and security of those affected in the riots that erupted on October 3.         
	Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF) MLA Karendra Basumatary, on the other hand, urged the government to shift the pregnant women to hospitals following the death of three children at the relief camps in Darrang district recently.

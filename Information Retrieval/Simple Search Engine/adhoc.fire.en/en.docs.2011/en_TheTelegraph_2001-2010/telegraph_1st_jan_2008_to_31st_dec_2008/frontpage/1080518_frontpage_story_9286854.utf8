The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Game Jaipur shows its grit 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Game Jaipur shows its grit

	Jaipur, May 17: The sixes rained as usual but the Indian Premier League looked beyond instant thrills for an afternoon at the Sawai Mansingh stadium, four days after serial bombers killed 63 people here.        
	The crowd of 5,000 fans was less than a fourth of the previous games 22,000, but that seemed to matter as little as the actual cricket, despite a thumping win for home team Rajasthan Royals.        
	No one missed the Washington Redskins although the Bangalore Royal Challengers, beaten by 65 runs, could have done with some cheering up. The cheerleaders were absent as a mark of respect to those killed in Tuesdays blasts.        
	But todays show was more about the action on the stands than on the ground.        
	For the IPL and its boss, Jaipurs own Lalit Modi, the frenzied shouts of Halla bol, halla bol and Hindustan zindabad  the Rajasthan team chants  would have been worth far more than the two points Shane Warnes boys gained.        
	Most of the stands looked empty in a stadium that can hold 35,000. But it was the East stand that saved the day with its young crowd seemingly unaffected by a blazing afternoon, with the mercury in the upper 40s.        
	It was as if Jaipur was saying what Rahul Dravid would say after the match: I am not facing adversity for the first time nor the last time; so keep your chin up, keep fighting.        
	Had we not organised this match this city would have carried a permanent scar, said spectator Avadhesh Soni.        
	The MBA student complimented the police but also cited security lapses. Cellphones were banned but Avadhesh smuggled one in his shoe just to test the security.         
	More than 3,000 police personnel were deployed, double the number in the last match. Sniffer dogs did the rounds.        
	Captain Warne, worried about security after the blasts, was apparently left deeply impressed by the citys fortitude.        
	He (Warne) was enquiring whether there were riots in Jaipur after the terror attack. But then he saw the bravery of this city and how it has recovered, said Anant Vyas, the Royals media liaison officer.        
	All the three foreigners who wanted to quit after the blasts  Warne, Shane Watson and Graeme Smith  did brilliantly on the field.        
	The city showed its grit in a different way: there has been no communal tension.         
	Hindus and Muslims have worked together to help the injured and bereaved. So Kishanlal, who caught a bus from a nearby village to watch the match, and Sirajuddin Ahmed, who came with wife Samina, had identical views. Well die if we have to, but well watch the match, Kishanlal said.        
	The IPL has promised Rs 6 crore towards the chief ministers relief fund. Vasundhara Raje herself turned up to show solidarity, dressed in the Rajasthan Royals colours: blue and ochre.         
	Only the VIP stand at the northern end remained largely vacant.

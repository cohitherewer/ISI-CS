	New Delhi, Jan. 10: President Pratibha Patil can buy a Tata Nano with a months salary after she got a raise today.
    
	The Manmohan Singh cabinet today decided to double the Presidents salary from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh a month.
    
	Vice-President Hamid Ansaris pay has been raised from Rs 40,000 to Rs 85,000 and that of governors from Rs 36,000 to Rs 75,000. 
    
	Former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and his deputy Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, too, have reason to smile. Since the new pay structure takes retrospective effect from April 1, 2007, they will get accumulated salary till July and August 2007, respectively, when they demitted office.
    
	Kalam has further reason to be happy. Presidents pension, too, has been doubled from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 6 lakh a year. 
    
	Sources said the President and the Vice-President had got their last raise in 1998, when Parliament amended the Presidents Emolument amp; Pension Act, 1951.
    
	A family pension that is half of their pension will be given to spouses of deceased Presidents, Vice-Presidents and governors. 
    
	Parliamentary affairs minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said the raise was necessary as cabinet ministers, who are also MPs, were earning more than the Vice-President, who is the chairman of the Rajya Sabha. At present, the ministers draw Rs 68,000.
    
	Das Munshi said the decision to increase the salaries had been taken last year but was deferred as the then President and Vice-President were retiring. 
    
	Former Presidents and Vice-Presidents are allowed several perks, including the use of a furnished residence without payment of rent, a telephone and a car. Secretarial staff, including a private secretary, a personal assistant and a peon, and office expenses are also allowed. Medical treatment is free as is travel anywhere in the country by the highest class by air, rail or steamer, accompanied by one person.
    
	Indias first President, Rajendra Prasad, had a salary of Rs 10,000 but would draw only Rs 6,000  choosing to forego Rs 4,000. Starting his second term in office in May 1957  Prasad is the only President to have served twice  wrote to then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru offering to forego 50 per cent of his salary. 
    
	A senior cabinet minister defended the raise, citing the example of the US President who gets $400,000 a year. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown earns about $375,000 annually, he said. 
    
	Closer home, Reliance CEO Mukesh Ambanis annual salary is Rs 24 crore, the minister added.

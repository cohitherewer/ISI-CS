The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Eye on cadres, CPM takes up retail rules
                                                                                                           Eye on cadres, CPM takes up retail rules
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Coimbatore, March 29: The CPM is set to ask Left-ruled states to regulate big domestic players in the retail sector, chiselling an alternative policy that the party hopes will help it address the concerns of sceptical cadres.        
	The draft political resolution, on which talks began at the party congress today, has mentioned the Reliance foray in retail while opposing entry of FDI in the sector.        
	The entry of big Indian corporates into the retail trade has a similar effect. At present, there is no law to restrict entry into the corporate sector. Taking advantage of this, companies like Reliance have entered retail trade in a big way, the resolution said.        
	The CPM has set out a policy document for licensing and regulating the entry of corporates in retail trade. Till the central government puts in place such a policy, the Left-led governments should take steps to regulate their entry.        
	The Bengal CPM is not against the entry of Reliance but ally Forward Bloc, which has a stranglehold on the agri-marketing network in the state, and cadres elsewhere are opposed to it.        
	The proposed regulations will help the party claim that its policy safeguards the interests of small shops and is different from that of the Congress-led UPA and, at the same time, allow big investors to step in but with some checks and balances.        
	The partys political-organisational report has a separate chapter on the Bengal, Kerala and Tripura governments and suggestions on the contours of a policy framework for them. Sources said the moves to regulate big retail groups would be part of the framework.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat iterated the partys opposition to FDI in retail.        
	How is FDI in retail trade beneficial when it will lead to loss of livelihood for millions of shopkeepers and traders? he asked.        
	The party wants the Left governments to evolve alternative policies based on a uniformity of approach. They have to work within a broad policy framework that would be shaped in the party congress, a politburo member said.        
	In contrast, the V.S. Achuthanandan government in Kerala is moving to fetter domestic retail chains.        
	We were considering bringing legislation to control the entry of corporate groups in retail. We want the big retail groups to seek licences from municipalities and panchayats before opening their shops, said Kerala CPM leader M. Vijayakumar.        
	It is not clear what regulations the party has in mind but Kerala has thought up a surcharge which may form a model for other states ruled by the Left, depending on the impact of the levy on the ground.

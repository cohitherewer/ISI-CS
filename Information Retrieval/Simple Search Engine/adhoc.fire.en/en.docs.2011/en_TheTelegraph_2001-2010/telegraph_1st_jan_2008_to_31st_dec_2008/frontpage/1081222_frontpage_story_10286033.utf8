	Mumbai, Dec. 21: A queue of cars choked traffic this afternoon as Mumbais elite gathered at the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel amid pin-proof security to mark a defiant yet largely symbolic re-opening.        
	Ratan Tata summed up the mood: You can hurt us. But you cannot knock us out.        
	The mood showed also in the way Maharashtras new chief minister, Ashok Chavan, stood alone and forgotten as invitees shook hands with Taj general manager Karamveer Singh Kang, who lost his wife and two sons on 26/11 night even as he guided guests to safety.        
	Kang stood outside the Tower wing entrance ushering in guests, his face set in stone but the smile of hospitality plastered on his lips. Later, when he marched through the lobby with hotel staff who had braved bullets to help the guests, the thunderous applause lasted over five minutes.        
	The whos who of Mumbais corporate and social circuits sang the national anthem and discussed the long night of terror over the 4pm high tea as the hotel reopened 268 rooms, nine suites and half-a-dozen restaurants.        
	I am glad the shops and boutiques of the Taj arcade have reopened. I need to shop for my daughters wedding, said the wife of a top city doctor.        
	The hotel, where the day began with multi-faith prayers joined in by Tata, will place a brass-and-bronze Tree of Life in the lobby with the names of all the 31 who died at the Taj engraved on it. The six-foot piece of art had survived the attack unscathed on the fifth floor.        
	Among the guests were Western Naval Command chief Vice-Admiral J.S. Bedi, stage actor Dolly Thakore, ex-cop Julio Ribeiro, Deepak Parekh (HDFC chairman) and Hemendra Kothari (DSP Merrill Lynch chairman), adman Prasoon Joshi, lawyers Mahesh and Ram Jethmalani and Soli Sorabjee and writer Shobhaa De, builder Niranjan Hiranandani and diplomats, including the Australian and French consul-generals.        
	At 7.30pm, when the hotel threw open the doors of restaurants Shamiana, Zodiac Grill, Souk, Masala Kraft, Star Board and Aquarius, many of the invitees made their way to their favourite haunts.        
	I have another engagement, but I will take a dekko at the Souk. Someone told me they wont charge the guests tonight, a socialite giggled. She would have been disappointed  only the high tea, strictly for invitees, was free.        
	We have received bookings for 150 rooms so far, said R.K. Krishna Kumar, the vice-president of Indian Hotels, which owns the Taj.        
	Only the Tower wing has been opened, and the badly damaged heritage wing is likely to be closed for some more months, said Ajay Misra, the head of sales, marketing, Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces.        
	The Trident on Marine Drive, where 32 people died, too will take a while to get its Oberoi wing operational. The Trident welcomed its guests back today with breakfast.        
	The first patrons were served with thank you notes in place of bills. Of the 550 rooms, 100 have been booked for tonight, said Gurendra Verma, the executive vice-president, Oberoi Hotels group.        
	Mumbai-based industrialist Arif Ansari, who was dining with son Rafi, 12, on terror night  both had pretended to be dead and lain under the table for seven-eight hours  was back today.         
	The staff broke into applause as the doors opened to welcome the first busload of guests. I was among the first to enter, he said.        
	At the Taj and the Trident, checking in was slightly different today. Alongside the namaste and marigold garlands, there were body frisks and metal scanners. For once, the guests did not throw a fit when frisked or asked to show their invitation cards or identity proof at several points.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Judge gets a   feel of Beltola
                                                                                                        Judge gets a   feel of Beltola
          A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, Feb. 8: Justice (retd) R.K. Manisena Singh today spent two-and-a-half hours touring Beltola and speaking to people who either witnessed or were caught in the street violence there on November 24.        
	The former judge was a satisfied man at the end of the unannounced tour. A very, very happy and fruitful trip, he said, indicating that he had gathered important material for his probe.        
	Singhs convoy covered the stretch from Dispur Last Gate to the Dakshin Beltola High School, where participants in the rally organised by the All Adivasi Students Association of Assam had gathered prior to the violence. The retired judge stopped at various places to speak to shopkeepers and residents, 20 of whom he formally summoned as witnesses to a hearing next week.         
	I am very happy with the response I received. I have asked them to appear before the commission to record their statements as they were witnesses to how the events unfolded. I talked to many people. Some of them were assaulted by the mob, while others saw either their vehicles or houses damaged, Singh said.        
	Monojit Sharma, who was at Beltola Tinali when the convoy stopped by, said residents warmed up to Singhs gentle persuasion and narrated their versions of the root of the violence that claimed one life and left over 250 people injured. Some of those who spoke to him said such a huge assembly  the Adivasi rally had been organised as part of the campaign for Scheduled Tribe status  should not have been allowed without proper security arrangements.         
	The owner of a kiosk near the high school complained about some of the rallyists not paying for his paan, but said there was nothing to suggest they would resort to violence.         
	Some residents said they were unaware of the newspaper advertisement seeking information about the incident. A few were indifferent, saying they were not convinced anything good would come of deposing before the inquiry commission.         
	But attitudes changed after Singhs interaction with them. The commission even asked the administration to provide conveyance to the locals so that they do not face inconvenience in going to the venue of the hearings next week, a source said.         
	The original dates for the next round of hearings are Monday and Tuesday, but they will probably be postponed by a day because of Saraswati Puja.         
	Singh said he was confident of meeting the deadline for completion of his inquiry.                                 
	He decided to make the trip to Beltola after doubts were raised by certain quarters about the authenticity of the statements already recorded by him.        
	 Justice Singh must have now got a feel of the area and also an idea of what and who triggered the violence, a witness said.

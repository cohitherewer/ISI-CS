The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Honble MP, your time is up
                                                                                                           Honble MP, your time is up
  - Three-minute ceiling on RS Zero Hour speeches kicks in           NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                                     
	New Delhi, March 12: Technology has done what hallowed tradition could not: shut Amar Singh up.        
	The loquacious Samajwadi Party MP was holding forth on a zehrili (poisonous) CD when the microphone went dead on him.         
	We have enforced the three-minute rule, Rehman Khan, the Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson, announced.        
	Zero Hour, which starts at noon, follows Question Hour in both Houses of Parliament and is the time when members can raise matters of urgent concern. Each MP is expected to speak for not more than three minutes.        
	But as the CPIs D. Raja, who was the next to be cut short, admitted, MPs usually launch into long speeches, disregarding pleas from the chair to wind up.        
	The solution: German technology.        
	The Brahler Inc. microphone system installed 15 years ago came equipped with a provision for timed cut-offs.         
	Yesterday, an all-party meeting had agreed with Khan that it should be used to enforce the three-minute rule. Not a part of the rules of conduct in Parliament, the time limit was implemented by consensus for judicious use of time, sources said.         
	Amar Singh was going strong about the CD, his voice competing with that of BJP members shouting slogans against the Kerala government. He hadnt noticed the electronic counter overhead counting the seconds as he spoke  till his time was up.        
	Back in the control room, sound engineers were following Khans directives. They would touch a switch on the console after three minutes and the microphone would switch off in the Rajya Sabha.         
	The MP was granted another three minutes, as was Raja after him. But the intervening silence broke their tempo.        
	We welcome the three-minute rule, Raja said, pointing out that the deputy chairperson had argued that if each MP stuck to three minutes, 10 notices could be taken up.        
	The BJPs M. Venkaiah Naidu kept speaking into a microphone that had gone dead.         
	A smiling Khan alerted members that the system was working.         
	But like in the monsoon session last year, when we tried the technology, it does not last long with members. This one also will not work for long, an engineer said.         
	The trial had not lasted long because MPs, who are known to love the sound of their voice, protested.        
	Wouldnt the technology be useful in the Lok Sabha?         
	In my 11 years as a parliamentarian, I have not seen it being implemented, Andhra Pradesh MP M. Jagannath said.         
	Maybe, its time starts now.

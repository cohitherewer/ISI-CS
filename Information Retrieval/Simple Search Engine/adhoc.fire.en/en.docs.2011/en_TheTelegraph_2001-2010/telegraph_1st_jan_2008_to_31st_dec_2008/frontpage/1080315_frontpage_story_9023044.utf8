The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Reliance man in RS poll surprise
                                                                                                           Reliance man in RS poll surprise
          SUMAN K SHRIVASTAVA                                              
	Ranchi, March 14: Rajya Sabha elections from Jharkhand have thrown up a surprise. And more than the candidate  Ahmedabad-based group president (corporate affairs) of Reliance Industries Parimal Nathwani  its the support the Independent has received from 11 JMM and one BJP MLA thats baffling political formations here.         
	JMM chief Shibu Soren, who lobbied the Congress and the RJD successfully to back his son Durga as candidate, would only say that Nathwani wasnt the UPAs official nominee.         
	He refused comment on those who backed Nathwani, fuelling speculation that the 11 JMM MLAs may have rebelled against his leadership for pushing his sons case. To add to the intrigue, sources close to Soren maintained that Durga would be filing his nomination papers on the last day tomorrow.         
	UPA partners, the sources added, had agreed to support Sorens son in the interest of keeping the alliance alive. It was apparently under this formula RJD chief Lalu Prasad supported Ram Vilas Paswans nominee in Bihar.        
	The 11 JMM MLAs who proposed Nathwanis name are Salkhan Soren, Thomas Soren, Sufal Marandi, Munnalal, Nirel Purty, Haru Rajwar, Mathura Mahto, Sushila Hansda, Jagannath Mahto, Amulaya Sardar and Sukhram Oraon. Tala Marandi of the BJP is the twelfth.        
	Deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi and human resources development minister Bandhu Tirkey were taken aback by Nathwanis candidature.         
	We will discuss our next move at health minister Bhanu Pratap Sahis dinner, he said.         
	Nathwani was, however, confident. I have the support of 12 MLAs. So I will remain in the fray even if Durga Soren files his papers. But I want to contest as an Independent, he told The Telegraph.         
	He said India is one and hence he was free to contest from anywhere. Jharkhand has a lot of potential for development. So, whoever is interested in development would support me, said the Reliance Industries official.        
	 Nathwani wouldnt comment on whether he had the backing of UPA leaders Sonia Gandhi or Lalu Prasad. I have done my homework before throwing my hat in the ring. I have met Shibu Soren once, he said.         
	The BJP also filed papers for its nominee, Jai Prakash Narayan Singh, today.         
	However, noted lawyer R.K. Anand has pulled out since he was uncomfortable with the situation in Jharkhand where 10 Independent ministers and MLAs would decide the fate of their Rajya Sabha bid.

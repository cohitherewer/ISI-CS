          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Agartala, Oct. 1: Three persons were killed and nearly 120 injured when five low-intensity blasts ripped through the heart of this capital city within a span of a few hours, shrouding tomorrows Id and the ensuing Durga Puja celebrations under a pall of terror.        
	The first four blasts occurred between 7.30 and 8pm and most of them in crowded places teeming with pre-Id and pre-Puja shoppers.        
	Though there was no official confirmation of the deaths, hospital sources put the toll at three and added that it might go up.        
	It is the first time that Tripura has faced urban terror as the states decades-old militancy has so far been dominated by tribal insurgent groups operating in tribal areas close to the Chittagong Hill Tracts.        
	The director-general of police, Pranay Sahai, refused to pinpoint any group or outfit for the blasts saying, My first job is to restore the shaken confidence of the people.        
	However, police sources pointed out that Huji was the main suspect as the city is bang on the border with Bangladesh and falls on the route taken by members of the outfit to enter India.        
	Chief minister Manik Sarkar and some of his ministerial colleagues rushed from one affected area to another as well as the hospitals to comfort the wounded. I dont want to hazard a guess over the group of people involved in the carnage. But we will find out who committed the atrocity, Sarkar said at GB Pant Hospitals.        
	For the injured, the trauma was intensified by the fact that hospitals in Agartala were least prepared to tackle an emergency of such magnitude, falling short of manpower and equipment to treat so many wounded people. Many of the injured reached the hospitals by themselves, covering bloodied faces with handkerchiefs or holding a broken and limp hand by the other. Wailing relatives of the dead and injured added to the cacophony of noise.        
	However, outside the hospital, Agartala turned into a ghost town as panic-stricken people shut themselves in, wondering where the next blast would take place.         
	At many homes, people tried frantically to call up friends and relatives to enquire about family members.        
	Police personnel used sniffer dogs to start investigations but admitted that it would be a Herculean task as Tripura police did not have the expertise to handle such cases.         
	It is a very new scenario for us. We will have to start from scratch, a young police officer said at the Radha Nagar blast site.        
	The police said the first bomb went off at a marketplace in Maharajganj, the biggest in the city.         
	The daily market  which sells vegetables and fish  was choc-a-bloc with evening shoppers when the bomb, kept in a bag hanging on a bicycle, went off. Three critically injured persons, who were rushed to the GB Medical College and Hospital, were declared dead by doctors. Over 50 people were injured.        
	Barely three minutes later, another bomb went off at a bus stand in the Radha Nagar area, barely 1km from Maharajganj. The police quoted eyewitnesses saying two youths on bicycles, their faces hidden by full-mask helmets, left a packet at one corner of the bus stand before disappearing. Even before people could realise what had happened, the bomb went off.         
	Most of the injured around 20  were shoppers to the marketplace located behind the bus terminus.        
	The third blast occurred at another marketplace, close to GB Hospital. The police said the people had very little idea where the bomb was kept as everyone was either buying or selling when the explosion occurred around 7.42pm.         
	Broken signboards and vegetables lay scattered among puddles of blood. Around 40 injured, including a number of women, were rushed to GB Medical College and Hospital in Agartala.        
	Around 10 minutes later, the fourth blast took place, this time in a relatively less crowded place at Aralia, a residential area.        
	The bomb was kept by the roadside. The police said 10 passersby were injured. Just as the city thought the worst was over, another big bang shook the city around 10.30pm at the Agartala motorstand. There was, however, no casualty in the blast. Quoting eyewitnesses police said two motorcycle-borne unidentified youths planted the bomb near a vehicle.

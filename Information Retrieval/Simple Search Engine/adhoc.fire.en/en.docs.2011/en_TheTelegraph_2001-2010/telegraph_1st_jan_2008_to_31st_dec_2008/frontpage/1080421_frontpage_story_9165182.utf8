          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, April 20: The army today busted a camp of Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF) near Manja in Karbi Anglong district of Assam, after gunning down one of the outfits members earlier in the morning.         
	A huge cache of arms and ammunition, enough to cause extensive damage to life and property, had been seized from the camp in a dense forest, 12km from Manja, army sources said.        
	The KLNLF retaliated by triggering a blast near the statue of Karbi martyr Rangfarpi Rangvi in Diphu town this evening.         
	Police sources said the deputy superintendent of police headquarters, Karbi Anglong, N. Dungal, sustained minor injuries in the blast.        
	A cart-puller spotted an abandoned bag near the statue around 7pm. He lost no time in informing the police.         
	Reverses suffered by the outfit in army operations prompted it to take retaliatory steps, the police source said.         
	The KLNLF militant was killed around 5 this morning in an operation that started last night.         
	Several of his comrades, suspected to have received injuries, escaped.         
	The operation comes 10 days after the outfit triggered a blast in the Howraghat area of the district, injuring 41 people.         
	Army sources said the haul was the result of an intensive search operation based on intelligence inputs from its personnel.         
	The operation is still on. The arms and explosives seized from the camp, prove the outfits strength, an army source said.         
	The haul included three AK-47 rifles and one of AK-56 series, a .30 US carbine, a 40mm single barrel grenade launcher, five .56mm rifles with under-barrel grenade launcher (UBGLs), eight UBGLs, 10 AK-47 magazines, a 3.3 rifle and 234 rounds of ammunition.         
	The explosives included 40 gelatine sticks and 10 electronic detonators which could have caused extensive damage to life and property, the source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sound of army boots in Jammu streets
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Sound of army boots in Jammu streets
          OUR BUREAU                            Protesters shout slogans against Jammu and Kashmir governor NN Vohra in Jammu on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	Srinagar/New Delhi, Aug. 2: The army, a feature of daily life in the Kashmir valley, had to be called out in Jammu a day after two persons were killed in alleged police firing on Amarnath land protesters.        
	As the countrys leaders racked their brains in not-too-distant Delhi over how to tackle the month-old agitation, the Jammu civil administration was forced to SOS the army.        
	Our army is out on the roads. We are assisting the civil police to maintain peace in the region, said Lt Col S.D. Goswami, the defence spokesperson in Jammu.        
	Unlike Srinagar, 293km away, the crunch of military boots is rarely heard in Jammu. No one could recall the last time the army had to man the towns streets.        
	Yesterday, Sunil Singh and Jugal Kishore died in alleged police firing on a mob in Samba, 60km from Jammu town, that had attacked the residence of a deputy commissioner. The army staged a flag march in Samba too.        
	The Jammu protests began on June 30 after the erstwhile Congress government bowed to a public uproar in Kashmir and revoked the allotment of 40 hectares of forest land to the Amarnath shrine board.        
	The agitation was called off on July 8, a day after the Congress-led government resigned. But on July 24 a young man, Kuldeep Kumar Dogra, committed suicide, allegedly in protest against the land revocation order. His death sparked fresh protests that have since gripped the town.        
	A strike called by the Shri Amarnath Sangharsh Samiti, a conglomerate of political, social and religious groups leading the protests, continued for the 10th day today.        
	Markets are closed and a thousand trucks are reportedly stranded between Jammu and Samba as agitators threaten an economic blockade of the Kashmir valley.        
	The police today detained former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti and Kranti Dal president Anan Sharma as they tried to address the media in Jammu. Sources said the two leaders were lodged in a police guesthouse at Kud, 100km from Jammu town.        
	Former MLA Shanti Devi of the Peoples Democratic Party, which had pulled out of the erstwhile government in protest against the land allotment, had her home stoned.        
	The violence has caught Delhi napping. The Congress leadership, busy plotting its own survival in power last month, had turned a blind eye to the tension in Jammu.        
	The Congresss Kashmir minder, Prithviraj Chavan, is yet to visit the region. Sources said it was only today that Sonia Gandhi revealed she was thinking of visiting the disturbed province.        
	She will visit soon, it appears, the Congresss Jammu MP, Madan Lal Sharma, said after meeting Sonia and home minister Shivraj Patil in Delhi. But Udhampurs Congress MP, Lal Singh, criticised the party. Koi sune tab na Dilli mein (someone has to first listen in Delhi), he said.        
	Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta conceded the situation continued to be bad. I have spoken to the DGP (state police chief) and curfew has been imposed, he said.         
	But a local politician said: The situation is not just bad, it is dangerous. Jammus anger at the raw deal it has got for the last six decades is showing, but I am more worried about the danger of communal tension, he said.        
	That fear haunts many. Hindu-majority Jammu has nursed a grouse against Delhi for paying more attention to Kashmir, whether on development projects or on peoples representation in the Assembly and Parliament.

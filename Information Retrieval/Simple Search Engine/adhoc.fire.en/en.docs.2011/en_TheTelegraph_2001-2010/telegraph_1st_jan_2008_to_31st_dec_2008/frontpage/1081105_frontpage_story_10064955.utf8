          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Singh                                   
	Patna, Nov. 4: Patna police today registered a case against Union minister Akhilesh Singh for allegedly slapping and abusing Kingfisher Airlines station manager Sagar Nath Das at the airport last night.         
	We have registered a case under IPC Sections 323 and 504 against the Union minister of state for food and civil supplies for allegedly manhandling the Kingfisher executive and have begun the investigation, an airport police station official said.         
	Sources said Sections 323 and 504 deal with manhandling someone doing their duty and creating a messy situation. After the minister called up the police and agreed to co-operate, the offence was changed from cognizable to non-cognizable.        
	Sagar Nath Das said Singh reported at Patna airport at 8.20pm to board a Calcutta flight when the planes doors had been shut and the flight cleared for take-off. Although I tried my best to board the minister, I found it impossible due to technical reasons, he said.         
	Das said he went to the minister to apologise for the failure. But instead of listening to me, he abused me and slapped me.         
	The ministers travel operator, Sanjiv, had called Das at 8.10pm to ask him to treat the booking as cancelled saying Singh had changed his plan because of Chhath puja.         
	Sanjiv said he called Das again at 8.15pm to say the minister had reached the airport and to request that the airline accommodate him. Das, however, said he got the second call at 8.20pm.         
	Singh, who was in Calcutta today, denied slapping Das. Of course, I scolded him. But I neither used any abusive words nor did I slap him, he said. I too have lodged a complaint against the Kingfisher executive with the civil aviation ministry.         
	Airport staff, however, said they saw Singh slap Das.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Unsaid message: Atal era ends
                                                                                                        Unsaid message: Atal era ends
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: The BJP today formally drew the curtains on the Vajpayee era, dispensing with even the formality of reading out a message from the former Prime Minister at its national executive meeting.        
	Atal Bihari Vajpayee had in a message told the last national executive, in Bhopal, that he was taking rest on medical advice but would return soon. Today, spokesperson Prakash Javadekar made it clear the party was no longer waiting for him.        
	Vajpayeeji wasnt present; there was no message from him either, he said. Asked why the senior leader didnt bless the crucial meet that took the victory vow, Javadekar said: His blessings are always there.        
	BJP president Rajnath Singh had set the tone in his inaugural address. We have declared the natural choice of our party and the country, L.K. Advani, as the future Prime Minister of India, he said.        
	Rajnath added: By approving our decision of declaring Advani as future Prime Minister, all our friends in NDA have given a message of unity. I believe this would lead us to success.        
	Vajpayee found a brief mention, when the party chief recalled that the former Prime Minister had blessed Advani. Advani has made a memorable contribution along with Vajpayee for the political rise of BJP and I hope that the BJP under his leadership would achieve memorable victory in the next election.        
	Advani, who was to address the national executive, said he would speak only at the concluding session of the national council that starts tomorrow. For his first policy statement since being anointed the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, Advani has opted for the bigger platform.         
	Apart from coming out with two resolutions  on politics and agriculture  the national council will amend the party constitution to reserve 33 per cent posts in the organisation for women.

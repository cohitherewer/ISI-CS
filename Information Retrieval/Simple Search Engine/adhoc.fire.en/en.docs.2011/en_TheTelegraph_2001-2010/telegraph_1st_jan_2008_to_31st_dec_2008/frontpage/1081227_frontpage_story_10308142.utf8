          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Dec. 26: The Nitish Kumar-led Bihar government has decided to sack 15,000 primary and secondary schoolteachers after discovering that they had submitted fake degrees and certificates.        
	The appointees were recruited during the first phase of an appointment spree, sponsored by the government, to fill the over 2 lakh vacancies in the states schools and institutions.        
	The second phase of the recruitment process is currently in progress.         
	The human resource department has already issued sack orders on the basis of an inquiry report in which the Bihar government found that 15,000 newly appointed teachers had submitted fake degrees and certificates, said human resource minister Harinarayan Singh.        
	The minister informed mediapersons today that the government had also blacklisted 75 BEd institutions across the country and in Nepal, since last week, to end the infiltration of fake degree holders from working in states schools.         
	The filtering process would be strict in the second phase of teachers recruitment  currently ongoing.        
	The government blacklisted institutions are located in Bihar, neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Orissa and Punjab.         
	The minister added that the degrees issued by the blacklisted institutions were neither recognised by the human resources department or the national council of teachers education.        
	For the second phase, Singh said, over 10 million candidates have applied against the 93,000 vacancies that are to be filled by the government. For the process the HRD has set up 9,000 recruitment centres.         
	He said the certificates and degrees submitted by the candidates were in the process of being thoroughly verified.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ulfa talks back   on Gogoi agenda
                                                                                                           Ulfa talks back   on Gogoi agenda
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, March 25: Dispur today signalled a fresh initiative to revive the stalled peace process with Ulfa by climbing down from its stand that any negotiation with the banned outfit should be within the ambit of the Constitution.         
	We are even ready for unconditional talks with Ulfa if it is willing to talk, chief minister Tarun Gogoi told the Assembly.         
	Gogoi left an escape hatch open in the event of criticism for going soft, particularly on Ulfas insistence that sovereignty be discussed, by saying that there was no basis for the demand.        
	The chief minister said except for Ulfa, nobody in the state was interested in a sovereign Assam and that all residents were proud to be Indians.         
	Expressing dismay over Ulfas lack of desire to talk peace, Gogoi said his government was even willing to facilitate the visit of an Opposition leader to Bangladesh to meet the Ulfa leadership and broker a dialogue.         
	Reminding the House that he had made a similar offer to Mamoni Raisom Goswami  one of the mediators in the Ulfa peace process  as well, he said his government always encouraged the efforts of peace emissaries.        
	The chief minister clarified that the arrest of Lachit Bordoloi, a member of the Ulfa-constituted Peoples Consultative Group (PCG), had nothing to do with his role as a peace broker.         
	We are not arresting anyone for establishing contacts with Ulfa to bring it to the negotiating table. But, at the same time, we cannot allow anyone to abet the outfit in its anti-national activities, he added.        
	Gogoi said it would be easy for Opposition members to win the confidence of Ulfa, which might not trust the ruling party as it carries out operations and other offensives against it.         
	At the same time, the chief minister took a dig at the AGP leadership by saying that contacting Ulfa would be a renewal of their old relation.         
	Earlier in the day, he blamed the AGP for bringing the cult of violence in the state during the Assam agitation. He said the trend was set by the killings at Nelie in the eighties.         
	The Opposition, however, rejected Gogois offer and said it was the governments responsibility to start peace parleys with Ulfa.         
	By making such comments, the chief minister is only manifesting his lack of interest in resolving the issue. He wants to keep the issue alive, leader of the Opposition Chandra Mohan Patowary told reporters after the days proceedings.         
	Replying to a cut motion, Gogoi had said earlier that his government was initiating development schemes, particularly in the backward areas, to check militancy. Use of force only will not solve the problem. I firmly believe that along with adequately equipping our security forces, we need to give emphasis on economic growth to tackle militancy, he added.

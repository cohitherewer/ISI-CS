          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                            Madhu Koda                                  
	Ranchi, May 9: Baffled to find that not a single farmer living in remote villages has been benefited by kisan credit cards, chief minister Madhu Koda today ordered departmental inquiry against erring officials, including the managing directors of co-operative banks.         
	Koda also sought detailed action taken reports in a week.        
	Most of these cards were given by Koda with much fanfare several months ago. In some of the functions, co-operative minister Dulal Bhuiyan too was present. But         
	the card-holders were never granted loans and other benefits.        
	Several card-holders from different parts of the state today met Koda at his residence and pleaded that these be taken back, since they were of no use.         
	He had received similar complaints also during his Chaibasa visit yesterday. In fact, he has regularly been receiving such complaints for the last few days.        
	Bewildered Koda consequently called up the officials of the co-operative department and sought detailed reports.         
	Although the chief minister did not go to his office today, he decided to hold a review meeting at his residence in the evening.        
	Sources said that it was observed that most of these irregularities had taken place during the tenure of former co-operative department secretary N.N. Sinha and registrar of co-operative societies Rahul Purwar. Worse, repeated orders passed by the government too were dumped aside by the dare devils.        
	Insiders maintained that the chief minister has taken strong exception to it.         
	He has decided to take necessary actions against the erring officials after proper inquiry. Co-operative secretary Sheela Kisku Rappaz has been asked to ensure that all the card-holders were being given their due share immediately. She has also been asked to submit detailed reports within a week.        
	Koda said that most of the complainants had received the cards at public functions in Ratu, Patamda and Jagannathpur.         
	While Koda distributed the cards in Ratu, Dulal Bhuiyan did it in Patamda. In Jagannathpur, both Koda and Bhuiyan were present.        
	I fail to understand, why the loans were not disbursed. The managing directors of the co-operative banks too will be taken to task. I am only waiting for the inquiry report, the chief minister added.

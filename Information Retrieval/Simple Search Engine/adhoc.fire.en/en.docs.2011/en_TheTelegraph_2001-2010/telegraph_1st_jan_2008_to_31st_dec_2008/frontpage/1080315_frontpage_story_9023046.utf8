The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Colleges race to snap up Dhoni
                                                                                                           Colleges race to snap up Dhoni
          AMIT GUPTA                            Dhoni                                  
	Ranchi, March 14: The prize catch of the IPL auction is again being bid for passionately.        
	This time its Ranchis Gossner College staking claim to its star student, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, lest the better known St Xaviers lure him away.        
	Gossner, a minority institution affiliated to Ranchi University, still has the India ODI captain registered as a BCom (accountancy honours) student of the 1999-2002 batch.        
	Technically, he is still our student since he is yet to take a college leaving certificate (CLC) or a transfer certificate, said Sidharth Kumar Ecka, Gossner principal.        
	We admit we never called him to complete his studies from our institution as we usually do with others. But we will now invite him to do so.        
	Gossners anxiety stems from Dhonis alleged wish to study at Ranchis St Xaviers College, an autonomous minority institution.        
	The star player is reported to have met St Xaviers authorities and said he wanted to enrol for its BCom programme.        
	Gossner, governed by the Gossner Evangelical Lutheran Church, will use its connections to influence the cricketer.        
	Our ex-student Chanchal Bhattacharya, a cricket coach in Ranchi, had introduced Dhoni to our college. Dhoni and our physical training instructor Anmol Khalko share a fine rapport, too. Well approach him through them, a Gossner official said.        
	If Dhoni still chooses St Xaviers, Gossner will not return the original copies of his school-leaving certificate and character certificate, issued by DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali.        
	If he turns us down, as per college norms, we will give him a photocopy of his certificates along with a CLC, Ecka said.        
	College games in-charge Anmol Khalko said Dhoni had been Gossners cricket captain for a short time.         
	He was admitted under the sports quota but, college authorities said, he would have made the cut anyway since he had scored over 57 per cent in his higher secondary exams.        
	Whether Dhoni used to attend his classes could not be ascertained since the attendance registers of that particular session could not be traced.        
	The slogan We want Dhoni reverberated across the college premises today.

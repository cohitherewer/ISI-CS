          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, April 21: Born of a marriage of convenience, the bandh called by Mamata Banerjee has died a premature death at the altar of real-life weddings.        
	Mamata today called off her first bandh in association with SUCI two hours ahead of schedule at 4pm, ostensibly keeping the marriage season in mind.        
	This is not the first time Mamata is cutting short a shutdown but the reason  marriages  is novel. However, sources said a lacklustre response from the Trinamul ranks  who are not yet reconciled to the idea of joining hands with a Left party  was one of the reasons that prompted Mamata to roll back the bandh.        
	Not that the reported indifference or the two-hour concession did anything to reduce the nuisance value of the bandh called against the price rise. With people refusing to take chances, the bandh cruised along on auto-pilot and managed to cripple life till the evening.        
	Aajke onek biyebari achhe. Charter pore bandh thakle tader onek ashubidha hobe (There are many weddings today and the families will be inconvenienced if the bandh stays after 4pm), Mamata told a rally in south Calcutta.        
	Monday wasnt suitable for weddings, according to almanacs, but quite a few receptions were on in the state. The recent wedding dates before April 27 were April 17 and 20. Normally, receptions are held after a days gap. But many were scheduled for Monday because of lack of availability of venues, said Arijit Roychowdhury of Gupta Press.        
	The bandhs early end will also help those who got married yesterday as, according to east Bengal customs, the groom leaves with the bride for her in-laws at sundown, said Pranati Bagchi of the PM Bagchi almanac family.        
	But a Trinamul supporter conceded that more pressing reasons might have forced Mamata to scale back the bandh.        
	We were absent from todays bandh since we did not find any logic behind it. Didi was dictated to by the SUCI leadership, her new-found ally, a Trinamul leader from Baruipur in South 24-Parganas said.        
	A Trinamul secretary from Purulia was more vocal. A shutdown with barely a month to go for the panchayat polls has inconvenienced us a lot. We did not participate in todays bandh, he said.        
	Other sources said Mamata was uncomfortable since the morning after getting reports that Trinamul activists were staying away from the bandh, barring some parts of Calcutta.        
	Later, she was told that some SUCI activists were picking fights and violence could eventually tell on Trinamul during the panchayat polls. It was then that a section of Trinamul leaders came up with the marriage excuse.        
	Mamata was so upset with SUCI leaders that she did not inform them before announcing her decision. We were not aware that Mamata had called off the bandh prematurely, SUCI state secretary Pravas Ghosh said. A joint media conference was called off.

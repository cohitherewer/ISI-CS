  - First steps to ending exploitation        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                             Shah Rukh Khan, surrounded by junior artistes, dances in Om Shanti Om                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: Bollywood may be taking its first steps to formulate a blueprint to curb exploitation of junior artistes, especially women, with government assistance.         
	A group of top directors and producers, including Firoz Nadiadwala, has requested the women and child development ministry to help draft industry guidelines to curb such exploitation, top government officials have said.         
	The filmmakers have also asked the government for assistance in setting up training modules that can help junior artistes find work once the project they are currently engaged in ends, sources said.         
	Junior artistes  men and women who dance in the background with the hero and heroine, or form a crowd  are largely unorganised and treated as unskilled labour by employers, the filmmakers said.         
	The plight of junior artistes was played out on celluloid in the 2007 blockbuster Om Shanti Om that lampoons the industry. It had Shah Rukh Khan playing a struggling junior artiste desperate to land a major film role.         
	The government, however, has yet to decide on whether it wants to join Bollywoods attempts to battle exploitation of junior artistes and in what capacity, the sources said.         
	Women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury is busy with her daughters marriage, so a decision will be taken only after she returns to work, the sources added.         
	We will discuss the proposal threadbare to see if we can contribute. But no decision will be taken in a hurry, a senior official said.         
	Junior artistes have long complained of poor pay, abysmal working conditions and, at times, humiliation.         
	But honchos of Bollywood, where most work is unorganised, have never before approached the government for help in framing any concrete plans to fight such exploitation, the sources said.         
	Quite honestly, we ourselves were taken aback at the proposal, as it comes from the very people who, if they wanted, could end exploitation. It is a good step, however, and their approaching us indicates they are serious, the official said.         
	The government is, however, unclear about the nature of the help the filmmakers want, another official said.         
	We can train and sensitise them, with help from the labour ministry, in respecting the rights of men and women working as junior artistes. But they have also asked for employment-related training, which we are unable to understand, the official said.         
	Chowdhurys ministry runs several employment-related training programmes for women who are either single, destitute or belong to Indias vast unorganised labour force. These include driving taxis, sewing clothes, managing small shops, assisting in supermarkets and nursing.         
	But ministry officials fear these programmes may not prove attractive to Bollywood junior artistes, many of whom, like Shah Rukhs character in Om Shanti Om, had joined the industry dreaming of becoming stars some day.         
	We can help junior artistes find alternate jobs. But this presumes they are willing to leave the industry, an official said.

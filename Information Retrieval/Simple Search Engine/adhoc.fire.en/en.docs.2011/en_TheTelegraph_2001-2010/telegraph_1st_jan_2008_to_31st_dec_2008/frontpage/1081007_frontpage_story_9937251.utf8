          A STAFF REPORTER                                           A rally in Guwahati on Monday in protest against the clashes . (PTI)       
	Guwahati, Oct. 6: The All Assam Students Union (AASU) and the All Bodo Students Union (Absu) today termed the acts of violence in Udalguri and Darrang as organised attacks on the indigenous people of Assam by the forces of Bangladeshi migrants backed by fundamentalists and anti-India groups.         
	The students unions today spoke to Governor Shiv Charan Mathur, now out of station, over phone and briefed him about the volatile situation. He was told that the situation would not improve unless Dispur abandoned its pro-Bangladeshi policies.         
	Addressing a joint news conference, the leaders of the two students unions said the state machinery had completely failed to stop attacks on the indigenous people.         
	The government being a mute spectator to hoisting of Pakistan flags in many places in the violence-hit areas was even worse, the leaders said.         
	It is a pity that the indigenous people of Assam have to flee their houses out of fear from Bangladeshis. And the mysterious part is that the state government is not taking any action against these groups, AASU adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya said.         
	A joint team comprising activists of AASU and Absu yesterday visited the affected areas and relief camps where over 80,000 indigenous people have been taking shelter.        
	It was a shame on part of the state government that no action had been taken against the fundamentalist groups who had hoisted the Pakistani flags in several parts of the two terror-torn districts, Bhattacharyya said.         
	The indigenous people were carrying the Tricolour to counter the move by the anti-Indian forces, according to him. The attackers are shouting Pakistan zindabad and Mughal-Pathan zindabad. The chief minister should have resigned on moral grounds.         
	In a joint memorandum to him, the students union said that Bangladeshi-fundamentalist nexus had been encouraged to carry out such attacks because of blessings from the state government.         
	Absu president Rwngwra Narzary alleged that fundamentalist elements from Morigaon and Nagaon had been infiltrating into the two districts to help the Bangladeshis carry out attacks on the indigenous people.         
	Commenting on the governments claim that the NDFB was behind these attacks, Narzary said it was a ploy of the government to hide the reality and give protection to the Bangladeshis.         
	AASU president Shankar Prashad Ray said inmates of the relief camps were not being provided enough security and medical aid, exposing the state governments lack of commitment towards the people of Assam.         
	On Saturday, a woman gave birth to a child at a relief camp in Udalguri without any medical aid, he alleged.

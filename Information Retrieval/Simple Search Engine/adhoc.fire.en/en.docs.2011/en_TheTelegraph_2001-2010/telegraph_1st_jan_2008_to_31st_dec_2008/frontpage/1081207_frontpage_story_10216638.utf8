The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | India summer amid Pak winter in UK
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   India summer amid Pak winter in UK

	London, Dec. 6: One of the most ambitious exhibitions on India lasting from May to October 2009 is to be held at the British Museum, as though to underline, however unfairly, that while one country is valued for its arts and culture, its neighbour is now associated only with exporting terrorism.         
	Indian Summer, as the exhibition will be called, will be a season dedicated to Indian culture featuring a unique programme of exhibitions, installations, performances, lectures and film screenings.         
	Sadly for Pakistan, there is hardly ever any equivalent promotion of the rich heritage of a country that has come to be linked  at least in the British media  only with madarsas, jihadis, militant groups of one sort or the other, military regimes, suicide bombings, Daniel Pearls beheading, Benazir Bhuttos recent assassination, the ISI and terrorism generally.         
	The India-Pakistan hyphen is not as common in British reporting as the expression, Pakistani terrorist.         
	Pakistan does not even have a counterpart of the Nehru Centre in London, though Pakistanis attending functions at the Nehru Centre are always made to feel at home.         
	However unbalanced the investment by British sponsors, arts and culture from Pakistan receives little or no support  and the recent attack on Mumbai will only widen the gap between India and its neighbour.         
	In marked contrast, Indian Summer at the British Museum is being funded enthusiastically by HSBC, whose group chairman, Stephen Green, said: HSBC is the worlds local bank and the British Museum is recognised worldwide. We are both committed to the idea of cultural exchange  understanding life in different cultures and building international relationships.         
	He did not explain why there appears to be almost no cultural exchange with Pakistan; perhaps he did not need to.         
	India is a major player in the world market and its cultural contribution here in the UK and around the world continues to grow, said Green. The Indian Summer season will provide a deep insight into the life, history and culture of this fascinating country.         
	The bank, which says it serves over 128 million customers worldwide from over 9,500 offices in 85 countries and territories, believes that cultural exchange can generate important business benefits. HSBC embraces cultural exchange in its widest sense; from fine art to cuisine, from language and literature to dance, street arts and all forms of music.         
	Launching the season yesterday, the British Museums director, Neil MacGregor, commented: There is an enduring fascination with the rich diversity of the art and culture of India.         
	Indian Summer will include Garden and Cosmos: The Royal Paintings of Jodhpur, an exhibition which provides a rare opportunity to view paintings of outstanding interest and variety that have never previously been seen in Europe; and an India Landscape, a specially commissioned space presenting Indian biodiversity in the Museums forecourt in collaboration with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.         
	The latter seems especially imaginative. According to the museum, the landscape will present a section through the immensely diverse habitats of the Indian subcontinent, taking visitors on a journey from the mountainous environment of the Himalayas, through a temperate region and ending in a sub-tropical zone centred on a pool filled with lotus flowers.         
	There will also be a rich and varied programme of events and activities, featuring public debates, lectures and talks by prominent Indian academics and artists, screenings of award-winning films as well as a wide range of family and educational activities. A special evening Late event will focus on India, and visitors will be able to enjoy music and dance performances, food and drink tastings as well as interactive workshops.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Kandhamal simmers. Telegraph picture                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 4: Orissa government today assured the Supreme Court that it will not allow VHPs kalash yatra, supposedly proposed by the partys secretary-general Praveen Togadia, carrying the ashes of leader Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati, in the state.         
	VHP secretary-general Praveen Togadia, however, said that the Orissa government has misled the Supreme Court and the people by lying under oath. He added there was no question of a yatra carrying the ashes, as the seer was not cremated and was buried in a samadhi. His pyre was not lit. There are no ashes to be carried, as claimed by the Orissa government, he said from Nagpur.        
	The VHP leader stressed he was just interested to tour Orissa, and it was within his right to mourn the death of a Hindu seer. The Orissa governments assurance to halt the supposed yatra was given in an affidavit filed by home secretary T.K. Mishra on behalf of the government at the Supreme Court today.         
	Following the assurance, a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan directed the government to ensure that no untoward incident takes place in the riot-hit Kandhamal.         
	The affidavit filed by the government contained details of the deployment of central paramilitary forces and police protecting the lives and properties in communal strife-hit areas. Prohibitory orders, under Section 144 of the CrPC, has been clamped in the district, the affidavit added.         
	Praveen Togadia, who had visited Kandhamal on August 25 to attend the seers last rites, announced at a news conference the next day, that his organisation would start off a state wide yatra to pay homage to the swamiji, where his followers would pledge to fulfil the dreams of the seer to not allow conversion.         
	Yesterday, the Supreme Court had sought a statement from the state government as to whether any permission was granted to Togadias proposed asthi kalash yatra.         
	The direction to the government was issued by the apex court yesterday, while hearing a petition filed by the Archbishop of Cuttack, Raphael Cheenath. The petition had sought a ban on the proposed yatra as it would create trouble in the area, already witnessing a spate of violence.                       
	The Archbishop had alleged that attacks on churches and properties belonging to his community was a well orchestrated conspiracy and pleaded that the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) be asked to conduct a probe to find out the agency behind the violence.

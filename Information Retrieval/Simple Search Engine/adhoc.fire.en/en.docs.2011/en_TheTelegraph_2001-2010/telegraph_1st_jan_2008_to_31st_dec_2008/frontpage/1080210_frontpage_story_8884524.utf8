                                                                                                        Head injury likely cause of DAV boys death, FIR filed
          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Jamshedpur, Feb. 9: Forensic experts believe injuries to the brain may have caused the death of Harshdeep Singh Kalsi (9) at DAV Public School on Friday, as this evening the boys parents filed an FIR against three children.        
	The FIR was based on the account of the deceaseds brother, who studies in the same school.         
	Harshdeeps younger brother who studies in Upper KG of the same school has said that three boys had assaulted Harshdeep before he collapsed. We will verify this once the school reopens, said East Singhbhum superintendent of police Naveen Kumar Singh.        
	The school, which remained closed today because of the tragedy, is scheduled to reopen on Monday.         
	Though no suggestion has been made on how Harshdeep may have got injured, the police have decided to preserve the viscera of the boy as a precautionary measure. We have found that the boy had injuries in the brain. But it is the job of the police to investigate if the boy was assaulted or if he was injured in the brain when he fell down, said a source in the forensic department.         
	Singh said the viscera were being preserved for analysis as it could be helpful later.         
	Harshdeeps tragic demise  he was cremated late on Friday  has sent the entire steel city into mourning. The Class II student of DAV Public School, Bistupur, was found lying near the school gates around 1.30pm after school got over. He was taken to the Tata Main Hospital in a school vehicle but doctors declared him brought dead.         
	The police said the circumstances surrounding his death looked suspicious. They are investigating the case from several angles, including death by poisoning. Singh said certain allegations (made by the deceaseds brother) have to be verified.        
	The police were also trying to find out if the boys death was due to negligence on the part of the school, the superintendent of police added.         
	Yesterday, Harshdeeps father, Paramjeet, had asked: My son never had any medical complications. How can he collapse and die all of a sudden? This statement, along with the circumstances surrounding the death, has added to the intrigue.

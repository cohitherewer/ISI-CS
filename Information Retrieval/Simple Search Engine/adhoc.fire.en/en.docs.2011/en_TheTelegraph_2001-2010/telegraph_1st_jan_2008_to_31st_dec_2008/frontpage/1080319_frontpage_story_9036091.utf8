          PHILIPPE NAUGHTON                             Governor Paterson                                  
	New York, March 18: The new governor of New York state has admitted that both he and his wife had extra-marital affairs when their marriage went through a rocky patch several years ago.         
	In a series of interviews in recent days, David Paterson told the New York Daily News that he had started an affair with a woman other than my wife in 1999 and continued it for two or three years.         
	Paterson was sworn in yesterday to replace Eliot Spitzer, the former New York prosecutor who was brought down by his involvement with a call-girl. The 53-year-old is remarkable for being both the first blind governor of New York state and the first legally blind state governor anywhere in America.         
	The Daily News said that the thunderous applause was still ringing in his ears when he told the newspaper that he and his wife had both had affairs. Michelle Paterson, 46, confirmed her affair in a joint interview with her husband.         
	Paterson said that he and the other woman  who has not been named  sometimes stayed at an upper West Side hotel, now called the Days Inn, at Broadway and West 94th Street.         
	This was a marriage that appeared to be going sour at one point, Paterson told the newspaper. But I went to counselling and we decided we wanted to make it work. Michelle is well aware of what went on. In a later joint interview with Paterson yesterday, only hours after his swearing-in, Michelle confirmed her husbands account.                             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

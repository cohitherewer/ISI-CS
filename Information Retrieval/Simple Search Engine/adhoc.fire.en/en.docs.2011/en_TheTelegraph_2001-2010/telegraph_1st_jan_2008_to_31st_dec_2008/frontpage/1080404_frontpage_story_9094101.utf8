          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, April 3: Fancy Bazar escaped a motorcycle bomb blast last evening after the two-wheeler developed a snag and the Ulfa militant entrusted with the operation had to abort the mission, only to be arrested within hours.         
	The militant, Rahul Das, who was arrested with two improvised explosives (IED) told police that he had procured the motorcycle to plant one of the IEDs on it and leave it at the business hub.         
	However, he could not succeed in his plan as the bike broke down and he was arrested by a special operations team following a tip-off last night before he could make a second attempt.         
	Additional superintendent of police (city) Debojit Deori said the police recovered two IEDs from his rented house at Hatigaon and seized the motorcycle.         
	One of the IEDs weighs 8.2kg while the weight of the other bomb is 3.6kg.         
	Deori said Das, 29, was trained in making bombs and had made the two IEDs himself. The Ulfa militant is from Udalguri and a member of the 27th battalion of the outfit.         
	Deori said Das had made the bomb, which was found inside a schoolbag in a sweet mart at Jalukbari, around 15 minutes before it was timed to explode.         
	According to Das, there was RDX in the two IEDs. However, forensic tests will confirm the presence of RDX as samples have been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for examination, the additional SP added.         
	Another police officer said incriminating documents, including a few notes on techniques of bomb-making, were seized from the militant.         
	He said Das had assembled the three IEDs at the house rented out to him by one Sipra Das. His landlady only knows that he has come to the city from Udalguri to learn driving. He had actually enrolled in a driving school in Dispur for his cover, the police source said.         
	He said during interrogation Das took a couple of names of his associates, who are now absconding.         
	We are carrying out raids all across the city to track them down, the officer said.         
	The police source said Das, who has studied only till Class IX, took down instructions on bomb-making over telephone from an Ulfa bomb expert based outside the city.                           
	The police have not disclosed the names of the bomb expert or Dass two associates.         
	He was instructed by his commanders to explode the two IEDs in the city ahead of Ulfas foundation day on April 7. Fancy Bazar and Dispur were his targets, he said.         
	Following the arrest, security arrangements have been tightened at Fancy Bazar, which has witnessed a string of blasts in the past couple of years.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Imphal, July 30: Police today arrested a person for his role in the serial abduction of children in Manipur.         
	The teenager has been identified as Akham Bobby Singh, 19, a resident of Mayang Imphal in Imphal West district.         
	A statement issued by Imphal West superintendent of police L. Kailun said Bobby Singh was involved in the abduction and recruitment of children for the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (vice-chairman) group.         
	On interrogation, the boy said he abducted two teenaged boys  Wangkheimayum Sohadev Singh and Kshetrimayum Suresh Singh of Mayang Imphal.         
	He said he abducted the children following the command of Chongtham Jiban Singh of Prepak (VC). He also told the police that some cadres of this group took away the two children on June 18.         
	After Bobby told them where the group was holding the children, a combined team of the police and 12 Maratha Light Infantry launched an operation at Laphupat Tera in the afternoon.         
	The militants holed up there opened fire at the approaching security team which fired back and killed two of the rebels. About 10 to 12 armed men escaped.         
	The security team found a 9mm pistol and a hand grenade on the two slain militants whose names are not yet known.         
	The SP said a passport-sized photograph of Sohadev was found on one of the two dead men.         
	 This (recovery) coupled with the information provided by Bobby about the presence of Prepak (VC) cadres responsible for the abduction of minor children suggest that the two persons killed in the encounter are also members of Prepak (VC) group, the statement said.         
	It could not be immediately known whether the parents had reported the two children as missing.         
	This is for the first time that the police arrested a child abductor. Four men, suspected to be involved in the crime, were earlier handed over by people in Imphal East.         
	All political parties in Manipur tonight discussed measures to check child kidnappings at a meeting in the chief ministers secretariat with Okram Ibobi Singh in the chair.         
	A late night statement released by the chief minister condemned the abduction of children and resolved to take up joint measures to prevent it. The meeting did not specify the measures being adopted.        
	More than 20 children in the age group of 11 to 17 have been reported missing since May.

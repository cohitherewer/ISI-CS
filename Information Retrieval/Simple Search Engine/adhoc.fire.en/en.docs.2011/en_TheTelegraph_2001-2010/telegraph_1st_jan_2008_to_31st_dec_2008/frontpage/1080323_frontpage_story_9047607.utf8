The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | China blips on weather radar
                                                                                                           China blips on weather radar
  - Isro instrument left out of shortlist        G.S. MUDUR                                    
	New Delhi, March 22: The India Meteorological Department has rejected a home-grown weather radar and veered towards a Chinese-made one, disappointing Indian scientists.        
	The scientists said they were concerned that the IMD, instead of nurturing the indigenous radar, had short-listed two foreign radars, one of which is a Chinese-made instrument that has never been tested in India.        
	The IMD plans to install Doppler weather radars at 12 sites across India to observe clouds and moisture and improve short-range forecasts of thunderstorms, cyclones and extreme rain events. The sites chosen are Delhi, Mumbai, Patna, Goa, Patiala, Mohanbari (Assam), Lucknow, Paradip, Karaikal (Pondicherry), Bhopal, Nagpur and Agartala.        
	One of the radars short-listed is from Beijing Metstar, a joint venture between Chinas National Huayun Technology Development Corporation and the US-based Lockheed Martin, and the other from Germanys Gematronic, an IMD source and an official representing Metstar in India said.        
	Among the radars rejected is one developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) that has been working successfully at the Sriharikota satellite launch centre for nearly four years, Isro scientists said.        
	Our radar has worked successfully. Every launch in the past four years has used weather data generated from this radar, an Isro official said. We also have a full handle on the software and hardware with our own radar.        
	The software source code  a crucial component of technology that may allow users to improve or amend it  is typically not handed over by high-technology vendors, a scientist said.        
	But a ministry of earth sciences official said the IMDs technical evaluation committee, which evaluated pitches from several domestic and foreign vendors, had found the Isro-developed radar technically unsuitable. But we have not placed any orders (with a foreign vendor) yet, the official said.        
	One weather scientist mentioned that the IMD had itself ordered two Isro radars  to be manufactured by Bharat Electronics Limited  for installation in Bhuj and Cochin. The first is scheduled to be delivered by next month.        
	We want indigenous technology to improve in a competitive environment, the ministry official said. The IMD has experience of operating a Gematronic radar in Chennai.        
	But scientists, who requested not to be identified, said they were puzzled by the IMDs contradictory position  ordering two Isro radars, then deciding to import others from foreign vendors. The Isro radar at Sriharikota, too, is operated by the IMD, they said.        
	The IMD appears not to have put in adequate efforts to perfect the use of the Isro radar, an independent radar electronics specialist said.        
	The Doppler radar is a sophisticated instrument and cannot be perfected without significant user effort over a considerable period of time. But the philosophy of nurturing local technology has been absent, the scientist said.        
	The IMDs technical evaluation committee had a member from Isro. But on the eve of a meeting last month to decide which radars would be short-listed, the committee was reconstituted with a single change, sources said. The Isro member was dropped.        
	The IMD has hurt itself in the past by attempts to outsource technology, scientists said. In the early years of the decade, the IMD had outsourced software meant to interpret satellite images to a foreign company instead of working with Isro scientists who had the required expertise.        
	The software could not extract the information needed, and the cameras aboard an Indian satellite remained inadequately used for years.

          ANITA SINGH                            Blyton: Firm favourite                                  
	London, Aug. 19: Enid Blyton has been voted Britains best-loved author in a survey which proves that the stories we read as children retain a special place in our affections.         
	Blyton was first and Roald Dahl second in a nationwide poll of adult readers. J.K. Rowling, writer of the Harry Potter books, was third.         
	The childrens authors were chosen ahead of Jane Austen, William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens, while Beatrix Potter, another childrens favourite, also appeared in the top 10.         
	Blytons creations  including the Famous Five, the Secret Seven, Noddy and the girls of Malory Towers  hark back to a gentler era. After her death in 1968, it became fashionable to denounce her stories as racist, sexist and out of touch.         
	Yet todays adults remember them with enormous fondness, according to the survey commissioned to mark the 2008 Costa Book Awards.         
	Jeff Norton of Chorion, owners of the Enid Blyton estate, said: We are delighted that the British public has voted Enid Blyton its best-loved author. Her storytelling is timeless and this result confirms that her books are still a firm favourite today.         
	What makes Blyton so successful is her imaginative, exciting and magical style. Her writing has sent countless young readers on thrilling adventures and we hope that new generations will continue to enjoy her enchanting stories.

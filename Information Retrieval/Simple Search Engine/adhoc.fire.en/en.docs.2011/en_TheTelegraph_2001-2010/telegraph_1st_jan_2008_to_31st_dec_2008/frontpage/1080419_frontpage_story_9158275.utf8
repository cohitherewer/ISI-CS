          SANTOSH SINGH                            Tejaswi: On perfect pitch                                  
	Patna, April 18: Tejaswi meaning the bright one could well be the star tomorrow in the Delhi Daredevils verses Rajasthan Royals IPL match in Firozshah Kotla Stadium.         
	The young man, who has Bihars most powerful couple as his parents, has found a place among the 21 chosen national and international cricketers in the Delhi Daredevil team under the captaincy of Virender Sehwag. Tejaswi was already a member of the Under-19 national team.         
	Lalu-Rabris youngest son, a Class XI student of Delhi Public School, New Delhi, always dreamt of being a cricketer. Tejaswi, it seems, is hopeful that he would get a chance to play tomorrow and if possible against Jacques Kallis  his favourite. Kallis is a member of the Royal Challengers (Bangalore).         
	It seems that the railway minister had an inkling of the IPL offer, but waited for the final list to come out. RJD national general secretary and Lalu confidante Shyam Rajak said: Lalu Prasad received the news during his trip to Jammu and Kashmir early this month. Tejaswi was at that point in Australia playing U-19 matches for India.        
	Rajak is also a happy man for a different reason  he has received a personal invitation from Preity Zinta to watch the Mohali IPL match between Chennai Super Kings and Kings XI Punjab.         
	Rajak added that the RJD chief was naturally elated. He added that Lalu Prasad would probably be in Delhi to watch his son play. But he admitted that he wasnt too sure of the leaders plan.

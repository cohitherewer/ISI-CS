	New Delhi, June 21: The Congress today gently nudged its Prime Minister to get over the nuclear deal and shift his focus to the economy.        
	With the CPM keeping up its attack on the deal, the message from the Congress to Manmohan Singh was: control inflation, protect the economy from going into a tailspin, and see that there are enough wheat and rice reserves to feed the country.        
	Singh, too, appeared to have put his head down to try and find a way to control the runaway prices. He met finance minister P. Chidambaram last night and the RBI governor, Y.V. Reddy, today after having shut himself in for most of Thursday and Friday.        
	But his party, reluctant as it is to face early elections on the nuclear deal, also worried about what the Prime Minister would do if there was no breakthrough at the UPA-Left panel meeting on June 25.        
	The CPM today accused the government of a massive disinformation campaign to promote a bad nuclear deal.        
	In response, junior power minister Jairam Ramesh said: It is nobodys case that the deal is a solution to all our problems. It expands our basket of energy options.        
	Sources in the Congress wondered whether Singh would attend the G8 summit in Japan from July 7 to 9 if no progress was made on the Indo-US deal. The Prime Minister is to meet President George W. Bush on the sidelines, and would want to carry an assurance that things were on track rather than sound helpless because of domestic compulsions.         
	The US state department spokesperson reminded India today that time was running out on the deal: Every single day that the Indian government delays and has delayed is a day that makes it much more difficult to get this done.        
	But the challenges before Singh would strike a chord with Bush if the US President were to recall the 1992 election his father lost to Bill Clinton, defeated by one enduring slogan: Its the economy, stupid!        
	Bush Senior was thought unbeatable on the strength of his foreign policy achievements, including the Iraq War, but Clinton campaign strategist James Carville came up with the phrase that shifted the focus to the recession in the economy and defeated him.        
	Mayavati added to the Congress jitters, by withdrawing her outside support to the government. The move does not threaten the governments survival (see chart) but it did scrap a suggestion by the pro-deal group to go ahead and seek a sense of the House, counting on the BSP and the Samajwadi Party to bail it out.         
	A Congress source said the party would not do anything without the allies on board. Asked if it would be breakdown or breakthrough on June 25, he said: Fifty-fifty.

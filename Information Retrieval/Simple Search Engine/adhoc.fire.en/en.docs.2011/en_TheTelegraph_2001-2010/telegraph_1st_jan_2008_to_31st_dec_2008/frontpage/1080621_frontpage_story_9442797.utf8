The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bangla war toll raised fivefold
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bangla war toll raised fivefold
          AMIT ROY                            Indian Army personnel in Dhaka during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. File picture                                  
	London, June 20: The number of people who died in the 1971 Bangladesh civil war has been put at 269,000 in an article published today by the British Medical Journal in London.         
	This is five times the figure that has hitherto been accepted by a database in Europe.         
	Information from the Uppsala/PRIO database, produced by collaboration between Uppsala University in Sweden and the Peace Research Institute in Oslo, Norway, has suggested that 58,000 people died in the secessionist conflict caused when the Pakistan Army was ordered by the countrys military ruler, General Yahya Khan, to crack down on dissidents in East Pakistan.         
	In the BMJ article, Fifty years of violent war deaths from Vietnam to Bosnia: analysis of data from the world health survey programme, research scholars have concluded that Uppsala/PRIO database has consistently underestimated casualty figures.         
	While no historian would treat the 58,000 figure for Bangladesh seriously, even the revised figure of 269,000 given in the BMJ article will be considered an underestimate by many.         
	There are many sources that put the true figure at anywhere between one and three million.         
	Death By Government, a much quoted book by political scientist, R.J. Rummel, says that the human death toll over only 267 days was incredible. Just to give for five out of the eighteen districts some incomplete statistics published in Bangladesh newspapers or by an Inquiry Committee, the Pakistani army killed 100,000 Bengalis in Dacca, 150,000 in Khulna, 75,000 in Jessore, 95,000 in Comilla, and 100,000 in Chittagong. For eighteen districts the total is 1,247,000 killed.         
	Rummell goes on: This was an incomplete toll, and to this day no one really knows the final toll. Some estimates are much lower  one is of 300,000 dead  but most range from 1 million to 3 million.         
	The BMJ article argues the need to collect more accurate figures for violent war deaths.         
	The articles authors are Ziad Obermeyer, research scientist, and Emmanuela Gakidou, associate professor, at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, and Christopher J L Murray, institute director, at the Harvard Medical School.         
	Estimating mortality due to war is notoriously difficult, but the importance of war as a public health problem as well as a social problem makes it imperative to improve on existing methods of measurement, the authors acknowledge.         
	They say: Accurate estimates of war mortality are crucial for planning on several different levels. Political, military, and public health leaders must have credible information on the number of deaths to plan properly before, during, and after wars.         
	The authors add: The public must also be aware of the human cost of wars. Information on war deaths is useful in the investigation of the scope of war crimes, as in the Nuremburg Trials after the Second World War or the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.         
	They also point out that an accurate count of the number of deaths in war is an important part of a nations history.         
	Based on house to house surveys, it is now thought that between 1955 and 2002 an estimated 5.4 million violent war deaths occurred in 13 countries, ranging from 7000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo to 3.8 million in Vietnam.         
	The other countries from where data was analysed include Bangladesh, Bosnia, Ethiopia, Georgia, Guatemala, Laos, Burma, Namibia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.         
	Our analysis indicates that there were 36,000 war deaths annually from 1995 to 2002 in these countries, the paper says.         
	Just how many have died in the current war in Iraq will continue to be debated for decades to come.         
	The authors estimate of 184 000 violent deaths falls between the Iraq Family Health Survey figure of 151,000 and the much higher 601,000 estimate from the second Iraq mortality survey by other scholars.

	New Delhi, May 20: Scientists have extracted a gene from the preserved remains of an extinct animal and inserted it into mice, demonstrating the first successful resurrection of lost DNA.        
	A team of American and Australian biologists activated the gene, taken from an extinct marsupial, the Tasmanian tiger, inside growing mice embryos.        
	Their experiments, published this week in the journal Public Library of Science One, show that at least some genetic secrets of even extinct animals may not be completely lost.        
	The Tasmanian tiger, the largest known carnivorous marsupial, was hunted to extinction in the early 1900s, and the species last captive member died at Tasmanias Hobart zoo in 1936.        
	Now, marsupial expert Marilyn Renfree from the University of Melbourne and her colleagues have extracted a gene that makes cartilage and bone from 100-year-old remains of Tasmanian tigers, preserved in alcohol at a Melbourne museum, and inserted it into three-day-old mice embryos.        
	As the embryos grew, the gene displayed biological activity. The American-Australian team did not allow the embryos to be born, but their results have shown that the resurrected DNA had helped the mice grow cartilage driven by the Tasmanian tiger gene that would have developed into bone.        
	In the past, scientists have extracted and studied genes from extinct species -- including the Neanderthals -- but no one had coaxed a lost gene to function in a creature living today.        
	I would imagine that others will now use this technique to study genes from the ancient mammoth or the Neanderthals, Renfree told The Telegraph over the phone.        
	The goal would be to understand the functions of genes from extinct species. We could also understand better the genetic differences between modern humans and the Neanderthals, or between elephants and mammoths, Renfree said. We could address issues such as the speech capabilities of the Neanderthals.        
	Most previous studies of ancient DNA had focused on the use of genome sequence data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of extinct species.        
	Last year, Spanish scientists studying ancient DNA had found clues suggesting that the Neanderthals -- like modern humans -- might also have displayed variations in hair and skin colour.        
	Renfree cautioned that the technique they employed cannot be used to resurrect entire animals -- the Indian cheetah, or dinosaurs. Its unlikely to happen in the near future, she said. But this could be a first, small step towards a very distant goal.        
	But this research could lead to a better understanding of the biology of extinct animals, said Richard Behringer, a team member and the head of molecular genetics at the University of Texas.        
	Renfree and her colleague Andrew Pask extracted the DNA from Tasmanian tiger remains in Melbourne, and collaborated with Behringer to genetically engineer the mice to activate the gene.

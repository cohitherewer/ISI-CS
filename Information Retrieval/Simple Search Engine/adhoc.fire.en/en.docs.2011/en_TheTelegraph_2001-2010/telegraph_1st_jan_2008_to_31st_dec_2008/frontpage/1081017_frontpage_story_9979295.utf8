	McCluskieganj, Oct. 16: Maoists struck at McCluskieganj station and abducted four railway officials, including an assistant station manager, in a daring late night raid 60km from the capital.        
	Those who have been taken hostage include assistant station manager Kamal Kishore, deputy station managers S.D. Ekka and S.K. Kujur, and guard Munshi Prasad. A gangman, Chandradeo Thakur, was also abducted but he was later released.         
	According to Bhubaneswar, a porter who saw it happen, the extremists reached the station around 11.45pm when Kishore and Prasad were in the main office that houses various communication equipment used to monitor the movement of trains.         
	They first got hold of Kishore and Prasad and then picked up Ekka and Kujur from their official residences located behind the railway station. The police, who were clueless about the culprits till this evening, later pointed to a breakaway Maoist group. State police spokesperson S.N. Pradhan said Jharkhand Prastuti Committee (JPC) was behind the incident. The JPC has become quite active in the area. The group kidnapped a circus manager for a ransom of Rs 10,000 some 10 days ago, he said.         
	But so far, no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and no demand for ransom has yet reached the authorities. McCluskieganj, once an idyllic hamlet of the Anglo-Indian community and a favourite tourist spot, is today a rundown little village. Of the 350 Anglo-Indian families which settled here in the 1930s, about 23 are left.         
	Its also the hotbed of Maoist activity.         
	Upon hearing about the raid, a stunned police team comprising officials from the district headquarters rushed to the spot around 3am this morning with a dog squad and personnel of the rapid armed police and special task force.         
	Initially, they had no idea about who were involved. In fact, senior police superintendent M.S. Bhatia, who reached the area around 2pm in the afternoon, had even doubted the involvement of extremists.        
	We are not sure if any extremist organisation active in the area has committed the crime or some miscreants. The motive is also not clear, he added.        
	Describing the operation that lasted around an hour and 15 minutes, a scared Bhubaneswar said they had slapped him and told him not to talk to the police before leaving. The porter, who happened to be inside the office, narrated the events. The rebels asked me to open the lock of the iron gate to the office. I sensed trouble and told Kamalbabu, who was then with guard saheb. Finding no way out, Kamalbabu opened the lock. Around 12 extremists barged into the office and took away the guard and Kamalbabu all the while pointing their guns at us.        
	Then, Bhubaneswar added, the rebels looked through the papers and documents kept on the table. They didnt seem to find anything and then asked Kamalbabu about the other senior officials, he said. Kamalbabu was forced to lead the way to the officials residences of Kujursaheb and Ekkasaheb behind the railway station. They asked him to call them. He did.        
	When the two came out, the rebels pointed their guns at them and whisked everyone away into the forests.         
	Local residents, too, suspected the hand of the JPC, which has been active in the area for the last one year.         
	McCluskieganj station is on Barkakana-Barwadih line. More than 60 goods trains and 10 passenger trains pass through everyday. The station falls on Ranchi-Garhwa-Delhi route known as the Central India Coalfield section. The station, always the first to be affected when there is a Maois bandh, is at a junction of three districts  Latehar is a kilometre south-west, Chatra is 2km north, while Lohardaga is 4km south.              
	On October 7, they abducted Mohammed Fizul Ansari at 10pm and shot him dead about three hours and a half later. On October 4, they attacked a contractor working on the bridge between Chandwa and McCluskieganj.         
	On October 5, they snatched mobile phones from two youths and thrashed them black and blue, said a resident who did not want to be identified.

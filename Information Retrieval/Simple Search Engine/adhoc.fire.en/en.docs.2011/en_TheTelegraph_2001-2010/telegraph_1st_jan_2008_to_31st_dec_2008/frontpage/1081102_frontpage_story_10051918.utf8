	Calcutta, Nov. 1: A malignant malaria patient died in Shambhunath Pandit Hospital today while his neighbour, down with the same disease but refused admission, has been left without proper medicines.        
	The hospital turned away chauffeur Ram Binod Tiwari, 37, on Wednesday in the middle of a city-wide outbreak of the disease that has killed eight persons in two months. The medicine prescribed is too expensive. My husband is continuing with the cheaper medicine, wife Gauri said at their New Alipore shanty.         
	Dukhi Paswan, 70, from the same slum, was admitted on Thursday and died today.

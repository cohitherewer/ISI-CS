  - Her Majesty faces message competition in Iran President           AMIT ROY                              Queen Elizabeth, President Ahmadinejad: Cheerful link				                                       
	London, Dec. 24: Next years Christmas message of goodwill on British television may well come from the Lashkar-e-Toiba but this year, Channel 4 is having a trial run with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran whose sermon from Tehran will rival that of Her Majesty the Queen from the Music Room in Buckingham Palace.        
	Normally, the Queen has the field to herself with her seasonal Christmas message after her loyal subjects clear the turkey with all the appropriate trimmings, finish the pudding drenched in brandy and ponder over a glass or two of port.        
	But this year, in an effort to give indigestion to the good people of Britain, Channel 4 has thought fit to carry Ahmadinejads sermon from the battlegrounds of Tehran.        
	Not everyone is happy.        
	Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: This is a man who has openly and consistently denied the Holocaust and the murder of millions of innocent victims. This is a very dubious decision on the part of Channel 4.         
	According to the advance text of the message, Ahmadinejad will begin: In the Name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful. Upon the anniversary of the birth of Jesus, Son of Mary, the Word of God, the Messenger of Mercy, I would like to congratulate the followers of Abrahamic faiths, especially the followers of Jesus Christ, and the people of Britain.         
	Meanwhile, the Queen, who will be speaking to the Commonwealth, will use her airtime to reflect on how this years festivities have taken on a more sombre tone for many.         
	In fact, with the UK battling rising unemployment and uncertainty in the financial markets, many High Street shops and department stores have preponed the sales, which normally begin on December 26, also known as Boxing Day, to Christmas Eve.        
	Indians, for example, were out in force in Londons Oxford Street today buying presents for relatives back home.        
	To those who are worried they may soon lose their jobs or their homes, Ahmadinejad is bringing a soothing touch.        
	All Prophets called for the worship of God, for love and brotherhood, for the establishment of justice and for love in human society, Ahmadinejad will say. Jesus, the Son of Mary, is the standard-bearer of justice, of love for our fellow human beings, of the fight against tyranny, discrimination and injustice. All the problems that have bedevilled humanity throughout the ages came about because humanity followed an evil path and disregarded the message of the Prophets.         
	He will add: If Christ were on Earth today, undoubtedly He would stand with the people in opposition to bullying, ill-tempered and expansionist powers. If Christ were on Earth today, undoubtedly He would hoist the banner of justice and love for humanity to oppose warmongers, occupiers, terrorists and bullies the world over. If Christ were on Earth today, undoubtedly He would fight against the tyrannical policies of prevailing global economic and political systems, as He did in His lifetime.         
	The Iran President will continue: We believe, Jesus Christ will return, together with one of the children of the revered Messenger of Islam, and will lead the world to love, brotherhood and justice. Once again, I congratulate one and all on the anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ. I pray for the New Year to be a year of happiness, prosperity, peace and brotherhood for humanity. I wish you every success and happiness.         
	From Buckingham Palace, the Queen will pay tribute to those who have led unselfish lives in the service of others. Christmas is a time for celebration, but this year it is a more sombre occasion for many. Some of those things which could once have been taken for granted suddenly seem less certain and naturally give rise to feelings of insecurity.

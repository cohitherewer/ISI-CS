The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Vitriol for citizen who exposed bitter Obama
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Vitriol for citizen who exposed bitter Obama

	Mayhill Fowler grew up with a mother who didnt like her talking politics in the home. As an adult, she faced publishers who would not put her writing in print.        
	She found an outlet for her twin passions of writing and politics last year in the Huffington Post, the Left-leaning website. But Fowler conceded that her early reports from the Democratic campaign trail did not produce anything particularly newsworthy.        
	That all changed last Friday, when her report on Barack Obamas statements about the bitter feelings of small-town Americans thrust the 61-year-old Oakland woman into a political storm that continued to rage yesterday. The story prompted charges of elitism against Obama by his presidential election opponents, and exposed the neophyte citizen journalist to waves of vitriol.        
	The furore is the latest reminder of how untraditional reporters and news outlets have changed the nature of journalism and politics. Fowler, a supporter and contributor to Obamas campaign, gained access to an event deemed closed to mainstream journalists and the resulting story forced big news outlets to take notice. We have entered new territory and the rules are not all clear, said Larry Pryor, a USC journalism professor. You have to assume that everything is on-the-record. Theres no getting around that anymore.        
	Fowler said yesterday she had received about 200 email messages that ranged from creepy to threatening, including a few death threats from purported Obama supporters. She said about 25 emails praised her.        
	Writers on the liberal website Daily Kos took up the complaints, accusing Fowler of intentionally undermining Obama and feigning support for the candidate to gain access to the San Francisco fundraiser where he made the controversial remarks April 6. Its like the liberal blogosphere has issued a fatwa against me, Fowler said in a telephone interview.        
	She said she was concerned enough about the angry response to her story that she did not want to reveal exactly where she would be reporting in Pennsylvania in advance of next weeks critical primary.

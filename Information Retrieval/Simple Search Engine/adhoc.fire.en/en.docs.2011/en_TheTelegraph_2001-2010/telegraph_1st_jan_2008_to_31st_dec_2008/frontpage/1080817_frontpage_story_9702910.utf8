          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 16: Mamata Banerjee and Bengals industry chiefs have set up a date.        
	The Trinamul chief has accepted an invite from the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry for an interactive session on August 19 where she said she would try to dispel doubts that she was against industry.        
	I am happy that leading industrialists and corporate houses will be present at the August 19 interactive session at the chamber, Mamata said after receiving the invite from president S. Radhakrishnan.        
	I look forward to answering all their queries about my stand on industry in the state. I would also make an attempt to clear doubts of critics who think the Trinamul Congress leadership is anti-industry.        
	In September 2006, Mamata was at a city chamber to voice her views on Bengals industrialisation, but the programme had been organised by her party. But this time, Mamata pointed out, she was an invited speaker and looking forward to the privilege.         
	Trinamul sources said the invite, which followed a statement earlier this month by eight chambers underscoring the need for industrialisation, was a culmination of weeks of efforts by Mamatas aides.        
	They said party leader Partha Chatterjee had been in talks with several chambers to set up a platform from where Mamata could explain her approach. Mamata, too, they said, felt the need for an interface with industry as the Singur controversy was presenting her in a negative light.        
	It would be a privilege to set forth my views that industry is required for our state, but not at the expense of the life and livelihood of farmers, Mamata said. I would utilise this opportunity to dispel the notion that our party doesnt want industry.        
	Radhakrishnan said he had sent the letter on behalf of all the eight chambers.        
	We wanted to hear her views and discuss the industrial climate of the state. Its going to be a general discussion and not about anything particular, he said, alluding to the Singur project.        
	Mamata, however, raked up Singur, saying talks with the Tatas would be possible only when they agreed to return 400 acres acquired from unwilling farmers. I cannot have a dialogue with them on how to ensure smooth construction of the Tata Motors plant by sacrificing the interests of poor farmers. Our agitation, scheduled to start on August 24 at Singur, stands.        
	Party leader Chatterjee said he was not aware of a receipt of any communication from the Tatas that they want to discuss Singur.        
	A chamber source said Tuesdays session would last about an hour and was likely to be a closed-door one with all eight chambers present.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Soren sounds tough after oath
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Ranchi, Aug. 27: JMM president Shibu Soren was today sworn in as the sixth chief minister of Jharkhand. Soon after Governor Syed Sibtey Razi administered him and his council of ministers the oath of office at Morabadi grounds, he made it obvious that he meant business.        
	Besides asking the secretariat employees to call off their indefinite strike and resume work tomorrow, he sought transparency in the public distribution system and better roads.         
	Soren has inducted almost all the cabinet members of former chief minister Madhu Koda in his council of ministers. Forward Bloc member Aparna Sengupta has replaced Chandra Prakash Choudhary.         
	Stephen Marandi, Sudhir Mahto, Nalin Soren, Dulal Bhuiyan, Anosh Ekka, Bandhu Tirkey, Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Hari Narayan Rai, Joba Manjhi and Kamlesh Singh also took oath today.        
	Soren would prove the majority of his government in the Assembly on August 29. The cabinet resolved to convene a special session of the Assembly on Friday and the Raj Bhavan has been requested to initiate necessary steps.         
	The Congress and RJD MLAs were conspicuous by their absence in the swearing-in ceremony, though. Only Congress state president Pradeep Balmuchu had been there for some time. The NDA also boycotted the event.         
	Arriving at the Project Building after taking oath at Morabadi grounds, Soren told the office-bearers of the secretariat employees union: Now I have come. Everything will be set right soon. Resume work from tomorrow. Have trust in me.         
	The chief minister ordered constitution of a three-member committee at the cabinet meeting to resolve the stalemate. The panel, headed by Stephen and comprising Tirkey and Shahi, would be holding a meeting tomorrow itself.         
	Soren also warned the PDS retailers, dealers and officials of the civil supplies department of stern action if irregularities were detected in the supply of foodgrains, sugar and kerosene.        
	I know that most of the red cards are in the custody of PDS shop owners. These cards ought to be returned immediately to the cardholders. The beneficiaries should be given their due share. I will be going to the villages and talk to the cardholders. The erring shop owners will immediately be put behind the bars, said Soren.The deputy commissioners, sub-division officers, block development officers and circle officers have been directed to improve the public distribution system in their respective domains.         
	The chief secretary has been asked to ensure that the PDS performances of officials are recorded in their annual confidential reports (ACRs). The engineers working with the road construction department have been warned of dire consequences if the condition of roads did not improve by this year-end.         
	I know that Jharkhands performance under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana is dismal. It has availed least funds in the entire country. I want this scheme to excel, said Soren.         
	The pitiable condition of National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, erratic power supply, drinking water, rainwater harvesting, inordinate delay in issuing certificates, health services, et al are Sorens other areas of concern. He asked the erring doctors and employees of the health department to either mend their ways or find alternative sources of livelihood.        
	The teachers, health services employees and panchayat-level employees of block and circle offices would be functioning under the supervision of gram sabhas, Soren said. Their monthly salaries, too, would be disbursed after getting clearance from the gram sabhas.         
	Soren wants the planning and execution of development schemes in villages by the villagers. The middlemen ought to be eliminated.         
	The officials concerned would be taken to task if the involvement of middlemen were detected, he said. Strict execution of Forest Rights Act, 2006, and children welfare schemes are among Sorens other priorities.

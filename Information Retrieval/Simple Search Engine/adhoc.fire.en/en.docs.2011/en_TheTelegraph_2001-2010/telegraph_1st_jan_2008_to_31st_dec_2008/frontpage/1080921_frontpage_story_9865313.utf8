The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Prayer for Wall Street at visa temple 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Prayer for Wall Street at visa temple 
  - Techies, students at Balaji door for puja to save economy          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                                    
	Hyderabad, Sept. 20: If the Wall Street upheaval eases soon, techies here will be thanking Lord Balaji for saving their jobs.        
	At least 3,000 local IT professionals and students yesterday thronged the Balaji temple at Chilkur, 30km from here, after learning that a special puja was being held to resolve the global financial crisis, temple sources said.        
	The temples priests decided to hold the puja after a devotee called up from the US with an appeal to save the world from the economic crisis. The next special puja is scheduled for tomorrow.        
	The Chilkur temple has always had a special relationship with techies and students hoping to study abroad. Our temple is famous as the Visa Temple, since anyone praying here is sure to get his visa to the US, head priest M.V. Soundararajan said.        
	An NRI woman from Detroit had rung up temple authorities on Thursday and broken down over the phone, saying she had lost her job with a subsidiary of a leading American bank. She asked the priests to invoke Balajis help for people like her.        
	At yesterdays puja, techies and IT students chanted the Runa Vimochana Nrusimha Stotram, a hymn to free oneself of debts.        
	This was to invoke Lord Narasimhaswamy (another name for Balaji or Vishnu), Soundararajan said. Several of the techies did the pradakshinam (a walk round the temple) twice.        
	While local IT professionals are now living in constant dread of the sack, sluggish recruitment has created panic among IT and business management students and their families.        
	Anand, a professional doing an advanced course at Ameerpet, the citys IT training hub, said he didnt know when the axe might fall. Our present projects are at a dead end and the company is not getting any new projects. Nobody knows when we will be shown the door, he said.        
	Many students said that even candidates with three-four years experience are not getting interview calls. The once-scorned teaching positions, however, are now suddenly in demand thanks to the crisis.        
	Industry sources said that outsourcing jobs from the US had slowed down right from the beginning of the financial year with many American companies cutting down their technology spending.        
	This has allegedly led most local IT companies to bench over a third of their regular employees since July  meaning they are receiving no projects and are being paid only a part of their salaries and perks.        
	Several multinational companies too have been pruning staff strength. A senior project leader at Dell resigned in a huff when she was asked to sit in the front office or leave, said K. Muralidharan, a senior HR consultant.        
	Although the average attrition rate in state IT companies  which includes the figures both of those leaving for a better job and those asked to leave  has been around 15 per cent, industry insiders claim it could touch 30-32 per cent this financial year.        
	Companies are exploiting the situation to get rid of non-performers, said Anil Kumar Jampala of the Hyderabad Software Exporters Association.        
	B.V.R. Mohan Reddy, chairman of Infotech and the Andhra Pradesh chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry, said the crisis would have only a temporary impact on Indian IT companies. But he acknowledged that by the time the crisis blew over, hundreds could lose their jobs.        
	It is inevitable in a country that services scores of US companies and depends on outsourcing revenues ranging up to Rs 1,000 crore, he said.        
	N. Ramakoteswara Rao, manager (business) with Peers Technologies, an IT teaching institute, however, said the fears about a slump in recruitment were exaggerated.        
	Only students of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and testing tools courses are in trouble. There is nothing to worry for those who have enrolled themselves in other courses, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lucky Palani lays it on table
                                                                                                           Lucky Palani lays it on table
                                      
	The following are excerpts from Part B of Palaniappan Chidambarams budget speech.        
	Many people are surprised by the buoyancy in tax revenues, especially in direct taxes. I am not. I have always maintained that moderate and stable tax rates coupled with a tax administration that shows no fear or favour will bring high revenues to the exchequer.        
	The UPA government inherited a tax to GDP ratio of 9.2 per cent in 2003-04. At the end of 2007-08, that ratio would have risen to 12.5 per cent.        
	High growth rates have helped. Changes in attitude have also helped. Above all, information systems and technology have helped the most. And, if I may add in a lighter vein, having a lucky finance minister may have also helped!           
	Indirect Taxes  
	Poultry and dairy  
	In order to reduce the cost of manufacture of cattle and poultry feeds, I propose to reduce the duty on vitamin premixes and mineral mixtures from 30 per cent to 20 per cent and on phosphoric acid from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent.        
	The duty on bactofuges will be reduced from 7.5 per cent to nil. This will increase the shelf life of milk and benefit the dairy industry.        
	Set-top box salve        
	I propose to fully exempt from duty specified parts of set-top boxes and specified raw materials for use in the IT/electronic hardware industry.        
	To establish parity between devices used in the information/communication sector and the entertainment sector, I propose to reduce the duty on convergence products from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.        
	Copter cut        
	To facilitate training of helicopter pilots, I propose to remove the duty on helicopter simulators.        
	Polymers        
	Naphtha is exported from refineries and naphtha is imported by manufacturers of polymers, leading to price distortions and revenue losses. I propose to correct the situation by withdrawing the duty exemption on naphtha for use in the manufacture of polymers and subject it to the normal rate of 5 per cent. However, naphtha imported for the production of fertilisers will continue to be exempt from import duty.        I shall now deal with excise duties.  
	Having carefully studied current trends of production and consumption, I believe there is a need to give a stimulus to the manufacturing sector. Hence, I propose to reduce the general Cenvat rate on all goods from 16 per cent to 14 per cent.        
	I propose to:        
	reduce the excise duty on all goods produced in the pharmaceutical sector from 16 per cent to 8 per cent;        
	reduce the excise duty on buses and their chassis from 16 per cent to 12 per cent;         
	 reduce the excise duty on small cars from 16 per cent to 12 per cent and on hybrid cars from 24 per cent to the general revised rate of 14 per cent;         
	reduce the excise duty on two-wheelers and three-wheelers from 16 per cent to 12 per cent; and        
	reduce the excise duty on paper, paper board and articles made there from manufactured out of non-conventional raw materials by units not having an attached bamboo/wood pulp making plant from 12 per cent to 8 per cent with a further reduction on clearances up to 3,500 metric tonnes from 8 per cent to nil.         
	AIDS drug        
	I propose to totally exempt from excise duty the anti-AIDS drug Atazanavir as well as bulk drugs for its manufacture.        
	Cement        
	I propose to bring parity in the excise duty rates on bulk cement and packaged cement. Accordingly, bulk cement will now attract excise duty of Rs 400 per metric tonne or 14 per cent ad valorem, whichever is higher. Cement clinkers will be liable to excise duty of Rs 450 per metric tonne.        
	Similarly, I propose to increase the excise duty on packaged software from 8 per cent to 12 per cent to bring it on par with customised software which will attract a service tax of 12 per cent.        
	Puff peeve        
	Non-filter cigarettes are more toxic than filter cigarettes, yet they enjoy a favourable tax regime, which is iniquitous. I propose to tax both filter and non-filter cigarettes on par by applying  as honourable members may have guessed  the higher rates.        
	Cell duty        
	An excise duty of 1 per cent called NCCD is now imposed on polyester filament yarn, which is the only yarn suffering this excise duty. I propose to remove that duty and shift the levy to cellular mobile phones.        
	Service tax        
	I propose to bring under the service tax net four services. They are:        
	asset management service provided under ULIP, to bring it on par with asset management service provided under mutual funds;        
	services provided by stock/commodity exchanges and clearing houses;        
	right to use goods, in cases where VAT is not payable; and        
	customised software, to bring it on par with packaged software and other IT services        
	I also propose to remove unwarranted doubts raised in respect of certain services and clarify that they are liable to service tax. These include money-changers, persons running games of chance, and tour operators using contract carriage vehicles.        
	Finally, I am happy to announce that the threshold limit of exemption for small service providers will be increased from Rs 8 lakh per year to Rs 10 lakh per year. As a result, about 65,000 small service providers will go out of the tax net.  
	Direct Tax  
	I recall the budget speech of 1997. I believe that boldness pays. I also believe that trust will beget trust, moderation will beget revenues and fairness will beget compliance.  
	Income-tax        
	I propose to increase the threshold limit of exemption;         
	in the case of all assesses, from Rs 110,000 to Rs 150,000, thus giving every assessee a relief at a minimum of Rs 4,000. Consequently, the four slabs and rates will be as follows: up to Rs 150,000 nil; Rs 150,001-300,00010 per cent; Rs 300,001-500,00020 per cent; Rs 500,001 and above30 per cent;        
	in the case of a woman assessee, from Rs 145,000 to Rs 180,000;        
	in the case of a senior citizen, from Rs 195,000 to Rs 225,000.        
	Senior citizens        
	I propose to add the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme 2004 and the Post Office Time Deposit Account to the basket of saving instruments under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.        
	Medical bonus        
	I propose to allow an additional deduction of Rs 15,000 under Section 80D to an individual who pays medical insurance premium for his/her parent or parents.        
	The Reverse Mortgage Scheme was notified by the National Housing Bank in the current financial year. In order to clarify the tax issues arising out of the scheme, I propose to amend the Income Tax Act to provide that:        
	reverse mortgage would not amount to transfer and        
	 stream of revenue received by the senior citizen would not be income.        
	Research relief        
	In order to promote outsourcing of research, I propose to allow a weighted deduction of 125 per cent on any payment made to companies engaged in research and development.        
	Fringe benefit        
	I propose to make some changes in the provisions of law pertaining to fringe benefit tax (FBT) that will give some relief to corporates and firms. Crche facilities, sponsorship of an employee-sportsperson, organising sports events for employees, and guesthouses will be excluded from the purview of FBT.        
	Dividend balm        
	I propose to allow a parent company to set off the dividend received from its subsidiary company against dividend distributed by the parent company, provided that the dividend received has suffered DDT and the parent company is not a subsidiary of another company.        
	Hospitals, hotels        
	I propose to insert a new sub-section (11C) in Section 80-IB to grant a five-year tax holiday to encourage hospitals to be set up anywhere in India, except certain specified urban agglomerations, and especially in tier-2 and tier-3 towns in order to serve the rural hinterland. This window will be open for the period, April 1, 2008, to March 31, 2013, during which the hospital must commence operations.        
	I propose to grant a five-year holiday from income-tax to two-, three- or four-star hotels that are established in specified districts which have Unesco-declared World Heritage Sites. The hotel should be constructed and start functioning during the period, April 1, 2008, to March 31, 2013.        
	Capital gains tax        
	Dividends that are distributed attract a tax of 15 per cent. Short-term capital gains attract a tax of 10 per cent under Section 111A. There is merit in equating the rates and, hence, I propose to increase the rate of tax on short-term capital gains under Section 111A and Section 115AD to 15 per cent. This will also encourage investors to stay invested for a longer term.        
	Securities        
	At present, securities transaction tax (STT) paid is allowed as a rebate against tax liability. Further, STT on options is levied on the aggregate of the strike price and the option premium and is borne by the seller. I propose to make some changes. Henceforth, STT paid will be treated like any other deductible expenditure against business income.         
	Further, the levy of STT, in the case of options, will be only on the option premium where the option is not exercised, and the liability will be on the seller. In a case where the option is exercised, the levy will be on the settlement price and the liability will be on the buyer. There will be no change in the present rates.        
	Commodities tax        
	Transactions in commodity futures have come of age. Hence, I propose to introduce the commodities transaction tax on the same lines as STT on options and futures.        
	Business of charity        
	Charitable purpose includes relief of the poor, education, medical relief and any other object of general public utility. These activities are tax exempt, as they should be. However, some entities carrying on regular trade, commerce or business or providing services in relation to any trade, commerce or business and earning incomes have sought to claim that their purposes would also fall under charitable purpose.        
	 Obviously, this was not the intention of Parliament and, hence, I propose to amend the law to exclude the aforesaid cases. Genuine charitable organisations will not in any way be affected.        
	Bank breather        
	I propose to withdraw the banking cash transaction tax with effect from April 1, 2009.        
	My tax proposals on direct taxes are revenue neutral. On the indirect taxes side, the proposals are estimated to result in a loss of Rs 5,900 crore.         
	Sales tax        
	Following an agreement between the central government and the state governments, the rate of central sales tax was reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent in this financial year. It is now proposed to reduce the rate to 2 per cent from April 1, 2008.         
	The muse        
	As always, I turned to my muse, Saint Tiruvalluvar, for guidance and reassurance. Two thousand years ago, he set the benchmark for good governance in the following immortal words: Kodai ali sengol kudi ombal nangum udaiyanam vendharkku oli (Generous grants, compassion, righteous rule and succour to the downtrodden are the hallmarks of good governance).        
	We have tried to remain true to this philosophy.

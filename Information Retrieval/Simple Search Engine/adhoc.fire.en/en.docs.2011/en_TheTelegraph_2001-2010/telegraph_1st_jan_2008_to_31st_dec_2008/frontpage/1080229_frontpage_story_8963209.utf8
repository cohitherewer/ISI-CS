          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Feb. 28: The head of an Axis Bank branch in Guwahati and a senior colleague were arrested today for verification lapses that allowed a fraud to encash a Rs 1.88-crore demand draft that was revalidated after being reported lost in transit.        
	Branch manager Bholanath Sharma and trust coordinator Rajiv Talukdar were charged with violating Reserve Bank of India guidelines, leading to the swindle of money meant for a government scheme in Bongaigaon district.        
	The man who intercepted the revalidated draft  how he did it the police still do not know  deposited it in a fake bank account and pocketed the booty is S.K. Mehta. He is absconding.        
	Bongaigaon police chief Dipak Kumar said the original draft was issued by the State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur in New Delhi in October 2006 in the name of the member secretary, DWSM, Bongaigaon under instructions from the Union rural development ministry. The draft was payable at SBI, Bongaigaon, and the DWSM (District Water and Sanitation Mission) was to spend the money on a sanctioned scheme.        
	Mehta opened an account with Axis Banks G.S. Road branch in the name of DWSM  this one standing for Development Work and Social Movement  in March last year to fraudulently withdraw the entire amount.         
	Kumar said the draft was deposited in the Axis Bank account on June 6 and the money withdrawn online in tranches by August 30. It has come to light that the money was withdrawn online from different places like Delhi, Calcutta, etc. On June 23, money was withdrawn twice. First Rs 9 lakh was withdrawn and then again Rs 8 lakh.        
	All this while, officials of the DWSM, Bongaigaon, were unaware that a revalidated draft had not only been issued but withdrawn, too.        
	The member secretary of the mission, M. Rahman, filed a complaint with the police only after he was informed by SBI, Bongaigaon last month that the draft had been cleared.         
	The case against the two Axis Bank officials hinges on the fact that they allegedly made allowances, knowingly or otherwise, to enable Mehta to pull off the swindle.         
	The duo have been charged under Sections 420 and 468 of the IPC. They were today taken to Bongaigaon for interrogation.        
	One of the lapses is that they (Axis Bank) sent the DD to SBI, Bongaigaon, in the hands of Rajiv Talukdar. The rules state that a draft should be sent by registered post, Kumar said.         
	Axis Bank vice-president Niladri Sarkar, who is in Guwahati, admitted that the withdrawal of Rs 1.88 crore through Mehtas account was fraudulent.

	Mumbai, May 3: Raj Thackeray today described the presence of north Indian migrants in Mumbai as a cultural invasion and dared the state government to act against him for his provocative speech.        
	The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader, arrested in February for stoking violence against migrants and freed on bail, ignored directives from the state human rights commission and police to observe restraint.        
	At the well-attended Shivaji Park rally on his partys second anniversary, Thackeray renewed his hate campaign.         
	I havent told migrants from UP and Bihar to leave Mumbai. But, if bhaiyyas continue their dadagiri against the sons of the soil, we will not hesitate to drive them out.         
	He blamed migrants for proliferation of illegal slums and increasing crime rates in Mumbai, and said they were robbing Marathi-speaking people of their rightful jobs.         
	What they (migrants) are doing is an invasion and nothing else, Thackeray said. Dont wait for instructions and orders from me. Whenever you see injustice on Marathis, kick them, he said, revealing his partys future agenda.        
	He repeated his accusation that actor Amitabh Bachchan did more for his native Uttar Pradesh than for Mumbai where he lived.        
	In an impromptu question-answer session with party workers that was a throwback to uncle Bal Thackerays speeches in the past, he asked: What did I say wrong? Did he not fight his election from UP? Did he not choose to act in Bhojpuri cinema when it came to working in non-Hindi films? Was he not a brand ambassador for UP, and did he not donate a girls school in Aishwaryas name?        
	But he denied that Navnirman workers had attacked Bachchans house with bottles. My workers will not a throw a bottle. They will throw a crate of bottles, he said.         
	Thackeray also attacked Hindi news channels whom he accused of spreading a misinformation campaign, Amitabhs wife Jaya, close friend Amar Singh, railway minister Lalu Prasad, health minister Anubani Ramadoss and social activist Medha Patkar.         
	Patkar said Thackeray had violated the human rights commission order asking for restraint.         
	However, senior police officials hinted that no action was likely to be taken against Thackeray. We will analyse the speech and see if it violates any provision, a police source said.         
	In the past, too, the government had been reluctant to act against Thackeray, afraid that an arrest might turn him into a hero.

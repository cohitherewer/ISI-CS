	Aug. 21: If the global dash for the iPhone were an Olympic event, Indians would win no medals.        
	India chose to sleep as Apples iPhone 3G made its midnight debut in the country, unlike America, Japan or Australia where people had stood in queues for hours, sometimes days, to get their hands on the supergadget.        
	Whether in Delhi, Mumbai or Calcutta, the lines were short before Vodafone and Bharti Airtel outlets, with TV crews, reporters and onlookers easily outnumbering the buyers in the first hour after midnight.        
	Ananth Raman, 29, was the first of the seven buyers at Airtels City Centre outlet in Calcutta during the early hours. It has so many features, especially the multi-touch facility, which is why Im willing to spend Rs 36,000, the event manager said, examining his 16GB phone.        
	Businessman Waseem Khan, 39, was equally willing, which made him the lone buyer in Durgapur, putting the town on the iPhone map.        
	Im very happy to be the first customer in Durgapur. Ill go home and try the product, he said. Only 14 people came to the store, which closed at 1.30am.        
	At Calcuttas Camac Street Vodafone store, Bhaichung Bhutia opened the scoring, becoming the gadgets first celebrity recipient. Ill enjoy the motor-racing games, the soccer star said.        
	Outside, there were no crowds; inside, just half-a-dozen buyers. The first of the buyers was MNC executive Saajan Agarwal, 41. Ive been using Apple products for a while. But I dont think its fair that the phone is being sold at a higher rate than was being speculated even a week ago, he said.        
	The price could be one reason for the slow start: the 16GB model costs Rs 36,100 and the 8GB model, Rs 31,000.        
	A second reason could be that many had booked their iPhone and didnt bother turning up at midnight since they were sure to get it anyway.        
	By Thursday night, we had 80 confirmed bookings (Customers) will collect their iPhone 3G on Friday, said Sanjay Chordia, owner of Imagine, Apples premium store at City Centre that will stock both Airtel and Vodafone connections. Because of security measures, we decided not to open the shop at midnight.        
	Midnight launches are unheard of in India, where stores are usually not allowed to stay open too late. Mumbai didnt miss out on the party though: the lights were dimmed and the music reached a crescendo at the stroke of 12 at the Infinity mall as a few hundred gathered before the Airtel counter. Only 10 bought the gadget in the first hour.        
	In Bangalore, where only two outlets opened, there were just five buyers among the 40 people at the Vodafone store in Koramangala. One of them, Prabhanjan Deshpande, agreed that the price could be a damper.

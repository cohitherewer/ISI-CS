  Tatas upset, govt scurries to clear air          OUR BUREAU                  Indian villagers who offered their land willingly for the Tata Motors plant take a procession demanding the immediate restoration of the company's project in Singur. (AFP)		    
	Calcutta, Sept. 8: The deal done in haste is haunting the government the day after.        
	Tata Motors has expressed distress at the limited clarity on the outcome of the Singur talks and has decided to keep work suspended, forcing the government to scramble to clear the air somewhat.        
	The mother plant and the ancillaries will not be separated and attempts will be made to find land for rehabilitation without affecting the integrity of the project, industries minister Nirupam Sen, accompanied by a grim Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, told reporters.        
	Sen added that the spirit of yesterdays talks at Raj Bhavan was to make efforts to find out whether land will be available in the project area after keeping the mother plant and the ancillary units intact. It wasnt discussed that land will have to be found by affecting the project.        
	The clarification contradicted Mamata Banerjees claim last night  and repeated today  that nearly 300 acres from within the project site would be spared.        
	Chief minister Bhattacharjee said the government was still trying to ensure that the Tatas did not leave Singur.        
	But sources said the fate of the project lay in the hands of Ratan Tata. It is his decision now. Others said the Tatas might wait till a committee submitted its report and then take the decision.        
	Mamatas comments and the absence of specifics in the document read out by the governor yesterday after the first-ever meeting between Bhattacharjee and the Trinamul leader had prompted the Tatas to write to the government and issue a statement expressing distress.        
	Tata Motors is distressed at the limited clarity on the outcome of the discussions between the state government of West Bengal and the representatives of the agitators in Singur, the statement said.        
	The company said the suspension of work would continue until it was satisfied that the integrity of the project would not be affected. We will review our stated position only if we are satisfied that the viability of the project is not being impinged, the integral nature of the mother plant and our ancillary units are being maintained and all stakeholders are committed to develop a long-term congenial environment for smooth operations of the plant in Singur.         
	Tata Motors sources later said the company was not consulted for the finalisation of the points of the agreement reached on Sunday. People with limited knowledge are taking a call on the project, a source said.        
	In the letter to the state government, Tata Motors said remarks attributed to Mamata that some 200 to 300 acres in the project area would be given back and ancillaries shifted across the road are causing confusion in our minds.        
	The industries minister said the government would send a reply to the Tatas today itself, assuring them of the fact that no confusion exists and that their integrated project stands.                  
	Sen added: There is no question of treating the mother plant and ancillary units as separate entities. This was also mentioned by the Tatas in letters to the government, governor (Gopalkrishna Gandhi) and Mamata Banerjee. It is not possible to separate the two and roll out the small car at such a low price.        
	A few hours before Sens comments, Mamata iterated that she had been assured that 300 acres would be set aside within the project area and another 100 acres in the adjacent areas for rehabilitation. Mamata also demanded that the vendor park be shifted.        
	Even after Sens clarification, Partha Chatterjee, leader of the Opposition, said: Perhaps, he has forgotten what was written in the agreement he had signed along with me last night in presence of the governor and the chief minister. There it was clearly written that maximum land would be provided to the unwilling farmers in the project area.         
	Drafting draws fire        
	The way the statement has been drafted is being blamed for the confusion. Mamata has seized on the word maximum to claim most of the land in the rehabilitation package would come from within the project area.        
	But the statement said land to be provided to the maximum within the project area, which suggests as much land as possible would be found within the site. Had the statement said maximum possible, this confusion would not have arisen. The chief minister should have taken seasoned officials with him and left the job to them once the political decisions were taken, a veteran associated with similar exercises said.        
	However, Ashok Ghosh, the state Forward Bloc secretary, defended the chief minister. The Left Front leadership had mandated the chief minister and his team to achieve three things: satisfy Mamata to the maximum extent possible, ensure that the Tatas are secure enough to commission the Nano project on the desired scale and the political environment is brought back to normal. They achieved all three admirably. Why are the Tatas pressing the panic button?        
	The government publicly contradicted another segment of the statement that suggested the package was meant for farmers who have not received compensation.         
	Today, industries minister Sen said the proposed compensation and rehabilitation package would have to be given to all landlosers of Singur. Be it land owners or bargadars, we wont make any distinction between those who willingly gave land and those who didnt. The government simply cannot do that, he added.

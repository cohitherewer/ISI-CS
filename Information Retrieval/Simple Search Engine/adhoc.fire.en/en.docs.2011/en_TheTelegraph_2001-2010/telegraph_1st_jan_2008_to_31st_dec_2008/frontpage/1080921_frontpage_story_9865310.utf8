	Calcutta, Sept. 20: Tata Motors will drive out of Singur if the government tries to make room for any further demand from Mamata Banerjee, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said tonight.        
	CPM sources said the chief minister conveyed the governments fears during a 90-minute meeting with governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi at Raj Bhavan this evening.        
	Senior leader Benoy Konar said Bhattacharjee told Gandhi his government had tried its utmost to accommodate the Trinamul chiefs concerns in the compensation package announced on September 12.        
	Any move to make room further would force the small-car project out of Bengal, he is learnt to have told the governor, who sought the meeting at Mamatas request.        
	Sources said Gandhi  requested by Mamata yesterday to get the government to honour the deal reached in his presence on September 7  asked Bhattacharjee if there was any way a land-based rehab package could be worked out.        
	Bhattacharjee said it was impossible to improve upon the package. The entire project will have to be scrapped if, going by her wish, 300 acres are spared from within the project site.        
	Also present at todays meeting was the governors legal adviser Chittatosh Mookerjee. Gandhi later briefed Mamatas aide Partha Chatterjee on the talks.        
	Bhattacharjee said his government had not disbanded the Singur rehab committee as Mamata had claimed. It lost its relevance since it failed to arrive at a decision after meetings over four days.        
	He said the package, with its promise of 70 acres within the project site, cash compensation and jobs, was proof of his governments resolve to end the standoff. Chatterjee said tonight Trinamul wanted nothing from the government except its commitment to the September 7 deal.        
	Gandhi has urged both sides to persevere with their discussions in the interests of a solution, which the people of Bengal desire and deserve.        
	Asked to comment on Nobel laureate Amartya Sens letter carried by The Telegraph today, Mamata said: Every person is entitled to hold or offer his or her views. But is industry desirable at the cost of the tears and sufferings of poor farmers?        
	In Singur, at least 50 farmers who had been unwilling to accept compensation had registered with Hooghly district authorities for the new package, reports said. Weve so far issued 15 cheques, said district magistrate Neelam Meena.                    WITH INPUTS FROM ANINDYA SENGUPTA AND UTTAM DUTTA

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Depp gets ugly for Mad Hatter
                                Depp: As himself                            
	London, Nov. 19 (PTI): Johnny Depp has once again experimented with his good looks and has turned ghoulish to fit the role of Mad Hatter in the upcoming film Alice in Wonderland.        
	The actor will be seen sporting a quirky hat with red curly hair sticking out besides donning a ghostly pallor and bohemian Victorian clothes, the Daily Mail reported.        
	Depp is unrecognisable in his latest role, the paper said.        
	The 45-year-old actor would play a darker version of the tea-drinking hat maker in Tim Burtons upcoming remake of Lewis Carrolls classic book.        
	From Edward Scissorhands to Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates Of The Caribbean, Depp is known for experimenting with his good looks to fit into a variety of roles.        
	The shooting for the latest film began in Cornwall this autumn, with a relative unknown taking the lead role as Alice.        
	Mia Wasikowska, from Australia, will be playing Alice, alongside Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. Burton has also cast his real-life partner Helena Bonham Carter as the moody Red Queen.        
	Matt Lucas of Little Britain fame will play the character of Tweedledum and Tweedledee.        
	The Queen star Michael Sheen will play the Cheshire Cat, while Back To The Future actor Crispin Glover will be seen in the character of the Knave of Hearts.

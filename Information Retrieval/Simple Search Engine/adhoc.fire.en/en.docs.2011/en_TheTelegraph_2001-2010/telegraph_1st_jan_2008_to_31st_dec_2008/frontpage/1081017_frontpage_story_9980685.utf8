                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Left offers 55-ticket bailout 
  - Jet, Air India to benefit from comrades Delhi flight           JAYANTH JACOB                                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 16: Look whos jumped to the aviation industrys rescue when the Centre is yet to show its cards and the CPM leadership is dead against a bailout!        
	Keralas Marxists have offered help  perhaps unwittingly.        
	CPM leaders from Kerala will be holding a protest march in Delhi tomorrow, and they are coming on commercial flights at a time airlines are desperately seeking business.        
	Chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan will be leading the march at the head of some 80-odd ministers, MLAs and MPs from Kerala, protesting against the Centres neglect of his state.        
	At least 55 of the luminaries are flying in from Thiruvananthapuram, their return tickets estimated to cost over Rs 13 lakh. This doesnt include the fares of the 19 MPs, whose trips will not cost the state because Parliament is set to reopen.        
	Ten, including the chief minister, are flying Jet Airways, which won its new Left friends just when it had announced the (now revoked) sack for 1,900 probationers citing a slump in business.        
	Jet, which had faced flak from CPM labour arm Citu over the lay-offs, will be smiling at evidence that not all Left protests are bad for business.        
	Its anyones guess, though, what the central leadership of Achuthanandans party may make of his efforts to help the aviation industry.        
	CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury today opposed any bailout package for airlines, saying the current crisis was of their own making and taxpayers money must not be wasted to help the companies earn more profits.        
	As Yechury spoke, most of the VIP protesters reached Delhi in dribs and drabs. A few will arrive tomorrow.        
	Achuthanandan, his private secretary, and ministers K.P. Rajendran, S. Sharma, G. Sudhakaran and Mullakara Ratnakaran touched down on a Jet flight at 8.45pm. Three ministers  C. Divakaran, A.K. Balan and M.K. Premachandran -- and Idukki MLA Bijimol arrived on the 7pm Jet flight.        
	Kerala finance minister Thomas Issac too arrived today but education minister M.A. Baby is expected on tomorrows Air India flight.        
	Unlike the chief minister, his 18 cabinet colleagues and the MPs, some of the MLAs will be taking the Rajdhani Express. However, many MLAs are flying. We will know which flights they are coming in only when they land, a Kerala government official here said.        
	Issac brushed away questions about the fares. What we are raising are pressing demands. There should not be any talk of the cost factor here. Anyway, ministers do come to the capital for various administrative purposes and also to submit memorandums to the various ministries, he told The Telegraph.        
	The march is to be held from Kerala House to Parliament but police are expected to stop it at Jantar Mantar.        
	The protesters want the states paddy quota restored in the above-poverty line category of the public distribution system, and are demanding a package for coconut growers, a special railway zone for Kerala and an IIT in the state.        
	E.K. Nayanar too had led a protest march against the Centre in Delhi when he was Kerala chief minister.        
	Senior Kerala Congress leader and Union parliamentary affairs minister Vayalar Ravi accused the Left of playing politics. The UPA government has been very kind to Kerala and sanctioned many projects. It is wrong on the part of the chief minister and the ministers to lead a march against what they call neglect by the Centre, Ravi said.        
	He advised Achuthanandan to learn from his Bengal counterpart, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	You saw Bhattacharjee battling for the Tatas while the Kerala chief minister is trying to bowl out the Tatas, he said, referring to Achuthanandans claim that Tata Tea was occupying government land in Munnar, Kerala.        
	Some of the Kerala ministers and MLAs will try to meet Union ministers during their Delhi trip. For instance, the CPM MLA from Ottapalam, M. Hamsa, has already met national security adviser M.K. Narayanan who is from his constituency.

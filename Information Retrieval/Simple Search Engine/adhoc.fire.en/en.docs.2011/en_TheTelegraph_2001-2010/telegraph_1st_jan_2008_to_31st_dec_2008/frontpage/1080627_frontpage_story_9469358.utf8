          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 26: Indonesia-based businessman Prasun Mukherjee today announced plans for a 10,000MW thermal power plant in Bengal.        
	If land is found  a tricky issue as 4,000-5,000 acres are needed in coastal Bengal where acquisition is a dirty word now  and the plant eventually comes up in Bengal, it will be the biggest in the state and possibly in the country.        
	The other challenge before power plants  the availability of coal  will be addressed through supplies from Indonesia, according to Mukherjee.        
	Mukherjee, a Salim Group associate, met power minister Mrinal Banerjee and said he would submit a formal proposal tomorrow for the Rs 42,000-crore investment. India doesnt have a 10,000MW plant yet.        
	The plant will be made in phases, over five years, Mukherjee told The Telegraph. It needs to be built on a coastal location; we need about 4,000-5,000 acres.        
	The power minister said Universal Success Energy, a subsidiary of Mukherjees Universal Success Enterprises, had not identified the land yet.        
	He sounded cautious on the subject after the Left Fronts panchayat poll reverses, such as in coastal East Midnapore, following the Oppositions anti-land acquisition movement.        
	We have told them to submit a formal proposal tomorrow, which we will approve. Then it is up to them to negotiate and sort out the land issues with the other political parties. Its a sensitive issue, and they have agreed to take the responsibility, Banerjee said.        
	The power will be primarily for Bengals use, Banerjee said on a day load-shedding hit parts of Calcutta.        
	Officials said the plant would not be a burden on the states coal and water.        
	I have coal blocks in Indonesia and I have shipping lines to bring it to Bengal, Mukherjee said, explaining why he wants the plant near the coast. I am also looking for more coal mines in China.        
	He said the power would be sold to the grid at a negotiated price. I am also talking to Maharashtra for a similar coal-based coastal power plant. But I want to do the first in Bengal.        
	The minister said Universal would use seawater at the plant to create the steam to activate the turbines. He added that the company had spoken of setting aside 5 lakh tonnes of coal for Bengal from its imports.

          SANTOSH K. KIRO                              
	Chhatarpur (Palamau), May 27: The murder of Lalit Kumar Mehta (37), civil engineer-turned-National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) activist, has left his family and friends shattered.         
	But his fellow workers, with whom he was conducting a social audit of the Union governments showpiece job scheme, have vowed not to give up the fight.         
	Mehtas fellow activists now want to step up efforts to expose irregularities in the implementation of the Act not only in Palamau but also in neighbouring Garhwa, his home district.         
	The people committing irregularities in the NREGAs implementation are thinking that we are scared after Mehta was eliminated. But they are wrong, said Mehtas long-time aide Manoj Kumar Singh, the president of NGO Sahyog Vikas Kendra founded by him.         
	Terming Mehta a martyr of NREGA, Singh said they would draw inspiration from his life and continue with the mission.        
	The NGOs office in Chhatarpur, always abuzz with activity, had turned quiet, even though workers tried their best to maintain a regular atmosphere as though it was business as usual.         
	Recalling the events of May 14, Singh said Mehta, after completing the first day of social audit, left Daltonganj for Chhatarpur alone on his motorcycle. They had unearthed massive irregularities in the NREGA and had even named some persons involved in it.        
	Mehtas body was found the next day in Kanda forest, about 25km from Daltonganj. Even Palamau superintendent of police Deepak Verma accepted that the manner in which the murder had been committed, indicated that the criminals harboured a deep animosity with the victim.         
	A resident of nondescript Jaynagar village in Garhwa district, Mehta studied in a local school before moving to Bangalore where he completed his diploma in civil engineering in 1993. But widespread poverty and hunger in Palamau district moved him. Even before he finished his diploma, he joined a Dehra Dun NGO Pani Chetna Manch. Along with other activists, he formed the NGO, Sahyog Vikas Kendra, at Chhatarpur in 2001.        
	He leaves behind his wife Ashrita Tirkey, a teacher in Kasturba Gandhi Vidyalaya, Ranka in Garhwa, and two children  one seven-year-old and the other only four years.        
	We will take a long, long time to overcome this grief, said his father, Jagdish Mehta.

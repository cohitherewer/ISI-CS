          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, July 7: Much on the lines of the N.T. Ramarao governments populist scheme in early eighties, the Orissa government today announced a scheme of providing 25kg rice every month to BPL families at a subsidised price of Rs 2 per kg.        
	The scheme would come into effect from August 1, an official source said.         
	The state exchequer will have to bear an additional expenditure of Rs 800 crore on account of the scheme, said finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei. If necessary, we will take a loan to meet the expenditure and subsequently provide funds in supplementary budget, he said.         
	Estimated 55.5 lakh state families are expected to benefit from the scheme, the source added. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik to review the functioning of the public distribution system.         
	At the meeting, Naveen had stressed on how the rising inflation had severely affected BPL families. Our government has, therefore, decided to provide rice at Rs 2 per kg to the families to ease their burden, he apparently said.        
	The Opposition was quick to dub the announcement as an election stunt. Leader of Opposition J.B. Patnaik said: My government had introduced the Rs 2-per-kg rice scheme. But, it was discontinued after the BJD government came to power. Now, as elections draw closer, it announced the scheme to woo voters.        
	There have been similar schemes offered on the eve of elections by different governments, like the most successful one by NTR in Andhra Pradesh in 1983.        
	The scheme would benefit 36.79 lakh BPL families, 12.64 lakh Antyodaya Anna Yojana beneficiaries and 5.56 lakh APL families of Koraput-Bolangir-Kalahandi districts.

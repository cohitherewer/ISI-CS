          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Raj steps out of the van. (AP)                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 13: Arrested, Raj Thackeray stepped into a police van, got off at a court and walked free after paying Rs 15,000.        
	Ambadas Dharrao, too, got on a bus but he never completed his journey home. Stoned by suspected supporters of Raj, the 53-year-old bled to death by the time he was taken to a hospital in Nashik.        
	Dharrao, who worked in a plant of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), was a Maharashtrian  the populace Raj was trying to protect from north Indians.        
	He was on his way home from the plant in Nashiks industrial area on a HAL bus when motorbike riders hurled stones at the vehicle. Dharrao was hit on the head around 4.45pm, apparently in retaliation to Rajs arrest.        
	The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena leader was arrested around 4.10pm for making provocative speeches resulting in sectarian violence. Raj was in custody for 2 hours and 40 minutes after which he was granted bail on the surety of Rs 15,000 and a condition that he would desist from making inflammatory speeches.        
	Playing fair, police also arrested Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi, but he was soon let out on bail.        
	Mumbai remained peaceful but stray violence was reported from areas like Nashik where Raj has some presence.        
	In the metropolis, however, roads emptied earlier than usual and trains were less packed at night. SMS jokes were soon buzzing around: If this is what the arrest of one politician can do, send one behind bars daily and make Mumbai a better place to live.        
	Some were hoping that they would be able to celebrate Valentines Day tomorrow undisturbed as the moral police are busy fighting among themselves.        
	The atmosphere for the arrests had started building up from the morning when deputy chief minister and NCP leader R.R. Patil, who also holds the home portfolio, cut short his visit to Nagpur and returned to Mumbai.        
	Patil reportedly gave the final clearance for the arrests after a meeting with the police brass.        
	The arrest was viewed with scepticism by the Opposition. Making a hero out of Raj is a calculated strategy of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, said BJP state president Nitin Gadkari. This is a move to divide the Shiv Senas Marathi votes and weaken our alliance partner.        
	Parts of Nashik reported an exodus of north Indian workers. Railway officials pegged the departure at 1,500 to 2,000 based on ticket reservations in Nashik.

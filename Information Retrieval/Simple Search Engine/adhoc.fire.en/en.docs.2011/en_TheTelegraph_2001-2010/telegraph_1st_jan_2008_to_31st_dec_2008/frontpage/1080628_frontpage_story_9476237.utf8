          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 27: Inflation crept up to 11.42 per cent today  and the economists expect the government and the RBI to cobble together a fire-fighting strategy to tame the spook.        
	The bitter cocktail of inflation, a fresh spurt in global oil prices and domestic political uncertainty drove the sensex down by over 600 points during the day.        
	The data for the wholesale price index for the week ended June 14 showed that the prices of a broad range of products from tea and milk to soaps and detergents had started to climb because of higher transportation costs.        
	The price of tea rose by 3 per cent, sunflower oil by 4 per cent, and milk, imported edible oil, salt and mustard oil by 1 per cent each. At the same time, the price of soap rose by 8 per cent, detergents by 9 per cent and hair oil by 1 per cent.        
	Economists seemed resigned to the prospect of living with double-digit inflation for some time.        
	Inflation can climb to 12 per cent as prices of manufacturers that use petroleum as an input will rise. Metals will also cost more, said D.K. Joshi, chief economist with rating agency Crisil.        
	The experts expect the government and the RBI to raise interest rates further when the central bank meets on July 29 to review the monetary policy.        
	The government is also expected to start drawing from its stockpile of 22 million tonnes of wheat and 26 million tonnes of rice to feed the public distribution system which provides cereals at controlled prices to the poor. It will follow this up with open market sales of foodgrain to rein in prices for middle class consumers.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram could draw some comfort from global credit agency Moodys report today which forecast inflation in India would decelerate to around 8.5 per cent by the year-end.        
	Fresh oil shock        
	Even as the government tried to get a handle on surging domestic prices, crude oil leapt to a new high of $142.26 a barrel in the international market.        
	However, with elections due in six states later this year, the Centre isnt expected to raise petroleum product prices anytime soon.        
	Airlines may announce fresh fare increases following the fresh rise in fuel prices.

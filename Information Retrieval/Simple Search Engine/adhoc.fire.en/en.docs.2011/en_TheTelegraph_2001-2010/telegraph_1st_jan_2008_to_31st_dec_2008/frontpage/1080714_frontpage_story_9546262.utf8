                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Soren seeks cabinet berth

	Bokaro, July 13: Amid the fluid political scenario at the Centre, JMM chief Shibu Soren today sought his pound of flesh, saying he wanted one cabinet and one minister of states berth as was promised to the party.        
	Soren told The Telegraph that neither the external affairs minister, Pranab Mukherjee, nor any of the BJP leaders had talked to him for his partys support. Let me make it clear at this juncture that none of the senior Congress, Communist or BJP leaders met me on this issue though they sent congratulatory messages to me on the marriage of my son Basant. No politics should be read on this issue, he said.        
	Late in the afternoon, Chief minister Madhu Koda and his wife Meera arrived at Sorens Bokaro residence with an urgent message of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi to ensure all the five JMM MPs support the trust vote. Koda held a 50-minute closed-door meeting with Soren after congratulating the newly wed couple  Basant and Hema. The JMM has five MPs, including Shibu Soren, Teklala Mahto, Suman Mahto, Hemlal Murmu and Sudam Manjhi.        
	Later, Koda told reporters that he had gone to Delhi to submit a report on the development of the state to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh but failing to meet him met Sonia with whom he discussed about the states welfare and the changed political scenario. He added that his talks with Soren was absolutely satisfactory. Soren said: At this stage, the JMM is with the UPA but the final decision on voting will come on July 19 after the party meeting.        
	Since last many months, we have been demanding that the JMM should be given one-and-a-half berth in the Union cabinet (one cabinet and one minister of state), Soren said         
	One week is still left for bringing the confidence motion in Parliament and as I am too tired and even indisposed due to social obligations after my sons marriage, I will take a bit of rest before thinking of politics, said Guruji.         
	One of the JMM MPs, on condition of anonymity, said that the nuclear deal has given us a last chance to get into the cabinet.

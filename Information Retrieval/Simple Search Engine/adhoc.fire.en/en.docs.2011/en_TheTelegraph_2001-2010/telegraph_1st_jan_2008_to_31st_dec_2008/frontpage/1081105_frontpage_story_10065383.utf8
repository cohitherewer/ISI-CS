  - Wouldnt like Sana to find there is no job in Bengal          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Sourav with Sana. File picture                                        
	Nagpur, Nov. 4: Sourav Ganguly has, over the years, been the epitome of a passionate cricketer. Hes passionate about other things too, not least the well-being of Bengal and the future there for the present generation as also the emerging one.        
	Bengals unofficial brand ambassador is, in fact, concerned about what lies ahead for his and Donas only child  Sana, who turned seven yesterday.        
	I wouldnt like Sana to grow up, get a good education and, at the end of it all, find that theres no job (in Bengal), Sourav told The Telegraph during an interview on a Calcutta-Nagpur flight last evening.        
	The following are excerpts:        
	Q: Theres talk that you could be a candidate, possibly an Independent supported by the CPM, in the next Lok Sabha elections.        
	A: (Interrupting): Thats not true.        
	Q: Is it because politics isnt really your cup of tea?        
	A: Absolutely.        
	Q: But are you ruling out a role in politics for all time to come?        
	A: In the mindset I have today, yes.        
	Q: That would include not accepting a nomination to the Rajya Sabha?        
	A: (Laughs) Look, I dont even know who qualifies to sit in the Rajya Sabha!        
	Q: With time on your hand after the Nagpur Test, your last India appearance, I suppose youll be happy to promote Bengal as a brand ambassador.        
	A: Id love to do that. I couldnt, so far, because of my cricket commitments. After Nagpur, Ill be free.        
	Q: At the height of the Nano controversy, you pitched strongly for it, appealing that the project stay in Singur. Why?        
	A: Because Bengal needs not one but many Nano projects. For the life of the youth to change, across the state, the top industrialists have to invest and create job opportunities. I wouldnt like Sana to grow up, get a good education and, at the end of it all, find that theres no job. Id like her to stay with me and Dona, in Calcutta, not go elsewhere for a job... Not go to Mumbai or Delhi or London. Its a personal example, yes, but one which would hold for you or my brother or the many people who love Bengal and are concerned about its future.        
	Q: Your support for Nano and, thereby, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee seems to have earned Mamata Banerjees ire.        
	A: Miss Banerjee shouldnt see my support for industry as disrespect towards her. Im not a politician and havent taken a political stance. The stand Ive taken has only been driven by one thing -- the wellbeing of todays youth and the future of todays children.         
	Q: Have you met Mamata?        
	A: No. I may not meet her at all, unless an opportunity arises.         
	Q: What brought you so close to the chief minister?        
	A: Certainly not a political agenda... Id say his personality. The first time I met him was on the Eastern Bypass (in Calcutta), many years ago, when he stopped his convoy to greet me. I was heading for the airport with my police escort and hed probably been going somewhere in Salt Lake. I was quite taken aback, pleasantly, when he said he admired my batting and was a keen follower of sport. He also spoke something about his university days.        
	Buddhababu didnt have to stop his convoy and get off in the middle of the road; he couldve called and told me the same things. But, then, thats Buddhababu. Why just me, the Tatas and the Jindals.They all have nothing but admiration for him and, remember, they keep interacting with Prime Ministers and chief ministers on a regular basis. If Buddhababu wants me to do something for Bengal, well, Im a phone call away. In fact, Ill be willing to work for the state, irrespective of who is in power.        
	Q: You made your India debut during the Jyoti Basu years.        
	A: Yes, but I never met him personally. Dont think there was any occasion.         
	Q: To go back to Nano, how did you feel when the Tatas moved it to Gujarat?        
	A: I was very disappointed. I know everybody will have his or her side of the story and, really, I dont know the politics of it all. The bottomline, however, is that the Nano wont be rolling out of Singur and as a citizen of Bengal, Im very disappointed. Im not saying that agriculture isnt needed, but for progress, youve got to have many Nano projects. I dont know what you feel, but the reality is that Nano wouldve employed thousands directly and many more indirectly. That opportunity has been lost.        
	Q: How long do you think it will take for Bengal to recover from the Nano setback?        
	A: (Pauses) Dont know. Everything depends on the investors. I must say I was glad to hear Mr Ratan Tata say that hed still like to invest in Bengal.         
	Q: Can things actually change in the state?        
	A: Its not a question of can or if, things have to change and everybody has some responsibility.        
	Q: The final one: Whats the update on your education project in Salt Lake?        
	A: Its ready to take off. I have ambitious plans and am quite passionate about it. I like being with children and Ill be a satisfied man if I can help shape the future of some of them. (Adds laughing) I havent thought of the name as yet but it definitely wont be the Sourav Ganguly School or College!

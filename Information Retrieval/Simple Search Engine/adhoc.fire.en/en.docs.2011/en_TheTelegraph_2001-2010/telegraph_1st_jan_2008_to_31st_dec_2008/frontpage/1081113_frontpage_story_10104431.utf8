                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Ban on migrant film

	The Maharashtra government has decided to ban the screening of Bhojpuri actor-producer Kamal Khans Deshdrohi, saying the film could create law-and-order problems.        
	The Maharashtra Navnirman Senas anti-migrant campaign is the theme of Khans debut Hindi film.        
	We feel the film can create tensions and disturb law and order. We have given our inputs to the government and it has taken a decision, director-general of police Anami Roy said.        
	Deputy commissioner Vijay Singh Jadhav said the ban would be effective for 60 days. The film is scheduled for release on November 14.        
	Khan threatened to move court. The government has not informed me in writing about its decision yet. But I am certain I will move court against the ban. There are no grounds to ban the film, he said.        
	The censor board has cleared it for release. The police had expressed apprehensions that the MNS and the Shiv Sena might have problems with the film. So I showed it to both parties, and they have no objections. The government seems to have some personal interest in stalling the release.         
	The censor board had cleared the film with five cuts. It had asked Khan to delete the word Marathi from some dialogues.

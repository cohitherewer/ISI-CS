                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bero school boys left to fend for themselves
  - With exams round the corner, 15 return to cook and study          SANTOSH K. KIRO                            Students cook in the open for themselves at Baridih Residential School on Saturday. Picture by Manik Bose                                        
	Bero, Nov. 22: Only 15 of 243 students have returned to the Bero Residential School that was left abandoned on the eve of Childrens Day when five of its boys died after drinking poisoned milk served with evening snacks.         
	Ever since their principal, who has been named in the FIR, and all 12 teachers fled the school on the day of the tragedy on November 13, no classes are being held at the Rajkiya Anusuchit Janjati Awasiya Uchcha Vidyalaya, a welfare department-run school for SC/STs.         
	So, 15 of the 25 Class X students are using kerosene lamps to study on their own for examinations that are around the corner. They are also cooking themselves a frugal meal of dal and rice since the two cooks  Laxman Nayak and Soma Oraon  have also been arrested along with the schools regular milk supplier Pratima Devi.        
	Our new principal R. Pathak came to see us yesterday. But, no other teacher has come back, said Sunil Khalkho, who  along with Vijay Toppo, Kshun Oraon, Vichar Oraon, Abhishek Oraon and others  returned to the school.         
	We cannot neglect our studies as the board examination is near So we decided to come back and start studying on our own, he added.         
	Pratimas arrest and subsequent detention has sparked a wave of local protests as both the hostel superintendent  who also fell ill after drinking the milk  and several students have vouched for her.        
	Pratima, they said, had been supplying milk to the school for the past two years or so and moreover, those who drank the milk in the morning after it was heated by the cooks did not fall ill. It was only the 70-odd students those who drank the milk in the evening who fell ill. Later, while they were being shifted to Ranchis Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), five of them died.        
	Pratima does not figure in the FIR lodged by Bero block welfare officer Viswanath Sahu, who has blamed the principal, hostel warden and two cooks for the incident. But Bero officer in-charge C.S. Singhs forwarding letter to the chief judicial magistrate of Ranchi, however, mentions Pratima along with the others.        
	Pratima Devi was supplying milk to the school which was poisonous and which caused the incident, the OC said in his report.        
	Pratimas parents, who rushed to Bero from their home in Bharno 45km away as soon as they heard of her arrest, said her two children have been inconsolable ever since.        
	Both Hansh Raj (4), who has only begun to go to school, and Neha Kumari (6), who studies in Class II at Holy Convent in Bero, have been crying day and night and asking for their mother, said her father Kedar Prasad Gupta. He alleged their daughter was picked up at 10pm on November 13 without the presence of a policewoman. This is blatant violation of the law, added her mother Basanti Devi.        
	The parents also alleged Pratima was kept in the mens lock-up along with the two cooks.         
	The police, however, denied their claims. The allegations are false, said Singh, adding that she had been arrested on grounds of suspicion as her name had come up during the process of investigations. State police spokesperson S.N. Pradhan has also maintained that Pratima was arrested as a suspect.        
	Investigations so far have, however, yielded nothing. The viscera of the five dead have been sent to the forensic laboratory for confirmatory tests to determine the nature of poison used. Reports are awaited.        
	It would not be wise to say anything at this stage. We are investigating the matter, said DSP Jyoti Uday Tete, who is leading a three-member probe team.         
	At Bero, the 15 boys who have come back to school admit they are scared. Now, they want to put the tragedy behind them. For that, classes must begin.         
	The government should ensure that our classes begin soon. Otherwise, our future will be ruined, said Vijay, one of the boys who have dared to return.

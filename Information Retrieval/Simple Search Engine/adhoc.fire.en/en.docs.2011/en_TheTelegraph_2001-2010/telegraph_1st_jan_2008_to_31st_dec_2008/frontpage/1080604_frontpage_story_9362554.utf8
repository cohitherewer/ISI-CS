BRIBE CUFFS ON RIPUN          OUR BUREAU                                     
	New Delhi/Guwahati, June 3: Assam education minister Ripun Bora was arrested in New Delhi today for allegedly offering a bribe of Rs 10 lakh to an officer of the CBI, which is investigating a murder case against him.         
	The CBI officer, who is probing the murder of student leader Daniel Topno, filed a complaint last evening that Bora had allegedly offered him the bribe to hush up the case.         
	The minister was arrested from Mathura Road this afternoon after being caught red-handed while offering the bribe to the CBI officer, sources in the investigating agency said.         
	The Tarun Gogoi government dropped Bora from the cabinet later this evening. The chief minister in a one-line statement, according to his press adviser Debo Bora, said in New Delhi the law will take its own course. Nothing more, nothing less.         
	An associate of the minister was arrested at Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport as soon as he arrived from Delhi. The CBI team took him back to Delhi soon after.        
	Ramesh Maheswari, a Delhi-based businessman, who allegedly supplied the money to Bora, was also arrested in Delhi today.         
	Bora, who had a long innings as the spokesman for the government, was a suspect in the murder case and had been questioned several times by the CBI.         
	Topno, the district president of the All Assam Tea Tribe Students Union, was Boras rival candidate in Gohpur constituency during the 1996 Assembly elections in Assam.         
	Topno was vocal against Bora, who lost the Assembly elections in 1996 but was elected from Gohpur in 2001. The student leader was murdered on September 27, 2000.         
	The CBI took over the investigations in 2005 after Assam police failed to crack the case.         
	Bora allegedly approached the CBI officer through the middleman for negotiating the outcome of the investigation into the murder case.         
	Topnos mother Silonti said everybody knew that Bora was involved in the killing of her son but nobody said so openly out of fear. I was almost sure about Boras involvement when he had asked me to force my other son to withdraw the high court case seeking a CBI probe into the murder, she told The Telegraph over phone from No. 5 College Guri village at Gohpur.         
	Silonti said Bora had come to her house soon after he won the Assembly elections in 2006 to ask her to have the case withdrawn. God is there and now it is almost proved that Bora was behind the killing.         
	Narayan Gorh, an accused in the Topno murder case and a close friend of his, said, I was arrested on false charges just to divert the attention from the main culprits. I was in jail for 76 days on charges of killing my friend. This was done at the behest of Ripun Bora, he said.         
	The CBI had also grilled Narayan several times in this connection. Narayan, who was the former assistant general secretary of the Assam Tea Tribes Students Association, said Topno was a clear threat to Bora as the student leader was very popular in the area and would have polled the entire tea communitys votes. I am not drawing any conclusion but it looks an open and shut case to me, he said.         
	The CBI registered a case under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) IPC and sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, Dec. 9: A 25-year-old expelled cadet of the Indian Military Academy in Dehra Dun rejoined the premier institute under a false name this year and pursued a course for six months until his luck ran out a few days ago.         
	Sanjeev Yadav, who holds MSc and law degrees and is the son of a retired army major, was arrested today by Dehra Dun police, four days before the passout parade.         
	We have arrested Sanjeev Yadav following an FIR lodged on behalf of the IMA which alleged forgery and impersonation against him, said Amit Sinha, senior superintendent of police, Dehra Dun.         
	The youths father, Major (retired) R.S. Yadav, has been detained for interrogation.        
	IMA authorities refused to comment. The school, which has had to beef up security following terror attack threats, is believed to be sending a report to the army headquarters.         
	Yadav had enrolled in the two-year technical graduate trainee course during which cadets are given lessons on different technical skills such as signalling, radio transmission, etc. The cadets are commissioned as officers in the technical wing.         
	IMA sources said Yadav had first taken admission in June 2005 in the same course after clearing the Service Selection Board (SSB) test. However, he was expelled in July 2006 for prolonged absence.         
	In 2008, Yadav again appeared for the SSB test.         
	He submitted the BTech testimonials of his 22-year-old brother Deepak Yadav and cleared the test.         
	IMA admissions take place after physical verification of the candidates background. In Yadavs case, the local intelligence unit of the Meerut police verified his credentials this year.        
	Raghuveer Lal, senior superintendent of police, Meerut, said the candidates father had confirmed during verification that Deepak Yadav was his son.         
	Between June and November, Deepak Yadav escaped scrutiny by IMA staff. His original batch had passed out last year. But his luck ran out last month when he bumped into an old batchmate on the campus, who refused to take him for Deepak Yadav.         
	The young officer informed the authorities and after an internal probe, the IMA was convinced last week of the impersonation.         
	The boys father is believed to have said his son wanted to take revenge on the IMA.

  - Row over God particle                                          (Top) Hawking, Higgs                                  
	London, Sept. 11: Peter Higgs has attacked his Nobel prize rival Stephen Hawking, describing his work as not good enough following a row over potential new discoveries from the Large Hadron Collider experiment.        
	Higgs reacted to an interview in which Hawking jokingly suggested it would be more exciting if the 2.5 billion experiment at Cern on the Franco-Swiss border did not find the Higgs Boson, or God particle, it has been set up to identify.         
	Hawking once placed a $100 bet that the particle does not exist and continues to argue there are more interesting outcomes to be drawn from the LHC than its discovery. Scientists believe the Higgs boson is crucial to understanding the origin of mass. Shortly after the big bang, it is thought many particles weighed nothing, but became heavy later on.         
	Higgs, who first suggested the existence of the particle 44 years ago, admitted he had not read the actual paper in which Hawkins dismisses his theory.         
	But I have read one he wrote which I think is the basis for the kind of calculation he does. And frankly I dont think the way he does it is good enough, he said. He puts together theories in particle physics with gravity... in a way which no theoretical physicist would believe is the correct theory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Solace to ride out recession
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Solace to ride out recession

	London, Oct. 27 (Reuters): At times fictional superspy 007 seems to be bullet-proof.        
	The new James Bond film Quantum of Solace may prove critic-and recession-proof too when it hits British cinemas this week and US theatres on November 14, box office trackers predict. The second Bond movie with Daniel Craig as the suave secret agent is expected to build on the success of 2006s Casino Royale, despite economic pressures on movie-goers and agreement among critics that the earlier film was comfortably the better.        
	Quantum of Solace is one of the few event pictures left in the year, said Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo.        
	People responded very well to Casino Royale, and I think peoples affinity for Casino Royale will drive Quantum of Solace to a terrific opening, he told Reuters.        
	Jack Warner, who covers the box office for Screen International, agreed.        
	Bond is a very strong brand to build on, he said. No one expects a sequel to do less well than the one before it. Casino Royale went down well critically and with audiences, and they will be looking to break that figure.        
	In Britain, Casino Royale made $107 million, a sizeable percentage of global revenues and a high figure for the country. Globally it went on to sell tickets worth $594 million, according to www.boxofficemojo.com, the ninth biggest film in the US in 2006 and fourth biggest worldwide.        
	Solace stands an excellent chance of outgunning Royale because Daniel Craigs first film as built up an audience base, said Gray, who saw parallels with Batman, which had a similar makeover when Christian Bale was cast in the lead in 2005.        
	He did not, however, see Solace matching The Dark Knight, Bales next outing as the caped crusader which is the top movie of the year so far at $991 million worldwide.        
	Experts said financial turmoil and plunging values of stocks and property would have only a limited impact on ticket sales. Movies remain the cheapest, or one of the cheapest entertainment events available, in terms of the type of things you get out of the home to do, said Gray.        
	Bond is well suited to ride out any kind of recession.

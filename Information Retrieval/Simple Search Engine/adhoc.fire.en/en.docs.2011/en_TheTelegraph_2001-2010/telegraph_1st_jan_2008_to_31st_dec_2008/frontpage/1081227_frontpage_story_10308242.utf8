          JAYANTH JACOB                            Mukherjee with Saudi foreign minister al-Faisal in Delhi. (Rajesh Kumar)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 26: Pakistan is unlikely to figure on your New Year holiday itinerary, but the Indian government is not taking any chances.        
	India today advised its citizens that it was unsafe for them to travel to or be in Pakistan.         
	The foreign ministry issued the advisory, citing reports of Indians being held in Pakistan by agencies that operate outside the law and civilian control. The reference was to the reported arrest of Indians in connection with Wednesdays Lahore blast, for which a pro-Taliban outfit took responsibility today.        
	Since it has been reported in the Pakistani media yesterday that the senior police officer in Lahore was unaware of the arrest in his city, it seems that this is the work of other agencies in Pakistan that operate outside the law and civilian control. Indian citizens are, therefore, advised that it would be unsafe for them to travel or be in Pakistan, a ministry spokesperson said.        
	Indian holidaymakers may not pick Pakistan but pilgrims, especially Sikhs, do go there. Between 200 and 300 people get Pakistani visas every month. The number goes up sharply during the pilgrim season  a phase of which ended last month. The next season is scheduled to begin in April.        
	Bus and train services between the two countries still operate but visa checks have been intensified after the Mumbai attacks on both sides, resulting in huge delays.        
	Pakistan may be unsafe for Indians but not for Saudis and Iranians  to whom India turned today as part of a diplomatic offensive to persuade Islamabad to act against terror outfits on its soil.        
	The appeals to the two countries came a day after India urged China, a time-tested ally of Pakistan, to pressure Islamabad into action.         
	Within 24 hours, the Chinese foreign minister spoke to his Pakistani counterpart. The substantial part of what transpired between the two today was not made public but a Pakistani statement said the country assured China it was in full compliance with a UN resolution against the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a front of the Lashkar-e-Toiba.        
	In Delhi, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee told his Saudi counterpart Saud al-Faisal how elements in Pakistan had carried out the Mumbai strikes and complained the neighbour wasnt doing enough to dismantle terrorist infrastructure, sources said.        
	King Abdullah has sent al-Faisal to try and bring down the tension between India and Pakistan. Saudi Arabia is a close US ally, with a friendly influence over Pakistan.        
	Al-Faisal dubbed terrorism a cancer that we need to cut out and urged the UN to set up an international body to deal with Mumbai-like attacks. He suggested that the UN set up the body to fight terror wherever it exists.         
	Later in the day, Mukherjee spoke to Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki, briefing him on the Mumbai attacks and Pakistans failure to dismantle terror outfits.

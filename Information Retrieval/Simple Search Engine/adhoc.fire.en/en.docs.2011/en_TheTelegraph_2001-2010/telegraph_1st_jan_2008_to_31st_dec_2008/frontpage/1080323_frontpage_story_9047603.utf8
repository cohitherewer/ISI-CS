The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Stop-gap buzz on Pak PM nominee 
                                                                                                           Stop-gap buzz on Pak PM nominee 
                            
	Islamabad, March 22 (Reuters): The party of assassinated former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto nominated former National Assembly Speaker Yousaf Raza Gilani as its candidate for Prime Minister, a party spokesman said today.        
	President Pervez Musharraf had asked the National Assembly to reconvene on Monday to elect the Prime Minister.        
	Gilani, a vice-chairman of Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party, is all but guaranteed to win the vote with the support of his party, which won the most seats in the February 18 parliamentary elections, and its coalition allies.        
	Gilani, from the Punjab province, was Speaker from 1993 to 1997 during Bhuttos second term. He later spent four years in prison on charges of making illegal government appointments, charges he said were politically motivated.        
	The PPP is now led by Bhuttos widower, Asif Ali Zardari, but he is ineligible to stand for Prime Minister because he is not a member of Parliament.        
	After holding consultations within the Pakistan Peoples Party, with the coalition partners and also with the chairman of the party... consensus has been achieved in nominating the candidate, party spokesman Farhatullah Babar said after he announced Gilanis name.        
	There had been speculation the PPP would nominate a stop-gap Prime Minister and Zardari would take over after entering Parliament via a by-election.        
	Analysts said the appointment of Gilani, a low-key Bhutto loyalist, was likely to add to speculation that Zardari would seek to become the Prime Minister.         
	Musharraf will swear in the Prime Minister on Tuesday and the government is expected to be sworn in later in the week.

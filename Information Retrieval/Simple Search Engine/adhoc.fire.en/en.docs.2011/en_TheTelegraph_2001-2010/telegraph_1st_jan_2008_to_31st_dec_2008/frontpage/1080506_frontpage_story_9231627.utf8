                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Armed, Heirok affords a smile
  - Overwhelming turnout for SPO recruitment in Manipur hamlet          KHELEN THOKCHOM                                          
	Heirok (Thoubal), May 5: Under a blazing mid-morning sun, 48-year-old Thokchom Mohon Singh watched with satisfaction his hamlets transition from vulnerability to empowerment.         
	It was 10.30am and 400 youths had already queued up for the recruitment drive for special police officers being conducted by the state home department at Heirok playground.        
	I am happy that the government listened to our demand for arms for self-protection. I have sacrificed my daughter. We can now defend ourselves with our own force, Mohon Singh said, surveying the swelling group.         
	His daughter Promila was perfecting her thabal chongba, a traditional dance, during Holi when a militants bullets killed her along with one of her friends and another youth from the locality.        
	Villagers said at least six, including a former pradhan, were killed in the past few years by militants in Heirok, which comprises three small villages.        
	Burning with rage, the residents demanded that the villagers be given arms to defend themselves from rebel attacks.         
	The government relented. Last Friday, the Okram Ibobi Singh cabinet announced that 300 village special police officers would be recruited from among local youths at Heirok in Thoubal and another 200 officers will be recruited from Chajing in Imphal West.        
	In over a month today, the people of Heirok smiled.         
	Mohon Singhs only eligible son, Premkumar Singh, did not take part in the rally, since the chief minister has already promised him a government job.         
	But Mohon Singh ensured that his elder brothers four children took part in the rally.        
	I decided to be an SPO to protect our villagers. I could not save my cousin. If I am selected, I can save others, Thokchom Shyamajit, one of Mohon Singhs nephews, said.        
	Mohon Singh and his nephew summed up the collective feeling of Heirok, which has 14,000 electorates.                                      
	While SPO aspirants stood patiently for their turn in the physical fitness test or to submit the application forms, parents watched from the sidelines.         
	I am quite satisfied with the response. This is multiplication of our police force and the SPOs will help us in containing militants. We will open SPO units in other villages if demands for such units come to us, Joykumar Singh said.        
	By 4pm, when the recruitment drive was declared closed, over 500 were teeming on the field.        
	The selection procedure for 200 special police officers in Chajing will be held within the next few days.        
	The SPOs will don police uniforms and be equipped with .303 rifles. Motorcycles will be provided for patrolling. In addition to the monthly remuneration of Rs 3,000, the SPOs will get money for ration.         
	The monthly remuneration and ration money are secondary. I didnt come here in search of a job. I am joining the recruitment drive with the objective of defending ourselves from rebels, said 21-year-old Ningthoujam Chandi.         
	Punjab has a similar model of special police officers raised by K.P.S. Gill to fight terrorism.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 25: The chairman of the Delhi IIT board of governors threatened to resign earlier this week accusing Arjun Singhs ministry of trampling on the institutes autonomy.        
	V.S. Ramamurthy may now have been successfully coaxed by an anxious government to stay on, but his threat had triggered an unprecedented flashpoint, sources said.        
	The threat came after Arjun, the human resource development (HRD) minister, had earlier this month unilaterally overturned a decision by the IIT Delhi board to suspend the institutes registrar, Colonel (retd) Rajendra Singh, the sources said.        
	Never has the chairman of an IIT board of governors  an Indian Institute of Technologys highest administrative body  resigned because of a spat with the ministry in the tech schools nearly five-decade-long history. Nor does Ramamurthys threat have a precedent, the sources said.        
	Contacted by The Telegraph, Ramamurthy, a former secretary in the ministry of science and technology, confirmed the flare-up with the ministry over Arjuns decision. There were certainly some issues... but things have been sorted out, he said.         
	Ministry sources, however, said they were yet to receive any official information on Ramamurthys decision on whether to continue as board chairman.        
	The IITs have had differences with the HRD ministry on many occasions but these have always related to policy matters such as the implementation of reservations for students or teachers.        
	A senior IIT Delhi administrative source said the institutes board was particularly upset because the decision to reinstate the registrar was an open slap in the face of the board.        
	The revocation of the suspension order is unique because it does not involve any policy decision but reverses an administrative decision that the IIT act mandates the board to take, the source said.        
	The elected government can take major policy decisions, but if people sitting in Shastri Bhavan (the ministry headquarters) are going to decide on administrative staff, then there is no need for the board, the source said.        
	The registrar was suspended in 2007 after he refused to pay a sum of Rs 25,000 to an appellant under the Right to Information Act in violation of a Central Information Commission order.        
	In a petition to the ministry, the suspended registrar, however, alleged he was victimised because he had blown the whistle on illegal transfer of funds from the institute to an IIT alumni fund.        
	The IIT possibly felt the revocation (of the suspension) cast aspersions on it by validating the registrars charges, a ministry source said.

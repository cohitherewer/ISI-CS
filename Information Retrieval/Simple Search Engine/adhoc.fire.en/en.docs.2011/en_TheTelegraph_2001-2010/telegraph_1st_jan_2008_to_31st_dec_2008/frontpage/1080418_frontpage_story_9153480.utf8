          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, April 17: Union minister of state for industry Ashwani Kumar today said he would personally and vigorously pursue the expansion of bandwidth in the Northeast for the growth of its IT and IT-enabled sector.         
	I will personally take up the issue of creation of more bandwidth as it will go a long way in creating jobs for the growing pool of young professionals of the Northeast, Kumar said this evening during his maiden visit to the state after taking over as the Union minister of state for industry.         
	More bandwidth will help boost the IT and IT-enabled sectors in which the youth of the region have very good potential, he added.        
	Kumar also promised to take up with the finance ministry the traders demand to give more excise duty benefits to the industrial units in the region.         
	He said a lot of initiatives had been taken under the North East Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy, 2007, to develop the region. Assam was at the centrestage of this strategy as the states development would have a trickle-down effect on the other states of the region.         
	To prove his point, Kumar said Rs 770 crore had been cleared in transport subsidy in the four years of the UPA government, compared to the Rs 1,287 crore disbursed till 2001 since the scheme was introduced in 1971.         
	Kumar praised chief minister Tarun Gogoi by saying that Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia had described Assam as a revenue-surplus state, a tag not many states enjoy.         
	Moreover, the GDP growth rate was 2.6 in 2001 while under your chief minister it is 6.5 plus. To us this is a great achievement, he said.         
	A beaming Gogoi said, Assam is progressing despite insurgency. The huge participation in Bihu functions and the merrymaking are indicators of things changing for the better.

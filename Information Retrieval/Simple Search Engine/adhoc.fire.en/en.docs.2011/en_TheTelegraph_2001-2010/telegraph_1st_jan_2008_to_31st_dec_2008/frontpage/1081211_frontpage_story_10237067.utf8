The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | If Delhi is dialling, it must be Malik at receiving end
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   If Delhi is dialling, it must be Malik at receiving end
  - Long before Mumbai attacks and current post, Pak envoy was used to being repeatedly called in           JAYANTH JACOB                            Malik: Not again                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: When Pakistan high commissioner Shahid Malik was summoned by South Block to be handed a demarche at 5pm on December 1, few diplomats would have been better prepared than him.        
	Malik, yet to complete a year as the high commissioner in Delhi, is an old hand at the diplomatic ritual. He is used to being called in by the Indian foreign ministry at all hours of the day and often far later than 5pm.        
	When he was deputy high commissioner in New Delhi between 1992 and 1995, Malik had been repeatedly summoned late at night, a practice intended as a snub to Pakistan, a former Indian diplomat recalled.        
	I can recount not less than eight times he was called in at night in those years, the veteran said, adding this was an unusually high number even in the choppy waters of India-Pakistan relations.        
	Half of these meetings happened as late as midnight, and once Malik was summoned from the middle of a party to be handed a demarche (diplomatic representation of a governments position). But then, such is the job of a diplomat  whether he is from India, Pakistan or any other country. We cant work looking at the clock, when being called in, the retired diplomat said.        
	That was when militancy was at its height in Jammu and Kashmir. Every day we got to see faxed reports about murders of our nationals by mercenaries, said another veteran diplomat, adding India-Pakistan relations were more fraught in those days before the recent peace initiatives.        
	Pakistan was actively supporting the mercenaries and we had to call the envoy to register protest, urging his government to take action. The pressure of deaths on a daily basis was no easy task to deal with. So many terror strikes in Jammu and Kashmir, the Chrar-e-Sharif (shrine fire) incident and much more.        
	Diplomats said the reason Malik, then deputy high commissioner, was summoned so many times was partly that the high commissioner was often away, and in any case protocol allows either to be called in.        
	The December 1 call-in, though, is said to be Maliks first as high commissioner, a post he took up on January 18 this year. He flew to Islamabad this week to be handed a new message, aimed at pacifying India, that he would pass on to New Delhi.        
	The reason Malik in his latest posting has not been required too often to make the 20-minute drive from 2/50G Shantipath, his office, to South Block is that such call-ins have decreased since the start of the composite dialogue in 2004.         
	Besides, the recent blasts across Indian cities, unlike the Mumbai attack, had not been directly linked to Pakistani territory.        
	An envoy to India is usually summoned by the head of the foreign ministrys division, headed by a joint-secretary level diplomat, dealing with his country. For instance, Pakistan comes under the PAI (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran) division.        
	So are these meetings very tense?        
	Its nothing like what most people think. We tell them what we have to very clearly, at times through a written demarche. They also raise issues after listening to what we have to say. But we dont forget the small courtesies like offering water or tea, one of the former diplomats said.        
	The lack of personal friction was evident on December 1 when the head of the PAI division made it a point to see Malik off outside the wing.        
	In his current job, Malik has been extremely busy and visible, regularly attending seminars and business meetings. His friends in Islamabad and New Delhi  and there are many here -- see him as a thorough professional.        
	Some of them remember how he held a grand Pakistan Day celebration this year, bringing over a qawwali troupe from Lahore.        
	Malik, whose previous posting was as Islamabads envoy to Canada, has served in Rome, Tokyo and Washington besides being additional secretary in the Pakistan foreign ministry. His brother-in-law Waseem Sajjad is a Pakistan Muslim League-Q leader and former Senate chairman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Small scare to big start
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Small scare to big start

	New Delhi, Sept. 10: After a short sub-zero scare, scientists today successfully steered proton beams around the full 27km underground ring of the worlds largest and most powerful particle accelerator near Geneva, Switzerland, preparing to probe some unsolved mysteries of the universe.         
	At a control centre in St. Saint Genis, France, Indian physicist Raghav Varma was among the first researchers to capture tracks of the protons as they zipped by 100 metres beneath their feet along an arc of the giant ring that juts into France before turning back into Switzerland.         
	The first proton beam circulated clockwise at 1028 Geneva time (1358 IST), about an hour after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), an engineering marvel, was switched on. In the afternoon, scientists tested a counter-clockwise proton beam. Its a fantastic moment, said LHC project leader Lyn Evans. We can now look forward to a new era of understanding the origins and the evolution of our universe.         
	It was a great day. Everything went perfectly well, although we had a problem in the morning, said James Gillies, a physicist and a spokesperson for the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, or CERN, the home of the LHC.         
	The morning began with a hitch when scientists detected a failure of a cryogenic component used to produce extremely cold temperatures needed to maintain the intense magnetic fields in the LHC. It was repaired quickly, Gillies said.         
	A key goal of the LHC is to find the hypothetical Higgs Boson, a subatomic particle predicted by theories but never observed yet.         
	The Higgs Boson  which belongs to a class of particles named after the 20th-century Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose  is the only missing piece in a physics puzzle that may explain why matter has mass.         
	But the search for the Higgs Boson will begin only after the proton beams moving in opposite directions are manoeuvred into a collision. Physicists are likely to spend the next few days taking measurements and calibrating instruments.                     
	Weve been checking the health of the (particle) detectors, said Varma, a physicist from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, who is part of a multi-institutional team from India that developed components of detectors at the LHC.         
	Scientists also hope that experiments at the LHC will provide a better understanding of the nature of the mysterious dark matter which is five times more abundant in the universe than ordinary matter. The high-energy proton-proton collisions will also recreate the energy density that existed just tiny fractions of seconds after the Big Bang.         
	The LHC is a discovery machine, said CERN director general Richard Aymar. Its research has the potential to change our view of the universe profoundly.         
	When the LHC collisions take place, a deluge of data about subatomic particles will be relayed to computers around the world, including two data analysis nodes at the VECC, Calcutta, and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai.         
	The next few days will be spent in perfecting the beams, but we hope to get data from collisions within days or weeks, said Subhasis Chattopadhyay, a team member at the VECC.         
	The most important thing right now is to make sure the detectors are fine, Chattopadhyay said. The proton beams themselves may fry the detectors if any magnet holding them in position fails and the entire beam falls on the detectors.        
	In the days to come, CERN physicists will try to get the beams to circulate for several minutes to hours  long enough to begin the collision experiments.

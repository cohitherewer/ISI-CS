          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              Biranchi with Budhia. File picture      
	Bhubaneswar, April 14: Protection of an Oriya actress emerged the prime motive in the murder of Biranchi Das, the former coach of marathon kid Budhia Singh.        
	Police are yet to make a breakthrough in the case  except detaining Dipak Acharya, brother of gangster Raja Acharya, and his cousin Prasant Panda. It was a cold-blooded murder, said police commissioner Binay Behera, adding: We are examining three possible angles to the murder  love, extortion and an illegal scrap deal.         
	The 37-year-old judo coach was shot dead by two motorcycle-borne assailants in front of the Orissa Judo Association building last evening.        
	Biranchi was apparently protecting Leslie Tripathy, 24, stalked by Raja for quite some time. Recently, he also tried his hands at music video business during which he came in contact with Leslie who he later approached to act in his videos.        
	According to sources, Raja, who wanted to marry Leslie, had called up Biranchi several times yesterday requesting the coach to make him talk to Leslie. In fact, the small-time Oriya film actress had lodged an FIR some weeks ago alleging Raja to be sending her threatening SMS texts for the last few months. Leslie, however, denied that she had sought Biranchis help. I never asked him to interfere in the case. In fact, Biranchi himself called me up soon after I lodged the FIR, she told reporters today.        
	In Biranchis murder case, Raja is thought to be the main accused as the coachs brother Sushant told reporters: Raja shot Biranchi dead, as my brother was approached by Leslies father for protection.        
	Police sources said Raja was released only 10 days ago after he had been arrested on the basis of Leslies FIR.        
	According to an eyewitness, Biranchi came out of the hall after receiving a call on his cellphone. There were two men, wearing helmet, whom he called inside for a talk. The duo apparently suggested to walk outside and talk, as there was a power cut. The last thing that he was heard saying was Raja Ruha (Stop Raja), said Babina, an eyewitness.        
	Dass knowledge of an illegal scrap deal also might be an angle behind the murder, the police said. Another theory doing the round is that Biranchi was involved in some deal involving a huge sum of money. The police think that Raja was demanding a part of the sum. However, the police refused to divulge the details.

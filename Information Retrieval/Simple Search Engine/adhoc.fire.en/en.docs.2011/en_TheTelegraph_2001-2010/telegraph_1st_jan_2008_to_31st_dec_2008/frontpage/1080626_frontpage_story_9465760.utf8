  48-hour deadline buzz sparks Cong scramble          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Manmohan Singh with Pranab Mukherjee after the Prime Minister was given his e-passport in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, June 25: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is forcing the Congresss hand on pursing the nuclear deal even at the cost of the Left withdrawing support and facing elections in the latter part of this year.        
	Singh is understood to have given 48 hours to the Congress to make up its mind one way or another after which he will be left free to take his course of action. The message is being construed as a veiled resignation threat.        
	After the meeting of the UPA-Left nuclear panel drew a blank  both sides restated their known positions and agreed to meet for one last time for forms sake  the Congress sought to give an impression that it had bought time to take a political call.        
	The next meeting of the committee, to be convened in due course, will finalise its findings, said Pranab Mukherjee, the external affairs minister and the panels convener.        
	The announcement of another meeting created an impression that Sonia Gandhi was pondering over the wisdom of seeking a mandate against the backdrop of high inflation and the Congresss organisational vulnerabilities in several states.        
	Once word was out that Singh was upset over such dilatory tactics and was considering not going to the G8 summit in the first week of July, the Congress panicked.         
	Sonia Gandhi, Mukherjee, A.K. Antony and Lalu Prasad  the principal political players  went to the Prime Ministers residence. Later, the Congresss core committee also went into a huddle.        
	The leaders also asked M. Veerappa Moily, the Congresss chief spokesperson, to go on primetime TV and declare that the party was fully behind the Prime Minister. We are going ahead with the deal but the timing will be ours, Moily said.                
	Sources said Sonia was expected to go through the motion of consulting allies again. One source claimed that no decision on going to the IAEA had been taken yet.         
	The UPA-Left panel is expected to meet again on June 28 or 29, when Sharad Pawar returns from London.        
	The governments main problem is it does not have enough time for manoeuvre. According to the timeline put out by official sources, 45 days are needed to get the International Atomic Energy Agencys approval for the India-specific safeguards agreement from the day the government gives the green signal.        
	In case the deal is reactivated on June 30, the IAEA process will be over by mid-August.        
	The monsoon session begins on August 11. If the Left formally withdraws support and the BJP moves a no-confidence motion, Congress sources said, they are not sure of the Samajwadi Party bailing out the government.        
	If the government is voted out, Congress sources wondered whether countries in the Nuclear Suppliers Group would be interested in pushing the case for a lame-duck dispensation. We will lose power and the deal then, a source said.        
	But the same source conceded that if the government caved in before the Left, its authority and legitimacy would be severely eroded.

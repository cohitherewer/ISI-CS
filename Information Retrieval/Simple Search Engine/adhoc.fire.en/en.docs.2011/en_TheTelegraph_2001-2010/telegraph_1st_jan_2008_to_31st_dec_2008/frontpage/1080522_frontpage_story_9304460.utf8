          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Vibhu Vaibhav Anand                                              
	Cannes, May 21: Dev Anand made an emotional speech in Cannes last night when introducing Guide which was screened in the festivals golden oldie section reserved for classics.        
	The 84-year-old star of yesteryear also referred to his younger brother, Vijay Anand, who had scripted and directed a movie that everyone yesterday agreed had stood the test of time.        
	Dignitaries at the screening were a little baffled no mention was made of Vijay Anands widow, Sushma, or his 27-year-old son, Vibhu Vaibhav Anand, who were both present yesterday.        
	Vibhu had turned up smartly dressed in black tie with a two-page tribute to his late father  he passed away in 2004  on which he had worked for days. The speech, written from the heart, remained undelivered.        
	Last night, mother and son attended a beachside reception thrown by Anand Mahendroo for the new film, Colours of Passion, directed by Ketan Mehta.         
	She declined to be photographed at the party or to talk to journalists, urging the latter to come to Mumbai if they were really keen to discuss Guide with her. My mother is very tired, we are thinking of cutting short our journey,said her son.        
	Today, Vibhu spoke to The Telegraph about what he had wanted to say last night in an intensely personal statement.        
	What I had wanted to talk about was what he was like as a father, said Vibhu. He told me stories about Guide. I now feel there was a parallel between his life and that of the fictional guide. Towards the end, he was searching for a spiritual life rather like the guide.         
	After the three-hour screening, uncle and nephew did hug each other. I am so happy we did, Vibhu said.

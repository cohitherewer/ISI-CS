	Jan. 25: Only the width of the Hooghly stood between Calcutta and bird flu today with the virus confirmed in Howrahs Sankrail. The addition of Purulia swelled the list of affected districts to 11.
    
	Samples sent from Sankrail in Howrah and Saturi block in Purulia have tested positive. Culling will start tomorrow, animal resource development (ARD) secretary Dilip Chakraborty said.
    
	Officials said there was no evidence of unusual chicken mortality in Calcuttas lone organised poultry farm, a state-run one in Tollygunge. The city has no backyard poultry farms.
    
	ARD minister Anisur Rahman acknowledged that the planned vigil on roads and railway platforms, to prevent smuggling of chickens from affected zones to the city, was hit by rain today. Even the monitoring of Calcuttas markets suffered but culling did not, he said, with 3.5 lakh chickens killed.
    
	To speed up the flu fight, the government has asked district officials to tell villagers they would not receive compensation unless they handed over their chickens for culling willingly.
    
	We are saying this only to pressure the villagers, Rahman said. Several villages in Maldas Chanchol have turned away culling teams, demanding an increased compensation.
    
	Rahman said 13.6 lakh birds had been culled till tonight but the overall target of 21 lakh had not been revised since yesterday. Howrah has 12.5-lakh poultry and could alone bloat the target considerably, although culling will be confined to Sankrail.
    
	District magistrate Khalil Ahmed said 80-odd culling teams would be deployed tomorrow in Howrah, just 700 metres from the city across the Hooghly.
    
	Ahmed said the chicken samples that tested positive came from Masjidpara near Nalpur. The Purulia samples came from Ramchandrapur village, about 290km from Calcutta.

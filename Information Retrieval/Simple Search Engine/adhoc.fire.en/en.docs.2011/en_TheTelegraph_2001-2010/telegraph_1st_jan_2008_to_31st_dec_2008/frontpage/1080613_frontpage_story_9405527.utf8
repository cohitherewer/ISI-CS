  - Standby order after SOS           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	Calcutta, June 12: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today announced that the army had been called out in Siliguri as ethnic clashes erupted, but later said the force was on standby after the violence scaled down.        
	The army, the chief minister said, would not be called in at least for today.        
	The moves reflected a rethink on the states wait-and-watch policy that involved withholding force and letting pressure build on the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha as its indefinite bandh began to hurt hills people.        
	The change of heart came apparently as Nepalis and anti-Gorkhaland Bengalis fought with stones in Siliguri during an Amra Bangali bandh against yesterdays attack on tourists in the Dooars.        
	In the morning, there was violence in several areas of Siliguri and adjoining areas. The situation was going out of control and I had no option but to call the army, the chief minister said.        
	Later, I found things were gradually settling down and the local administration had restored normality. So I asked the administration to keep the army on standby. The army has been asked to keep itself prepared.        
	Bhattacharjee, however, also started efforts at a consensus by announcing an all-party meeting on June 17 and dropping enough hints that the Morcha was likely to be invited.        
	Asked if the Morcha, which has no representation in the Assembly, would be called to the meeting, the chief minister replied: I think the meeting should be broad-based so that several parties can be drafted in. Thats why I will take a final decision tomorrow.        
	He added: The spirit of whatever the Morcha said today after its central committee meeting is good and positive. It is willing to join the meeting, I am told. Thats why I am taking time to consider whether to call the Morcha to the meeting.        
	Earlier, Morcha leader Bimal Gurung had struck a conciliatory note, saying he was willing to attend the meeting.        
	We havent yet got an invitation. There is no harm in attending the meeting but the government should not set preconditions. They should allow us to talk on Gorkhaland, he said. What the chief minister said regarding our press conference was encouraging. Its good that he is inclined to call us.        
	Gurung indicated a softening of stand saying the indefinite hills bandh, which resumes on Saturday, would spare the schools. He said he had written to the Prime Minister, chief minister and the Union home minister, requesting a tripartite meeting.        
	The state government, which has ruled out statehood, is working out more carrots for the Morcha, Writers sources said.        
	We are considering whether more mouzas in the Dooars and Terai regions can be brought under the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, whether more financial powers can be granted, an official said.        
	Earlier, clashes broke out in several places in Siliguri, threatening to take an ethnic turn when the Morchas opponents traded stones with residents of Bhanunagar, a Nepali-dominated colony on the Mahanandas banks.        
	Police burst 30 tear gas shells and drove the mobs away and the administration clamped prohibitory orders in the Siliguri, Pradhannagar and Bhaktinagar police station areas of the city. Nine policemen were injured in the violence during the Amra Bangali bandh, which is effective till 2pm tomorrow.        
	By noon, the Sashastra Seema Bal was carrying out flag marches. Six Central Reserve Police Force companies were to reach Siliguri by tonight.        
	Mobs protesting the Morchas bandh, however, stopped trucks from carrying groceries and vegetables to the hills.        
	Hill affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya appealed for unity and calm and promised: Ill personally ensure that essentials reach the hills.        
	The Left Front will meet on June 14 to discuss the stand to be taken at the all-party meeting, where the government wants to build a consensus against statehood, a CPM leader said. We believe that all parties will talk against statehood. It will help us mount pressure on Gurung.        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi said in a statement that public opinion-makers and the civil society should strive to maintain communal harmony.

										      Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee at his residence early this morning (Thursday).   The meeting held a day after the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) expelled Somnath Chatterjee from the party for refusing to follow the party''s advice regarding resignation from the Speaker's post.  The discussion between the two is still unknown. Jayanti Natarajan, a Congress spokesperson said that Chatterjee''s expulsion would have no bearing on his continuation as Speaker. "Chatterjee does not belong to any party, as he lost his affiliation with his party after being elected Speaker," Natarajan added.

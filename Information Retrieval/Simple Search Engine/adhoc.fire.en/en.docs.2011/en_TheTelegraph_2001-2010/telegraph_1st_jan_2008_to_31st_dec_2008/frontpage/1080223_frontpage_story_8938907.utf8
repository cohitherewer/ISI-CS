  - Friends today, foes tomorrow: how IPL will affect rivalry          G.S. MUDUR AND CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                 
	New Delhi, Feb. 22: Cricket lovers may miss the heady patriotic passion that erupts when Ishant Sharma dismisses Ricky Ponting in an international match, if the young Indian and the Aussie are seen exchanging high-fives while playing for Calcutta, sports psychologists have cautioned.        
	But home and international cricketers handpicked for the Indian Premier League are likely to be able to switch loyalties with ease in a cycle of city-to-nation-to-city after possible teething hiccups, the experts said.        
	Instead of war between two countries, spectators may get to watch the worlds best players in action in a single match, said Sandeep Tiwari, sports science specialist at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Physical Education and Sports Sciences in Delhi.         
	International matches  especially needle encounters like India versus Pakistan or Australia  may lose their edge for spectators because of perceived lack of single-minded loyalty to the nation, they said.              
	From the point of view of spectators, the fun of an India-Pakistan match, for instance, may decline with yesterdays arch rivals becoming best buddies on field today, said Usha Lohan, sports psychologist at Kurukshetra University.        
	Shoaib Akhtar, who has bowled many a hostile bouncer at Sourav Ganguly, will now be playing alongside the southpaw for Shah Rukh Khans Calcutta team.        
	Balancing perceptions of loyalty for an IPL team with national commitments may not be as easy for Indian cricketers as switching between club and nation appears for many footballers, according to cricket historian Ramchandra Guha.         
	Football grew in European cities when they became industrial centres. Football rivalries between cities added to the identity of the city, Guha said. International football, especially the World Cup, came later, only in the 20th century, he said. So in Europe, international commitments are an additional responsibility over club work, he said.         
	Nonetheless, the occasional flare-up does occur.        
	When Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo clashed in an England-Portugal tie at the 2006 World Cup, fans at Manchester United  the English club where both play  were reported to be reconsidering their fondness for the Portuguese player.         
	In India, by contrast, enthusiasts have only seen cricketers play international matches, Guha said. Here, the IPL is the encroacher. It will not be at all easy to play in the IPL without reducing spectator belief in a players national credentials, he said.         
	Gopa Bhardwaj, professor of social psychology at the University of Delhi, said spectators may start viewing players less as national icons and more as commodities of local clubs.         
	The perception stimulated by the new cricket environment could be that the players are doing it for money and not for the country, she said. Such perceptions are likely to lead to a public less tolerant of poor performance.         
	But the cricketers themselves are likely to manage a balance in commitments, the psychologists said. All these players are highly professional  whether they play for a city or for a nation, they will seek to excel. Individual performance is all that they concentrate on, said Parimal Debnath, a professor of physical education and expert in sports psychology at Jadavpur University.        
	Sourav and Andrew Flintoff played alongside for Lancashire, even as they were busy trying to outdo each other in a take-the-shirt-off contest in 2001-02.         
	But doesnt the fact that Sourav remained a darling in India despite playing in the same team as Flintoff show that spectators, too, may accept a switch between local and national loyalties?         
	Not necessarily, said Lohan. In India, county cricket hardly enjoys even a minuscule percentage of the visibility that IPL will. Also, you dont mind if Sourav performs poorly for Lancashire, as long as he succeeds for India, she said. The two commitments are to two different sets of spectators. Its different here.

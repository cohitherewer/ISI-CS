	Bodhbadhan (Vidarbha), March 1: Owning an extra fifth of an acre could become a millstone round Nilesh Aades neck in Maharashtras farmer suicide zone.        
	Yesterday morning, listening to the budget speech on his familys radio set with his two teenage sisters and mother Godavari, the 18-year-old had been over the moon. P. Chidambaram had just announced his historic Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver for farmers.        
	We thought our loan of Rs 40,000 would be waived and we would be saved, Nilesh said.        
	But when he pulled out the familys 7/12 land document (the legal record of their land holdings), it showed their plot was marginally larger than two hectares. The excess area  about 900 square metres  can cost the Aades Rs 30,000 and close their way out of despair.        
	In Chidambarams package, only those owning less than two hectares get a full write-off. The rest receive only a 25 per cent waiver if they are ready to repay the remaining three-fourths of the loan.        
	My land is 5.2 acres. Wont we be eligible for a complete waiver? Nilesh asked, echoing the fears of many in this village, most of whose cotton farmers own just over two hectares.        
	Bodhbadhan, 135km from Nagpur, has 350 households and recorded 18 suicides in the past two years. The count is the highest in Yavatmal district, the epicentre of the crisis, where at least 332 farmers ended their lives last year.        
	The toll across Vidarbha has been 4,000 since 2004, when the United Progressive Alliance came to power, including 146 in this years first two months.        
	At least 95 per cent of the villagers have debts irrespective of how much land each has, said Ganesh Shelke, husband of sarpanch Mangala.        
	The Shelkes own four hectares and have one of the few TV sets in the village. Watching the budget on it, they were shattered. The family has borrowed Rs 65,000 from a cooperative bank, Rs 18,000 from a scheduled bank and Rs 15,000 from a moneylender.        
	Chidambarams waiver helps only if the loan has been taken from a government-backed institution, but most farmers borrow from moneylenders at the start of the sowing season when they need to buy seeds.        
	Those like Shelke, however, will get some more relief after agriculture minister Sharad Pawars statement in Mumbai today. He asked farmers not to repay unauthorised moneylenders. Farmers neednt pay a single paisa to moneylenders lending illegally with no authority or licence, Pawar said.        
	Waiver or no waiver, it doesnt help us. We will work till we die, said Anasuya Devkar, 70, whose son Ramchandra had borrowed Rs 30,000 for daughter Sangeetas wedding in 2003. After the 2004 crop failed, he drank poison.        
	The family received Rs 1 lakh in compensation but, under a bond, Rs 70,000 of it will remain locked in the bank for six years.        
	The Rs 30,000 the Devkars got lasted a very short time. We had borrowed Rs 20,000 from a relative; there was little left after we repaid him, said Ramchandras son Sanjay, 28.        
	Anasuya works as a farm labourer and looks after her 16-year-old granddaughter. I have no money to get her married, she said. The Devkars, too, own a little more than two hectares.         
	If Union minister Mani Shankar Aiyar makes his expected visit tomorrow, the villagers will request him to include them in the waiver scheme. The farmers also have a second demand: raise the minimum support price for cotton from Rs 1,700 a quintal to Rs 3,500.        
	Bodhbadhans high suicide rate had prompted spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar to pay a visit in October 2007. Volunteers taught the villagers how to harvest water. Suicides have not been reported since but the farmers continue to reel under huge loans.        
	Prahlad Phuphare, whose brother Eknath killed himself in 2004, had his best crop since 2002 last year. He, too, owns a little over two hectares.        
	I sold 10 quintals. But my sick wife and two kids need to survive on this money till the next crop. I cant repay my bank loan of Rs 76,000, he said.

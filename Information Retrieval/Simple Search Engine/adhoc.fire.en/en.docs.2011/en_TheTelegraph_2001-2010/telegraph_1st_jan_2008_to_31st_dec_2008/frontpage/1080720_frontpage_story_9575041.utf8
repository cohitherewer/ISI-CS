          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, July 19: A suspected Ulfa militant today walked into the trap laid by Congress leader and Dhubri MP Anwar Hussain in his New Delhi residence.        
	Ramen Baruah of Ulfas 709 battalion called on Hussain at his official residence in the capital to extort money from him.         
	The extortionist had given two demand notes to Hussain which the MP said he had handed over to Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi.         
	Letters addressed to Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav and minister for external affairs Pranab Mukherjee were found in Baruahs car.         
	The arrest of Baruah, who belong to Ulfas 709 battalion led by Hira Sarania, has fuelled speculation that the outfit is trying to bargain support in Assam for the UPA government ahead of Tuesdays crucial trust vote in Parliament.         
	Police found letters with names of Pranab Mukherjee and Mulayam Singh Yadav in his Tata Indica, Hussain told The Telegraph. The letters were said to have been sent to forensic laboratories for investigation.        
	The MP alleged that Baruah had been demanding money from him for the last four months.         
	He kept on threatening Hussain if he failed to shell out the amount.         
	Hussain said he had given Rs 25,000 to Baruah in April because his daughter was getting married and he was afraid of the consequences. In May, Baruah again came and demanded Rs 25 lakh, he said.        
	This was supposed to be the fourth meeting. When he came to my house, I asked my personal assistant to tell him that I was away. I sneaked out of the backdoor and informed police commissioner, Y.S. Dadwal, Hussain said.         
	Baruah, who came to the MPs residence at 3pm, was arrested at 5.45pm. Police, however, remained tight-lipped.         
	Sources said Baruah was jointly interrogated by the police and IB officials till late tonight.        
	The police reached Hussains residence in the evening to get his statement.         
	The public relations officer of the police, Rajan Bhagat, said there was no official reaction.         
	The Ulfa is now under tremendous pressure from security forces as the government has asked its leaders Paresh Baruah and Arabinda Rajkhowa to stay off from jihadi groups in Pakistan

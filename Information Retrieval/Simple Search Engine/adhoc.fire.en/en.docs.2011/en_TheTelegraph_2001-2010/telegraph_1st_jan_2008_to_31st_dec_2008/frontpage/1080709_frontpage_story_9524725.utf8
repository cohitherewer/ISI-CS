          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Imphal, July 8: A day after two schoolboys went missing from Eroisemba in Imphal West district, police today arrested a man who allegedly confessed to neighbours about his involvement in the case.         
	The police said Sorokhaibam Gam Singh, 26, a neighbour of one of the missing boys, was taken into custody this morning after the parents lodged a complaint yesterday.        
	Family members said Yengkhom Naobi Singh, a student of Class IV, and his friend Angom Langamba, a Class III student, went missing after they left home on Sunday afternoon.        
	Ratan Singh, Naobi Singhs elder brother, said when the two boys did not return home till late evening, the families launched a search.         
	They even started a publicity campaign in the area seeking information about the children.         
	The search came to nought but local residents caught Gam Singh last night after he confessed to being involved in the case.         
	We caught him on suspicion of his involvement. When we questioned him, he disclosed that the two boys were taken away by an uncle of Langambas, identified as Samo Singh, Ratan Singh said.        
	Gam Singh was handed over to the police this morning.         
	Before the police took him away, Gam Singh also reportedly confessed to neighbours that he had handed over the boys to Samo Singh in lieu of Rs 5,000 for each boy. It is not clear who paid him the commission.        
	Relatives said an unidentified caller informed Langambas family using Samo Singhs mobile phone today that the two children would be returned soon.         
	Interrogation is on and we are following the clues given by him to trace the children, a police officer said.        
	The police said it could be a case of child trafficking, though it is not common in Manipur.         
	Everything will be known after a thorough interrogation, the officer said.

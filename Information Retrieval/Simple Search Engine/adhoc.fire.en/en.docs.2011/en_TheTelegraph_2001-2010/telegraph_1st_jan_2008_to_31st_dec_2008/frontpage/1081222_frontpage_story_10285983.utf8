  - Campaign against British help to Indian company        AMIT ROY                            Prince Philip gives a ride to the Queen on Sunday in his Land Rover Freelander which stalled on the way to the church on the royal estate Sandringham, Norfolk. The ignition fired normally on the return journey. In the film The Queen, in which Helen Mirren plays the lead, the Queen is shown driving a Land Rover which suffers a broken axle when she drives it into a shallow stream                                        
	London, Dec. 21: Indian rivals of Ratan Tata and Tata Motors are mischief-making by circulating an argument that Jaguar Land Rover is an Indian company which does not deserve help from the British government, sources have said.        
	The allegation is similar to some comments made about the Nano debacle in which it was suggested, not least by Ratan Tata himself, that the companys business rivals did not want Tata Motors to succeed in Singur and aided the opposition in some way.        
	Apparently, some Indian enemies of Ratan Tata, who do not want Tata Motors to succeed in the UK either, are lining up behind the campaign: Why should the British taxpayer bail out an Indian company?        
	Or so it is claimed.        
	Among those putting the counter-argument in powerful support of Jaguar Land Rover is industry expert and Labour peer, Lord (Sushantha Kumar) Bhattacharyya, 68, who was appointed professor of manufacturing systems at the University of Warwick in 1980 and went on to establish the Warwick Manufacturing Group.        
	Today, as a Bengali batting like Sourav Ganguly at his best but for Britain, Bhattacharyya spoke to The Telegraph from his home in the West Midlands.        
	I am supporting Jaguar Land Rover not because it is Indian-owned but because it is a British company and because it is the British economy which is at stake, he declared.        
	It employs 16,000 people directly, another 80,000 in the components and supply chain and 300,000-400,000 in the distribution and garage network.        
	Bhattacharyya, who studied at IIT Kharagpur, where his father had been a professor of chemistry, came to Birmingham where he did an MSc in engineering production and management and a PhD in engineering production.         
	He said he was anxious to correct a misconception about the nature of the financial assistance, which he believed to be $1 billion, that Jaguar Land Rover was seeking: It does want a handout but a loan guarantee for a year to 18 months. It cannot get a loan in the normal way from banks because banks are not giving loans.        
	According to Bhattacharyya, the British government will have to take measures similar to those adopted in America where President George W. Bush stepped in on Friday with a $17.4-billion loan for US car giants Ford, General Motors and Chrysler.         
	Bhattacharyya stressed, however, that unlike the US carmakers, Jaguar Land Rover made products that were profitable and the group had invested heavily in research and development.         
	With Jaguar Land Rover, 85 per cent of its production is exported, he pointed out. In many markets, Jaguar outsells Mercedes. The company has a turnover of 7 billion. The banks are in meltdown, the housing sector is not moving so where will growth come from unless it is from manufacturing? With Land Rover there are also defence implications.        
	The issue is taking on a political colour, with Lord (Peter) Mandelson, the business secretary, telling The Observer: I am closely following the fortunes of Jaguar Land Rover. My officials are in close touch with the company.        
	The government cannot be the first call for help in these circumstances. The companys owners have got to look to themselves and their own resources.

  - Examination of train amp; blood samples were crucial        A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Guwahati, Sept. 22: Forensic experts today expressed doubts on whether they would be able to identify the gas which killed 15 oil thieves on Friday night, saying examination of the railway wagons which were pilfered was very important as were tests on blood samples of the dead.        
	R.P. Gohain, director of the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) here, today said it would have been ideal if forensic experts were called in to examine the railway containers and collect samples to identify the gaseous substance which is suspected to have caused the death of 15 people.        
	The pilferers suffocated to death and several took ill when an attempt to steal oil from a train late on Friday night turned fatal at Saiding in Karbi Anglong district, close to the Assam-Nagaland border.        
	Gohain added that the FSL was yet to receive the organs and viscera of the victims sent from Diphu hospital where the post-mortem on eight of them was carried out. Gohain, who is an expert in toxicology, said, Generally, it is very difficult to pinpoint what gas they had inhaled from the analysis of the viscera.         
	He said they would conduct a host of laboratory tests and analysis like mass spectrometry, chromatographic techniques, ultraviolet spectrophotometry  all very advanced tests done in their state-of-the-art laboratory  to arrive at a conclusion.        
	Another expert in forensic medicine at the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital echoed him, saying, Examination of the railway wagons would have provided some definite clues.        
	The railways had allowed the train, carrying fuel from Numaligarh Refinery to Mughalsarai, to travel the very night of the incident after the pilfered wagons were resealed.        
	The post-mortem on the eight persons had established that inhalation of corrosive gas had led to suffocation and eventual death.        
	The superintendent of Diphu civil hospital, Akhil Chandra Narzary, however, today said it was very difficult to collect blood samples from the bodies of the victims as these had arrived at the hospital long after the deaths had occurred.        
	The blood had clotted by then and it was not possible to collect the samples, he said.        
	Narzary felt examination of tissues of the lungs should be able to establish the nature of chemicals inhaled. Besides, the traces should also be available in the kidneys, liver and stomach, all of which have been sent to the FSL.        
	Asked if blood samples of the two persons who were undergoing treatment at the hospital could help, he said it was highly unlikely.              
	 as the traces would have been washed out by now. Their condition is now stable, he said. Routine blood examination has been carried out but that would not help, he said.        
	Karbi Anglong police today said samples of the liquid collected from the barrels left behind by the thieves have also been sent to the forensic laboratory for examination. Some of the barrels might also be sent to ascertain whether these had contained harmful substances before being used to take away the stolen fuel.        
	The police have seized around 900 such barrels from the incident site.        
	A senior official said investigations have revealed that two persons had boarded the train at Rangapahar station where it had stopped to get an additional locomotive attached to help it negotiate the steeper gradient ahead. Police sources said the duo had perched themselves between two wagons and had brought the train to a stop at the spot  where the fuel heist was planned  by tampering with the vacuum pressure system, which operates the brakes.        
	The sources said those undergoing treatment at Dimapur and Diphu were being interrogated.

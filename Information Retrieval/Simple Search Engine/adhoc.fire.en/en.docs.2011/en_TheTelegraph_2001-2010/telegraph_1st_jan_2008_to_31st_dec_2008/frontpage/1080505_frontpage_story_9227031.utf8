The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Shoaib to play, not this week 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Shoaib to play, not this week 
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              
	May 4: In the lead-up to the Indian Premier League (IPL), Shah Rukh Khan dreamt that Shoaib Akhtar would play the opener, in Bangalore, and take three wickets in the very first over.        
	That remained a dream, but if everything stays on track, Shoaib will reach Calcutta on Tuesday night and join the Kolkata Knight Riders after much drama over the past many weeks.        
	However, Shoaib wont be making his Knight Riders debut at the Eden (where he made such a stunning impact in the 1999 Asian Test Championship) on Thursday.        
	Shoaib wont be considered for the match against the Bangalore Royal Challengers. Hell first have to settle down and could be in contention next Sunday (in Hyderabad), said coach John Buchanan, who is calling the shots in the team.         
	Weve established contact with Shoaib. Weve confirmed that he holds a valid visa for India. According to what he has said, Shoaib should be in Calcutta late on Tuesday, a member of the Knight Riders team management told The Telegraph tonight.        
	Earlier in the day, the appellate tribunal constituted by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) suspended the temperamental fast bowlers five-year ban for a month, allowing him to play for the Shah Rukh-owned Knight Riders.        
	The decision followed a fresh appeal from Shoaib, whod in any case been allowed to play outside Pakistan. The IPL, though, had been firm that he couldnt take the field as long as he was banned.        
	Clearly, the suspension of the ban has worked to everyones advantage, with Shoaib being the biggest beneficiary.        
	The other beneficiaries are actually many: The PCB, its appellate tribunal, Shah Rukh and his Knight Riders and the IPL itself, which is now without the top-rung Australians.        
	Specifically, some of the heat (generated by politicians) is off the PCBs back and the appellate tribunal supremo, Justice (retd) Aftab Farrukh, can tell the world that he allowed Shoaib to earn his livelihood.        
	As for Shah Rukh, its a win-win situation, but Shoaib must first clear the mandatory fitness test, which will be overseen by physio Andrew Leipus.         
	Shoaib hasnt played competitive cricket for months, but its assumed that hes been keeping himself fit.         
	Interest had dipped after the fourth loss in a row, last night, but its unlikely that there will now be an empty seat on Thursday. Shoaib wont be in the XI, but his presence alone is expected to draw many.        
	A reaction from Shah Rukh was awaited, but hed earlier backed Shoaib emotionally and firmly.        
	Left to me, I wouldnt have kept him out of the IPL, but Im not one to fight with them. Ill be strictly guided by what the IPL decides, Shah Rukh had told The Telegraph last month.        
	Typically, Buchanan didnt go overboard over the buzz-creating development. However, its a fact that handling the 32-year-old Shoaib has been a challenge for all coaches whove shared dressing room space with him.        
	Before Shoaib got banned, Buchanan had maintained: Look, in such a diverse group, there are bound to be players with different temperaments.... Shoaib brings pace to the table and thats a key element, particularly in Twenty20 cricket. I dont forsee a problem as long as Shoaib understands his responsibility, the values and the culture of the team.        
	The Knight Riders havent won for a fortnight and poor starts have been the biggest concern. While Shoaib cant be counted upon for much in the batting department (though he has a best of 40s in both Tests and ODIs) his presence in the XI is bound to intimidate the opposition somewhat.        
	After a string of poor performances, Sourav Ganguly and Co. need something to give their campaign wings. Perhaps, they will be looking to soar on the Shoaib-factor.

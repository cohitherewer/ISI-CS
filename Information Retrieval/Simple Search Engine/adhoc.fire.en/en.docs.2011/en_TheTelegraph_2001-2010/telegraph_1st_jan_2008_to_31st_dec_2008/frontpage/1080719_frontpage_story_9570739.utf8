No way, were Indian
          RAHUL BEDI                       India rsquo;s Kanaka Mahalakshmi turns out in T-shirt and shorts for a World Beach Volleyball championship match in Chennai. (Reuters)                          
	New Delhi, July 18: The Indian womens team participating in the World Beach Volleyball tournament has declined to wear bikinis, declaring them objectionable and against their traditions.         
	As a result, the rules, which state that bikinis are the mandatory dress for the contest, have been relaxed and the Indian contingent will now play in T-shirts and shorts.         
	We want to give a good fight in the game and not the dress code, said Kanaka Mahalakshmi, a member of the Indian team, adding that she would rather not play if required to wear a bikini that is the recognised dress code for all international beach volleyball tournaments.         
	A.J. Martin, the local head of the beach volleyball championship staged at the southern port city of Chennai, said the rules permitted a change in the dress code out of respect for the religious, cultural and ethical sentiments of participating countries.         
	Overseas players, however, were sticking to the dress code yesterday and said they hoped the spectators would focus more on their skills rather than their brief attire.         
	Everything is possible in sports to respect culture of different countries. We dont mean to offend anyone. We are here to play the sport, said Zoe Chater of the French team.

	Maybe once they see us, they will be inspired in the future to wear bikinis, she added.         
	Beach volleyballs popularity the world over is attributed in large measure to the sex appeal of the sport stemming from its dress code.         
	But the bikini-only rule has not been popular even in the West, with many women arguing that they should be allowed to wear either tights or shorts.         
	Indian pair Kasi and Kiran yesterday put up a commendable show to stun Israeli duo A. Alokoby and . Alkoby in a hard fought match.         
	Current national champions Pradeep Johan and P. Mohan, however, went down to Dipierro and Van Zwieten of the US in their first match.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Students halt job interview
  - Union members lock up Manipur University gate          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Imphal, Sept. 19: Tribal students today bulldozed Manipur University into indefinitely postponing an interview for recruitment of three lecturers by locking the gate of the administrative block.         
	The Manipur University Tribal Students Union is demanding an increase in the job quota for tribal candidates in the university from the current 7.5 per cent to 31 per cent, the state quota for tribals in government departments.         
	Despite an understanding between the tribal students and the Manipur government to put on hold all recruitments of the university until the issue of tribal reservation is settled, the university decided to go ahead with the interview for three guest lecturers in the history department.         
	Vice-chancellor C. Amuba Singh had fixed today as the date for the interview, ignoring the unions demand to postpone it.         
	Enraged by the plan to hold the interview, nearly 100 tribal students stormed the administrative block, where the vice-chancellors office is located at 9am.         
	They also squatted at the gate. Thirty-one candidates turned up for the interview scheduled for 11am.         
	The students locked the main gate, not allowing any employee to enter, including the vice-chancellor. Police were called, but they failed to persuade the students to open the locked gate.         
	No attempt was made to forcibly evict the students or break open the lock.         
	Left with no alternative, Amuba Singh invited a delegation of the students for talks at the universitys guesthouse.         
	After the meeting, Amuba Singh did not come back to his locked office but sent the dean of social sciences, M. Jitendra Singh, to the students to convey the outcome of the talks.         
	We decided to postpone the interview indefinitely until further orders, Jitendra Singh announced amid clapping by the students.         
	After the announcement, the students broke up, restoring normality in the administrative block around 1pm.         
	Later, the president of the students body, Sonthang Haokip, told reporters that a team comprising chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, education minister L. Jayenta Singh and representatives of the students union would visit New Delhi on September 22 to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and human resource development minister Arjun Singh.         
	The team will request the central leaders to increase the job quota for tribal candidates in the university.         
	Tribals are under-represented here. Of the 170 teachers, only five, two of them guest lecturers, are tribals, Haokip said.         
	Manipur University, being a central one, follows norms laid down by the Centre, which reserves 7.5 per cent of jobs for tribal candidates.         
	Arguing that more than 30 per cent of the population in Manipur belonged to tribal community, the union said reservation in the university should be increased to 31 per cent, which was the norm in state government departments.

	Ranchi, Feb. 19: Big players in the power sector are keen to keep the state capital glowing.         
	The Jharkhand State Electricity Regulatory Commission (JSERC) has received six applications from major corporate houses in the power sector, boosting the uninterrupted electricity wish of consumers here.         
	Torrent Power Company, Calcutta Electricity Supply Corporation, A2Z Power Company, Jamshedpur Utility and Services Company, National Thermal Power Corporation and Built Power  a subsidiary of Crompton Greaves  have shown interest in doing business in the Jharkhand capital.         
	Sources in the JSERC hinted at Tata Power also applying for supplying power here before the deadline for receiving applications on February 29.         
	Jharkhand High Court had ordered the commission on January 9 this year to float tenders inviting bids from private parties for supplying power to the subscribers in the state capital.         
	The court was extremely peeved with the functioning of the JSEB due to its erratic power supply.         
	Jharkhand electricity regulatory commission chairman S.K.F. Kujur claimed in the progress report submitted to the high court recently that the commission had appointed Central Electricity Authority as its consultant for selecting the agency for supplying power to the state capital. The applications would be forwarded to Central Electricity Authority after February 29 and the commission would take a final decision on the matter within three months.         
	The JSERC has also asked the state electricity board to submit the details of its assets in the state capital because the selected agency would need it for chalking out its plans to supply power to the subscribers.         
	After the agency is finalised, the power subscribers in the state capital can expect the private party function professionally, ensuring quality power supply. In case of shortage, the private company can easily purchase power from other sources to maintain the supply, an official of the state electricity regulatory commission said.         
	Moreover, the private party would spend money on maintaining and upgrading its infrastructure to avoid snags.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, May 4: Police officers from Siliguri and Jalpaiguri and some leaders of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today visited Indira Gandhi Maidan, the venue for the partys public meeting on Wednesday, and discussed factors like the positioning of the dais, routes to the ground and security arrangements.        
	Vishal Chetri, the convener of the Terai branch committee of the Morcha, said: We are expecting more than 1 lakh supporters to turn up at the meeting.        
	Jalpaiguri additional superintendent of police Tapas Das said adequate security measures were being taken. Although the ground is on the outskirts of Siliguri, it is located in Jalpaiguri district.        
	Four companies of forces will be deployed at the venue to maintain law and order and avoid any untoward incident during the meeting, Das said. One additional superintendent of police will be in-charge of the entire security arrangement. He would be assisted by four deputy superintendents of police and inspectors from both the districts.        
	The Bhaktinagar truck terminus and the empty space adjacent to Indira Gandhi Maidan have been earmarked as car parks, said Chetri. We have agreed to cooperate with the administration, the Morcha leader added.        
	Yesterday, the administration gave the Morcha permission to hold a public meeting in Siliguri, which has been a long-standing demand of the party. But Morcha leaders have been handed a set of 19 conditions (see chart), which they must meet.

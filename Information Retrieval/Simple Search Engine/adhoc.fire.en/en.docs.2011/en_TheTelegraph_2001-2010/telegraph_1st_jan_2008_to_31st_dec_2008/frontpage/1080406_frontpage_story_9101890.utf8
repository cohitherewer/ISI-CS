          RASHEED KIDWAI                            Jagdeep as Soorma Bhopali in Sholay                                        
	Bhopal, April 5: Madhya Pradesh will hold a competition to find a Soorma Bhopali  after the character from Sholay who brags himself into trouble.        
	Down the ages, the princely state of Bhopal has been home to many raconteurs who didnt let facts come in the way of a good story. There was even a name for them  batole baaz.        
	Shaddan Nawab, famous for his shikar (hunting) stories, was one. A favourite tale of his went like this: Shaddan was once chased by two tigers in the Obaidullahgunj jungles, 50km south of Bhopal. But he had only one bullet and a small knife on him. In one stroke, the nawab threw the knife at a tiger and fired the bullet at the moving knife. The bullet hit the knife and split into two, moved in opposite directions and killed both cats!         
	Batole baazi was also a pastime of the last nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan. On a visit to Bombay, he had wondered aloud if the Arabian sea was bigger than Bhopals bada talab.         
	In Sholay, Jagdeep plays a batole baaz who goes by the name Soorma Bhopali. But Bhopali is caught out when he is in the middle of a story about how two wanted criminals, Jai and Veeru, fell at his feet and begged for pardon when the duo show up in the audience.        
	Between April 19 and 26, when the Bhopal Carnival is held, there will be a search for the biggest brag.         
	Dhruv Narain Singh, the chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation, said the jury would include retired batole baaz and government representatives. We will give winners and participants handsome prizes, Singh said.        
	A verse competition, Char Bait, is also planned. Char Bait  which literally means four lines of poetry  has a senior team member delivering the lines spontaneously and others repeating them loudly.         
	Patia (streetside) chess competitions will be held. In the congested bylanes of Old Bhopal, hundreds of young and old men are seen engrossed in moves and counter-moves. Mostly played under streetlights or dim lamps, these games draw dozens of keen onlookers.

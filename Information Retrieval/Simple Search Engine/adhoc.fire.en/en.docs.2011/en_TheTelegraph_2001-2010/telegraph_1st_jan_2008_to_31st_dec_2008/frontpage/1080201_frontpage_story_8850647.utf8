 - Economic benevolence amp; 
 political role in Book Fair 
    KINSUK BASU AND BISWAJIT ROY
                          
	Calcutta, Jan. 31: Bad economics and subtle politics have caught up with the Book Fair. 
    
	Denied a venue, several regular participants of the fair have started asking questions on the way the annual sale was being carried out.
    
	Opening another flank, dissidents in the Publishers and Booksellers Guild have written directly to CPM state secretary Biman Bose, sports minister Subhas Chakraborty and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.
    
	None of the three has anything to do with selling books  the prime objective behind the fair, though loftier motives such as promotion of reading are now being attributed to it. Neither does the government have anything to do with the guild, an umbrella of private booksellers.
    
	But the dissidents have sought the help of the government and the party to hold an alternative fair at Salt Lake Stadium from February 21, the World Mother Tongue Day.
    
	The economics is as intriguing as the politics.
    
	The guild has been reaping a rich harvest of exemptions from government agencies. The CMC has by its own admission given an exemption that could be valued at Rs 97.25 lakh. 
    
	Given the usual charge, the cost of hiring the Maidan would have been little over a crore, said Faiyaz Ahmed Khan, MMIC (parks and gardens). 
    
	Had the fair taken place, a 500-strong police force would have been spared for the sale, free of cost (see chart). The figures do not include the Rs 70 lakh the CMC spent to spruce up Park Circus Maidan, from which the court evicted the fair. 
    
	Enjoying such benevolence, it is difficult to run up a loss. Back-of-the-envelope calculations show the fair can hope to make a profit of Rs 92.8 lakh in a good year, although a few expenditure heads such as sheds, food for volunteers and transport have not been counted.
    
	But the guild has its own logic.
    
	There is no doubt that the CMC should have charged far more. We have also convinced civic officials why we neednt pay amusement tax because we are a non-profit body engaged in holding book fairs and distributing books to the needy, said Sudhangshu Dey, a member of the guilds executive committee. 
    
	There is no denying we get sops. Thats because we are not here to mint money but to allow book-lovers a place to meet and mingle while offering a platform to a large number of medium and small publishers along with little magazines and artists. 
    
	The publishers are now questioning this theory. 
    
	The rates for stalls have not changed even though the venue has. So what one had to pay when the Maidan was the venue has to be paid even if the fair is shifted to Salt Lake or Park Circus. Yet, no one can raise any question, said Biplob Das of Camp publishing house. 
    
	For a 200sqft stall, a publisher has to pay around Rs 5,000 as fee along with Rs 618 as service tax and another Rs 800 for advertisement. The bills for interior decoration and insurance have to be picked up by the participant.
    
	But asks Ranjit Deb of Indiana Book Store on College Street: Why should one be forced to insure through a representative fixed by the guild? Why should a publisher be forced to pay for the ad in the guilds catalogue?
    
	It is against this backdrop that a few dissidents have approached the party and the government. Sports minister Chakraborty, who holds charge of the Salt Lake stadium, told Bhattacharjee today it would be possible to host the fair if the chief minister wants so. 
    
	The CPM state secretariat is likely to decide where it would be held finally.

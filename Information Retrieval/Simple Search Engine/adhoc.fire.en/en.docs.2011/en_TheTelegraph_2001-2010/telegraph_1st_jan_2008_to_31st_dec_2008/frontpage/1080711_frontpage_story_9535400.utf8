          JAYATI GHOSE                            The Apple 3G iPhone goes on sale on Friday in most nations but could have a limited launch in India in August. (Reuters)                                  
	New Delhi, July 10: Apple 3G iPhone enthusiasts will see only a limited launch of the iconic smartphone in the country next month since India is yet to adopt third-generation mobile services.        
	Service providers Vodafone Essar and Bharti Airtel are ready to roll out the iPhone version 2.0 in August, but the telecom department is yet to declare the guidelines or the manner in which 3G services will be launched.        
	The new iPhone, which goes on sale from Friday in most nations, boasts faster web links and supports third-party applications like games and email. As a handy bonus, 3G also means you can talk on the iPhone and surf the Internet simultaneously, which you could not do before.        
	However, without third-generation services, Indian buyers will not be able to exploit the complete benefits of this long-anticipated 3G iPhone, analysts said.        
	3G services, which allow real-time transactions, video streaming, voice and data services, hold potential for revenue generation for telecom companies.        
	Indias 3G policy is stuck because of a difference of opinion between the telecom ministry and the sector regulator. While telecom minister A. Raja and the finance ministry are keen to open the 3G auction process to all players, telecom regulator Trai wants 3G licences restricted to domestic players.        
	However, the Centre is eager to roll out 3G services by January 2009.        
	Analysts added that with Bharti and Vodafone not planning to subsidise the gadget by bundling it with their chip, it would cost double that offered by AT amp;T in the US, deterring potential customers in India.        
	The 8 gigabyte (GB) version is likely to be priced between Rs 16,000 and Rs 18,000, while the 16 GB would cost Rs 24,000 to Rs 28,000. However, AT amp;T sells the 8 GB iPhone at $199 (Rs 8,000) and the 16 GB at $299 (Rs 11,960) in the US.        
	These are bundled versions that come with an inserted chip and are sold cheaper by the telecom operator since the call rates are higher. The phone is given free by O2 in the UK, while T-Mobile prices it at 1 euro (Rs 67.92) in Germany.        
	AT amp;T, O2 and T-Mobile are bundling iPhones with their services, resulting in cheaper pricing of handsets, analysts explained, adding that in India bundling was not a successful formula.        
	According to a recent Gartner study, the Apple iPhone rose to third position globally in the smartphone category in terms of market share, selling over 1.7 million handsets in nine months.

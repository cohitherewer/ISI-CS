                                Timely honour                            
	New York, April 8 (AP): Thanks to Bob Dylan, rock roll has finally broken through the Pulitzer wall.        
	Dylan, the most acclaimed and influential songwriter of the past half century, who more than anyone brought rock from the streets to the lecture hall, received an honorary Pulitzer Prize yesterday, cited for his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.        
	It was the first time Pulitzer judges, who have long favoured classical music, and, more recently, jazz, awarded an art form once dismissed as barbaric, even subversive.        
	I am in disbelief, Dylan fan and fellow Pulitzer winner Junot Diaz said of Dylans award.        
	Diazs The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, a tragic, but humourous story of desire, politics and violence among Dominicans at home and in the US, won the fiction prize. Diaz, 39, worked for more than a decade on his first novel  I spent most of the time on dead-ends and doubts, he told The Associated Press yesterday  and at one point included a section about Dylan.        
	Bob Dylan was a problem for me, Diaz, who has also published a story collection, Drown, said with a laugh. I had one part that was 40 pages long, the entire chapter was organised around Bob Dylans lyrics over a two year-period (1967-69). By the end of it, I wanted to throttle my like of Bob Dylan.

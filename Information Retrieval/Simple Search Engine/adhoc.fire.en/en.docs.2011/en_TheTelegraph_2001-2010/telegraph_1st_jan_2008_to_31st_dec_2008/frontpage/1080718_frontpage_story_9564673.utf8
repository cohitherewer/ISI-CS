          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                    
	Ranchi, July 17: If Shibu Soren can, why not Babulal Marandi?        
	Sorens predecessor and the states first chief minister today made it clear that he would support the UPA during the July 22 floor test in the Lok Sabha only if he was assured that the alliance would topple Madhu Koda from the states hot seat by Saturday.        
	Marandi, the MP from Koderma, wants both the Congress and RJD to withdraw support to the Koda government. He told The Telegraph that he was ready to review his decision to oppose the vote of confidence if the UPA allies withdrew support from the corrupt Koda government by July 19.        
	The former chief ministers public stand so far had been that he would oppose the vote of confidence along with the UNPA, led by Telgu Desam Party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu.         
	Marandi said that several UPA leaders, including railway minister Lalu Prasad, had got in touch with him to get his support. I told them that it was difficult for him to pitch in for the Congress which was supporting Koda, said Marandi, who floated Jharkhand Vikas Morcha to fight corruption about two years ago. I am ready to review my stand to rid Jharkhand of a corrupt government.        
	The JVM chief said he had also made an appeal to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh not to repeat the 1993 episode in which the JMM had bartered Jharkhand to save the Narasimha Rao government. Instead of repeating the JMM bribery episode, Singh should submit his resignation and live up to his image of an honest politician, he added.        
	Marandi said that the UPA government had been reduced to minority. So it had no mandate to go ahead with the nuclear deal. Instead, the deal should be debated in public and in Parliament, he said.        
	Late last night, Soren rushed to New Delhi to meet Ahmed Patel, the political adviser to Sonia Gandhi. According to a PTI report from Delhi, the JMM chief had gone into hiding soon after landing there. The Congress, apparently, could not establish any contact with Guruji.

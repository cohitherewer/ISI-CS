          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                            Debashish Jana and his eight-year-old son Sanjoy outside a Nandigram hospital where they met after a night of separation enforced by a mob that allegedly stripped and beat up the childs mother.   The Bengal government has launched a probe into the charges levelled against CPM supporters by the woman who eyewitnesses said ran naked for half a kilometre with the mob in pursuit.   Debashish said he saved himself by hiding under a heap of cow-dung cakes. The child said he fell unconscious after being thrashed by the crowd.

	Nandigram, May 6: The day doesnt show the night in Nandigram.         
	Most villages of the 10 gram panchayats under Nandigram I block wear a deserted look during the day  as it should in the scorching heat of the midday sun.         
	As the sun goes down and darkness creeps up, life stirs out of stupor and sneaks out. Many men and some women  almost all Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee (BUPC) supporters  emerge from the shadows, gather in clusters and disappear into the darkness.        
	Now is the time to escape the wrath of the Red Brigade.        
	Soon, hundreds of motorcycle-borne CPM cadres sweep into the villages and begin a door-to-door search. Their targets: the voter identity cards of those foolhardy enough to stay back.        
	This is the simplest way of ensuring that the residents of BUPC-dominated villages do not get a chance to vote in the May 11 panchayat poll here.         
	They ask us to hand over the voter identity cards or face their wrath. We do not have any option but to comply. Those who resist are beaten up with lathis, said Sheikh Suleman, a resident of Garchakraberia, which was once the nerve centre of the BUPC.         
	Suleman said he had handed over his identity card four days ago when CPM supporters came calling.         
	In the run-up to the polls, villagers said, it has become routine for CPM cadres, armed with revolvers, bombs and lathis to parade through Garchakraberia, Sonachura, Maheshpur, Gokulnagar, Adhikaripara, Deaudpur, Satengabari and Ranichowk. These villages were out of bounds for the CPM till the recapture last November.         
	There is a pattern behind the parade. The cadres announce their arrival by firing several rounds in the air and hurling bombs. The message is loud and clear: vote for us or leave the villages.         
	Its a Keshpur-like situation in Nandigram. The motive is not to kill but terrorise villagers so that we do not turn up to cast our votes, said a Gokulnagar resident, too afraid to identify himself. The CPM had prised Keshpur out of the hands of the Trinamul Congress after a campaign of terror.        
	Some villagers alleged that the cadres had forced them to put their thumb impression on blank papers, warning that their land would be taken away if the CPM lost the poll in Nandigram.        
	Jyotindranath Das of Satengabari, who fled with his wife and three sons on Monday night to Nandigram town, is not sure whether he would be able to return to his house before the elections.        
	Das, who has taken shelter in the BDO office in Nandigram, said he had given his thumb impression on a blank paper two days ago but decided to flee the village nevertheless.        
	I have small children in my family, he said. What else can I do but flee even after having given in to all their demands. What if any of the children got hurt?        
	Shantiram Gorai, the block divisional officer of Nandigram 1, said he had sent a letter to the officer in charge of Nandigram police station, Debashis Chakraborty, to ensure the safety and security of the villagers.         
	Once again, it is a war-like situation here and the supporters of the ruling party are employing all tactics to terrorise the villagers. I have done my duty and the onus is now on the police to do the needful and ensure that democracy prevails in this war zone, Gorai said.         
	The CPM, however, denied any wrongdoing on its part. We are trying to maintain peace here, said party leader Ashok Bera, panchayat samity sabhapati of Nandigram I. These BUPC supporters do not want democracy and elections. That is why they are levelling all these allegations against us.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Rebels face little militants
  - Students rally against outfits holding education to ransom          KHELEN THOKCHOM                            Students at the rally in Imphal. (Eastern Projections)                                        
	Imphal, July 5: When Sacred Heart School in Manipurs Thoubal district received an extortion demand from militants a month ago, all it could think of doing was hold a mass prayer and hope for divine intervention.        
	Today one lakh people, mostly students and teachers from 300 schools and colleges, marched through Imphals streets in pouring rain, shedding their fear of the rebels to condemn them for holding the states education system to ransom.        
	The largest-ever students rally in Manipur, whose powerful students bodies have often influenced the course of state politics, climaxed at the Khuman Lampak stadium. Since it could hold only 30,000, the rest swarmed around the sports complex outside.        
	The marchers, who included girls and boys as young as 13, slammed campus politics and corruption, too. But the chief target was never in doubt.        
	The rebels have been threatening the teachers at my school, said Class XI student M. Raju Singh of Imphal, who didnt want his school named. They have ruined the atmosphere. We cant concentrate on our studies; the teachers cant focus on teaching.        
	Armed insurgents have been terrorising schools and colleges across the state, their demands for money prompting many to shut down indefinitely.        
	Some of the targeted institutions have held sporadic protests, but today was the first time they gave one voice to their anger.        
	The participants ranged from small-town schools to the top institutions: the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Central Agriculture University and Manipur University (MU).        
	Y. Mohen Singh, RIMS superintendent, led his team of students and faculty in the march. Three grenades were hurled at my quarters in the past three days. Such incidents affect the teaching process at our institute, he said.        
	On May 25, rebels had exploded a bomb at the institute, closing classes for three days.        
	The call for the rally came from the Democratic Students Alliance of Manipur (Desam), an apolitical organisation working to improve the state of education.        
	Teachers, students and members of citizens organisations arrived in busloads at Thau ground, where the march was flagged off by the additional director of school education, Chaoba Sharma.        
	The programme ended with the rally at the Khuman Lampak, the face of the soccer frenzy six years ago that was said to have brought a lull in militancy for the duration of the Santosh Trophy.        
	The rally comes two days after militants extortion demands prompted a frightened Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Thoubal to close indefinitely, as Little Master English School had done in Imphal in February.        
	Sometimes, the rebels have hit back at protesters. Three days after MU teachers held a sit-in against insurgents, six of them were paraded before the media by the rebels, who accused them of corruption.        
	Which is where the size of todays protest could be important. It will open a new chapter in the states education sector, hoped H. Rajendro, president of the All Manipur Government College Teachers Association.

	Bhubaneswar, May 22: Aditya Birla Group is going to invest Rs 75,000 crore to Rs 80,000 crore in Orissa in the coming years with an eye on aluminium, cement and port sectors, said chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla today.        
	The seventh richest Indian and the eighth youngest Indian billionaire in the world (according to the Fortune magazine), Birla met chief minister Naveen Patnaik at the secretariat today.        
	At the meeting, both ongoing and pipeline projects were discussed.         
	While talking to reporters later, the Birla boss said: We are committed to a larger investment in Orissa as the state is an important investment destination for us. Here we are looking into the aluminium and cement sectors, with telecom, retail and port sectors also in mind.        
	The group at present runs aluminium plants in Rayagada and Sambalpur and has a proposed cement plant in the pipeline at Sundargarh.         
	The chief minister and the Aditya Birla group chief also discussed the proposed Chudamani port in Bhadrak and Birla conceded that the talks were positive.        
	We are also looking into the retail sectors in the state and plan to open outlets within the next six months, said the chairman, explaining that the state outlets would be a part of a national retail chain. Describing todays meeting as fruitful, Birla said he had apprised the chief minister about the progress of the ongoing projects.         
	Recently the Aditya Birla Group faced problems in and around Kashipur alumina plant in Rayagada with displaced families demanding a revised compensation package on the basis of a new state R amp;R policy.         
	We got the plant (earlier owned by Alcan of Canada) only four years ago and complied with the R amp;R package that was presented by the Orissa government in 1992, he said.         
	However we are willing to talk of a reasonable settlement if need be, said Birla, also seeking state co-operation in the matter.        
	Stressing on the groups commitment to corporate social responsibilities, Biral said the group would set up industrial training institutes and health centres in and around project sites.

  - 14-year-old boy drowns in drain at Fatasil Ambari           A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, Aug. 18: A teenaged boy drowned in a roadside drain in Fatasil Ambari this evening, a day after a three-year-old miraculously survived a similar fall on GS Road.        
	Police said Vicky, the 14-year-old son of Segunbari resident Dev Sundar Sharma, failed to make out the drain on the waterlogged road near his house and disappeared into the pool around 5pm.        
	His body was recovered a couple of hours later.        
	He was swept away by the strong current of the water. The body was finally found hundreds of metres away in front of Atul Dyeing Centre near Nipen Bora Path, the police source said.        
	Two mishaps, one of them leading to a death, has jolted the district administration which today blamed the PWD for not taking mandatory precautions while cleaning drains in the city.        
	Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner Prateek Hajela said a PWD team was engaged in cleaning the drains in front of Dona Planet where three-year-old Priyansh Bhansali fell yesterday.        
	Priyansh is undergoing treatment at the paediatric ICU of GNRC Hospitals in Six Mile. Doctors attending to him said his condition is stable and he is recovering.         
	However, he is suffering from chest infection and will require hospitalisation for three to four days, GNRC spokesperson Manoj Deka said.         
	The boy had been out with his mother and other relatives for an evening show at the multiplex in Dona Planet, when he slipped into the open drain.         
	Since the entire area was waterlogged after a heavy downpour, he stepped into a drain. The government must take upthe matter seriously because yesterday it happened to my son, tomorrow it may happen to anybody, said father Vijayendra Bhansali, a resident of Chatribari.        
	Today Guwahati Municipal Corporation (GMC) andGuwahati Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) workers hurriedly covered the portion of the drain where the child fell but in the afternoon a woman slipped into another open drain on the other side of GS Road in the area.         
	The middle-aged woman sustained minor injuries and she was rushed to a nearby clinic.         
	Hajela said there are standing instructions issued by the state government that the areas where the slabs over the drains were removed for cleaning must be properly barricaded by bamboo poles or ribbons to ensure that people do not step on them.         
	The PWD was asked to look into why the standing instructions were not followed at the place where the incident occurred and find out who is responsible for the lapse, the deputy commissioner said.

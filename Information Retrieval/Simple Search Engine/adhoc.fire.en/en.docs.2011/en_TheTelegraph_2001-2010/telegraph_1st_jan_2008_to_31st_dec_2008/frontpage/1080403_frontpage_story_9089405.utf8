          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 2: Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar held another review meeting yesterday with Manipur chief secretary Jarnail Singh, the third one in four months to discuss security.         
	Contrary to speculation that Presidents rule would be imposed in Manipur, the cabinet secretariat denied any such move.         
	A senior Manipur police official conceded that police would be in a better position if central rule was indeed imposed.         
	In the past few days, at least 10 persons have been killed in militant attacks in Manipur. Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh has been under pressure not only from home but also from the UPA government on the deteriorating law and order scenario.         
	Development in Manipur has suffered mainly because of depredation by valley-based militants and the NSCN groups in the hills. Government officials live in guesthouses in Imphal while most Manipur cadre IPS officers are out of the state on deputation.         
	With the district council elections to be held after more than a decade  the Assembly is expected to take a decision on the polls tomorrow  the Centre is ensuring better security.         
	The meeting was to discuss the follow-up action on development schemes, district council polls and security aspects, a senior official in the cabinet secretariat told The Telegraph today.

  -   Harvest of debt waiver for farmers 
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 29: Two crore-plus people will pay less tax, four crore farmers wont repay debts  or wont pay in full  and a four-letter word is on everyones lips. Poll.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram today raised the income tax exemption limit from Rs 110,000 to Rs 150,000. This means if youre a man, you dont pay tax if you earn Rs 150,000 or less a year. If youre a woman, you pay tax only if your income is above Rs 180,000.        
	Chidambaram cited his 1997 budget, where taxes were cut dramatically, to renew his belief in boldness while he announced the bonus for taxpayers.        
	But the real boldness was reserved for three crore small and marginal farmers for whom he announced a loan waiver of Rs 50,000 crore. One crore other farmers will get a 25 per cent waiver of their loans in a one-time settlement costing Rs 10,000 crore.        
	Over 17,000 farmers have committed suicide since this government took charge.         
	Sonia Gandhi called it a revolutionary step, after her party and allied MPs caused a mini-revolution in Parliament with some delighted desk-thumping.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, like his finance minister, dug into history to reincarnate the animal spirits of the economy he had spoken of when he used to sit in Chidambarams chair.         
	Singh said the loan waiver was a very unorthodox response to raise the depressed animal spirits of the farmers, the countrys biggest businessmen.        
	If the finance minister addressed a large constituency with his loan and tax gift, he set lips smacking among 30 lakh-plus central government employees by saying that the sixth pay commission report would be out by March 31.        
	Amid this post-budget ruling party cheer, there was little doubt among pundits and the people  not to speak of politicians of all paths  that polls were round the corner.        
	BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi called the budget an election manifesto.         
	Nine states go to polls this year. Lok Sabha elections are due in the summer of 2009.        
	As the minister announced the write-off with a flourish, Opposition MPs shouted, only to draw jeers of Are you kulaks? from the rival benches.        
	The stock market wasnt smiling either. The sensex dropped 245.76 points to 17578.72.        
	Sunil Mittal, who heads the Confederation of Indian Industry, said: The budget is on expected lines and industry has not been penalised, although we are disappointed corporate tax has not been changed.        
	Sections of industry rejoiced at excise duty cuts that will bring down prices of small cars, two- and three-wheelers and drugs.        
	In another potentially growth-stimulating measure, the general central value-added tax, or cenvat, was reduced from 16 to 14 per cent across the board.        
	The two together were seen as a response to worries about a growth slowdown.        
	At the centre of discussion was, however, the farm loan write-off, the biggest ever. That record has so far stood in the name of Devi Lal who had announced a Rs 10,000-crore farm loan write-off in 1990.        
	Chidambaram did not say in the budget who was going to take the Rs 60,000-crore hit: the government or banks.        
	At the post-budget briefing, he said: Credit me with some intelligence. We have done our homework. We will tell you when we do it.         
	No party criticised the waiver for fear of being painted anti-farmer. L.K. Advani, the leader of the Opposition, picked on the allocation for schemes for the minorities to allege that the budget had heavy communal overtones.        
	One argument against the write-off was that farmers who were killing themselves had borrowed from moneylenders, not banks.        
	For the Congress and its allies, the schemes success or failure will depend on the outcome of the election.        
	But, as Chidambaram himself said, hes a lucky finance minister.

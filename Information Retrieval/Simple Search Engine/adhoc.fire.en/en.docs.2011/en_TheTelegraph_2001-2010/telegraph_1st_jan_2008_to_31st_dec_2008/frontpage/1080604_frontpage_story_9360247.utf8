  - Orissa co-op venture banks on fair price, right quantity           PRIYA ABRAHAM                            Doorstep delivery is pitted against flourishing mall culture                                        
	Bhubaneswar, June 3: It is now a mall versus consumer co-operatives war being waged in Orissa.         
	The otherwise non-flashy Orissa Consumer Co-operative Federation (Bhanjaprabha) has pulled up its socks to reach out to consumers with better quality goods  delivering them right at the doorstep.         
	The federation is now targeting apartment residents, the ones who are more drawn to what the federation president calls the mall culture.         
	The Orissa Consumer Co-operative Federation started in 1979 with an aim to organise a network of retail outlets in important towns and cities in the state to distribute goods at fair prices. Today, it has its chain of stores in 19 districts of the state.         
	The stores have since been playing a significant role in distribution of controlled and essential commodities to people maintaining quality and price.         
	However, of late, with the advent of malls, the Bhanjaprabhas have been facing a crisis with only a few consumers preferring to opt for them.         
	We wanted to break the monopoly of the mall culture, said Golak Mohapatra, the federation president.        
	The air-conditioned atmosphere makes them forget that they are paying a higher price for the goods. Also, outside the malls, big traders fleece gullible customers by charging false rates after creating an artificial scarcity by hoarding goods, he pointed out.         
	According to the federations new plan, each family in a complex will be supplied an index containing the names of essential commodities.                                       
	The consumers would tick on the item they require and put it in a drop box that will be collected by a dedicated van every day. The goods will be supplied at the doorstep in six hours.         
	Besides, the goods will also be made available on call or an SMS made to the help-line number.         
	Mohapatra is sure that the new idea would click. People these days want to save time at any cost. Getting the goods at the doorstep will save them time and energy. Besides, we will charge the correct price for the right quality assurance. People will definitely prefer our services, he said.        
	The service, on an experimental basis, has already begun in 11 apartments in Bhubaneswar and will be soon spreading to other apartments. In six months time we will make our presence felt throughout the state, said a confident Mohapatra.        
	So far, Ashirvad and Gokul Apartments, Satyam Towers, Vishaka Apartment, Ramdharam Palace, Vasant Villa, Shantinivas, Gunjan Palace, Madhukunj Enclave, Swarnalata and Manorama Apartments are subscribing to the facility.         
	There will be one van for each ward in Bhubaneswar. About 700 employees of the federation will be pressed into service to execute this new venture. The federation targets to make a business of Rs 60,000 per van every day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Funds drag on student flow to US
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Funds drag on student flow to US

	New Delhi, Oct. 27: Indian students queuing up for a passage to the US have almost doubled over the past three years of this countrys booming economy, but the ongoing financial crisis may slow down the flow, consultants and counsellors have said.         
	The number of US student visas issued to Indians has leapt from 16,891 in 2004 to 32,652 in 2007, the latest data available with the United States-India Educational Foundation (USIEF) reveals.         
	But the fuel propelling this rapid hike may be running out, and the possibility of a climbdown as steep as the rise cannot be ruled out, counsellors warned.        
	Traditionally dependent on fellowships and scholarships for their studies abroad, Indians are now increasingly riding the countrys economic growth to finance their academic pursuits in the US, senior educational advisers said.         
	Due to Indias booming economy, the affordability has increased. We see a significant number of students opting for US education, irrespective of scholarships or fellowships, Sevanti Narayan, the national educational adviser at the USIEF, said.         
	The affordability for individual candidates apart, the increasing willingness of banks to offer student loans has contributed to the growing queues for student visas, Narayan said.         
	But liberal bank loans and greater affordability have both taken a hit in the financial slump, education counsellors said. Banks were willing to give student loans more than ever before because they were earning returns from the stock markets, too. As losses from the markets pile up, students are already finding it harder to obtain study loans, education counsellor Amit Raghav said.         
	Raghav said at least 12 students, who approached him since the start of October, have complained that they were denied student loans by banks that cited the economic slowdown as the reason.         
	The jump in student visas issued by the US to Indians from 2004 to 2007 (see chart) coincided with the sharpest climb in growth parameters of the Indian economy.         
	The sensex ended 2004 at just over 6600 points, but had crossed 9000 by the end of 2005. By February 2006, the five-digit mark  10000 points  was breached, and by the end of the year, the sensex had covered another 4000 points. The index crashed through the 20000 barrier by the end of 2007, and reached 21000 last January.         
	But if the hike was steep, the fall has been steeper, with the sensex now struggling to stay above 9000 points.         
	 The rise in students seeking visas to the US followed the fortunes on Dalal Street as the markets surged. The fear is that as the markets collapse, this trend will reverse, Shruti Seth, a Pune-based counsellor, said. A rising rupee-to-dollar ratio will also hurt students, she said.

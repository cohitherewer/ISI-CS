          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Sept. 28: The Special Branch has recommended names of about 60 extremists to the state home department for announcing cash prizes to people providing vital clues for their arrest.         
	The award would be given to people, policemen and chowkidars, among others, providing information about the extremists whereabouts.         
	Of the 60 names recommended, only one is of a woman. A cash award of Rs 2 lakh has been recommended as prize for helping police arrest sub-zonal commander Sarita, whose permanent house is in Simaria under Chatra district.         
	Peoples Liberation Front of India chief Dinesh Gope could soon carry a cash prize of Rs 5 lakh on his head. Following Gope are CPI(Maoist) zonal commanders Moti Singh Munda, Chhote Sarkar, Shushil Singh, Mahadev Singh Munda and Trilochan Singh Munda. All these CPI(Maoist) activists might soon carry a cash award of Rs 4 lakh each on their heads.         
	These rebel leaders are active in Tamar area of Ranchi.         
	The list also includes names of many sub-zonal commanders active in Gumla, Chatra, Lohardaga, Latehar and Hazaribagh districts, against whom cash awards ranging between Rs 1.5 and Rs 3 lakh have been recommended.         
	Additional director-general of police, Special Branch, Rajeev Kumar said that they have forwarded the recommendation to the state home department and it has to take a final decision on the matter.         
	A home department source told The Telegraph that state government would take a decision on the recommendation of the Special Branch soon.         
	Announcing cash awards will help the police in nabbing extremists and other criminals. The state police was successful in nabbing Birbalji, a regional committee member of CPI(Maoist), after a cash award was announced for helping the police arrest the dreaded extremist, said Kumar.        
	The CPI(Maoist) still reigns supreme among rebel outfits in 65 to 70 per cent areas, revealed a report sent by the states Special Branch to the home department today.         
	The Peoples Liberation Front has replaced Tritiyo Sammelan Prastuti Committee in terms of extremist-related activities, said Kumar.         
	Compared to last year, activities of the front have increased manifold, that too in areas surrounding the state capital. After CPI(Maoist), the front holds the second position in terms of perpetrating fear among people, Kumar told The Telegraph.         
	Police sources said the breakaway factions of the CPI(Maoist) had made their task harder.

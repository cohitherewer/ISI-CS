	The ban on jallikattu  lifted at the last minute  resulted in a three-fold jump in injuries this year.
    
	Spectators came in droves to Palamedu, near Madurai, for the opening fight (AP picture on right), their interest revived by the Supreme Court ban that was relaxed for Pongal on Tuesday.
    
	At least 84 men  participants and spectators  were injured, police sources said. Usually, 25-30 are wounded. Sixteen are in hospital, but the injuries are not life threatening, they said. No bull was hurt. 
    
	The court had allowed jallikattu, a sport it had described as barbaric  where a man grabs a bulls hump and must hold on till it crosses a fixed distance  on the condition that the government would ensure there were no injuries. The police blamed the high casualties on the crowd surge.

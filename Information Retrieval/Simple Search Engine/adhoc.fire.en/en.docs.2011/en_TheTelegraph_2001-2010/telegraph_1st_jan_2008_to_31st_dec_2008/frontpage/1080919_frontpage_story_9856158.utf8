	Patna, Sept. 18: An advocate and four others were today found guilty of murdering Papia Ghosh, a professor of history in Patna University, in 2006.        
	The court will pronounce the quantum of punishment tomorrow.         
	The 53-year-old unmarried professor, a well-known name in the states academia, was stabbed to death along with her 75-year-old maid Malti Devi at her Pataliputra house here on December 3, 2006.        
	The next day, an FIR was lodged in the case which had sent shock waves through the states academic circles and the police quickly embarked on the exercise to pick up offenders who had perpetrated the twin murders.        
	The fast-track court judge, Omprakash, held advocate Ramchandra Mahto guilty under Section 414 of the Indian Penal Code while Shankar Sahu, Manohar Kumar, Asish Kumar Roy and Anil Oraon under Sections 396 and 412 of the IPC. While Section 414 deals with the recovery of the stolen goods and conspiracy, Sections 396 and 412 deal with dacoity and murder and concealment of stolen goods.        
	The police, investigating the case directly under the supervision of then inspector-general (Patna) Rajyawardhan Sharma, had recovered a computer, TV and several other material stolen from Papias home from the possession of advocate Mahto.        
	While pronouncing the order, Omprakash said that Mahto was in the know of the things. The police had also recovered the stolen goods from Papias house from the possession of other four accused persons which eventually led to their arrest and pronouncement of the guilt today.        
	Papias sisters  Delhi-based IAS officer Tuktuk and Kario-based Keya Sena  had rushed to Patna, joining intellectuals here to write letters to the President, Prime Minister and chief minister asking for a proper investigation.        
	Papias house was raided in the midnight on December 3 and she and her maid were found stabbed next morning. The criminals also decamped with her TV, computer, cash, jewellery, utensils among others.

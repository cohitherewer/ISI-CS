          OUR BUREAU                            Gopalkrishna Gandhi                                  
	Calcutta, May 6: From Eden Gardens, darkness will spread to Raj Bhavan, but this time by invitation.        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi will observe a two-hour voluntary power cut at the palatial bungalow from tomorrow, apparently keeping in mind the outages that have become a part of daily life in the city and elsewhere.         
	This decision follows the governors view that Raj Bhavan need not be an exception to the citys electricity supply situation, a statement said, without describing what the situation is. The voluntary power cut would be reviewed as and when necessary, it added.        
	The statement suggests the governors objective is to share the inconvenience of other Calcuttans, rather than indulge in Gandhigiri, a form of friendly protest.        
	But the governors voluntary gesture is certain to have the involuntary fallout of embarrassing the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government that is still licking the wounds of the Eden blackout a little over a fortnight ago.        
	The state government and the CPM reacted with dismay and derision.        
	The governors decision will send a wrong message to the people, particularly when it does not match reality. Over the past few days, the power supply situation in the state has improved, said power minister Mrinal Banerjee.        
	CPM state secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty opted for sarcasm. It is an exemplary move. In view of the price rise, it is increasingly becoming difficult for many people to afford a square meal a day. So, we will wait for the governor to skip a meal or attend inaugurations travelling by bus, the CPM leader said.        
	Raj Bhavan sources said the staff would switch off all fans, lights and air-conditioners for two hours every day. The switch-off time has not been set yet.        
	CESC sources said the power line to Raj Bhavan was special and free from loadshedding. Raj Bhavan has a connected load of 700 kilowatts as against the 2 kilowatts of a two-bedroom flat.        
	The power minister said he did not know why the governor had decided to go without power. If there is a cable fault in Tollygunge or Jadavpur, it will not be possible to take the power meant for Raj Bhavan to those places, Banerjee said.         
	He said the demand for power had gone up this year by several hundred megawatts but capacity could not be stepped up because of technical reasons. Norwesters, too, had added to the disruptions, he said.        
	The government had an earlier run-in with the governor over Nandigram which, coincidentally, is back on the boil again.

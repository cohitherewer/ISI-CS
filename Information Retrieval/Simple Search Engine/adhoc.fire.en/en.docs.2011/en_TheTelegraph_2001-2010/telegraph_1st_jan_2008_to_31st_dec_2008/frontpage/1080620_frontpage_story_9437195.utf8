	Dhanbad, June 19: Jharkhands record in implementing the UPA governments flagship rural job scheme has been dismal. But there are signs of hope, ironically from Maoist-hit areas of Dhanbad district, where the forest department has met with appreciable success in launching the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS).         
	Palma and Nawada villages on the Dhanbad-Giridih border with around 150 families in each have responded well to forest officials efforts.         
	So far, 95 job cards have been distributed to villagers who are working on building an irrigation canal and check dams that could end their perennial water crisis.        
	Its an encouraging beginning, given that the villages are in Tundi block, a known Maoist bastion where both poverty and unemployment are embedded in their cruellest form.         
	According to divisional forest officer Sanjeev Kumar, both villages have long suffered due to lack of water. Given its peculiar geography, Palma cannot retain the water it gets during monsoon. Nawada has no water source. Hence, there is no scope for irrigation.         
	To get out of this mess and help themselves, they have now been involved in building an irrigation canal in Palma and check dams in Nawada under NREGS, Kumar explained.         
	The canal is worth Rs 2.7 lakh, while the check dams will come up for Rs 9 lakh. So far, the forest department  the implementing agency  has distributed 55 job cards in Palma and 40 in Nawada.         
	The forest department believes an irrigation canal will pave the way for cultivation of 75 to 100 acres in Palma.         
	The department has also chalked out a plantation programme. We plan to plant Siddha trees for cocoon culture, another programme under the scheme, the DFO said.         
	Budhan Tudu (38), who planted mustard seeds last year, is happy about the check dams coming up in Nawada.         
	The well closest from my plantation is one and-a-half kilometers away. It was a tedious job to fetch water everyday. The check dam will surely help, said the villager who is among the many eager participants of NREGS.         
	Yesterday, none other than the schemes primary architect, Jean Drze, dubbed Jharkhand worst among states in the implementation of NREGS while he was conducting a public hearing in Koderma.        
	But forest officials in Dhanbad seem determined to undo the damage. For, apart from creating agricultural facilities, the forest department is also planning spend Rs 3 crore to build at least 90km of grade I and grade II roads under NREGS.         
	The department has set a target of March 2009 for completing the work under NREGS, Kumar said.

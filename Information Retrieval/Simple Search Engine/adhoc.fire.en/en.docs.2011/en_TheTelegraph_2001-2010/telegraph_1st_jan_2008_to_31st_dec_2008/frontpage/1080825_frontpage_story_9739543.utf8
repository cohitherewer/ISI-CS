	Beijing, Aug. 24 (PTI): Nepali Prime Minister Prachanda today vowed to continue supporting China on Tibet and won promises of every possible help for his countrys development.        
	Prachanda was given a red-carpet welcome when he arrived last night in the Chinese capital on his first trip overseas after being sworn in on August 18.         
	By flying to Beijing, the Maoist Prime Minister has departed from tradition  in the past, India would be the first port of call for most top Nepali leaders.        
	The promises of help for Nepals development and stability came during separate meetings Prachanda held with Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao.         
	Hu thanked Kathmandu for its support on Tibet and described China and Nepal as good neighbours, good friends and good partners.         
	Mr Prime Minister has come to the Beijing Olympics closing ceremony a week after being sworn in. This demonstrates the great attention Nepal attaches to relations with China and its friendship with the Chinese people, he said.        
	He welcomed Prachanda to the closing ceremony and thanked him for Kathmandus support to the Games. The Nepali leader returned the compliments, saying the Nepalese felt proud for the Chinese.         
	Prachanda also assured the President his country would stick to its one-China policy and never allow activity detrimental to Beijings interests in Nepal.        
	He described China as a reliable friend, saying Nepal expected more help to achieve permanent peace and economic development, the official Xinhua news agency said. Nepal was willing to cement the co-operation and take bilateral ties to a new high, he added.        
	The Chinese government is ready to continue providing every possible help in Nepals economic and social development and to promote the long-term development of neighbourly partnership, Hu responded.        
	The two countries should maintain close communication and co-operation to contribute to regional peace, stability and prosperity, the general secretary of the Communist Party of China added.        
	Beijing respects the social system and path of development chosen independently by the Nepalese people and supports their efforts in safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity, Hu said.        
	Tibet also came up during the talks with Prime Minister Wen. Prachanda repeated that Nepal would always support Chinas efforts to maintain territorial integrity. The allusion was also in part to Taiwan.         
	Wen said he believed Nepal would achieve political stability and economic development through the joint efforts of all political parties under Prachandas leadership.        
	Prachanda said the friendship between China and Nepal had endured the test of time.         
	Historic changes were taking place in Nepal, he added, with the government and the people striving for stability and economic development, and sought Chinas support.        
	Prachanda is accompanied by information minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara and senior officials on the five-day visit.

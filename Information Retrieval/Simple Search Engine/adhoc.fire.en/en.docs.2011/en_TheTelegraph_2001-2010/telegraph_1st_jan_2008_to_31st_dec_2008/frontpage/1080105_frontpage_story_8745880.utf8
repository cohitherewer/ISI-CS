	Mumbai, Jan. 4: A suburban apartment building squirmed in shame a day after 14 middle-class youths were arrested for the Juhu beach New Year molestation.        
	The Ville Parle Siddhivinayak Society, where nine of the accused live, today defended its own saying the boys had just been in the crowd  or that they were actually trying to save the two victims. But the sense of shame was palpable.        
	Children, just back from school, rushed towards the lift to the security of their homes. Their elders, heads bowed, moved in and out without a word to one another.        
	All 14 boys had surrendered last night, prompted by their elders after the media carried pictures of some of them at the molestation scene, clicked by two news photographers.        
	The Society, located in a middle-class neighbourhood, had celebrated the New Year on its premises like every year. From there, nine young residents had headed for the Juhu beach with five friends.        
	All these kids belong to good families. They said they went towards the scene of molestation only when they heard commotion from that direction, said resident Mohan Jadav, president of Bal Mitra Mandal, a local club that organises Ganeshotsav. Thirteen of the accused are members of the club.        
	They were pushed around and got trapped. Their pictures were clicked at that point of time. They didnt molest anyone, Jadav claimed.        
	Instead of nabbing the real culprits, they are making scapegoats of these kids. I took these kids to the police station myself when I saw pictures of two of them in the papers. I thought if I explained the situation to the cops, everything would be fine. But things have got worse for them.        
	A city court today granted bail to all the 14 on a surety of Rs 10,000 each. But some formalities remain and they are likely to be freed only on Monday.        
	All 14 claim they are innocent but the police say the pictures show four of the accused.         
	The photographers said some four or five youths had attacked the women while a crowd of 80 watched; the victims said the spectators numbered about 50.        
	Among the earliest to surrender were Nilesh Bhagatkar and Sandeep Shukla, both 19. Nilesh, a first-year college student, figures prominently in the pictures. Sandeep, a mobile sales executive, lives in Kandivali and had been part of the group.        
	Sandeeps cousin Ravindra Shukla, 26, a college dropout and a Society resident, gave himself up later. He works in his uncles sandwich shop in Ville Parle.        
	My son tried his best to save those girls. We let him go to the police station because everyone asked us to. His picture was on all the channels and we thought it wise to tell the police his side of the story, said Nileshs mother Manisha.        
	Nileshs father does painting jobs. The boy has a brother and two sisters.        
	The mother of Sandeep and Manoj Panchal, aged 19 and 21, said: I dont know anything, dont disturb me. My children just went out with their friends that day.        
	She ignored the incessantly ringing telephone at her coconut-and-newspaper stall in the neighbourhood and kept peeling one coconut after the other.        
	The Jadhav family stayed glued to their TV set. Kunal Jadhav, 20, who works in a private firm, and his brother Derek, 19, a photographer, are among the arrested.        
	They had never seen the inside of a police station before. This was the first time they had gone out of the neighbourhood to celebrate New Year. They are good people, said a teary-eyed Rosario Fernandez, a friend and Society resident who skipped the party to go to church.        
	The Society plans a news conference on Monday to tell its side of the story with all the 14 present.        
	The prosecution had sought the youths remand for an identification parade but the court granted bail when the defence said the accused were not hardened criminals and would co-operate with the investigation.        
	The police say they are still identifying witnesses for the ID parade and hope to get the victims statements. The main accused, the man in a white T-shirt with a red shirt underneath, is yet to be identified.

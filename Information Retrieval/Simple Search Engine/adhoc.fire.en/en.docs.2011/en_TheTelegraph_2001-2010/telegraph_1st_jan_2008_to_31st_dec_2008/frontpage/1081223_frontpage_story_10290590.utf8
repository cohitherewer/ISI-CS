	Ranchi, Dec. 22: The state election commission today deferred the Tamar by-election to January 5 and the counting of votes to January 8  giving more time for campaigns.         
	Earlier, the election and counting were scheduled to be held on December 29 and January 2, respectively.        
	Chief electoral officer (CEO) Debashish Gupta told The Telegraph that the dates were deferred as it was becoming difficult to mobilise central paramilitary forces.         
	By-elections are being held in other states, too, where paramilitary forces are also required, he said.        
	By-elections to seven Assembly seats in Karnataka, three in Bengal and one in Manipur are also scheduled on December 27. A by-election for an Assembly segment in Tamil Nadu is also slated on January 9.         
	According to sources, the commission took the delay call after a Union home ministry meeting.         
	Political observers responded to the situation stating that the delay would help Soren, who is struggling to establish his identity on new turf. Since 85 per cent of Tamar is red-hit, some 25-30 companies of paramilitary forces would be required for a fair elections, an EC source said.        
	Deputy inspector-general (CRPF) Alok Raj said out of 36 companies deployed in the state, 12 have been deployed for anti-rebel operations in Tamar. We have not received any official communiqu to release them for electoral purposes, he said.

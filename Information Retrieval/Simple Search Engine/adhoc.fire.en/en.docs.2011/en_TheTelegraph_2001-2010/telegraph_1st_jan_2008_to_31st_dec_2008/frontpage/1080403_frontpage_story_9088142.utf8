                                                                                                           Ministers pitch for local jobs
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 2: The Orissa government today asked corporate houses, who are investing into the Kalinganagar industrial complex, Jajpur, to employ states youths on a priority basis in the wake of allegations that a number of outsiders were being engaged in the projects.         
	Orissa industries minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan, who reviewed the projects progress in Kalinganagar industrial complex today, said reports reaching his office claimed a large number of outsiders were being engaged in non-technical posts (driver, helper and cleaner).         
	Harichandan added he had directed representatives of the industries concerned to prioritise on employing local youths when recruiting for non-technical and skilled posts. The project people have also been asked to absorb the states skilled people before looking for experts from outside, he said.        
	The minister said company representatives explained they had engaged skilled workers and technical personnel from outside the state while the construction work was still on. Once the plants are commissioned and the projects are nearly complete, the officials have assured me, local youngsters would be given preference, he added.         
	In an official review it was seen that out of 2,642 people employed in technical jobs, 855 were from outside the state. Also, while outsourcing jobs, 1,613 people (935 technical and 678 non-technical personnel) from outside the state were engaged in the Kalinganagar complex area.         
	Harichandan also warned the companies of fake certificates and informed all those assembled of how his office had detected forged documents submitted by workers from outside the state. The certificates were later cancelled.         
	The meeting also discussed issues relating to land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement and infrastructure. The parties also discussed the 13,086-acre private and government land that had been acquired by state-owned Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation for the Kalinganagar industrial complex. Tata Steel, Jindal Stainless, Nilachal Ispat Nigam, Mideast Integrated Steel and Visa Steel are some of the companies that have a stake in the complex.

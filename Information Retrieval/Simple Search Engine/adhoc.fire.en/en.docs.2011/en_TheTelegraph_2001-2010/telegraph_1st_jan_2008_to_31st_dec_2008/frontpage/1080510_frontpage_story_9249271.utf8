          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, May 9: Its four months since the Centre has sanctioned Rs 200 crore, but the Jharkhand government is yet to even invite tenders for over 8,000 houses for urban poor, leave alone constructing them.        
	The government is supposed to complete the projects under the scheme within 15-18 months of sanction of amount from the Centre. Otherwise, the onus of cost-escalation of building material involved lies with the state government that has to spend amount from its own kitty, said D.S. Negi, the officer on special duty of JNNURM at the Union ministry of housing and urban poverty alleviation.        
	The state urban development department has been unable to invite tender for the project despite the Centre sanctioning Rs 200 crore under Basic Services to Urban Poor scheme in January this year and thereafter releasing a fund of Rs 50 crore to the state.         
	The scheme is part of JNNURMs sub-mission II for which the government had submitted a detailed project report (DPR) to the Centre. The same was consequently given approval for Ranchi and Dhanbad. Similar DPR for Jamshedpur got stuck as the matter of municipal corporation formation in the steel city hangs in balance with the Supreme Court.         
	This is not for the first time that the state government is lacking in terms of reaping the benefits under the ambitious JNNURM. It is already two years behind 60 cities across the country  total 63 cities are covered under JNNURM  when it comes to benefit in improving urban infrastructure and governance, the main agenda of JNNURM under sub-mission I.        
	We are still reviewing the DPRs being prepared for improving water supply, integrated traffic management (that would include construction of flyovers), preservation of water bodies, solid waste management, sewerage and drainage system among others. They will be sent to Centre after a clearance from the state government, said J.P. Singh, joint secretary at the state urban development department.        
	Today, during a meeting chaired by departmental secretary Shailesh Kumar Singh, authorities reviewed the progress of JNNURM in the state. Singh directed the authorities to invite tender for BSUP schemes.

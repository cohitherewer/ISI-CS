	Calcutta, Sept. 24: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government may reason with the Tatas one more time and request them to assess the ground reality elsewhere in the country before exercising the pullout option.        
	The CPM leadership is believed to be in favour of such an approach by the government. The party, more or less resigned to a Tata pullout and willing to look at post-Singur political options, is expected to place the suggestion before the government in a day or two.        
	The CPM feels that the government should anchor its renewed appeal on the premise that unrest over land is not unique to Bengal but is sprouting across the country. They (the Tatas) may be requested to look at the situation in its entirety and stick with the government for a while, a party official said.         
	However, senior officials were crestfallen after Mamata Banerjee emerged from a meeting with the governor and announced that she would continue with the protest.        
	Mamata tempered the threat with a rider that she would decelerate her programmes to let people celebrate the Pujas and accommodate her mothers wish that she give herself a break from the punishing business of launching campaigns.        
	I shall address the issue of relaunching the Singur siege only after Diwali (October 28). But we shall carry on other political activities like street-corner meetings and processions in Bengal, an aide quoted Mamata as saying. A procession will proceed from Moulali to Esplanade at 3.30pm tomorrow, and a rally will be held in Singur on Friday.        
	But ministers and officials sounded unconvinced. I do not see this project happening now, said a minister. Only a miracle can save the situation.

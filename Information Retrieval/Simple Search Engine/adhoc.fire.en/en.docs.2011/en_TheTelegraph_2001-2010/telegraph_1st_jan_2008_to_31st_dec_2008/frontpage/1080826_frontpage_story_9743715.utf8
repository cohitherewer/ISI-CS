The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Singh vows to protect Majuli
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Singh vows to protect Majuli
          RIPUNJOY DAS                                    
	Jorhat, Aug. 25: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today vowed to protect Majuli both geographically and culturally at any cost. The river island, which is reeling under unprecedented floods, however, observed a black day in protest against Singh not visiting it.        
	Singh met the 24 satradhikars (heads of Vaishnavite monasteries) of Majuli during a 20-minute exclusive meeting here and assured them that funds will be not be a constraint and the government would do all that was required to get the World Heritage Site tag for the island.         
	The meeting was scheduled for Majuli, but had to be held here because the Prime Ministers helicopter could not land on the island. He also had to cancel his plan of undertaking an aerial survey of the island because of bad weather.        
	The satradhikars, who submitted a memorandum to Singh, appeared satisfied with his assurance of not allowing Majuli to erode any further. The Prime Ministers assurance carries more weight as it (his sincerity) was reflected in his tone. We hope the government will keep its word this time, one of them said.        
	Singhs meeting with the satradhikars was held inside an air-conditioned room put up behind the main sprawling pandal at Court Field, where a symbolic foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Rs 160.64-crore Jorhat Medical College was held.         
	Singhs commitment of central help to the satradhikars and for the state-of-the-art medical institution in this Upper Assam town helped lift the spirits of the thousands who had gathered here for the hour-long meeting despite a heavy downpour this morning. Dressed in a blue turban and waistcoat, Singh praised chief minister Tarun Gogoi and health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. He unveiled a model of the Jorhat Medical College at the venue.        
	The Prime Minister also articulated the problem of flood and Majuli in his speech that was read out in absentia in Nagaon where the public meeting had to be cancelled because of bad weather.        
	Majuli, however, felt the Prime Minister should have visited the island to see the misery of the people. He had promised to visit the island, but he failed. If he can come to Jorhat, why not Majuli? questioned Durlav Bhuyan, an AASU leader of the island.         
	Hundreds of AASU activists observed a three-hour sit-in at Garmuh, one of the few places in Majuli not submerged under water, and covered their faces with black cloth as a mark of protest. The AJYCP hoisted black flags.        
	Having fulfilled his commitments in Jorhat, the Prime Minister came to Guwahati where the water resources department made a PowerPoint presentation on the flood and erosion problem in the state at Raj Bhavan this evening. Later, the council of ministers submitted a memorandum to Singh.         
	A PCC delegation met Singh, but delegates of the AUDF, the AGP, the BJP and the Jamiat-Ulema-i-Hind (Assam branch), left without meeting him.         
	Leader of Opposition Chandramohan Patowary told The Telegraph that they decided to leave after waiting till 7.10pm for the 5.30pm meeting.         
	While we were kept waiting, he was meeting industry people. This only reflects the kind of seriousness the Centre has about solving the problem of the state, he said.         
	BJP spokesperson Charan Deka said they left because of the alleged indifferent attitude of the Prime Minister.         
	In the evening, the Prime Ministers wife attended the wedding of the youngest daughter of Congress leaders Devananda and Nibha Konwar, sources said.

  - In lightning Torres lies Spains big hope          KEIR RADNEDGE IN VIENNA                                    
	The Germans are favourites to re-establish command of their continent when they take on the Spaniards in the Euro 2008 final here in Vienna on Sunday.                    
	Thunder growled around the stadiums like a drum roll on both Wednesday and Thursday to hail the two nations progress when Germany dramatically defeated Turkey 3-2 and then Spain decisively beat Russia 3-0 to set up only their eighth competitive meeting.        
	The final promises a marvellous contrast of styles between two of Europes major nations  albeit Spain has traditionally, mystifyingly, disappointed at major tournaments and is competing in its first final after, remarkably, 24 years.        
	That was back in 1984 when it lost 0-2 to host France; and its fans have to think a further 20 years back to recall a Spanish victory. Then, in Madrid, Spain had defeated the Soviet Union 2-1 in the final to claim the nations only major prize.        
	Of course we can win this trophy again, says veteran manager Luis Aragones, at 71 the oldest boss here. But we can also lose. This is football. There is a fine line between winning and losing and, at this very highest level, the line is almost indecipherable.        
	Germany carries the burden of greater expectations. The nation has won the World Cup three times and also the European title a record three times  most recently, however, back in 1996. Since then, the German national team has vacillated between the excellent and the awful and only in the last couple of years has it regained its traditional consistency.        
	Manager Joachim Loew had always set reaching the final  not winning it, note  as his expectation and he has delivered. Now he is expected to go one step further.        
	The Germans were the pre-tournament favourites, partly thanks to the promise of their performance in the 2006 World Cup.         
	Jurgen Klinsmann then stepped down as manager but Loew has maintained and developed the root-and-branch revolution that Klinsi launched.        
	The Germans opening thrashing of Poland appeared more impressive than it was; Poland turned out to be one of the weakest teams at the finals. Then the Germans lost against Croatia and had to scrap their way past Austria to reach the knockout stages.        
	Against Portugal, however, Loew changed personnel and tactics. He dropped the badly under-performing Stuttgart striker Mario Gomez and reorganised tactically with two defensive midfielders supporting two wide men and Michael Ballack in the centre.        
	Ballack  who has an awful record of losing finals  then looked a different player. Indeed, if Germany wins the final, he may deserve to be hailed as the tournaments most influential player. Either him or Lukas Podolski, the Bayern Munich striker who has been a revelation in a left-wing role which has provided him with a little time and space from which to make the most of his pace.        
	The question marks over the Germans concern their fast-fading veteran goalkeeper Jens Lehmann and the lack of pace of centre backs Per Mertesacker and Christoph Metzelder.        
	This is the area in which the outcome could be decided because Spain possesses, in Liverpools Fernando Torres, one of the most frighteningly quick centre forwards in the tournament.        
	Torres scored 24 goals for Liverpool in the English Premier League last season, a record for a foreign player in his first season.        
	He missed two or three golden opportunities against Russia in the semi-final on Thursday and was hauled off early by Aragones. But it is hard to believe he will again play below par when the chips are down against Germany in the final.        
	Spain has an outstanding goalkeeper in Iker Casillas  the best in the world after Italys Gigi Buffon  but is stronger on the right of defence with the lightning-quick Sergio Ramos and energetic Carles Puyol than on the left where Carlos Marchena and Joan Capdevila may struggle to restrict Miroslav Klose and the aggressive Bastian Schweinsteiger.        
	A decisive role could then fall to Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, an influential substitute against Russia after injury to the tournaments four-goal top-scorer.        
	David Villas injury means he will miss the final but, if that means Fabregas starts at last and thus strengthens Spain midfield in confronting Ballack, it could prove a blessing in disguise.              
	Likely teams        
	Germany: Lehmann; Friedrich, Mertesacker, Metzelder, Lahm; Rolfes, Hitzlsperger, Schweinsteiger, Ballack, Podolski; Klose.        
	Spain: Casillas; Sergio Ramos, Puyol, Marchena, Capdevila; Senna, Iniesta, Xavi, Fabregas, David Silva; Torres.

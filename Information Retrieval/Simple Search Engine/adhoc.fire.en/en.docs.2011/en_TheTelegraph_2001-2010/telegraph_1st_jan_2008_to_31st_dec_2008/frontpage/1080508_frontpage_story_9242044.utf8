  - India leads list, America at the bottom          G.S. MUDUR                                                     
	New Delhi, May 7: Indias time-honoured traditions of repairing appliances and washing the laundry with cold water may be keeping even its elite ahead of the West on environment-friendly behaviour.         
	Consumers in India and Brazil have tied with the highest score for environment-friendly behaviour and lifestyle in a 14-nation study released today by the National Geographic Society and a polling and research firm.         
	US consumers scored the lowest, and Canadian and French consumers were at the second and third place from the bottom in the list generated by the Society and GlobeScan, an international consultancy, through a new mechanism to measure and compare consumer practices.         
	People in developing countries take more action to reduce consumption and waste, though they have fewer opportunities to do so, according to the findings based on a survey earlier this year of a thousand consumers from each of the 14 countries via the Net.         
	The study has provided an unprecedented look at how consumers across the world are behaving, said Terry Garcia, executive vice-president of mission programmes at the National Geographic Society.         
	Consumers in developing countries were more likely to live in smaller houses and own fewer appliances or electronic devices, and were likely to walk, cycle, use public transport, or opt to live close to their daily destination, the survey found.         
	US consumers scored worse than those in any other country  developing or developed  on housing, transportation and goods. Only 15 per cent of US consumers said they minimised their use of fresh water.         
	India was at the top of the food index  its food consumption ranked as the most environmentally sustainable among the 14 countries. But, in washing clothes with cold water, Indi a was ranked five.         
	We hope the study inspires all consumers, particularly those in the countries where consumers scored lowest, to adopt the best behaviours of those who scored well, Garcia said.         
	The findings have surprised Indian experts who believe the method employed for the survey  the use of the Internet  should have thrown up a picture of consumers not too dissimilar to the West.         
	I would imagine we have some people here whore just as wasteful as those in some developed countries, said Ashok Khosla, chairman of Development Alternatives, a non-government organisation.         
	Its extraordinary, were getting a picture that represents the average in India through a survey of people with access to the Internet, Khosla told The Telegraph.         
	The study showed that consumers in the developed countries  who have more environmental-friendly options to choose from  often do not opt for those choices. They have larger homes, own more cars and use public transport relatively less .         
	One environment expert said a study of consumer behaviour needs to take into account socio-economic groups.         
	A nation with a stratified social structure cannot have a single consumer culture, said Jayanta Bandopadhyay, professor at the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta. The use-and-throw economy hasnt come in a major way here yet, but in metropolitan areas, things are changing, Bandopadhyay, who specialises in environment and development, said.         
	A more representative sample of Indias consumer population  to include people without access to the Internet  might have pushed up Indias score even higher, an expert said.         
	The assessment was based on choices that consumers make consciously such as repairing rather than replacing items, or using cold water to wash laundry, as well as on choices dictated by local circumstances such as the availability of public transport.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 5: The party that shut down all of Bengal today kept its headquarters wide open.        
	As boss Bose  Biman, Biman Bose, the CPM state secretary  explained: How can political parties close down their offices on a bandh day?        
	Did he mean to say: How can we close you down if we close down ourselves?        
	True.        
	We need to come to our (party) offices to articulate the peoples protest, he added.        
	People, right outside 31 Alimuddin Street, the CPM headquarters, however, were unaware of what the protest was all about.        
	All they knew was that the bandh business was good for business.         
	Aaj bahut jyada customer hain, said Golam Rahman with a twinkle in his eyes. He owns a teashop bang opposite the bandh control room. Nothing is closed here and we are very happy, added Golam, who does a business of Rs 600-700 daily. By 5pm today, he had already topped that mark.        
	As Bose argued: We work to protect peoples interests as well as articulate their grievances and aspirations.        
	If Golam makes more money on bandh day, that is no doubt one way of protecting peoples interests. Bose could, however, do nothing about the teashop owners grievance that his brother had gone to their ancestral village and wasnt around to help him sell a few more cups of the beverage.        
	Why tea alone? On Thursdays, red meat cant be sold. Today, if you wanted beef, perhaps the only place in Calcutta where you couldve got it is Alimuddin Street.        
	Ladla, who owns the oldest shop  selling grocery  in the area, expected sales to double. No party cadres asked us to close and this is usual during all bandhs, he said.        
	It hardly matters as long as we get customers. I think the bandh has been called following the rise in prices of essential commodities.        
	Alimuddin forgot to convert in its own mohalla.        
	For Asgar Ali, who sells snacks, its good news tomorrow is also a bandh.

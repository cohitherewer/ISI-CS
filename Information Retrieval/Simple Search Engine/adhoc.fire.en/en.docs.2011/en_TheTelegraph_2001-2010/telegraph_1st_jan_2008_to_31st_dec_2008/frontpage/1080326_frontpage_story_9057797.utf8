	Ranchi/Hazaribagh, March 25: A woman Maoist leader and 12 others were arrested at Saldaga village in Simdega district late last evening.        
	Simdega superintendent of police Deo Behari Sharma said that the woman, identified as Radha Devi and her accomplices, belonged to the rebel group, Jharkhand Liberation Tigers, active in Khunti and Simdega districts.        
	The extremists were hiding at Manjubera village after committing a murder at Kairbera village. Getting information of the groups whereabouts, the police raided the village and arrested 13 of them, though a few others managed to escape under cover of darkness        
	Jharkhand Prastuti Committee rebels, who called a statewide bandh against alleged police atrocities, set seven trucks on fire at two different places in Hazaribagh district. The police had confirmed the incident but failed to say as to which rebel outfit was behind the act.

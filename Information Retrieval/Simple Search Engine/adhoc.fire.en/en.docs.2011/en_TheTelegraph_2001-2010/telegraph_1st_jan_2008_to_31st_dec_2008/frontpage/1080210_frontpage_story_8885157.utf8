The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Spare the rod? No way
                                                                                                        Spare the rod? No way
  - Govt spends thousands in 2-year hunt for aluminium thief          JAYANTH JACOB                                                    
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Gautam Rai is no Dawood Ibrahim but the government wants him all the same. At any cost.        
	Rai, a peon at the foreign ministrys Akbar Bhavan office, was caught stealing a small aluminium rod from the building two years ago and vanished soon after.        
	The government has since then been steadily tightening its net around the man, spending thousands in the effort. It started a departmental inquiry and then issued notices to Rai that remained undelivered because he had fled his New Delhi home.        
	Now the ministry is close to catching him. All Rai needs to do to be brought to justice is respond to a newspaper advertisement the ministry has taken out warning him to show up or face action.        
	The advertisement, published on Thursday, cost Rs 30,000 in taxpayers money. The aluminium rod would not have cost much more than Rs 30  ministry sources said it was the sort used in scaffoldings or to hang curtains and was small enough for Rai to hide in his bag.        
	Officials say they went strictly by the book in the hunt for their man.        
	It was in April 2006 that Rai was caught red-handed at the office gates by Central Industrial Security Force guards trying to smuggle out his booty. The government shortly started penalty procedures under Rule 14 of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965.        
	The officials said the crime constituted a vigilance case and came under the ambit of misappropriation of government property and misconduct. An apparently frightened Rai stopped reporting for duty since May 2, 2006, in an unauthorised manner.        
	Rule 14 says there can be no punishment without an inquiry. The ministry tried to contact Rai so he could tell his side of the story before the inquiry panel, but in vain.        
	The inquiry was held ex parte (in the absence of one party) and the report was ready in September 2007. A notice, dated September 7, 2007, was sent to the address Rai had given the ministry -- 547 Ali Ganj, Lodhi Road  and was followed by a second.        
	Both notices asked Rai to appear before the panel and give his version.        
	Now, five months later, the ministry has through the newspaper ad given Rai a final opportunity to collect a copy of the inquiry report and give his representation.        
	If he fails to respond in 15 days, it would be presumed that Rai has no representation to make and further action will be taken against him in the matter.        
	A theft is a theft, and amounts to a violation of service rules. We sent intimations to his address twice, but he didnt respond. So, we are giving him a final chance, a ministry official said.        
	Joint secretary Debnath Shaw, who is also the ministrys chief vigilance officer, said: We dont comment on vigilance cases.

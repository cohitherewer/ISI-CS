The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tears for film and verse, not a drop for riots
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tears for film and verse, not a drop for riots
  - Iron Man Advani embarrassed that he cries easily in public          SANKARSHAN THAKUR AND G.S. MUDUR                            Advani at the Assocham meet, where a couplet brought tears to his eyes. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, June 7: Many might be tempted to think his tears are a tactic in the larger scheme of softening down his hard-liner image. The man himself reckons they are an embarrassment hed rather not display, at least to the public eye. But somehow, L.K. Advani, would-be Prime Minister, just cant shake off his lachrymal lapses, the last just a few days ago when businesswoman Swati Piramal read out a couplet at Assochams annual meet here.        
	But its fair to say that this latest outburst had nothing to do with the image makeover Advani is desperately seeking in order to make his candidacy for the top executive job more acceptable.        
	The man who once sought to fashion himself as Sardar Iron Man Patel Mark II is a serial crier of established vintage. He had told The Telegraph in an interview as far back as 1991: Tears come to my eyes so readily that I often feel embarrassed about this weakness of mine.        
	A brief history of Advanis crying (The Public Episodes):        
	During a speech to felicitate Atal Bihari Vajpayees accession to Prime Ministership at Parliament Annexe in 1996;         
	On being told by a reporter in 1998 that since he became Union home minister, he was being missed at the BJP headquarters;        
	Watching his daughter Pratibha refer to him as a soft man with an unfair hard-liner tag on live television;        
	While watching Aamir Khans Taare Zameen Par, several times, we are told. And several times while watching several other movies that he is a huge fan of.        
	Medics would tell you that as you get older, most people tend to suffer whats known as the dry-eye syndrome which is, essentially, a shortfall in the supply of tears. With Advani, 81, thats clearly not the case. The older he gets the more he seems to have of tears.        
	Physiologists might have an explanation. A predisposition to frequent shedding of tears triggered by emotions could be attributed to an overactive sympathetic nervous system, the aspect of human brain physiology that mediates response to stress or joy.        
	An overactive sympathetic nervous system can cause outbursts of emotions  from stress and from intense joy, said Ramesh Bhat, the head of physiology at the Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore. An overactive sympathetic nervous system could have genetic basis.        
	Although several animals produce tears, scientists believe it is only in humans that emotions can activate the tear glands. Physiologists have classified tears into three classes  basal tears that lubricate the eye, reflex tears that are caused by irritant chemicals such as tear gas or even onions, and emotional tears.        
	A number of studies suggest that emotional weeping through tears is healthy. Medical scientists say emotional tears observed across human cultures represent a protective mechanism to counter effects of stress. It is an important outlet to relieve stress, Bhat said.        
	Such tears may be stimulated by stress, and emotional experiences. (For Advani earlier this week, it may have been a couplet). One study in Japan found that the emotion-laden movie Kramer vs Kramer led 44 out of 60 participants to tears.        
	In other situations, scientists have observed dramatic physiological responses from even music. In one experiment, researchers at the Institute of Music Physiology and Hanover University in Germany found that a specific score from Mozart stimulated goose bumps and shivers in 7 out of 38 volunteers.        
	In Advani, tears get jerked by many and more of the above mentioned causes. As he told The Telegraph all those years back: Any intense emotion, whether joy or sorrow, immediately moistens my eyes. Even a moving piece of dialogue in a film, or for that matter, fulsome praise showered on the BJP by outsiders, or news of some outstanding achievement by a near and dear one brings tears to my eyes.        
	Ayodhya and its aftermath and Gujarat 2002 evidently dont qualify.

  - Driver plays Samaritan, rescues Burmese fishermen          PRIYA ABRAHAM                            Rescued fishermen in Gopalpur                                        
	Bhubaneswar, March 5: For fishermen on the other side of the Bay of Bengal, Berhampur has become a home away from home.        
	The three fishermen of Myanmar rescued last month off the shore in Gopalpur, about 180km from here, have found shelter at the house of Purnachandra Sethi in Burma Colony on the outskirts of Berhampur.        
	Sethi and his family settled in the south Orissa town in 1969 after spending several years in Myanmar. Along with some other families from Myanmar, they set up their house in Burma Colony.        
	Sethi was only 15 years old when his family had officially come to India. He did his schooling in Rangoon (now Yangon) and serves as a driver with the Indian Rare Earths Limited at Berhampur, about 16km from Gopalpur. His knowledge of Burmese made him a saviour of the trio, who were searching for land for over two months after venturing into the deep sea.         
	When Sethi learnt that the rescued fishermen would be sent to jail, he decided to take them out on personal bond and offer place at his modest house for the time being. The rescued fishermen  Zan U, Zaw Lwin and Ko Lin  were released on bail from Gopalpur police station a few days ago.         
	Sethi and his family are now the only ones in the state who can communicate with the illiterate fishermen in Burmese. Im ready to offer food to them with my little income till they get an opportunity to go back to their country, said Sethi.        
	As a humanitarian gesture, the forest department also employed them as daily labourers for two days to provide them some income.         
	But this is not a lone case for Sethi. In 1992, his family had provided shelter to nine fishermen from Myanmar rescued at Gopalpur. They could only return in 1994.         
	They provided food and shelter to these fishermen on their own. The family again played Samaritan for seven fishermen rescued in Puri in 2003.        
	It will take at least one-and-a-half years for the trio to return to Myanmar. How can I let them from my erstwhile homeland languish in jail? Sethi asked.

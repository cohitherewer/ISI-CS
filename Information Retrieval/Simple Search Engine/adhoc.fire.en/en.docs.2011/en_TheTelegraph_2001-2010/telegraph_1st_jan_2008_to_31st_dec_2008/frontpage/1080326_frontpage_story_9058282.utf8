                                Mohammed Azharuddin                            
	Anil Kumbles first India captain, Mohammed Azharuddin, was among those invited by the Board for Tuesday evenings function in Chennai.        
	The following are excerpts from what Azhar said after the felicitation:        
	Kumble didnt have much of variety when he started off, so I couldnt have predicted how far hell go Today, however, Im hoping that he takes 700 (Test) wickets        
	Im very happy at what Kumble has achieved, through hard work and such dedication Bowlers need to be given space to do their job and, when I was the captain, I didnt tell him what and how to bowl after every delivery        
	Its nice that the Board organised a function such as this. Kumble, after all, deserved to be feted in this manner              OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN CHENNAI

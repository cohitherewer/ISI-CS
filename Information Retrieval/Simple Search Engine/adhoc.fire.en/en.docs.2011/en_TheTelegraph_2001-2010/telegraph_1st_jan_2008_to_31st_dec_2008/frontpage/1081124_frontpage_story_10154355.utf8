                                Liz: Mink stinks                             
	London, Nov. 23 (PTI): Liz Hurley has invited the fury of animal welfare organisations by becoming the new face of an exclusive fur company.        
	The actress has enraged the animal lovers by appearing in an advertisement for American fur house Blackglama, which is famous for producing the worlds finest natural ranch-raised mink.        
	In her new advertisement, the actress can be seen wearing fur coats and wraps, the Daily Mail reported.        
	Leading animal-rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has issued a savage attack on the 41-year-old actress last night accusing her wardrobe to be as dead as her film career.        
	Its shocking that shes taking money to wear baby minks, who are skinned at six months old for Lizs luxuries. Her wardrobe is as dead as her film career, said Robbie LeBlanc, the director of PETA Europe.        
	Hurley declined to comment on her decision to work for Blackglama last night, the paper said.

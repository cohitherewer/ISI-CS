  - Govt to consult Opposition         OUR BUREAU                                    
	New Delhi/Calcutta, May 29: The Bengal government will look for a consensus with the new Opposition-led zilla parishads before going ahead with land acquisition for industry, the state industries minister today said.        
	There is a new leadership at the district level in East Midnapore and South 24-Parganas (thrown up by the panchayat polls). We will consult them for a consensus before going ahead with the new projects, Nirupam Sen told reporters. Meanwhile, well go ahead with the projects that already have consensus.        
	Asked about the projects of the Indonesia-based Salim group, Nirupam said: The government will acquire land for the projects only after a consensus at the grassroots level.        
	The minister, in Delhi for the two-day CPM central committee meeting that began today, later clarified to The Telegraph: It should not be inferred from my earlier words that the Salim groups projects would be scrapped.        
	In Calcutta, Mamata Banerjee said the talk of consensus was just a ploy to appease voters before the Lok Sabha polls. The industries minister... is lying to woo back the voters who have rejected the CPM in the rural polls.        
	The Salim group is likely to be affected the most by the policy of consensus. Political observers said they did not expect any movement on the projects till the general election. Salim associate Prasoon Mukherjee declined comment.        
	Bengal industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said work on two Salim projects  the Nayachar chemical hub and the Raichak-Kukrahati bridge  was on and there is no confusion about their future.        
	The Nayachar land belongs to the government, so theres no need to wait for a consensus. We have sent our final proposal and are waiting for the Centres clearance, Nirupam said.         
	As for the bridge, we need a 6km approach road on either side, Sabyasachi said, adding that a consensus should not be a problem for the very small area to be acquired.        
	But another Salim project, the 108km Barasat-Raichak expressway, faces a long wait. Political observers expect the expressway, which requires 3,000 acres, to run into rough weather after the change of guard in the South-24 Parganas zilla parishad.        
	Nirupam said the government would go slow on the project to avoid confrontation with the Opposition or Left Front allies.        
	On Tuesday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had indicated the go-slow, skipping a meeting with Salim group officials on land acquisition moves, sources said. Nirupam attended the meeting, though.        
	Other Salim projects include an 850-acre knowledge park and health city in Rajarhat-Bhangar and townships covering 10,400 acres in Bhangar, Baruipur and Kukrahati.        
	The townships were a quid pro quo: they allowed Salim entry into real estate on a commercial basis as an incentive for its role as anchor-developer of the chemical hub and the expressway.        
	The township projects are not relevant now since these are supposed to come up at the fag end of the 15-year time span for the construction of the expressway and other projects, Nirupam said.        
	Construction of the Mahabharat motorcycle factory in Howrahs Uluberia, sponsored by Salim, would begin soon, Sabyasachi said.        
	The government must also await a consensus, despite issuing a land acquisition notice, for the Geonkhali shipyard project  which is not a Salim venture  in East Midnapore.        
	He added that consensus would be sought on the desirability of the project, its location, the nature of land to be acquired, the price offered to land-losers and the rehabilitation package.

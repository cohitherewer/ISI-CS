  - Daughter to be in charge of waqf assets worth Rs 250cr          RASHEED KIDWAI                            Saba Ali Khan                                        
	Bhopal, July 9: Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi has decided to share the Bhopal burden not with his star children Saif Ali Khan and Soha, but with his less famous jewellery-designer daughter Saba.        
	The 31-year-old is all set to become the mutawalli (chief patron) of dozens of shrines, orphanages and religious trusts that are part of the princely waqf properties of Bhopal. The Telegraph had reported in March last year that Saba was the Nawabs favoured choice.        
	Pataudi, who has so far been managing the Awqaf-e-Shahi  the princely waqf properties bestowed for charity in the name of God  has recommended Saba as his successor in a letter to Bhopal authorities.        
	Written in Urdu and signed by Pataudi, it says: I have been fulfilling my duties as mutawalli of Awqaf-e-Shahi, Bhopal. However, I feel the time has come to share my burden.        
	I, therefore, propose my elder daughter Saba, as naib mutawalli (deputy patron). As per the merger agreement between State of Bhopal and the state government, Saba may be appointed as my deputy so that she acquaints herself with the functioning of waqf during my lifetime.        
	Once Saba becomes mutawalli, she will become the first woman head of the Awqaf-e-Shahi  since the end of princely rule  to govern religious properties worth over Rs 250 crore, including Bhopals picturesque Jama Masjid.        
	Madhya Pradesh Waqf Board CEO A.W. Qureshi said there was likely to be no hitch in the process as Pataudi was within his rights to appoint his daughter as his successor under the waqf religious provisions.        
	With Nawab sahib suggesting Sabas name, it is a mere formality to announce her name as de facto head of religious trusts and shrines. As per law, there is no hitch, Qureshi said.        
	He explained that when property was bestowed as waqf, it was accompanied by a deed listing benefits from the property to its beneficiaries.        
	Accordingly, waqf was of two types: Waqf Allal Khair, which was for general charity; and Waqf Allal Aulad, where the ultimate benefit was reserved for God but the property was vested in the beneficiaries and income from the property was used for maintenance and support of the family of the founder and his descendants.        
	In March last year, Pataudi had visited Bhopal along with Saba. She was introduced to prominent religious leaders and eminent citizens of Bhopal.         
	Once she becomes mutawalli, Saba will also have special discretionary powers to sanction free lodging at the Rubat in Mecca and Medina. The Mecca Rubat, located near the Kaaba that is considered the House of God by Muslims, is one of the most sought-after accommodations during Haj.        
	Together, the two buildings can house approximately 300 Hajis (pilgrims), who are not charged for their stay. The properties are managed by the Indian consulate in Saudi Arabia.        
	BJP leader Anwar Mohammad Khan, who is the chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Minorities Commission, said: In principle, the state government does not have a problem with the Nawab nominating his daughter, Saba.        
	But we have to gauge the Muslim communitys mood. If serious objections are raised about the new appointment, we will have to take a closer look.

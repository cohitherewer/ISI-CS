	Bhubaneswar, March 11: Those who dreamt to be masters of python, elephant, or Royal Bengal Tiger have reasons to cheer. For, Nandan Kanan Zoological Park has dished out an animal adoption scheme.        
	Interested parties can now adopt among the 1,250 animals (of 125 species) housed in the zoo for a premium. The costs will vary anywhere between Rs 500 and Rs 2.3 lakh.        
	The largest animal in the zoo  the elephants  would be the most expensive ones to adopt followed by the Royal Bengal Tigers, at Rs 1 lakh. Avian species such as lovebirds are on offer for Rs 500.        
	To adopt animals from the zoo, people would have to fill up an adoption form and deposit the requisite money with the authorities. Formalities over, they are entitled to give their pet a name, which would be mentioned on the cage.         
	If necessary, the owner can appoint a special caretaker for the pet. If they feel the need to discuss their bear or snakes wellbeing, they can always approach the authorities.         
	I am excited about the scheme. Its time that citizens come forth to adopt animals as it would help zoo authorities to take care of the inmates better, said Satish Kumar Sahoo, a visitor.        
	The costs would also include an annual maintenance fee  on which one can claim tax rebates. The scheme received the clearance from the income-tax department, too.        
	The zoo has formed a society for the development and management of the park and to attract funds from corporate houses and individuals. The society sought the I-T departments clearance so that donors could claim tax exemption on their contributions under Section 80(G) of the Income-Tax Act.                                      
	The I-T nod to the tax exemption will make the scheme people-friendly and attractive. The basic aim of the scheme is to make people more involved in animals and inculcate a sense of ownership, love and passion for them, said zoo director Ajit Pattnaik.        
	The society would receive and manage all public and corporate contributions for the larger interest of the park.         
	The money would be used not only for maintenance and upkeep of the park, but also for the improvement of the botanical gardens.         
	Till date, a King Cobra, a lion-tailed Macaque (a type of monkey) and a dove have been adopted.         
	The cobra now is an adopted friend of the Rotary Club members, while the other two are individual pets.         
	Nandan Kanan is an internationally recognised zoo that enjoys an excellent reputation for its several captive breeding programmes.

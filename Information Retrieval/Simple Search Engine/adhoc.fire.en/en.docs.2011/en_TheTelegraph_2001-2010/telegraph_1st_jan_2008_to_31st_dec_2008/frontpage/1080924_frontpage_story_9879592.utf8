  - What happens to the younger son in the family? Ask Anil          OUR CORRESPONDENT                             Ambani in Mumbai. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai, Sept. 23: Anil Ambani was stumped by the question.        
	A shareholder of Reliance Natural Resources Ltd asked the company chairman why Anils elder son, 16-year-old Jai Anmol, held 1.67 million shares in the company while younger son Jai Anshul (13) held only 100. Wasnt this discriminatory?         
	Anil, who has been involved in a corporate battle with elder brother Mukesh that eventually led to the split of the Reliance empire in January 2006, clearly wasnt expecting the question.         
	He thought for a bit and replied with acerbic wit: Ab samajh mein aya chhote ke saath kya hota hai (Now you know what happens to the younger son in the family).        
	The shareholders at the annual general meeting cracked up  but it left the question unanswered.        
	Going by todays closing price, Jai Anmols portfolio in RNRL is worth Rs 13.22 crore while Jai Anshuls holdings amount to less than Rs 8,000.        
	The intriguing detail has hung in the air for just over two years. Jai Anmol held the 1.69 million shares in March 2006 when the company listed on the bourses after the split.         
	At that time, Jai Anshul did not hold a share in the company. He was allotted 100 shares three months later.        
	Jai Anmol has passed his Class X from Cathedral and John Connon School, Mumbai, and is now studying in England. Jai Anshul is a Class VII student of the same school.        
	Jai Anshuls holdings in the other Anil Ambani group companies are equally meagre when compared with his elder siblings.         
	While Jai Anmol holds 16.69 lakh shares in telecom major Reliance Communications, Jai Anshul holds a mere 100 shares. The elder son has a substantial holding in Reliance Energy where he holds 16.69 lakh shares, compared to the 100 held by his younger brother.        
	In Reliance Capital, the financial services company, Jai Anmol holds 83,487 shares, while Jai Anshul holds a paltry five shares.         
	Young Gujarati boys usually have to go through a rite of passage called the janeyu, or thread ceremony, around the time they are 14  and Jai Anshul, who turned 13 this month, may have to wait until then before some sort of parity is established.

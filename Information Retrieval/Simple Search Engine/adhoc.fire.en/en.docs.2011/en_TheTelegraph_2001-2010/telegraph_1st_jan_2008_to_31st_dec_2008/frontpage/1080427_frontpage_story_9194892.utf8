          A STAFF REPORTER                             Shah Rukhs Kolkata Knight Riders lost to Chennai Super Kings on Saturday. See Sport                                  
	Calcutta, April 26: Fans will miss watching Shah Rukh Khan belt out korbo lorbo jitbo re with his Bollywood chums from the specially built dais at Eden Gardens on Tuesday.        
	But thanks to this decision by the actor  who is, of course, expected at the ground unlike in Chennai today  more people can watch the Knight Riders take on the Mumbai Indians at home.        
	King Khans company, Red Chillies Entertainment, has asked for the 48ft x 40ft dais to be removed, which will throw open 6,000 more seats. Fans, who had nearly rioted after the tickets ran out earlier this week, can hope to grab them tomorrow.        
	We have been informed that Shah Rukh wont be repeating last Sundays act; so we have decided to dismantle the dais, Cricket Association of Bengal president Prasun Mukherjee said. But I have no idea why he will not do so.        
	Nor is anyone else sure, but the buzz is that SRK was unhappy with the two small LED screens at the Eden that showed him egging his team on.        
	CAB officials said they knew of this and had been informed that the small screens were being replaced with two larger ones hired from a Chennai firm.        
	They will be installed before Tuesdays match. A Chennai-based company is on the job, said CAB joint secretary Amitava Banerjee.        
	Red Chillies officials said even the screens from Chennai would be a temporary measure, and two even larger ones were being imported from Britain and the West Indies.        
	For us, it has to be the best of everything: players, coach, support staff, even the giant screens, said I.S. Bhandari, a senior company official.        
	Another Red Chillies official, however, said the imported screens would have to be reassembled after they arrive and it is difficult to say when they will be installed.        
	The company, however, would not say why it had asked for the dais in J Block to be dismantled.        
	The move will open up not only the 4,000 J block seats that were hidden by the dais, but 2,000 more in the neighbouring H-I and K blocks that had been left vacant for the actors security.        
	Now that Shah Rukh wont be on the dais, all these seats will be up for sale, a CAB official said.        
	Not only Calcuttans but Mukesh Ambani, too, might feel denied by Shah Rukhs decision to scrap the song-and-dance routine on Tuesday. Reliance sources said the owner of Mumbai Indians was expected to watch the game with his wife Nita and their children.

	Calcutta, May 18: A 99kmph speed demon originating from Mahendra Singh Dhonis home state wrecked the hopes of Knight Riders and a capacity crowd at Eden Gardens this evening.        
	The paradise of cricket turned into a purgatory as a Norwester  the fiercest this season  cut short the game that was awarded to Dhonis Super Kings on the Duckworth-Lewis method, sent 100,000 people as well as some players scrambling for cover and brought the CAB boss to his knees in an unseemly tangle of plastic sheets.        
	Floodlights went on the blink again, but this time the blame is being pinned on the howling storm. However, a controversy has erupted over why the floodlights had old bulbs that could not weather voltage fluctuations.        
	The Cricket Association of Bengal scurried to point out that the match was truncated because of the storm that left the ground unsuitable for play, not because of the lights that blinked back to life after 17 minutes.        
	CAB president Prasun Mukherjee said: The light disruption did not affect the match. It was the weather that led to the curtailment.        
	Water had accumulated on the protective covers. The match could not have resumed without draining out the water. The super sopper was used but the deadline of 8pm set by IPL rules could not be met.         
	The storm sent winds howling at 99kmph across Calcutta  the speed at which trees are uprooted.        
	 Norwesters trace their roots to the Chhota Nagpur plateau, parts of which are in Dhonis state Jharkhand. Dhoni later said he had kept the rain forecast in mind while chasing  a clairvoyance that can help if and when the Duckworth-Lewis method comes into play.        
	At least two people in the stadium, including a spectator, were injured.         
	The Super Kings were standing in a line behind their dugout when a huge plastic sheet meant to cover the ground during the rain virtually swept them inside.                  I AM 82KG: Caught in a tangle of covers, Prasun Mukherjee being helped out. Picture by Pabitra Das      
	Also coming in the line of fire, or wind, was CAB boss Mukherjee, who was sucked under one of the covers. I am OK. The sudden storm took everyone by surprise and I was also caught in the storm.        
	Asked whether he was swept off his feet, Mukherjee said: I am 82kg and it is not possible for the storm to blow me away.        
	Mukherjee said some parts of the asbestos roof of Block B were ripped off and iron beams were precariously hanging from there. People were asked to vacate those areas immediately.         
	Shah Rukh Khan, too, couldnt weather the Kalbaishakhi, which forced him to leave the Club House. The Club House was the first gallery to empty out and the other stands followed suit.        
	Around 25 lights in each of the four towers went off at 6.33pm. CAB officials blamed voltage fluctuations  unlike the unexplained blackout on April 20.        
	The officials said voltage plunged from 440 volts to 190 volts, triggering the partial blackout. Asked why only 25 bulbs of the 216 in each tower went off, he said: New bulbs manage to stay alight even when the voltage comes down, the old ones go off. The voltage threshold of the old bulbs is not much.        
	Power department officials said that if that was the case, the old bulbs should have been replaced.         
	As to why the voltage fluctuated, the CESC will have to explain, said Amitava Banerjee, the joint secretary of the CAB. Had there been any fault with the towers or their wiring, all four towers would not have been affected simultaneously as was the case today.        
	Mukherjee, too, said the CESC would have to explain. A CESC official said thunderstorms do cause voltage fluctuations. But we have to examine if that was the case at the stadium.        
	However, a senior CESC official said there was no abnormality in any of the two feeders that supplied power to the Eden floodlights.

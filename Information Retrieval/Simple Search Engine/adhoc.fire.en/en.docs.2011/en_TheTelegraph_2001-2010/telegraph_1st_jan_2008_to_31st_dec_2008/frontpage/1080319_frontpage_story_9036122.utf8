	Kokrajhar, March 18: Three persons died and two were injured when unidentified persons attacked a National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) camp in Assams Kokrajhar district today.        
	Sources said the assailants came in two vehicles around 6pm and started firing indiscriminately at the inhabitants of the NDFB camp at Ghoskhata under Dotma police station. They also set fire to the camp, which got partially burnt before the fire brigade doused the flames.         
	Kokrajhar additional superintendent of police Mrinal Talukdar said the assailants were armed with AK-47s. The deceased have been identified as B. Bhatam, B. Modaram and B. Lambu. Nabaraj Narzary and Kamakhya Narzary were injured.         
	The attack comes a day after suspected NDFB activists killed a surrendered member of the outfit on suspicion of his maintaining close links with the disbanded Bodo Liberation Tigers, which continues to exist without a name and its battle of attrition with the NDFB.        
	The bullet-riddled body of Belaibe alias Bigrai Basumatary, secretary of Surrendered NDFB Welfare Association, was recovered from Dhaolabari Ashuline, 5km from the BTC headquarters of Kokrajhar town yesterday. His driver Samar Basumatary, whose clothes were recovered from the vehicle they were travelling in near Ghoskhata, is yet to be traced.         
	The association had called a 12-hour Assam bandh today in protest against the killing. It was supported by the Ex-BLT Welfare Association.         
	All business establishments, educational institutions and offices remained closed in the four Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC)-administered districts of Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Udalguri and other Lower Assam districts. Traffic came to a standstill, though train services were not affected.         
	Curfew remained in force at Bengtol in Chirang where four persons were killed in police firing on March 13.        
	The situation in the area is limping back to normal, but we are keeping a close watch before lifting curfew, a senior officer in the district said.         
	The toll in the fratricidal killings that have rocked the Bodo belt over the past 18 days reached 12 today.

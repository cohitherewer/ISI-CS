  - Lift the gloom          G.S. MUDUR                            FREEDOM Grin: A released Mumbai hostage                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 5: If you want to do your bit to lighten the post-Mumbai gloom around you, try smiling at people. It may just work, suggests new research.        
	To make others happy, be happy yourself  that appears to be the message from scientists at the Harvard Medical School, Boston, and the University of California, San Diego.        
	The study has found happiness can spread from person to person across social networks, through a chain reaction, somewhat like the common cold. It spreads from people to their friends, to the friends friends, up to the friends friends friends.        
	Your emotional state may depend on the emotional experiences of people you dont even know  who are two to three degrees removed from you, said Nicholas Christakis, professor of healthcare policy at the Harvard Medical School and lead author of the study published in the British Medical Journal. But our ability to influence others appears to stretch to only three degrees.        
	The researchers studied a social network of 4,739 people in the US and measured their emotional levels from 1983 to 2003. Their interpersonal relationships and how far they lived from each other were analysed.         
	The study shows happy people tend to cluster together, but proximity plays a key role. The closer a friend lives, the stronger the effect and as distance increases, the contagion effect weakens.        
	When a person becomes happy, a friend living within 1.6km experiences a 25 per cent increased chance of becoming happy. The chance rises 8 per cent if a spouse becomes happy  but not if husband and wife do not live in the same house.        
	Happy neighbours next door increase peoples chances of happiness by 34 per cent while siblings living 1.6km away have only a 14 per cent effect.        
	This is groundbreaking because it provides a possible mechanism to explain how social networks can influence emotional health, said Andrew Steptoe, professor of psychology at the University College, London, who has commented on the findings in the Journal.        
	Theres a parallel between how happiness is transmitted through social networks and how an infectious illness spreads, he told The Telegraph.        
	The study shows another encouraging result: sadness does not spread as efficiently as happiness.        
	We do see it with sadness  but our models show happiness spreads more reliably than unhappiness, said James Fowler, associate professor at the University of California and co-author of the study.        
	The researchers said the exact mechanisms for emotional contagion are still unclear.        
	Some of this is probably imitation  I see you smile and smile myself  and some might be the sharing of experiences: if I win a lottery, I might buy you a beer. But whatever the mechanism, happiness does appear to spread, Fowler said.        
	In cultures where neighbourhood contact is more frequent, we might find happiness spreads to people on the same block, not just between next-door neighbours, Fowler said. I hope researchers in other countries see if they can replicate these findings.        
	Scientists believe the findings may have implications for public health. Most public health messages now focus on steps that individuals have to take to maintain health or prevent disease. Now, we may think of how interpersonal relations may also influence public health, Steptoe said.        
	Many previous studies have shown happiness has an important effect on reducing mortality, pain and improving cardiac functions. A better understanding of how happiness spreads can help us learn how to promote a healthier society, Fowler said.        
	Earlier studies by Christakis had shown that obesity and smoking behaviour also tend to spread across social networks.

  - Centre politely turns down former Presidents request for aircraft           BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                             Kalam                                        
	New Delhi, June 13: The Centre has shot down an unusual request by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam that would have allowed the retired peoples President to jet around at public expense.         
	The governments polite refusal came in response to a plea by Kalam that he be allotted an aircraft to enable him to keep up with a schedule that appears to have become more hectic since he left Rashtrapati Bhavan last year.         
	Citing reasons of non-entitlement and setting an improper precedent, the government said not possible.        
	Sources said acceding to the request would have opened a Pandoras box with several former Presidents, Prime Ministers and Vice-Presidents asking for similar facilities.         
	At present, only the President, the Prime Minister and the Vice-President are entitled to government aircraft. In case of an urgent requirement  and subject to availability of aircraft  the Union home minister, the defence minister, the minister of state for defence, the three service chiefs, the cabinet secretary, the defence secretary and cabinet ministers can be allowed their use.         
	Former President Kalam is admittedly a busy man  he probably receives an invite a day from across the country and the globe and is out nearly 15 days a month on an average.        
	Kalam had sent a written request to the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) in February this year, asking for a jet to be provided to him for his tours and travels.         
	The PMO was initially flustered by the unprecedented request. Sources said the issue was discussed within the PMO and there were some who actually favoured the idea of Kalam being allowed use of government aircraft.         
	The majority opinion, though, was against it.         
	However, since the aircraft for VVIP use are generally provided by the Indian Air Force, Kalams request was forwarded to the ministry of defence, which categorically said that it was not feasible to agree with it.         
	The ministry cited examples of other countries, like the US and the UK, where former Presidents and Prime Ministers are not entitled to any such privilege once they demit office. They even said that allowing Kalam to use the government aircraft will set a precedent which would be difficult to follow.         
	The ministrys opinion was conveyed to the former President by the PMO. Arguably one of the most popular Presidents in recent times, Kalam has visited five countries since October last. These include two visits to the United States and one each to Finland, Israel, Indonesia and Canada. Besides, he has kept a hectic travel schedule at home, addressing scientific conferences and presiding over various functions.         
	But for all of that, there is going to be no government jet for him. Kalams office did not confirm or deny the request was made and turned down. His secretary R.K. Parshad merely said he had no comment to offer.

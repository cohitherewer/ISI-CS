  - The rich and the famous have a new toy to acquire          AMIT ROY AND OUR BUREAU                                              
	Jan. 27: The Trophy Wives Club faces stiff challenge. From real clubs that can win real trophies.        
	Rich husbands in India and elsewhere are forking out tens of millions to own popular sports clubs. In stadium VIP enclosures abroad, they are taking their arms off the slender waists of wives half their age to egg on bejewelled stars on the field.        
	Perhaps the men have figured out the advantages.        
	Unlike a trophy wife, a sports club doesnt only spend money but can earn it, too. There are no messy divorces: sacking a troublesome manager is so much cheaper than getting rid of a wife, which is where Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich scores over former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney.        
	And staying out the night of the match, downing pints, could actually earn brownie points for loyalty, as Laxmi Mittal, the richest Indian who has bought Queens Park Rangers (QPR) football club, has doubtless been tutored by now.        
	In the past, tycoons and celebrities in the West had been known to own sports clubs but the wives and luxury yachts still ruled the glamour stakes. What better way to refurbish a middle-aged mans image and pump his ego than have a young, beautiful woman on his arms?        
	Owning a club, it now seems, from the way American and Russian businessmen have been rushing to buy up English Premier League football clubs like Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool.        
	And now the Indian rich and famous are scooping up one Indian Premier League cricket team after another, as well as investing in English soccer clubs and Formula 1 teams.        
	Social psychologists forward a slew of serious explanations. A businessman or film star might want to buy a popular sports club to expand his sphere of influence. Or to portray himself as a regular guy, which is easier to do when you are cheering in a stadium than when you are being photographed stepping off your $300-million yacht with a six-foot-tall, Armani-clad former model.        
	We call this impression management, said Gopa Bharadwaj, professor of social psychology at Delhi University. For people who are already well-known and leaders in their own fields, such acquisition can add value to image.        
	In India, where wives and yachts are to be modestly hidden away from the limelight, owning a cricket team with superstar players on your roll is a gilted investment because of the fan and media frenzy.        
	Owning a cricket club will provide the tycoon greater visibility. A yacht or a Taj Mahal hotel is no match for a cricket club, said Mumbai psychiatrist Harish Shetty.        
	A cricket club is an outrageously expensive possession and is certainly a bigger status symbol than a yacht, an island or a trophy wife, said adman Alyque Padamsee.        
	In the US, owning a baseball club indicates that you have arrived. Whether you make or lose money, you still have the prestige. Its a combination of glamour and a profitable business venture.        
	In England, buying a football club can help a rich foreigner climb up the social ladder. Russians are generally kept out of polite English society but Abramovich, 43, is an exception.        
	Buying QPR could well be part of the Mittal familys strategy to gain a more favourable profile in English public life. The steel baron was apparently sold the idea by his friend Bernie Ecclestone, from whom he bought his London mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens (said to be the most expensive private residence in London).        
	But where a trophy club trounces a trophy wife 5-0 is in the social perks it offers. In short, it gets you the girls.        
	Abramovich has done a nifty substitution in his personal life  bringing in the 26-year-old model Daria Zhukova, former girlfriend of tennis player Marat Safin, in place of his second wife, Irina.        
	Besides, a strong club  as even the caveman knew -- can actually help you acquire a trophy wife.        
	When Ecclestone himself put a fortune into F1 racing, the Daily Mail asked unkindly: How do ugly boys get gorgeous girlfriends?        
	It went on to answer its own question: In lonely hearts adverts, men usually emphasise what they are looking for in a woman physically, whereas women look for wealth and status. The difference in priorities might explain why the Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone is married to a stunningly tall wife, Slavica.        
	With inputs from Samyabrata Ray Goswami, Satish Nandgaonkar and G.S. Mudur

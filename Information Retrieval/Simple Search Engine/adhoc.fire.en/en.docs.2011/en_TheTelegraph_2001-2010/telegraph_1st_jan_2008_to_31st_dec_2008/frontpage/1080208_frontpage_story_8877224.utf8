The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bird hit amp; burst tyres
                                                                                                        Bird hit amp; burst tyres
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Feb. 7: An Air India A-320 Airbus from Calcutta to Guwahati with 82 passengers and seven crew members on board today survived danger twice, first when a mid-air bird hit damaged a section of the landing gear and then an emergency touchdown that went wrong with two tyres bursting on impact.        
	When flight commander Capt. D. Tiwari finally braked IC 229 to a halt on the scorched runway, it was the end of easily the longest 45 minutes for the passengers and the crew. The aircraft had been circling the airport for that period of time to jettison fuel for the emergency landing.        
	On touchdown, there were two sounds and the plane tilted towards the left before stopping. The realisation of what could have been dawned on most of the passengers only after they disembarked and saw the aircraft and the commotion all around.        
	God was with us and the pilot did a commendable job... he saved us, one of the passengers, Vijay Singh Daga, said. Daga, the managing director of transport company Bikaner Assam Roadlink, was returning with his wife and daughter.         
	Air India officials posted here said Capt. Tiwari and his co-pilot could not have handled the emergency better. The flight commander is among the best we have, one of them said.        
	The director of the Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport, R. Veeraswami said two of the four tyres on the left burst because they bore almost the entire weight of the aircraft. The pilots did not risk using the right side of the landing gear because they were not sure how much damage the bird hit caused.        
	As it turned out, a portion of the steel frame holding the right wheels was bent when the bird crashed into it.         
	The aircraft was about 7km from the airport and the pilots were preparing for landing at the scheduled time of 11am when the bird hit occurred. Some passengers suspected something was wrong when they heard a thud and felt the aircraft vibrate before starting to pick up altitude again instead of continuing the descent.        
	As we circled the airport, the plane was still vibrating. The cabin crew were back in their seats. We first thought the plane had not received clearance to land and was biding time. But after some time, we started asking what was going on. It was then that the pilot announced the bird hit and said everything was under control and that there was no need to panic, Daga said.        
	Another passenger, Suman Budhiya, said the tension was unmistakable when the plane started shaking and gained altitude again. When one passenger enquired what was happening, a crew member asked him to relax and remain seated. Finally, the pilot made the announcement. But there was no panic as such.         
	Budhiya and most of the other passengers realised what they had been through the moment they saw the preparations for the emergency landing. There were a lot of people along with fire-tenders and ambulances lined up on the tarmac. It was only then that we realised what a close shave it was.         
	Businessman Raju Kalita said he could not have imagined that a flight that took off smoothly on time and was cruising could get into such big trouble. I must admit to going blank for a while, not knowing what to make of the siatuation. Anyway, alls well that ends well.         
	The runway was reopened only after the damaged aircraft was taken to the apron with a change of tyres.         
	The Bagdogra-Calcutta IC 722 was diverted via Guwahati to accommodate passengers who were to take the return flight. The flight took off at 4.30pm. Veeraswami said instances of bird hits in Guwahati were infrequent. The species of the bird that hit IC 229 could not be ascertained because it was mangled.

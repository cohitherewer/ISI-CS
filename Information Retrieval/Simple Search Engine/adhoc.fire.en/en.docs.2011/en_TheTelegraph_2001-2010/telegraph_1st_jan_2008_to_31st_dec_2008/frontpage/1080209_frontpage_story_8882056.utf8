The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pranab scoffs at China protest
                                                                                                        Pranab scoffs at China protest
          OUR BUREAU                             Manmohan in Arunachal                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: India today reacted sharply to Chinas informal objection to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Arunachal Pradesh at a time talks are on to resolve the border dispute.         
	Arunachal is an integral part of our country. We are having elected representatives in Parliament from the state. Therefore, it is quite obvious that the Prime Minister can visit any part of the country, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said in Mumbai.         
	The protest, at a junior level, was registered with the Indian mission in Beijing. China has not followed it up with an official note yet, sources in the foreign ministry said.         
	What was conveyed informally was the unhappiness over the visit at a time both sides are in the process of settling the border question and differences in perceptions still exist, the sources said.         
	This was the minimum possible China could have done, they said. The protest comes a week after Singhs visit to Arunachal, the first by a Prime Minister in 12 years, where he called the state our land of rising sun.         
	The trip, on January 31 and February 1, came about a fortnight after Singhs return from China.         
	Delhi has not yet officially replied to China.        
	During the visit to China, Indian officials accompanying Singh had said border talks were progressing and special representatives were trying to evolve a common framework to resolve disputes.         
	The BJP had criticised the Prime Minister for not going to Tawang, which China claims as its territory. It was interpreted by the BJP as a weakening of Indias stance on the border row.         
	Despite the request of our chief minister, who is from Tawang, the Prime Minister did not visit Tawang probably because of Chinese pressure. We will raise the issue in Parliament, BJP MP from Arunachal (East), Tapir Gao, said.        
	The Prime Minister inaugurated a helicopter service to Tawang and also visited a border station of the army.

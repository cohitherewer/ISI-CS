          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, April 12: The Indian Institutes of Technology hold their joint entrance examination tomorrow uncertain, for the first time, on how to pick the most deserving candidates.        
	The IITs are yet to collectively decide how many seats will be available this year to each category of students  general, SC/ST and OBC  officials said. The mechanism to select the OBC candidates, too, is to be finalised.         
	Over 3.2 lakh students are expected to appear in the JEE, nearly 30 per cent higher than last year, across 600 centres. Each answer script will carry a box to be ticked only by OBC students.         
	The procedure for setting the cutoff marks for the OBCs will be finalised by the joint admission board of the IITs, said S.C. Saxena, director of IIT Roorkee, which is organising the JEE this year.         
	Although general category seats at the existing IITs and Banaras Hindu University  which admits students on the basis of JEE marks  will remain unchanged, opportunities for these students at the three new IITs remain unclear.        
	A selection procedure finalised earlier this year by the IIT directors may now need to be tweaked.         
	That mechanism was based on the number of seats we had before the announcements about the three new IITs this year, and before the OBC quotas were cleared. The mechanism will be looked at again, said an IIT Powai official who was closely associated with last years JEE.         
	The new IITs in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan are each expected to offer 200 undergraduate seats this year. But though the Centre does not expect the existing IITs to reserve the full 27 per cent seats for OBCs this session, it wants the new institutes to do so.        
	With no additional funding likely at this stage for the new IITs to increase seats, the number of general seats at these institutes is likely to drop.        
	Although each existing IIT had earlier proposed an 18 per cent seat expansion this year, many of them fear they cannot carry it out.        
	Till we know the number of seats available in each category, it will be impossible to set cutoffs, the IIT Powai official said.        
	The IITs also feel it would be difficult to identify the creamy layer among the OBCs, with several of the criteria somewhat nebulous.        
	But the confusion is unlikely to affect students appearing in the exam tomorrow, said Shiv Kumar, director, Career Launcher coaching institute.         
	It may bother their parents. But the students themselves are likely to be too preoccupied with the exam to worry about the quota controversy, he said.

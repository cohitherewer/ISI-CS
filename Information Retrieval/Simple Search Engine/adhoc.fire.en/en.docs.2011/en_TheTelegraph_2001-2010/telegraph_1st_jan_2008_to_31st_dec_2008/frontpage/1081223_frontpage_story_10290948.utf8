The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bio-terror on train, to save a life
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bio-terror on train, to save a life
  - Dangers of flawed TB therapy become evident during a journey          G.S. MUDUR                            The diagnostic laboratory at Jan Swasthya Sahyog, a rural hospital near Bilaspur, where the patient from Calcutta finally received appropriate anti-TB therapy                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The doctor from Parnashree in Behala, south Calcutta, sometimes wonders whether he had committed an act of bio-terror that night on the three-tier sleeper coach of the Howrah-Mumbai Mail.        
	Just before the train had rolled out of Howrah, he had given a patient he was travelling with a 15ml  thrice the normal  dose of a cough suppressant, and repeated it twice during the 11-hour night journey to Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh. He had also opened the windows on both sides of the compartment and turned on the ceiling fans.        
	And long after the coach lights had dimmed and the cacophony of chatter from fellow passengers dwindled, the doctor had lain awake, listening for sounds of cough from the patient  a 40-year-old man from Garden Reach, Calcutta, so weak that a porter had to ferry him from the Howrah parking lot to the train on a luggage cart.        
	Tuberculosis bacilli were thriving in his lungs. His cough was likely to be loaded with microbes that could put people around him at risk. I was worried. I kept thinking: was this the right thing to do? said the doctor who requested not to be named.        
	The Garden Reach patient is among thousands across India who, after failing to respond to the first course of anti-TB therapy, have received a controversial re-treatment plan from Indias TB control programme (as The Telegraph reported yesterday).        
	The ideal way to re-treat TB patients is to expose their bacilli to different drugs, find a cocktail that works, and tailor therapy for each patient. But the governments plan of re-treatment adds a single drug -- streptomycin -- to the four drugs used in the first therapy for all patients, violating textbook rules for TB treatment.        
	Public health experts say this re-treatment strategy can worsen the illness in many patients and contribute to the spread of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB), which is harder to cure and 100 times more expensive to treat than non-resistant TB.        
	Weve seen some frightening practices... and tragedies, said Nargis Mistry, director of the Foundation for Medical Research (FMR), Mumbai, a non-government organisation.        
	Under a project supported by the UK-based Wellcome Trust between 2004 and 2007, FMR staff had detected MDR TB in 33 out of 91 patients in central Mumbai who were given the re-treatment therapy after failing to be cured by the first set of drugs.        
	Every one of these patients should have received individualised therapy. But the health centres just ignored our results, Mistry told The Telegraph. Thirteen of the 91 died in the past three years.        
	And 10 patients who had failed to respond to re-treatment were again placed on the same re-treatment plan. But we cant blame the staff at these centres, Mistry said. They are helpless. The government has never tried to face this issue.        
	Some patients -- like the man from Garden Reach -- are lucky to find helpful doctors. The doctor from Behala took him to the Jan Swasthya Sahyog, a rural hospital near Bilaspur where physicians organised a drug susceptibility test. It showed that his TB bacilli were resistant to all five drugs used in re-treatment.        
	The government programme currently offers nothing to the vast majority of such patients... it leaves them to die, said Anurag Bhargava, a physician at the Jan Swasthya Sahyog.        
	Bhargava and a colleague, Yogesh Jain, have analysed the TB control programme in the latest issue of the National Medical Journal of India and urged a revision of its re-treatment policies.        
	The Garden Reach patient is now on a combination of four non-standard anti-TB drugs. Hes gaining weight and appears better, said the Behala doctor. Was it worth risking the health of others to try and save one mans life? I dont know.        
	He added: But there are many others like him -- without treatment.        
	Health officials said they decided in October this year to offer drug susceptibility tests to patients who have failed an initial course of anti-TB therapy. But India does not have the infrastructure to provide such tests to patients across the country.

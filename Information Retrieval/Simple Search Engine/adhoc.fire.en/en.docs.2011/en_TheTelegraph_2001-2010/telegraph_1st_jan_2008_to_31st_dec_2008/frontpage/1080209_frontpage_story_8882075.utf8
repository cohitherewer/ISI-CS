  - Govt to fund classes for entrance tests           CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: Aspirants to Indias elite engineering and management institutions may soon receive virtually free online coaching from top faculty under a government plan to compete with private coaching classes.         
	Concerned about the proliferation of private tutorial services and the high fees they charge, the human resource development ministry has approved a proposal to introduce the countrys first public-funded training to crack competitive exams.         
	Initially, the training is likely to cover entrance tests to the Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Management. But the government plans to extend the facility to the civil services entrance exam too, senior officials said.         
	Over the past two decades, private coaching classes have become virtually essential for students to get into the IITs and IIMs. But their costs are impossible for many students. Now, they will have a cheaper, almost free, option, an official said.         
	The government is, however, anxious to ensure that the cheaper option does not end up as a poor mans coaching class.         
	Teachers from the countrys top higher education institutions will be invited to form a faculty pool for the facility.         
	It will be a broad-based effort involving teachers from universities, IITs and IIMs. The institutions have agreed in principle. The challenge will be to bring teachers on board, the official said.         
	Officials conceded that at least initially, the online coaching might not be a substitute for the physical tutorials.         
	But they hoped the low fees would attract people  rich or poor  to it.         
	We hope that soon enough they will realise that they will be prepared best for the competitive exams here, the official said.         
	Fearing pressure from the powerful private coaching lobby, the ministry is playing hush-hush on the landmark initiative.         
	But the intent is clear  the Planning Commission is learnt to have cleared the proposal as well.         
	A finance committee has yet to finalise the fee that students will have to pay for the government facility. But sources said students were likely to charged only a basic registration fee  probably less than Rs 1,000  which will be used to cover additional emoluments for the faculty.        
	The faculty will each have a blog restricted to students, who can ask questions and will receive answers within a day.         
	The teachers pool will prepare tests in each subject, which students will take online  like the GRE.         
	Each student will have an online account  their entry to the coaching class.         
	Apart from the questions through blogs, live classes can also be held, the official said.

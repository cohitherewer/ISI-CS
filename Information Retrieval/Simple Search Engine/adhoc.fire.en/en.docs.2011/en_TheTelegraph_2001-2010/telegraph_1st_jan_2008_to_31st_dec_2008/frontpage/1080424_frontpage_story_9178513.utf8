          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 23: With the illegal railway-scrap trade being linked to coach Biranchi Dass murder, states police (crime branch) have swung into action.        
	Police conducted raids at several scrap godowns in Mancheswar industrial estate here today  well-known for its scrap deals.         
	Two persons, including a driver and an owner of a city godown  Brajabasi Iron and Steel  were arrested, while two truckload of scrap that were smuggled out of railway yards on the morning of April 13, were recovered.         
	Scrap dealer Maman Agrawal and his driver are presently being interrogated by officers. Meanwhile, Mamans father, Brijlal Agrawal, and two other employees (also drivers) are said to be absconding.         
	A police team comprising officers of Airfield and Mancheswar police stations also laid a trap for a reported scrap mafia member at Biju Patnaik airport this afternoon. However, the police failed to nab him.         
	The scrap racket estimated to be running into crores has put officers in a tizzy. Todays raids were conducted in a random manner, where police teams verified papers of scarp dealers and made general interrogations.        
	A special police team, led by CID superintendent of police S.K. Biswal, has also been conducting raids at scrap yards in the same area for the past two days. Yesterday, the team started its raids late night and continued them till early this morning. Meanwhile, Cuttack police conducted raids at Jobra godowns as well         
	Incidentally, a sub-inspector of Mancheswar police station was suspended for allegedly allowing illegal shipment of railway scrap. Rumour stated that the officer also leaked Biranchi Dass name to a scrap racket gang when the latter acted as a police informer.        
	Sources believe coach Biranchi Das apparently had knowledge of some illegal deal which he exposed on the morning of April 12, a day before his murder. There were reports of at least three truckloads of scrap illegally finding their way out on that day. Mancheswar police apparently knew of it, but did not act. It is being said that Biranchis bid to bust the trade proved fatal for him.         
	Biranchi had made several calls to powerful people on Sunday informing them of how the racket worked. Biranchi apprehended a threat to his life, too, a police source said.         
	The suspension of Mancheswar police station sub-inspector B.K. Mishra for allegedly letting go off three trucks, illegally transporting scrap worth an estimated Rs 45 lakh on Saturday night, turned the needle of suspicion towards the police as well.         
	This was followed by a series of transfers of officers in the police department.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Probe into rebel nexus in NC Hills
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, May 22: Dispur has decided to institute a commission of inquiry to probe links between some senior members of the North Cachar Hills Autonomous District Council and the Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dima Halam Daogah, which had recently killed a score of people in a string of attacks.        
	The state government has directed police to register cases against those facing specific charges.         
	Asked what steps were being taken to contain the violence in the volatile district, government spokesman Himanta Biswa Sarma said at least three ruling members of the council belonging to the ASDC  chief executive member Debulal Hojai, executive member Mohit Hojai and former MP Prakanta Warisa  allegedly have ties with militants.         
	They are also responsible for diverting funds meant for the council through two contractors, according to evidence furnished by the police and Raj Bhavan. Accordingly, the government has decided to act against those having specific charges and also constitute a commission of inquiry to get to the bottom of the truth. We are also ready for a CBI probe or willing to set up a judicial commission if the Opposition demands, Sarma said.         
	 The alleged charges against Warisa were that of striking a deal with senior NSCN (I-M) functionary V.S. Atem in 2006 to win the Assembly elections while Debulal Hojai and Mohit Hojai are said to have helped and harboured DHD (J) rebels who have killed 75 people since January.         
	While Debulal is related to DHD (J) commander-in-chief Niranjan Hojai, Mohit is related to Maurang Hojai, an area commander. Debulal is said to have given a government job to Niranjan during his first term.         
	A judicial statement signed by arrested DHD member  Action Dimasa  said they used to collect and store arms and ammunition at Debulal Hojais place. Moreover, mobile records of two arrested DHD (J) cadres showed that they were in constant touch with these leaders. Thirdly, according to information provided by Raj Bhavan, around Rs 10 crore meant for the council against various bills was diverted to the coffers of the DHD (J) through two contractors  R.S. Gandhi and another called Ali, Sarma said.         
	As to why the government took so long to wake up to the politician-militant nexus though armed with proof, the minister said: We have started now because we got the information now. Moreover, the police cannot simply go and arrest these people or the Opposition will say the Congress was trying to dislodge the council. Moreover, Dispur has certain limitations under the Sixth Schedule. But we have initiated action, Sarma said.         
	 The Congress had lost the autonomous council elections to the ASDC-BJP combine in December. The party, in fact, gave up the fight after militants started targeting its leaders in the district.         
	 Warisa, when contacted in Haflong, said the charges were nothing new. The accusations have been levelled to malign my image. The charges of my links with the NSCN (I-M) first surfaced before the Assembly elections. I had cleared them myself. Even the NSCN (I-M)) had denied it. Moreover, I lost the elections to the senior most Congress leader, G.C. Langthasa. Everybody, including the chief minister, knows how Langthasa wins elections in the NC hills. That is why he was not included in the cabinet, he said, hinting at Langthasas links with the rebels.         
	Sarma denied the charges, saying a man who had lost his two sons to militants and whose family is under constant threat will have nothing to do with militants.

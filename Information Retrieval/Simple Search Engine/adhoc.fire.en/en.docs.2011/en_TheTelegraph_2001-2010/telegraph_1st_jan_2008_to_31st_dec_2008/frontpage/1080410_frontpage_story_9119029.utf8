	Pokhara (northern Nepal), April 9: The eve of Nepals most critical and momentous election is prohibition night but Pokhara is a party, high on malts and cocktails, swinging in merry violation of the letter and spirit of a deeply troubled nation.         
	Ban? asked a restaurateur on the gorgeous lake front. But thats only for public places, this is private, totally private, nothing to stop us.         
	All of Pokhara was private space tonight  booze flowed in the jazz and snack shacks and music blared discordantly to the bad news erupting all round.         
	A dozen people  seven of them Maoist cadres in the volatile southern district of Dang  have been killed in sporadic pre-poll violence overnight and today. Unsettling reports have been flashing from datelines across the country  a candidate of the Nepali Communist Party gunned down in Surkhet, Maoist apparatchik apprehended with guns and crude bombs, clashes between political groups, minor explosions and curfews.         
	On a day of cautionary appeals from across the political class, most of Nepal hurried nervously indoors, praying poll day will pass peacefully.         
	Tomorrows mandate will have a fundamental impact on where Nepal heads from here and how. It could finally dismantle the monarchy, cast aside the widely-despised King Gyanendra and lay the ground for a democratic republic. Or, if things go wrong, it could push the country into renewed tumult.         
	We are in the throes of make or break circumstances, is how a senior leader of the Nepali Congress put the significance of what transpires tomorrow. We can either make something of our country or totally forget about it.         
	Security forces are on optimum alert, parts of the country look like barracks have spilled over. Hundreds of observers  former US President Jimmy Carter among them  have arrived to monitor whats inarguably a decisive turn for Nepal. The media paradrop is even more intense. This is a taut night, and the worlds watching.         
	But in many pockets of Nepal, its tough to sense the magnitude of the moment. The bar buffs of Pokhara  affluent Nepalis and foreign tourists  remained determinedly unbothered. Desperately waiting for tomorrow to be over, said one prosperous native, clinking his beer mug. Then the real party can resume again. Such a nuisance, this election.         
	This is not a carping report on revelry, this is merely a quick examination of why Nepal is plunged so deep in crisis. Pokhara might offer some clues. The posh districts of Kathmandu  the ivy-laced mansions of the Shahs and the Ranas, of royalty both forsaken and faux  might offer even more.         
	Nepal is a besieged schizophrenia of excess and deprivation. For more than a decade now, it has been mired in a chaotic and bloody civil war that emerged from the desperation of disparities. Its elite remains insular and unseeing. Also, for the most part, entrenched and influential. Its citizenry remains consigned to all manner of dearth.         
	Does it surprise you we have had a Maoist insurrection? asks Birendra Shreshtha, a retired history teacher. Blood has been flowing in this country, those who are meant to be in charge have been swilling wine.         
	A short stroll down the neon-lit pleasures of Pokharas lake front is the village of Dhumre, a clutter of dark hovels and famished fields where farmers work tiny plots that wont yield because theyve been ravaged, quite literally, by hail and high water. Last summer was a series of flash floods, the winter brought heavy frost. The young men of Dhumre have all gone away in search of jobs, to India or to the Gulf, the elderly have little to do but wait for money to arrive at the post office. Some of the villagers, men and women, sit in a huddle getting drunk on raksi, a cheap rice brew.         
	What are we to do with time? one of them says. Elections? Yes, well see what they can change, little has in my long life.         
	The winding road from Pokhara to Kathmandu  from one oasis of blinkered plenty to another  is a lucid tutorial in why the country is so afflicted. Its a beauteous drive, sandwiched between hills and the emerald Trishuli river, but it is scarred all the way by overwhelming insufficiency.         
	When the Pajeros and Land Rovers make a highway stop, unclad children come running asking for matchsticks. They probably know of toffees and chocolate, but they need more essential things.         
	The villages  some so remote you walk a dozen miles for water and all bereft electricity  are flying a new insignia of hope, the red flag of revolution. But this is an election, they must understand, change is still a far cry. And if you look carefully, revolution is riding a Pajero, too; Prachanda is in it.         
	As we enter Kathmandu, we hear of two explosions, one midtown but both zero on human toll. Its the scare factor, though, the taxi driver reckons. Its impact will resound on the turnout tomorrow. Its apparent the bombs havent been heard in Kathmandus discotheque bars; the music is probably too loud. Tonight is still a party.

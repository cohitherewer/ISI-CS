          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: Sorry, ladies, you dont always get to be first. Should you want that to be the case, the electorate seems to have said, youd have to work for it.        
	Its been a hugely mixed bag for the four high-profile women involved in these elections, but surely in the case of the big two  Sheila Dikshit of Delhi and Vasundhara Raje Scindia of Rajasthan  image and performance seem to have defined the difference between victory and defeat.        
	For the two stormy petrels of the heartland  Mayavati and Uma Bharti  it has been the difference between possessing an organisation on the ground and having none.        
	Mayavati may not have made high-voltage news today, but her BSP has been the most engrossing sideshow in what was essentially a bipolar contest between the Congress and the BJP. Already considered a key player in the next Lok Sabha on the basis of her Uttar Pradesh muscle, she has let rivals know she is steadily spreading the BSPs footprints beyond her existing domain.        
	Uma Bharti, on the other hand, would probably be thinking it isnt enough just being Uma Bharti, even with the wily Govindacharya for company and consultation; the volatile sanyasin received good notice during the campaign, but the results may have brought home to her the importance of having a machinery to exploit her magic.        
	Her Bhartiya Jan Shakti Party vanished in the victory trail of her parent organisation. Uma herself suffered the ignominy of defeat on her Tikarmgarh home turf. Irony is, the last time Madhya Pradesh went to elections, it was Uma who churned up and rode the tide that swept Digvijay Singh out of power and brought the BJP in. The BJP is still there, Uma isnt.        
	For her former colleague Vasundhara Raje, even the presence of the party couldnt help --- indeed, some are suggesting that key elements in her party themselves contributed to the end of her raj in Rajasthan. Her governments development record wasnt poor --- something that even the Congress grudgingly concedes, although it alleged Raje was too urban-centric.         
	But Rajes real problems may have come from how she came to be seen by party and Parivar ranks. Through her years in power, Raje had accumulated formidable and fairly outspoken enemies like former external affairs minister Jaswant Singh. She had dissidents within her cabinet making allegations of corruption against her. She had angered sections of the RSS and the Hindu rightwing, who alleged Raje was arrogant and aloof, that she was projecting herself ahead of the party and the Parivar.         
	All of them may have contributed to putting an end to the Raje cult.        
	As one top BJP think-tank told The Telegraph today: Narendra Modi too took on the traditional organisation of the BJP and the Sangh in Gujarat, but it is clear now Vasundhara Raje is no Narendra Modi.        
	But the woman of the day by far was the eldest, and probably least controversial, of the ladies: Delhis redoubtable Sheila Dikshit, the first Congress chief minister in more than three decades to have won three consecutive terms. It isnt as if she hasnt had problems --- the Delhi Congress has mostly been a bitterly divided house, there has been no end of intrigue and revolt these past years against Dikshit. And Delhi being Delhi, her government has constantly been under the national scanner.        
	How did Dikshit do it? For one thing, few deny that Delhi, with all its outstanding civic problems, has become a much better city to live in under Dikshit --- there has been significant movement on quotidian issues like bijli, sadak, paani and pollution.        
	But it has perhaps taken Dikshit more than just that to beat anti-incumbency a second time. That was perhaps best summed up by one of her BJP rivals backstage at a television studio: The thing about her is her personality --- she is seen as decent, well-meaning, almost like a genial mausi (aunt). It shows in how she has held herself, even through crises, she has been calm, she has not been drawn into ugly scenes, she has constantly replied to her critics with the work she has done -- not many have that quality.         
	Delhi, then, has gone for the quiet doer even at a time when terror held national attention and concern. Probably a clue here about what works best --- work itself.

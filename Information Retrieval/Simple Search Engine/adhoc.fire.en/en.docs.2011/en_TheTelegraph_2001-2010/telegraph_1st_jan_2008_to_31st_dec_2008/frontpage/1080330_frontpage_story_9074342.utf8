                                                                                                           Ranchi all set to get woman mayor
          SANTOSH K. KIRO                             Rama Khalkho and Ajay Nath Shahdeo                                  
	Ranchi, March 29: After a momentous campaign and relatively peaceful elections, the Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) seems all set to get its first lady mayor after 22 years.         
	After nearly the final round of counting, Rama Khalkho (37) was leading by almost 16,500 votes over her nearest rival, Ashrita Kujur.         
	Ajay Nath Shahdeo was headed for becoming deputy mayor with a lead of almost 11,300 votes over his nearest rival, Pradeep Sharma.         
	Once he wins, he will bring with him a touch of royalty  he is a member of the Ratu family.        
	Counting for the elections held on March 25 was slow as no electronic voting machines were used in Ranchi due to the high number of candidates (1103 were in the fray for ward commissioners alone).         
	The state election commission had to call in 200 more teachers to speed up counting. So strenuous was the process with pressure building up from a crowd of supporters who virtually laid a siege to the area, that at least six vote counters collapsed due to sheer exhaustion.         
	 Till the evening, the EC had declared the names of 40 ward commissioners. Fifteen more are to be declared.        
	 Jubilant over her certain victory, Khalkho said she would be focusing on holistic development of the city and its people.         
	I will work for making the city a better place to live in. Ensuring basic civic amenities apart, my dream is to help the city get a new image without neglecting its cultural identity, she told The Telegraph.        
	President of the womens cell of Jharkhand Janadhikar Manch (JJM), Khalkho joined politics soon after her studies in Nirmala College.         
	She has been an active member of various tribal organisations before that and is said to have the blessings of state human resources development minister Bandhu Tirkey, who is a United Gomantak Democratic Party (UGDP) MLA from Mandar.         
	Shahdeo, on the other hand, is politically inclined towards the Congress. He, however, made it on his own efforts, though he agrees his political affiliations helped.         
	A commerce graduate from St Xaviers College here, Shahdeo said he would work to make the dream of Greater Ranchi a reality.         
	Honesty will be my hallmark in everything I do or promise. I will also ensure that the pollution in the city is controlled, Shahdeo said.         
	As the two likely winners were planning their victory processions in the city roads, ward commissioners had already hit the road, those in the counting hall continued to battle fatigue to ensure that the results did not spill over to the next day.        
	Sukhram Oraon, an irrigation department employee, was injured in the head after a fall as soon as he came out of the Pandra Bazar counting hall. He was rushed to the Sadar hospital after first aid.        
	Late last night, Bhajendra Oraon, another government employee, fainted.

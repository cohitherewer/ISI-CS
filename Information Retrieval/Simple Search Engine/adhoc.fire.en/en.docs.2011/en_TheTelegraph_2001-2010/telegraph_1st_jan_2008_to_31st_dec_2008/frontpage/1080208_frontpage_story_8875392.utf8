  - Gopalpurs all-weather port may be ready ahead of schedule          SUBRAT DAS                            File picture of the Gopalpur port                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 7: If everything goes according to plan, the under-construction, all-weather port at Gopalpur will be operational one-and-a-half years ahead of schedule.        
	The port was supposed to be commissioned within three years of the concession agreement. But, we are hopeful that it would be operational by December 2009, said Mahimananda Mishra, director of Gopalpur Port Limited.         
	The agreement was signed in October 2006, between the government and Gopalpur Port Limited  a consortium formed by three firms to develop the existing seasonal port to a modern one, on a build, own, operate, share and transfer basis with an investment of Rs 1,700 crore.        
	The port site is located on the southern fringes of the Orissa coast and is expected to ease traffic pressure on the Paradip port. It is also expected to handle export of aluminium and steel products from plants set up in the region and boost ilmenite export from Indian Rare Earths Limited.        
	Talking to The Telegraph, commerce secretary Priyabrata Patnaik revealed that work had already started on the break water. The progress is encouraging and the project is on schedule. Ill be happy if they can commission the port ahead schedule, he added.        
	Gopalpur port between 1986 and 1987 operated as a seasonal lighterage port. It was closed in 2003-04 due to lack of cargo, however, the state subsequently decided to develop it into an all-weather modern port through a private developer. Gopalpur Port Limited, was selected through international bidding.

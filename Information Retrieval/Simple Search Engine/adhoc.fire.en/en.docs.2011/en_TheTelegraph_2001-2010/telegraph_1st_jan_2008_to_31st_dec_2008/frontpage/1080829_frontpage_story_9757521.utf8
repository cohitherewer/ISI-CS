	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 28: The situation in strife-torn Khandhamal remained tense today with fresh reports of violence trickling in from some areas under Daringibadi police station even as chief minister Naveen Patnaik today met Governor M.C. Bhandare to apprise him of the law and order situation.        
	Sources said a mob passing through Saniketa village under Daringibadi police station area ransacked homes and set them ablaze.         
	Reports of clashes were also received from Tikabali and G-Udaygiri. Deputy inspector-general of police R.P. Koche said some incidents were also reported from Kotgarh.        
	Revenue divisional commissioner (south division) Satyabrata Sahu, who chaired a peace committee meeting at Khandhamal headquarters town, said instructions have been issued to form peace committees at village-level.        
	Against this backdrop, the chief minister briefed the governor about the situation in the state for more than 30 minutes, sources at Raj Bhavan said.        
	Earlier, a delegation of leaders of the Opposition had sought the governors intervention and urged him to direct the government to convene an all-party meeting to find ways to restore peace in the state. The delegation had also alleged that the government was not allowing them to visit the affected areas and was not taking them into confidence.         
	Today, the Opposition stalled the proceedings of the Assembly till afternoon demanding all-party meeting.        
	Though the chief minister gave a statement in the Assembly in the afternoon, he evaded the Opposition demand for an all-party committee.        
	Naveen admitted in the House that the situation in Khandhamal was not fully under control, but quickly added that the scene was improving fast. The situation was under control in other parts of the state, he said.        
	Curfew has been clamped in Phulbani, Baliguda, Tikabali, Barakhama, Raikia, G-Udaygiri, Daringibadi and Tikabali, while prohibitory orders have been clamped throughout the district. Flag marches are being conducted to instil confidence among villagers and ensure peace, Naveen said.        
	The chief minister admitted that the administration had received reports of roads being blocked by trees in interior areas.         
	But, he assured, all arterial district roads that were blocked, have been cleared.         
	Eleven criminal cases have been registered regarding the violation of human rights in Khandhmal alone, while 85 cases have been registered in the state and 167 people have been arrested.        
	The chief minister also issued a warning regarding breaking the law on the floor of the House.         
	So far, four battalions of the central paramilitary force have been requisitioned by the state government, three companies of the RAF and two companies of CRPF has already arrived and has been deployed in sensitive areas. Free kitchens and camps are operating in six blocks, where riot-affected people are being provided police protection.

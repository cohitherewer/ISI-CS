	Keonjhar, May 26: ArcelorMittal officials today exuded confidence that they would be able to commission its proposed greenfield steel plants in Orissa and Jharkhand on schedule.        
	For us, both the projects are important. Equal attention is being paid to both, said Vijay Bhatnagar, ArcelorMittals country chief and member of committee of management.        
	Both the projects are moving at good pace, said greenfield projects CEO Sanak Mishra. Asked which project is moving faster, he said: A lot of preparatory works are going on. They are running neck-to-neck.        
	ArcelorMittal had signed an MoU with the Jharkhand government in October, 2005, for setting up a 12MTPA greenfield plant along with a 1,500MW captive power plant. A year later, it signed another MoU with Orissa in December, 2006, for a greenfield steel plant of the same capacity.        
	Our target is to commission phase I (6MT each) by 2011-12, Mishra added.        
	Bhatnagar said the company was going to set up a design and engineering centre in Calcutta, which would not only cater to the needs of Orissa and Jharkhand plants, but also plants world wide. In our wisdom, Calcutta will be the right location, he said.        
	ArcelorMittal, worlds largest steel manufacturer and 4th largest mining company, is operating in 60 countries and producing steel in 27 nations. A technical team is busy in choosing worlds best technology for Orissa and Jharkhand plants, Bhatnagar said.        
	Presenting a progress report of Orissa project, Mishra said the feasibility study report had already been submitted and the detailed project report was under preparation and expected to be ready by next month. Socio-economic survey of the project has been completed and a detailed rehabilitation and resettlement plan was submitted to the state government, Mishra said.        
	Mishra said 17 villages in Patna tehsil in Keonjhar district were to be affected by the mega steel plant projects. Enumeration of displaced families was under way and they would be provided with house, electricity and water supply. Besides, the company would set up an industrial training institute near the site to impart vocational training to local youths. Those who qualify would be employed in the plant, he said.        
	The company would require 6,000 acres for steel plant, another 1,000 acres for the captive power plant and 750 acres for building a modern township. Water resources study and road connectivity were in place too, he said.        
	In Jharkhand the company zeroed in on Torpa in Khunti district for its proposed plant.        
	Meanwhile, villagers of Patna tehsil today staged demonstration against the proposed steel plant.

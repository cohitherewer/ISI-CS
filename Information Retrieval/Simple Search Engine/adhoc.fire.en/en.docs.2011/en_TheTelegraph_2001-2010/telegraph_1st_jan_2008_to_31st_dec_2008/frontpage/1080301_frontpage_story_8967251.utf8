The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Loan breather for farmers 
                                                                                                           Loan breather for farmers 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Rrich pickings                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 29: The one big announcement of the Union budget was the mammoth Rs 60,000-crore loan waiver for indebted farmers, which finance minister P. Chidambaram described as a historic decision.        
	The farm loans to marginal and small farmers constitute about 4 per cent of the bank loans.         
	 While the announcement evoked slogans of a populist budget from the Opposition, investors dumped bank stocks, spooked by the thought that their shaky fundamentals wouldnt justify the valuations.        
	 All agricultural loans disbursed by scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks and co-operative credit institutions up to March 31, 2007 and overdue as on December 31, 2007, will be covered in the scheme, said Chidambaram.        
	For marginal farmers, holding up to 1 hectare of land, and small farmers (1 to 2 hectares), there will be a complete waiver of all loans that were overdue on December 31, 2007 and which remained unpaid until February 29, 2008. The total value of overdue loans being waived is estimated at Rs 50,000 crore, said Chidambaram.        
	 For bigger farmers, the budget proposed a waiver of Rs 10,000 crore as a one-time settlement, provided the farmers repaid 75 per cent of their loans that were overdue on December 31, 2007.        
	About three crore small and marginal farmers are likely to be benefited from the debt waiver, while another one crore peasants are estimated to get relief under the scheme.        
	The chief economist of Bank of Baroda, Rupa Rege Nitsure said, From the banks perspective, the waiver of small farm loans is not a negative thing entirely as these are the most stubborn NPAs on banks loan books. There is also comfort that the government will partially bear the burden for banks.        
	Chidambaram said the farmers covered under the scheme would be eligible for fresh loans after the waiver. Loans rescheduled earlier would also be eligible for relief under the new scheme, he added.        
	Bank balance sheet        
	Though the proposals initially led to worries about its impact on the balance sheet of banks, bankers heaved a sigh of relief when word came in that they would be reimbursed for the write-off. At a news conference following the budget, Chidambaram said that liquidity would be provided to banks over a three-year period. He, however, did not give further details.        
	However, confusion persists on which loans will be reimbursed. A senior banker from a public sector bank said that there were two options available to the government  it could reimburse banks for those non-performing loans which have been already provided for in their books or only repay those where provisions so far have not been made. Banks have to make provisions ranging from 25-100 per cent on their loans.        
	Its unlikely that the government will settle for the first option as it will be very profitable for banks. They could therefore reimburse for only those amount where provisions have not been made so far, the banker said.                          
	Vaibhav Agrawal, banking analyst at Angel Broking, avers that in the event of the government choosing the second option, it can still be positive for banks. If the government bears part of the burden, banks will not have to make provisions to that extent. This is a positive as the cash generated from this can be used for lending, he added.        
	There were senior bankers who had other apprehensions. While the finance ministers move to implement a loan waiver scheme for small and marginal farmers will provide immediate relief to the community, and is a necessary step strictly as a one-time move, one needs to be cautious that it does not set a precedent for other sectors going forward, says Gautam Vir, CEO and managing director, Development Credit Bank.                                                                     
	We are pretty happy with the waiver of loans for marginal farmers. I expect this to cover about 40-45 per cent of the farmer population, said U.S. Awasthi, managing director, Indian Farmers Fertiliser Co-op Limited.        
	 Anoop Bhaskar, head of equity at UTI MF, said based on the interaction with the PSU banks management it was expected that the government will make budgetary provision to enable banks waive off the outstanding amounts. However, post-budget, the finance minister has mentioned a lack of budgetary provision for this populist move, which could expand fiscal deficit to GDP ratio by 1 per cent.        
	 The Left parties welcomed the loan waiver but said it would not benefit most farmers as they had taken credit from local moneylenders.

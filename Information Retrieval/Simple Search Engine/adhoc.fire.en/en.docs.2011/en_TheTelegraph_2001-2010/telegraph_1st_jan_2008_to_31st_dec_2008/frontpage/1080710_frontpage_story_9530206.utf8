          MANINI CHATTERJEE                               
	Toyako, July 9: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, no longer dependent on the Lefts support for survival, today shed all coyness about Indias engagement with the United States by declaring that the Indo-US relationship has truly acquired the characteristic of a genuine strategic partnership.        
	It was the intention of his government that India and the United States must stand tall, stand shoulder to shoulder and thats what is going to happen, he said.        
	The 50-minute meeting between the Prime Minister and President George W. Bush at the picturesque Toya resort here early this morning was marked by a bonhomie and camaraderie that spilled into the formal statements they made.        
	The one-on-one meeting between the two leaders, both nearing the end of their terms in office, not only sought to put a decisive seal on the Indo-US nuclear deal but also propel bilateral relations to a pitch it had never reached before.        
	If Bush described their meeting as a typical conversation between friends and stressed that he respected the Prime Minister and India a lot, Manmohan returned the compliment in full measure by thanking the US President for his personal magnificent contribution to the evolution of our relationship.        
	Oblivious to the possible domestic political repercussions  including on restive sections of the Samajwadi Party  of such gushing praise for one of the most unpopular US presidents in history, Manmohan said he was happy to report to the President that our relations have moved forward handsomely since our first meeting in July 2005.         
	We have made progress in all areas. We have made progress in nuclear co-operation, space co-operation, defence co-operation, educational exchanges, our working together in multilateral institutions for the success of the Doha Round.         
	And then, in words that seemed to confirm the Lefts apprehensions about the UPAs foreign policy, the Prime Minister said: And I am very pleased with the state of our relationship, which has truly acquired the characteristic of a genuine strategic partnership.         
	Thanking Bush for his personal contribution, he said: And all I can say is our relationship with the United States has never been in such good shape as it is today.         
	Indirectly accusing the Left of being thoughtless in its opposition to close ties with the US, Manmohan went on to say: And it is the intention of my government, as I believe it is also the will of the Indian people, particularly the thinking segments of our population, that in this increasingly interdependent world that we live in, whether it is a question of managing the global economy, India and the United States must stand tall, shoulder to shoulder, and thats what is going to happen.         
	In his remarks, Bush, too, used the S-word, talking of the need to develop not only a new strategic relationship, but a relationship that addresses some of the worlds problems.        
	On the contentious 123 Agreement, he only said: We talked about the India-US nuclear deal, and how important that is for our respective countries.        
	In his typical Texan style, Bush ended by saying: All in all, it was a really good meeting amongst two friends. And so, Mr Prime Minister, thank you for joining us today, and congratulations on your leadership at home.        
	The two leaders then warmly shook hands, with Bush even giving a patronising pat on Manmohans back before they both dispersed, only to meet at multilateral fora through the day.

	New Delhi, July 4: The bitterness of an impending break-up and the flirtations of a budding romance played out in agonising slow motion in the corridors of power today, leaving everyone guessing about the actual dates and modalities of both the divorce and the wedding that are in the offing.        
	Samajwadi Party leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh held back-to-back meetings with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at his Race Course Road residence and with Sonia Gandhi at 10 Janpath but neither meeting led to any conclusive announcement of a tie-up with the UPA  just yet.        
	The same tantalising uncertainty marked the timing of the break-up between the Left parties and the UPA.        
	After a meeting of leaders of the four Left parties, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat read out a letter addressed to Pranab Mukherjee seeking to know definitely whether the government was taking up the safeguards agreement with the IAEA board of governors and demanded a reply by July 7.        
	The Lefts ultimatum left the Congress fuming with party spokespersons using unusually harsh language against their political allies who are on the verge of turning adversaries, giving a glimpse of the bitterness that is set to return to the Left-Congress discourse after years of an uneasy concord.        
	Congresss chief spokesperson Veerappa Moily accused the Left of showing a lack of courtesy and betraying desperation and frustration while Abhishek Manu Singhvi gave a lecture on political etiquette, pronouncing that sovereign governments or political parties cannot be subjected to deadlines.        
	But his rather prissy retort could not hide the fact that the political drama in the capital was feverishly unfolding behind closed doors under the shadow of the deadline to clinch the next steps of the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	The government, unmindful of US Congressman Gary Ackermans repeated time-is-running-out warnings, chose to remain deliberately vague on the timeline.        
	Briefing reporters on the Prime Ministers visit to the G8 Summit from July 7-9, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said: I have always avoided all questions about timeframe. But went on to add: We want to go ahead with it (the deal), we will do our best, we will go ahead with it as soon as we can.                  
	The governments refusal to spell out exactly when it will approach the IAEA, sources said, was linked to the continuing uncertainty over the nature of the support being offered by the Samajwadi Party.        
	After getting former President A.P.J. Kalams endorsement of the nuclear pact last evening, the Samajwadi leaders today iterated that they were satisfied with the Prime Ministers clarifications to their queries and stressed that the deal was in national interest.        
	But if the N-deal has passed muster, details of the M-deal remain to be ironed out, sources said. On the face of it, the main agenda under discussion between the Congress and Samajwadi top brass at 10 Janpath today was their future alliance in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Sceptics, however, pointed out that with elections several months away, discussing a seat-sharing formula was a little premature at this stage, hinting that extraneous issues could well be part of a hard bargain the Samajwadis are seeking to extract from the Congress.        
	The Samajwadi leaders did not give their customary bites after their historic meeting with Sonia today but Amar later reminded a news channel that his party had given a letter of support to the UPA even before the Manmohan Singh government took oath back in May 2004  and, as such, was a supporting party already.        
	That intriguing comment is not likely to bring much comfort to either the government or the Congress.        
	The government and the Congress want a firm, clear, and preferably unconditional reiteration of support from the Samajwadis at this stage. In the absence of such a public commitment, the government cannot rest easy that it will win a vote of confidence once the Left withdraws support.        
	On the other hand, if the Samajwadis were to either join the government or spell out its firm support in the coming days, the Centre can  without more hesitation  reply to the Left and announce the date it will go to the IAEA.        
	Efforts to persuade the Samajwadis to adopt one of the two options may take another few days.        
	The Left leadership  smarting under the double betrayal by first Sonia and then their Samajwadi allies  are beginning to run out of patience, sources said.        
	 The Left leaders decided not to precipitate matters while the Prime Minister was on foreign soil, but the endgame could draw to an end soon after Manmohan Singh returns to India in the early hours of July 10.        
	The government might like to delay the divorce with the communists till the marriage with the socialists is solemnised, but Left sources indicated that they would not play along any more.        
	Pranab Mukherjee might offer to hold a final meeting of the UPA-Left committee as a delaying tactic but we are not interested in any more meetings, a Left leader said.

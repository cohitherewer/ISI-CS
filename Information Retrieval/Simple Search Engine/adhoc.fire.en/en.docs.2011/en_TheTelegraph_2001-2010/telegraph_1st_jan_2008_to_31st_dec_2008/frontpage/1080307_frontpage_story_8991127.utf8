          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, March 6: The people of Darjeeling hills will get back the old Subash Ghisingh after March 10, when he resigns as caretaker administrator of the DGHC and once again takes up the cudgels for Gorkhaland.         
	On his return to Siliguri from Delhi today, the GNLF chief said once he quits, he would be freed of all administrative responsibilities. The old Subash Ghisingh would then be back, the GNLF leader told reporters at the rest house of the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited. I have told the Prime Minister that a fresh dialogue on Gorkhaland should be opened.        
	The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has banned the GNLF chiefs entry to the hills and in the face of indefinite bandh and hunger strike, Ghisingh was forced to take shelter in Pintail Village on the outskirts of Siliguri the last time he came from Delhi on February 18.         
	He had been to the capital then to mobilise support in favour of the Sixth Schedule bill, which the Morcha has been opposing. At that time the Morcha had even set up blockades in front of Pintail.         
	This time, police did not take any risk and Ghisingh was whisked away to the rest house at Second Mile off Sevoke Road after he landed at Bagdogra in the afternoon.        
	The GNLF chief also said he has asked the district magistrate of Darjeeling to keep a draft of his resignation letter ready. I will submit my resignation on March 10, irrespective of my place of stay.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, May 7: The ministry of human resource development has decided to dump a location slotted for a new Indian Institute of Technology on a river bank outside Patna because the site gets flooded every monsoon.        
	But the likely replacement site, offered by the Bihar government, is sandwiched between a national highway and a railway track, triggering concerns of excessive noise pollution at the new IIT.        
	Top government officials said that a team of experts today visited Bihta, recommended as the location for the new IIT by the Nitish Kumar government, to evaluate alternate sites for the Bihar IIT. The new IIT will officially start functioning this academic session, minus a campus, with students likely to be accommodated and taught initially at IIT, Kanpur.        
	Located 100km outside Patna on the eastern bank of the Sone, Bihta was first identified for the purpose by the Bihar government in 2005. A site of 550 acres was marked between the river and a National Highway. To the east of the highway lies a railway track. But the team of experts, in its visit to Bihta in 2007 learnt that the site identified next to the river suffers from waterlogging.        
	Asked to find an alternate site, the state government has, however, only shifted the location eastwards.         
	There are issues of high noise pollution which may arise. But we are likely to accept the site, a member of the visiting team said.

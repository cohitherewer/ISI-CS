                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Jenna to wed on Saturday
                                Jenna: Last to know                            
	Washington, May 6 (AP): Talk about hush-hush wedding planning. First daughter Jenna Bush was the last in the family to know she was getting married on Saturday, May 10.        
	Months ago, her fiance, Henry Hager, told Jennas twin sister that he wanted to propose. Then at the Camp David presidential retreat, Hager asked President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush for their daughters hand in marriage.        
	For weeks, the President and Laura Bush kept their lips zipped. Then on August 15, 2007, Hager roused Jenna at 4 am to go hiking on Cadillac Mountain in Acadia National Park in Maine. It was freezing, Jenna recalled. But we got up, and we hiked in the dark for an hour and a half, and then when we got towards the top  with the sunrise  he asked me.        
	Here are the details: Jenna will wear an Oscar de la Renta gown with a small train. More than 200 friends and relatives will attend the outdoor ceremony with dinner and dancing. A tent is being erected at the western White House. There are 14 bridesmaids.         
	Barbara Bush, Jennas twin, is the maid of honour. She helped Hager make decisions about the ring. The diamond, a Hager family heirloom, was reset in a ring that also features sapphires.        
	Yesterday, the President disclosed that Jenna will say: I do near a lake at the ranch  in front of a giant cross made of Texas limestone. The cross, built for the wedding, will serve as a landmark at the ranch for years to come. The President said that was his contribution to the wedding that the Bushes are trying to keep a low-key affair.

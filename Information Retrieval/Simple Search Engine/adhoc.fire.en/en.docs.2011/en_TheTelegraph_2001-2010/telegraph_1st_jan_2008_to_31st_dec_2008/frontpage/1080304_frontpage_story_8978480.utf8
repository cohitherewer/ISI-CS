	New Delhi, March 3: The producers of Jodhaa Akbar moved the Supreme Court today, challenging a ban on screening in some states and citing its impact on collections.
    
	 The petitioner (UTV Software Communications Limited) apprehends that other states may also ban the film with the objective of gaining political mileage, said the petition, mentioned in the apex court on behalf of Jodhaa Akbar by counsel Indu Malhotra. 
    
	These states, it said, have not banned the movie officially but only issued administrative orders. In cities of Haryana and Uttarakhand, the petition said, it has been banned only on the basis of oral orders issued by local authorities/police authorities. In other states like Rajasthan, no cinema is willing to exhibit the movie.
    
	The petition said the movie had been cleared for exhibition and screening by the censor board. 
    
	The right to exhibit a film is part of the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed to all citizens under Article 19(1)(A) of the Constitution and it is being trampled by various state governments with the sole objective of gaining political mileage, the petition said. 
    
	Fundamental rights could only be curtailed by bringing in a law imposing reasonable restrictions on limited grounds such as public order, which implies a serious law and order problem or a breach of peace and not a mere threat of agitation or opposition.
    
	The movie was well received and was running to packed houses before the ban. UTV claimed that the movie had cost around Rs 41 crore to produce and another Rs 4 crore had been spent on publicity. The company is suffering losses every day because of the ban, it said. 
    
	The life of a movie when it earns revenues is only the first few weeks and, thereafter, it becomes stale and also becomes available in the grey market, it said. 
    
	The petition will come up for hearing tomorrow.

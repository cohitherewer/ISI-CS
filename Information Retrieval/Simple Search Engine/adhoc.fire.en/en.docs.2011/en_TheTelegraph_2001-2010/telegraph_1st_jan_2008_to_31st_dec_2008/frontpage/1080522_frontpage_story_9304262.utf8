The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Assam tea loss is Bengal gain
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Assam tea loss is Bengal gain
  - Companies skirt Guwahati auction        A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Guwahati, May 21: At least 10 major companies with gardens in Assam are bypassing the Guwahati Tea Auction Centre and selling their produce through the Calcutta Tea Auction Centre, causing a 17 million-kg drop in sales in the state.        
	State industry and commerce minister Pradyut Bordoloi spelt out the shocker at a news conference today, doling out statistics to prove his point.        
	The Guwahati auction centre sold 159m kg in 2000 but last year the figure came down to 142m kg, whereas the Calcutta auction sold 140m kg last year, 42m kg more than the amount sold in 2000, he said.        
	Besides the state losing out on revenue, the drop in sales has earned the Guwahati Tea Auction Centre the dubious distinction of being a storehouse of mediocre tea.        
	This, despite the fact that GTAC was the worlds third largest in volume of business after the auction centres in Mombasa in Kenya and Colombo in Sri Lanka. In terms of business in CTC, GTAC was the worlds second largest after Mombasa.         
	The minister said the government has approached these companies and requested them to sell at least some percentage of their total produce through the Guwahati Tea Auction Centre.        
	We have also asked the Guwahati Tea Auction Centre to go all out for aggressive marketing. We cannot be complacent. It is the nonchalant attitude of GTAC that the Calcutta auction centre is taking advantage of, he said.        
	Assams annual tea production at present is just over 500m kg, which is 55 per cent of the countrys total produce.        
	However, there have been complaints regarding the quality of Assam tea  especially those produced in bought-leaf factories.        
	Bordoloi said the decline in quality had reflected in one of the major buyers of Assam tea  the Tata-owned Tetley  procuring just 15 per cent of its requirement from Assam as against the earlier figure of 70 per cent.        
	We have information that tea from Kenya and Sri Lanka have replaced Assam tea for Tata Tea Tetley product. The company buys only 15 per cent of tea from Assam for its premium brand today whereas it was 70 per cent of Assam tea earlier, Bordoloi said.        
	The minister said the bought-leaf factories  which buy green leaf from gardens and make tea  were responsible for giving Assam tea a bad name. These factories, numbering around 210, send their poor quality produce directly to Ahmedabad, Mumbai or Calcutta through their agents. The state is not only losing revenue but Assam tea has got a bad name as far as quality is concerned, he said.        
	As an antidote, the government has decided to set a quality benchmark for these factories. Unless there is a benchmark for bought-leaf factories, they will not give importance to quality, the minister said.        
	He said the government would also start issuing certificates of quality to bought- leaf factories and impose a 20 paise cess per kg on tea produced by them.        
	Bought-leaf factories produce around 110m kg per year.        
	The only silver lining, the minister said, was the fact that tea production in the state has increased to almost 500m kg from 360m kg about 10 years ago.

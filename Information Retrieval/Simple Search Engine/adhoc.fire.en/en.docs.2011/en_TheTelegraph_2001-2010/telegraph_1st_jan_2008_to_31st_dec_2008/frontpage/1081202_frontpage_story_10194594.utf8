          JAYANTH JACOB                             The lone arrested terrorist, identified by police as Mohammed Azmal Amir Kasab, 21, at an undisclosed location in Mumbai. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: India today asked Pakistan for evidence of action against terrorists who masterminded the attack in Mumbai even as US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice was on her way to take a measure of the strain in relations between New Delhi and Islamabad.        
	Rices unscheduled visit  she is due here on Wednesday  will follow the summoning of Pakistan high commissioner Shahid Malik who was formally conveyed Indias concern and demand this evening.        
	He (Malik) was informed that the recent terrorist attack on Mumbai was carried out by elements from Pakistan, a statement from the external affairs ministry said. India expects that strong action would be taken against those elements, whosoever they may be, responsible for this outrage, the statement added.        
	The summoning of the envoy comes after foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee talked of elements in Pakistan being behind the terror attacks. But the formality with which the message was given today is meant to convey the seriousness with which India intends to pursue the requests and demands it made to the Pakistan government.        
	It was conveyed to the high commissioner that Pakistans actions needed to match the sentiments expressed by its leadership that it wishes to have a qualitatively new relationship with India, the Indian statement said.        
	As the freeze between New Delhi and Islamabad sets in, the arrival of Rice, who has been talking to Indian and Pakistani leaders, highlights the concern in Washington over the immediate future in South Asia when US forces are operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan.        
	Pakistans military authorities had warned that they would move about 1 lakh troops from their border with Afghanistan to that with India, effectively pulling them out of the US-led war against the Taliban, because Islamabad fears a military reprisal.        
	Rice, who will fly in from London after a pre-arranged Nato meeting, will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as well as foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Rice today said Pakistan must provide complete co-operation to India in the terror investigations. The secretary of state said she would not jump to conclusions but Pakistan must let the evidence lead wherever it takes the investigators.        
	Pakistan is also sparing no diplomatic efforts. Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari had telephone conversations with the Presidents of France and Afghanistan and the UK foreign minister, seeking their help to avert a conflict with India.        
	Repercussions that a possible stand-off between the two countries can have on the fight on terror in Afghanistan  a key foreign policy imperative of President-elect Barack Obama as well  will form part of her discussions here.

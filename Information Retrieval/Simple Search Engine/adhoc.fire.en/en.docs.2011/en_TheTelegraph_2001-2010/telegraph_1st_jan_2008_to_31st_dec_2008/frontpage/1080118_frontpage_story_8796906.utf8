     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Imphal, Jan. 17: As many as 19 people were drowned or crushed to death when a rickety wooden bridge caved in under the weight of a truckload of passengers in a remote area of Manipur where bus services are unheard of.
    
	But for the armys prompt response to the accident, which occurred close to the Indo-Myanmar border in Churachandpur district this morning, there would have been fewer survivors than the 20-odd people who escaped with injuries.
    
	A defence spokesman, Col Rajesh Mishra, said the truck was overloaded and plunged into a tributary of the Tuivai river when the weak bridge at Gasuanlui, near Behiang village in Singhat subdivision of Churachandpur, gave way.
    
	Behiang is a stones throw from Myanmar and over 100km from the district headquarters. The area is bereft of the presence of a civil administration, much less basic facilities like a bus service to the nearest town. 
    
	The sheer weight of the truckload of passengers bro-ught the wooden bridge down. The casualties increased because the water level is high despite this being the dry season. Some drowned and a few came under the debris of the truck, Col Mishra said.
    
	The nearest army post at Singhat received news of the accident just before noon, after which the 57 Mountain Division sent a team of doctors and paramedical staff to the site. 
    
	The Churachandpur administration, too, sent medical and police teams, but it was left to the army to do the emergency rescue act.
    
	Soldiers brought up all 19 bodies and took the injured passengers to Singhat Civil Hospital for first aid. An army convoy carrying the injured then headed for the district headquarters. 
    
	The casualties included nine women and three children. 
    
	The army spokesman said some of the injured were in a critical condition and might have to be shifted to a hospital bigger than the one in Churachandpur.
    
	A source said trucks carrying people beyond capacity was a regular sight in those parts. A bus plies between Singhat and Churachandpur town, but there is none between Behiang and the headquarters. Only trucks ferry passengers from Behiang to other places and back. 
    
	Even trucks do not operate along this route at frequent intervals. So when a truck leaves the border area, it is invariably packed with passengers. Todays accident proved it could be invariably fatal, too.

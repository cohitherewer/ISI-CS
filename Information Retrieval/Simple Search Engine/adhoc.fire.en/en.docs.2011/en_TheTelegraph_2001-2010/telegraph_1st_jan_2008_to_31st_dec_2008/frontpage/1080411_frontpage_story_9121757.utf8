          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Security matters                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 10: Keeping in mind the threat perception of the 12th century Jagannath temple in Puri, the state government has decided to set up a separate police station for the ancient shrine.        
	Home secretary T.K. Mishra said the existing outpost located near the temple would be upgraded to a full-fledged police station with around 200 personnel.         
	The new police station would be named Singhadwar police station.         
	Besides, three more outposts in Puri  Baselisahi, Baliapanda and Talabania  would be upgraded to police stations, he added. With this, the number of police stations in Puri would be seven.         
	Also, patrolling on beaches would be intensified to provide security to tourists, he said adding that men in khaki would be posted at tourist assistance booths too.        
	Another police station would be set up on the Puri-Konark Marine Drive at Ramachandi, a popular tourist spot, said director-general of police G.C. Nanda.        
	These decisions were taken at a meeting chaired by chief secretary Ajit Tripathy to set up tourist police cells in the coastal districts of Puri, Khurda, Cuttack, Balasore and Ganjam.        
	The meeting felt the need to deploy more policemen and mobile forces to take care of tourists security. And the police department was asked to submit concrete proposals to this effect, said a senior police officer present at the meeting.         
	The need for stepping up security arrangements at tourist spots, especially in Puri and Konark, was felt in the wake of growing assaults on tourists recently.         
	The police also decided to launch a special drive to dispose of pending cases of atrocities on scheduled castes. A review revealed that 1,751 cases were pending since 2000 against 9,889 total cases reported during the last seven years.         
	A dearth of senior officers  of deputy superintendent rank  was holding up the cases. For, according to the Prevention of Atrocities Act, only a police officer of DSP rank (or higher) was empowered to investigate allegations of atrocities on scheduled castes.

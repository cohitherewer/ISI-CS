	Los Angeles, June 28 (Reuters): Actress Uma Thurman, star of the Kill Bill movies, is engaged to London financier Arpad Arki Busson, according to news reports yesterday.        
	I can confirm she is engaged, her representative Stephen Huvane told celebrity website People.com in a posting yesterday.        
	Huvane was not immediately able to be reached for further comment. People.com said the pair began dating last summer, and since then their relationship has blossomed quickly. Thurman, 38, has a long list of film credits that include roles in Pulp Fiction and The Producers. She was previously married to actor Ethan Hawke, with whom she has two children, as well as to actor Gary Oldman.        
	Businessman and philanthropist Busson was until 2005 involved with Australian model Elle Macpherson.

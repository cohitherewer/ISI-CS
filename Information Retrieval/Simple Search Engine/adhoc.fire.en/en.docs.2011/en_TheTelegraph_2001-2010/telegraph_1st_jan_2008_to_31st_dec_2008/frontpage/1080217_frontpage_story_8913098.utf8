          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Some of the accused in custody. (Naeem Ansari)                                  
	Lucknow, Feb. 16: Three railway policemen and four others gagged and raped an 11-year-old girl near Kanpur Central station last night before smashing her head with a stone slab from the tracks.        
	The seven attackers, who included a vendor and a railway contractor, barged into the girls home in the slums adjoining the station around 9pm and beat up her eight-year-old brother when he tried to resist, Kanpur police said.        
	They then dragged the girl out, gangraped her and murdered her while neighbours in the Railway Colony shanties cowered behind their doors.        
	The victims mother, Sarita Devi, a labourer from Bihars Munger who works for a railway contractor, had not returned home from work when the incident took place.        
	The policemen had been eyeing my daughter for sometime. They had asked me several times to send her to them, said a sobbing Sarita, 32.        
	Our investigating officers who saw the body were horrified. She had gaping wounds in her head, special superintendent of police Anand Swaroop said.        
	Railway Protection Force jawan Vinay Rai, 45, vendor Pappu Kumar, 32, Government Railway Polices Vinod Rai and small-time contractor J.P. Yadav  both in their 40s  were arrested after the girls brother named six of the attackers.         
	The police are looking for the other accused, who include GRPs Manoj Rai.        
	The post-mortem has confirmed rape and the medical examination of the arrested RPF jawan suggests he raped the girl, SSP Swaroop said.        
	The girl had gone to the station for a cup of tea and snacks around 7.30pm. The three railway policemen were drunk. They followed her home and saw that her mother was out, an investigating officer said.        
	As the policemen took turns raping the girl at a corner of the colony, home to railway contractors labourers, the other four accused joined them.        
	The neighbours said the girls muffled groans horrified them but they were too afraid to step out. They alleged that the contractors goons ruled the area with railway police patronage and had raped several slum women.        
	After the rape, my daughter tried to crawl back inside our shanty but they killed her, said Sarita, whose husband Rajendra Prasad Keshri is in jail for petty crimes.        
	The police took the girl to hospital but she was declared dead on arrival, deputy inspector-general Brijbhushan said.

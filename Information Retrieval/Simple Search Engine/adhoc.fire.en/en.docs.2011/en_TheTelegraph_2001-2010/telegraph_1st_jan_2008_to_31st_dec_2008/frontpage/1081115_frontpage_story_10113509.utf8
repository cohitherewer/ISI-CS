	Srinagar, Nov. 14: Snow is threatening to play poll spoilsport after separatists tried to derail the Jammu and Kashmir elections.        
	Kashmir today received the seasons first snowfall, prompting the Valleys biggest mainstream party  the National Conference  to demand postponement of the polls. The first phase of the Assembly elections is only three days away.        
	The snow came down as paramilitary and police personnel packed the streets of Srinagar and its neighbouring areas to thwart an anti-poll rally planned by Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani. He was scheduled to return from Delhi today and address a gathering in Srinagar.         
	Kashmiris woke up to a thick blanket of snow this morning. T.N. Jyotshi, the assistant director of the meteorological department, said Srinagar received 44.6mm of snow between 8.30am and 2.30pm.        
	Qazigund, Pahalgam and Kupwara experienced 32.6mm, 18.7mm and 2.7mm of snowfall, respectively, since 8.30am. It is still snowing in Kupwara, Pahalgam and Kokernag. But snow has almost stopped in Srinagar, he said in the evening.         
	If the people are struggling to stay warm, the political parties face a different battle  of taking their election campaign further in the hostile weather. The parties in the fray have been toiling to ensure a respectable turnout in the face of a poll boycott call by separatists.         
	National Conference president Omar Abdullah was the first to cry hoarse. People will not be able to exercise their franchise and political parties wont be able to campaign in the snowfall which has occurred not just in the upper reaches of the Valley but also in Srinagar city that has never ever had it in mid-November, he said.         
	The Election Commission should take a fresh look and postpone the elections to March or April next year.         
	The separatists, too, have been struggling to take their anti-election campaign forward, but for a different reason  most of their leaders have been booked under the public safety act and arrested.        
	Snow spoiled Geelanis plans and he was stranded in Delhi as his flight could not take off.         
	In anticipation of his rally, however, the authorities clamped an undeclared curfew in many parts of Srinagar.         
	The restrictions and the snow compounded the problems of ordinary citizens. Power and communication lines snapped in several places.         
	Chief electoral officer B.R. Sharma said the poll panel had decided to go ahead with the elections. We have drawn up contingency plans for the polls. We are using choppers to take materials to these areas, he said.         
	The Met department has some good news, though. The weather is likely to improve tomorrow afternoon, Jyotshi said.

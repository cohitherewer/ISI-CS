          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 15: The four persons arrested yesterday in connection with the murder of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati have been labelled Maoists apparently to contain communal tension in Kandhamal.        
	At least 40 people, mostly Christians, died in communal clashes that plagued the district soon after the murder of the seer and his four associates on August 23.        
	Director-general of police M.M. Praharaj claimed that one of the arrested is a hardcore Maoist, while the rest are rebel sympathisers.         
	However, Hindu organisations are not convinced. They suspect that the real killers are still at large. VHP state secretary Gouri Prasad Rath said the police were trying to prove Maoists had killed their leader. But the people know the truth. Its also surprising that the police, who had failed to arrest the killers for so many months, suddenly detained the culprits just on before the deadline expired, Rath said, adding that the VHP would go ahead with its decision to call a bandh in Orissa on December 25.        
	At a rally about a month ago, Sangh Parivar outfits had threatened a bandh on Christmas if the police failed to arrest the seers killers by December 15.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik held talks with a delegation of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati Shradhanjali Samiti, an outfit sponsored by the Sangh Parivar, yesterday and requested them to refrain from observing the bandh. However, Hindu Jagaran Samukhyas state chief Ashok Sahu said the samiti would not relent.        
	A year ago, churches in several districts, including Kandhamal, were ransacked and torched on Christmas disrupting peace for a month. The government is taking guard so that recurrence of such events does not take place this year.         
	After a debate in the Assembly over Kandhamal today, Naveen said: The government will come down heavily on forces who will disturb communal harmony.         
	Leader of Opposition J.B. Patnaik demanded the bandh should be declared illegal.        
	The accused had been identified as Garanath Chalanseth, Bijay Kumar Sanseth, Bhaskar Sunamajhi and Budha alias Budhadeb Naik. They were arrested from the Kotgarh area of Kandhamal. Combing operation is still on in the Chandrapur area, bordering Rayagada district, considered to be a red-hit area, to arrest six others suspected to be involved.         
	The four were produced in court today, but were denied bail, sources said.

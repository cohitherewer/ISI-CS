	Feb. 26: Jodhaa Akbar will be screened in Madhya Pradesh, after Jabalpur High Court today ordered the government to lift the ban it had imposed on Friday.
    
	The Shivraj Singh Chauhan government, which had banned the Ashutosh Gowariker film after Rajputs objected to it, appeared relieved. 
    
	Commercial tax minister Babulal Gaur, whose department had issued the ban, almost welcomed the high court ruling. The government would obey it in letter and spirit, a smiling Gaur said. 
    
	Advocate-general R.N. Singh confirmed that his department would not file a review petition or move the Supreme Court.
    
	UTV Motion Pictures, which produced the film starring Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, had on Saturday moved the high court against the ban.
    
	Chief Justice A.K. Patnaik and Justice Prakash Srivastva today directed the state to lift the ban with immediate effect. Citing Article 19, the judges said the ban amounted to curbing freedom of expression.
    
	In Bhopal, theatre owners and film distributors welcomed the order. Azizuddin, who owns Alpana cinema, said: Our faith in the judiciary has increased.
    
	BJP leaders said the court order had saved the ruling party from further embarrassment. For us, it is a win-win situation. The Rajput community will be indebted to us for standing by them. The court order has saved us from lifting the ban amid pressure from our own ranks, the bureaucracy and civil society, a state BJP functionary said.
    
	Chauhan, who had ordered the ban under pressure from the Rajput Mahasabha and some influential BJP leaders, wanted to withdraw it minutes later. But by then, the order was signed and out, and the media had got wind of it, a source said. 
    
	Rajput Mahasabha representatives declined to comment on todays ruling, saying they would wait till they had read the full judgment. The community claims that Rajput princess Jodhabai was Jehangirs wife and not Akbars, as the film has shown. 
    
	The court has understood that this is an issue that required support, said Ronnie Screwvala, CEO of UTV Software Communications. We felt strongly that the local people (of Madhya Pradesh) were with us. 
    
	This is a huge boost to all advocates of creative freedom in our country, added UTV Motion Pictures director Siddharth Roy Kapur.
    
	The film has grossed Rs 74 crore worldwide in 10 days, including $2.5 million in the US. The collections in Bengal now stand at Rs 2 crore.
    
	The film has been dubbed in Tamil and Telugu as well and will be released in the southern market on March 6. But Kapur said this had nothing to do with the problems the film was facing in the Hindi belt. We had planned a window of two-three weeks before releasing it there. A.R. Rahman has even scored songs in those languages.
    
	As for Rajasthan, Screwvala said they could only continue to appeal. Rajasthan is the last state that is holding out. We have even tried to show them (the protesters) the film but they have refused.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              Gandhi, Bhattacharjee      
	, Calcutta, Nov. 12: Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi has sought a panel of three names that could be considered for his press secretarys post, departing from the usual practice of opting for the nominee selected by the government.        
	A veteran official said he could not recall an earlier instance of any governor asking for such a panel of names to pick a nominee customarily appointed by the government.        
	Dhruba Basu, Gandhis current press secretary, has been transferred to the information and cultural affairs department. Apurba Chatterjee, the chief of bureau of the information department, has been asked to take Basus place, following which the governor sought the panel of names.        
	The governors proposal was conveyed to information and cultural affairs secretary Dilip Chakrabarty by Gandhis secretary K.S. Rajendra Kumar.        
	Basu, too, has written to the government that he is happy with his job at Raj Bhavan  which is being seen by some officials as an expression of willingness to continue in the same post.        
	We have received the letter from the governors secretary. I cannot recall any instance of the governor asking for a panel of names. I had been secretary to the governor earlier and it was the government that decided to appoint me and later transfer me, Chakrabarty said.        
	He said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would have the final word. I cannot take any step as the letter has come from the governors secretary. Thats why I have handed over the communication to the chief minister. Now it is for him to take the final decision, Chakrabarty added.        
	The official said it was the governments prerogative to decide who would be posted where. In this case, the press secretary had been working at Raj Bhavan for eight years and that is a pretty long term. The practice of rotational appointments is generally followed by the government.        
	Contacted by The Telegraph, the governor said: Yes (the letter has been sent), but I have nothing to add to what the government has told you.        
	His secretary said: I cant say exactly whether it is the governments practice to send a panel of names. But we havent yet got any response from the state government.        
	An official of the chief ministers secretariat said Basu had written that he was happy and satisfied working at Raj Bhavan and that at the fag end of his career, he would like to perform his duties with dignity and peace of mind.        
	Writers sources said Basu  who has three years for retirement  was press secretary to former governor Viren J. Shah also. Gandhi retained him after a short interview.

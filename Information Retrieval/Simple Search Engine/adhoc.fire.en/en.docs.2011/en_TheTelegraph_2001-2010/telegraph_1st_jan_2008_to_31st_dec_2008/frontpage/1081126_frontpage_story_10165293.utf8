                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Thai says pirate ship sunk was his trawler
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             The navys picture of the fire-engulfed pirate vessel                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: A pirate vessel the Indian Navy claim to have sunk in the Gulf of Aden last Tuesday was a Thai trawler, CNN reported on its website from Bangkok today.         
	But the navy believes the vessel was commandeered by pirates who had threatened to fire at its frigate, the INS Tabar.         
	CNN quoted the Thai trawlers owner as saying his ship was fired at by the Tabar when it was being hijacked.         
	The Indian Navy yesterday released photographs of the pirate vessel, which the defence force described as a mother ship from which the pirates were operating, that shows fireballs rising from the boat as if they were explosions.        
	Indian Navy spokesperson Commander Nirad Sinha said: Obviously, the ship was laden with explosives. As far as we are concerned, we fired after we were fired at. If it was a Thai boat, what was it doing in an act of piracy?         
	Shortly after the incident last Tuesday, the Indian Navys effort was hailed by the International Maritime Bureau as a pro-active step and a victory against pirates operating off Somalia.         
	CNN reported from Bangkok that 14 sailors are missing from the trawler, the Ekawat Nava 5, from which the pirates were alleged to have threatened the Tabar.        
	 Indian naval crew on board the Tabar reported having seen gun-toting men in the vessel. The navy spokesperson also said the pirates threatened to draw up alongside the Tabar to blow it up. It was a risk that a warship like the Tabar, fully armed and loaded with explosives, could not take.        
	 In Bangkok, the owner of the trawler Wicharn Sirichaiekawat said a crew member was found alive after being adrift for six days and another was confirmed dead.         
	The Indian Navy had reported seeing two small fast boats in which the suspected pirates were said to have escaped. CNN reported that Wicharn said his ship made a distress call on November 18 when it was chased by pirates in two speedboats.         
	Wicharn said the Ekawat Nava 5 was sailing from Oman to Yemen to deliver fishing equipment. The Indian Navy had said the Tabars encounter took place on the high seas south-west of the Omani port of Salalah.        
	Wicharn said he was informed by the Cambodian crewman who survived the gunfire and drifted in the ocean for six days. The sailor was found by a passing ship and is now in a hospital in Yemen.

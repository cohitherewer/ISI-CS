                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         China expresses surprise over India's disappointment with its NSG stand
            New Delhi, Sept. 9 : Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, who is on a three-day visit to India, has said that he is surprised by reports that India is disappointed by China's stand at the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) meeting in Vienna.   Jiechi, who met External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee on the second day of his state visit on Monday, told this to a private television news channel.  Indian diplomats had expressed disappointment after China appeared less than keen on supporting a U.S. proposal to lift a global ban on nuclear trade with India during the 45-nation NSG meeting in Vienna this weekend.  Jeichi had called on Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh on Monday.  India and China signed agreements to promote higher education. The two foreign ministers are expected to discuss the festering border dispute.  China and India, the world''s fastest growing major economies and most populous nations, face many of the same challenges, including stability in Asia and the struggle against terrorism.  In addition to solving a border dispute dating back to a 1962 war between the two countries, the two Asian giants are seeking to push bilateral trade beyond the present thirty billion U.S. dollars.  China has hardened its position on the border dispute by restating its claim to the Buddhist monastery at Tawang, and Indian security forces have complained of frequent border incursions by Chinese forces last year.  The Indo-U.S. civilian nuclear deal now requires a U.S. congressional approval before the deal is finally signed.

          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Nov. 2: Kerala police today gave clean chit to the two youths from Jharkhand taken into custody yesterday for moving around with a suspected member of the National Development Front (NDF).        
	The youths, Vijay Shankar (19) and Ramni Kant (22), were detained for interrogations from Tanur railway station, around 45km from Calicut, yesterday around 10pm. A suspected member of the NDF, Moiuddin Kutty, too, was also detained. He is still in custody.        
	The NDF is currently under police scanner for recruiting youths for terrorist activities. Four NDF recruits were caught in Kashmir in the recent past. One was killed in an encounter there.         
	The NDF, after religious conversion, allegedly trains youths and sends them as mercenaries for projects.         
	Yesterday, the police may have overreacted, but it is true that the NDF is recruiting young men and posting them as mercenaries after religious conversion. The situation is alarming, said a senior police officer from Kerala, who works with the intelligence wing.         
	What made the police doubly suspicious was the PAN card that Vijay Shankar was carrying.         
	During interrogation, Shankar, who is still a student, said he got the card to avail a loan to purchase a motorcycle. He also expressed his desire to join the stock trading business one day, where a PAN card is mandatory.        
	It was also found that both the youths had joined an embroidery-designing course at the Institute of Textiles and Fashion Technology, Tirupur, near Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. The two intend to leave the state after the three-month course is over.         
	They dont seem to have links with terror groups. However, Kutty is still being interrogated, said inspector-general (Thiruvananthapuram) A.K. Sinha.

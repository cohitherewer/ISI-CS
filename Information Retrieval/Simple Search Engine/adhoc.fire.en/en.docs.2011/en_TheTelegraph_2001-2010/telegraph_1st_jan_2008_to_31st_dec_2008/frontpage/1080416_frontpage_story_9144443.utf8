  - Centre open to rights probe, SC told        OUR CORRESPONDENT                            A Salwa Judum camp in Chhattisgarh                                        
	New Delhi, April 15: The Centre today strongly opposed the disbanding of the Salwa Judum  under which the Union and state governments have armed local viillagers to take on Naxalites  in Chhattisgarh but agreed to a probe rights excesses by individual activists of the movement.        
	To assume that the Salwa Judum was an army of people with weapons and asking for it to be disbanded will be no more than asking for these people to be pushed out to be killed (by the Naxalites), additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium told the Supreme Court which is hearing a batch of petitions seeking to have it disbanded.        
	Activists Kartam Joga, Nandini Sundar, E.A.S. Sarma and Ramachandra Guha have in their petition alleged widespread rights violations by members of the Salwa Judum. They have also sought an independent inquiry into the human rights violations committed by this counter-insurgency force.        
	At its last hearing, the Supreme Court had severely frowned on the government arming citizens to defend themselves. The court had asked both the Centre and the state government machinery to tackle the problem itself.         
	The ground reality, said Subramanium, was that Naxalite activity in the Dandakaranya area was serious.         
	He also agreed to alleged human rights violation probe. The court directed the NHRC to send a fact-finding mission to Bastar and submit a report.

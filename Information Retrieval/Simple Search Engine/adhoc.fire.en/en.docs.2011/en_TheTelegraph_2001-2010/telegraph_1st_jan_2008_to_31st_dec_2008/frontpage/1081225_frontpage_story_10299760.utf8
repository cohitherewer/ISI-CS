          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 24: Prodded by the Centre and still recovering from the Kandhamal shock, the Orissa government has made elaborate security arrangements for a peaceful Christmas.         
	Officials said Union home minister P. Chidambaram called up chief minister Naveen Patnaik today and urged him to take adequate measures on the eve of Christmas. Chidambaram assured all help, including helicopter patrol.        
	Talking to reporters, Naveen, who also holds the Home portfolio, said he had been regularly reviewing the security situation in riot-ravaged Kandhamal and elsewhere. Wishing everyone a merry and peaceful Christmas, he made a fervent appeal for communal harmony.         
	State home secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi said all necessary steps had been taken to ensure a peaceful Christmas in the wake of threat from non-Christian organisations. Adequate security forces have been deployed in sensitive pockets of Kandhamal, Sambalpur and Sundargarh districts, he said.         
	In Kandhamal alone, 38 companies of central paramilitary forces, three companies of the Rapid Action Force and two units of the Orissa Disaster Rapid Action Force have been posted, besides a posse of state armed police, the home secretary said.         
	He confirmed that the Centre had offered to provide a helicopter for patrolling Kandhamal and Sambalpur districts. It will be pressed into service if need be, Padhi said.         
	DGP Manmohan Praharaj has left for Kandhamal to oversee the arrangements. Local administrations have also been instructed to invoke sections 107, 110 and 151 CrPC wherever and whenever necessary, he added.         
	Memories of last years communal violence in Kandhamal during Christmas is still fresh and people fear a rerun in the wake of the recent communal tension in the district.         
	Widespread violence had marred celebrations in the state last time.         
	Three people were killed and hundreds of churches, missionary schools, hospitals and homes were damaged.

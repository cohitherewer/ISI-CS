	Nandpur (Himachal Pradesh), March 17: On the roadside at this mountain village, pictures of the Mahatma and the Dalai Lama hang from tent strings.        
	On the minds of the tents occupants, resting after a 28km leg of their back to Tibet march, the desire for independence from China seems stronger than the devotion to non-violence.        
	As more and more Tibetan groups choose independence over the greater autonomy advocated by the Dalai Lama, the 1997 referendum for autonomy seems to be losing sheen.        
	If the majority wants independence, His Holiness is ready to accept it, says Thubten Samphel, secretary to the Tibetan government-in-exiles department of information and international relations.        
	Asked if its time for another referendum, Samphels answer does not match the Dalai Lamas statement yesterday that Tibetans want autonomy, not independence.        
	It is one of the options another referendum, the official says. More shock follows. Samphel says the Dalai Lama would never compromise on non-violence. If the struggle turns violent, he will step down.        
	In the 1997 referendum, 64 per cent of Tibetans had backed the monks middle way and given their spiritual leader the final authority for decision-making.        
	We want independence, though His Holiness has taken the middle way, says Chime Youngdung, leader of the National Democratic Party of Tibet and one of the 48 marchers.        
	After all, we are just lay people, he says, emphasising the difference with our God Dalai Lama. But the movement will be non-violent, we promise.        
	I am from the Tibetan Womens Association, which is for the middle way of His Holiness. But I have joined the march of the Tibetan Uprising Movement in my personal capacity and I want independence, says Dolma, who left behind her business in woollens in Nashik to join the march.        
	The 48 include 30 monks and 10 nuns, who are marching with a Taiwanese-donated ambulance and supply trucks. They are the second batch; the first group of 102 marchers was arrested on Thursday and is being held in judicial custody.        
	Having set out from Dehra on Friday, the group of 48 had halted at Nandpur last night and reached Chatara, 12km from Una district headquarters, tonight.        
	Late tonight, they told The Telegraph they planned to move to Punjab early tomorrow having learnt the Himachal government planned to arrest them.        
	But well continue our efforts to reach Tibet through some other state, such as Uttarakhand or Arunachal, a source said.

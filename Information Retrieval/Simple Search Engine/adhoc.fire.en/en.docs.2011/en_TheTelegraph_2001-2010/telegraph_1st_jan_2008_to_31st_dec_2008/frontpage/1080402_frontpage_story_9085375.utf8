                                Not funny                            
	New York, April 1 (AP): Woody Allen asked a federal court today to strip a clothing company known for its racy ads featuring scantily clad models of at least $10 million for using his image on billboards and on the Internet.        
	In a lawsuit in a Manhattan court, the actor-director said he does not endorse commercial products or services in the US, which makes the May 2007 American Apparel billboards in Hollywood and New York and website displays especially egregious and damaging.        
	The lawsuit said Allen was not contacted by the company and did not consent to the use of his image, which was taken from one of his movies.        
	American Apparel Inc., which is based in Los Angeles and operates worldwide, did not immediately reply to a telephone message seeking comment yesterday.        
	The lawsuit complained of a billboard featuring a frame from Annie Hall, a film that won Allen a best director Oscar. The image showed Allen, 72, dressed as a Hasidic Jew with a long beard and black hat and Yiddish text meaning the holy rebbe. The words American Apparel also were on the billboard.        
	The billboard falsely implied that Allen sponsored, endorsed or was associated with American Apparel, said the lawsuit.

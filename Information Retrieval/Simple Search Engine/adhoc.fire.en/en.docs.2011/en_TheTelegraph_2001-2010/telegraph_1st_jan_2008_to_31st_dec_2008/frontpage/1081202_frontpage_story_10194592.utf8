  - PM night reading: 5 boxes of finance files          RASHEED KIDWAI                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: For perhaps the first time in four-and-a-half years, his eyes shone with glee.        
	The economist enthusiastically discussed work and read his files with passion. A more pressing engagement in poll-bound Rajasthan kept him in Jaipur for most part of the day, but Manmohan Singh apparently insisted that five boxes, carrying 10 neatly folded files all marked finance, be placed on his table for late-night reading.        
	The Prime Minister is feeling at home, having got his teeth into the finance portfolio again after 12 long years.        
	His (the Prime Ministers) enthusiasm was visible, a close aide said. He is far from feeling burdened by the additional work.        
	Manmohan Singh had been the architect of Indias economic liberalisation as the finance minister in P.V. Narasimha Raos 1991-96 government. Outgoing finance minister P. Chidambaram today described him as the countrys best finance minister.        
	Singhs plate is now full to overflowing. Apart from being Prime Minister and in charge of the department of atomic energy and space, he has the additional burden of finance, information and broadcasting, coal, and environment and forests. He must now also take up the power portfolio with minister Sushil Kumar Shinde tipped to become Maharashtra chief minister.        
	Indications are that although he is keen to distribute the other portfolios, the economist in him is reluctant to part with finance too quickly.        
	The Prime Minister is keen to induct an additional minister of state in the finance ministry, and the names of Jyotiraditya Scindia and Ashwini Kumar are doing the rounds, sources said.        
	They added that Singh also hopes to benefit from the experience of two trusted associates, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and former RBI governor C. Rangarajan. The two men are likely to provide critical inputs as long as Singh holds the finance portfolio.        
	A cabinet reshuffle is also round the corner. The Prime Minister is said to be keen to promote a few ministers of state, such as Jairam Ramesh and Prithviraj Chavan, who have the technical knowledge to handle key infrastructure ministries like coal and power.        
	In addition, the information and broadcasting portfolio is set to go to someone who can showcase the ruling alliances policies, programmes and achievements in the run-up to the general election. Tourism and culture minister Ambika Soni has many backers in the Congress for the job.        
	The sources said the real problem in pushing talent from the Congress to the government was intra-party rivalry and factionalism.        
	Following Chidambarams induction as home minister, the younger lot of MPs and junior ministers, in their late 40s or early 50s, want to be promoted as cabinet ministers. But at the political level, these appointments have to be cleared by 10 Janpath first.

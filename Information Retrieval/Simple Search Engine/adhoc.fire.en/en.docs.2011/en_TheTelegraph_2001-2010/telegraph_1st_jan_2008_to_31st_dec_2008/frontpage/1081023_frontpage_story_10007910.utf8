	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Oct. 22: The protests against the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) in parts of Bihar affected railway services in Jharkhand today, as several trains, including the Ranchi-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, were either cancelled or terminated.        
	Trains originating from Ranchi and Hatia railway stations, such as the Hatia-Patna Express, Maurya Express, Jharkhand Swarn Jayanti Express, Hatia-Jammu Tawi Express and Ranchi-Varanasi Intercity Express were cancelled.        
	In Jamshedpur, Patna-Tata-Durg South Bihar Express arrived almost 12 hours late and the Danapur-Tatanagar Superfast Express was running late indefinitely.        
	Similarly, the Danapur-Tatanagar Express, too, was running indefinitely late and the railways had no information regarding its present status.        
	We had to cancel trains as there were disturbances in some areas falling along the East Central Railway. For those trains that were cancelled, passengers would be entitled to a full refund, said Vivek Srivastava, the senior divisional commercial manager of the Ranchi division. Passengers travelling from Tatanagar to Patna and Chapra, however, were not affected.         
	Railway officials said that there were no protests reported in any part of the railway divisions falling in Jharkhand. Large-scale demonstrations were reported from Bihar, which affected trains here, but there was no trouble in the state, he added. Tata-Jammu Tawi was cancelled in view of the demonstration at these places, confirmed Rajendra Prasad, the deputy station superintendent.         
	He added that the South Bihar Express that was scheduled to leave Patna at 7pm on Tuesday was delayed due to the students agitation there.         
	Meanwhile, the delay and cancellations left passengers in the lurch.         
	Passengers of the Tata-Jammu Tawi complained they had no prior information about the cancellations. I reached the station around 1.30pm and came to know that the train was cancelled. We had information that there was a problem in Bihar, however, we didnt know that the railways would take the decision to terminate the train, said Daljeet Singh, who was to board the train at Jamshedpur.        
	Anxious family members of passengers coming to the state through Bihar kept calling the enquiry counters to confirm status of trains. Many complained officials were not co-operating with them.         
	My son is coming by the Danapur-Tatanagar Superfast Express that is running late. The official at the enquiry counter has failed to provide a satisfactory answer till now and we have no choice but to wait for the train indefinitely, said A.K. Tiwari in Jamshedpur.         
	I do not know where to spend the night. I may have to sleep on the platform, said Karan Singh, an elderly passenger, who was supposed to travel to Rajasthan by the Rajdhani from Ranchi. Conversations among passengers centered around the MNS boss, Raj Thackrey, and the turmoil caused by his men in Mumbai. Several of them blamed the MNS chief for the violence in Bihar.        
	Raj Thackeray gets bail        
	MNS leader Raj Thackeray, who was arrested yesterday and spent a day in police custody, returned to his residence amid celebrations today after he was granted bail.

	Lucknow, Aug. 12: One wedding, two walls broken.        
	When Sayeda Hamid popped the question Nikaah qubul hai? to bride Naesh Hasan this evening, she smashed a centuries-old glass ceiling.        
	Solemnising a Muslim marriage has been the preserve of male qazis.        
	This may be the first marriage in which a woman assumed the role of a male qazi and performed a marriage, said Shaista Amber, chairperson of the All India Muslim Womens Personal Law Board who was among the 50-odd guests at the wedding hall.        
	At least in north India, this is a first, (though) in the south, I heard about some experimental marriage like this happening.        
	Social worker Naesh and NGO activist Imran Naeem, 41, who smiled as his 28-year-old bride uttered Qubul, qubul, qubul, also helped break another barrier.        
	The Sunni couple chose a Shia qazi to declare them man and wife  not allowed in traditional Muslim marriages.         
	Even the choice of witnesses seemed to hold a message: only one among the five witnesses was a man.        
	Why should the male folk be assigned all the crucial works of society? said Naesh, who has been leading a campaign for empowerment of Muslim women in Lucknow.        
	For Hamid, it was uncharted territory. But I think I have done my job well, the Central Planning Commission member, who flew down from Delhi, said after the marriage.        
	The wedding, however, followed all other norms of a traditional ceremony.         
	Shia scholar Kalbe Jawwad ratified the marriage. I have nothing to make any complaint about, he said.        
	But some clerics questioned Hamids legal status.        
	A marriage of this kind cannot pass the test of law as a woman qazi does not have any locus standi in a court of law, said Lucknow Idgah committee chief Riyaz Ahmed.         
	But All India Muslim Personal Law Board member Maulana Khalid Rashid Firangimahali endorsed the union, saying there was no bar on women performing a nikaah. But I wont ask anyone to go for this kind of marriage.

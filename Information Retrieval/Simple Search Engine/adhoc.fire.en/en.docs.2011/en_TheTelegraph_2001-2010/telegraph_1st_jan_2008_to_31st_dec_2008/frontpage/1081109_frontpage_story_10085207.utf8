	Nov. 8: By Jupiter, blame it on a skewed alignment of stars. Barack Obama, who ran a near-flawless campaign, slipped up at his first post-election news conference yesterday.        
	In terms of speaking to former Presidents, Ive spoken to all of them that are living, the President-elect said in answer to a question. I didnt want to get into a Nancy Reagan thing about, you know, doing any seances.        
	It was a crack about the ailing, 87-year-old former First Ladys reported dependence on astrologers, on whose advice she apparently changed meetings and rearranged the schedule of her husband, President Ronald Reagan. Obama, however, quickly apologised.        
	(Obama) called Nancy Reagan today to apologise for the careless and off-handed remark, a spokeswoman said. (He) expressed his admiration and affection for Mrs Reagan that so many Americans share and they had a warm conversation.        
	Nancy Reagan had turned to astrology after an assassination bid on Ronald in 1981. She was never accused of speaking to the dead, anyway  but Obamas top Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, is said to have taken a spiritual advisers help to talk to her hero Eleanor Roosevelt.        
	The closest Obama came to a faux pas during the campaign  apart from his political bombshell about how some rural voters get bitter (and) cling to guns or religion  was when he brushed aside a female reporter saying, Hold on one second, sweetie. He later apologised to her.        
	No apologies are likely from Republican running mate Sarah Palin who yesterday slammed John McCains campaign aides who have accused her of billing the party $150,000 for new clothes and not knowing if Africa was a country or continent. Palin said the criticism was cruel, mean-spirited, immature, unprofessional, and those guys are jerks.        
	Obama, though, may have made the Reagan joke merely to try and lighten the mood at a briefing that grew sombre as reporters quizzed him on the economy.         
	Later, he made another joke, calling himself a mutt when asked about the puppy he had promised daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7. Looking grateful  dogs and children are a disarming and safe topic  he said: Malia is allergic, so it has to be hypoallergenic; there are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic. Our preference would be to get a shelter dog but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me.

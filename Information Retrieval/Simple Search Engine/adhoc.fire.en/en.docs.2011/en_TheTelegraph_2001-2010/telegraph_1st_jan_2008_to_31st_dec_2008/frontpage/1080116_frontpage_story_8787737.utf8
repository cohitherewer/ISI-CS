	Ranchi, Jan. 15: Madhu Koda has virtually scored an advantage point for himself by deciding to go to Delhi tomorrow with his report card, as the state Congress failed to submit its report on the performance of the Koda government to the party leadership.
    
	Koda will meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi and other senior UPA leaders and prove with documentary evidences that allegations made by the Congress were false.
    
	Apart from senior ministerial colleagues camping for him in Delhi for the past three days, Koda is also enthused because RJD legislators Annapurna Devi and Ram Chandra Chandravanshi on their return from the national capital this afternoon told him there was nothing to worry. Girinath Singh is still in Delhi.
    
	Health minister Bhanu Pratap Sahi, rural development minister Anosh Ekka and land revenue minister Dulal Bhuiyan are learnt to have joined Kodas delegation to Sonia Gandhi.
    
	Congress sources, meanwhile, said it would take another couple of days before state Congress president Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu hands over its report to the AICC leader and in-charge of the party affairs in Jharkhand, Ajay Maken.
    
	In response to the one-page questionnaire that the 81 party observers were given yesterday, about 40 replies had reached the state party headquarters. Another 41 replies would reach tomorrow.
    
	State Congress spokesperson Alok Kumar Dubey said Balmuchu would visit Delhi after January 17. He is, however, in Delhi now discussing the state Congresss intention to fight the Simaria by-election on February 4.
    
	NCP general secretary Tariq Anwar today told Ahamed Patel the Koda government should not be disturbed at this juncture. Lalu Yadav, too, has said the UPA should not do anything that benefits the BJP. Therefore, we see no threat to the Koda government, said Kamlesh Singh.
    
	Koda told The Telegraph his report was ready and that he would furnish documentary evidences to prove his point. He advised the alliance partners to restrain patience. If I was at fault, the presidents of RJD, JMM and such other parties would never have supported me. I have tried to solve every issue that remained neglected for the last several decades. But I am not a magician, said Koda.

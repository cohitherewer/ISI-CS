  - Experts fail to convince Meghalaya parties          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Shillong, Aug. 22: Union cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekar and Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar today failed to convince the all-party committee on uranium mining and non-governmental organisations in Meghalaya on the need to carry out uranium mining in the state.         
	The emissaries of the Prime Ministers Office and experts of the Atomic Energy Commission held separate meetings with the all-party committee and the NGOs on uranium mining in West Khasi Hills district.         
	Briefing reporters after the meeting, both Chandrashekar and Kakodkar said they had received a mixed response. Some support uranium mining, some are neutral and some oppose the project, Chandrashekar said.         
	He said the Centre did not want to force anyone. Ultimately, it is upto the government and the people to take a final decision as uranium mining is needed for the countrys energy requirement, he added.         
	Kakodkar said the meeting aimed at providing as much information as possible about the merits of uranium mining. We made it clear that radiation because of uranium mining would be minimal and there would be no health hazards. The land used for mining would be as clean as it was before excavation.         
	Kakodkar said the Centre would continue to convince the government and the NGOs in the state on the need to carry out uranium mining.         
	Chief minister Donkupar Roy, who is also the chairman of the all-party committee, said after the meeting that mining health hazards were still a cause for concern.               
	The experts of Atomic Energy Commission explained all aspects of uranium mining to us, but we are waiting for their comprehensive report as the issue of health hazards needs to addressed, Roy said.         
	Deputy chief minister H.S. Lyngdoh from the Hill State Peoples Democratic Party said the commission had not been able to allay fears of radiation. Unless they can protect the people from radiation, we will not be ready to carry out uranium mining. We cannot see people dying.        
	The Khasi Students Union, the Federation of Khasi Jaintia and Garo People and the Hynniewtrep National Youth Front opposed the project during the meeting.         
	KSU leader Samuel Jyrwa said a majority of the people had opposed the project during a public hearing held in West Khasi Hills on June 12 last year.         
	We have conveyed our message of cancelling the project to the Prime Minister through the Union cabinet secretary, he added.         
	The white paper prepared by the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) states that the uranium mined from Mawthabah in West Khasi Hills of Meghalaya would be used to expand the countrys nuclear power capacity upto 20,000 MW by 2020.         
	Though the initial project was limited to Domiasiat, the UCIL has renamed the project as Kylleng-Pyndeng Sohiong uranium project, considering the vast deposits of uranium in the entire stretch from Wahkaji to Mawthabah villages in West Khasi Hills.        
	The government has proposed a Rs 1,000-crore project for mining uranium ore at Kylleng-Pyndeng Sohiong and processing it at Mawthabah.         
	A processing plant will also be set up at Mawthabah for production of magnesium-di-uranate, also known as yellow cake. It would be used by the nuclear fuel complex in Hyderabad to make fuel for the countrys atomic reactors.

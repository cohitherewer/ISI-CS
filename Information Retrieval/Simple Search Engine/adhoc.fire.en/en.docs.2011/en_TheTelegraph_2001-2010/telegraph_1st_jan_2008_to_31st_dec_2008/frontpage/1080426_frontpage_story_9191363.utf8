	New Delhi, April 25: A large proportion of heart attack patients across India, irrespective of their economic status, does not receive timely or the most appropriate treatment, a nationwide study has indicated.        
	Indias largest study on heart attacks, which examined the fate of 20,937 patients in 89 hospitals of all classes from 50 cities, has also shown that the poorer a patient, the higher the risk of death.         
	But whether rich or poor, heart attack patients take much longer to reach hospitals in India than in developed countries. Even after they arrive in emergency departments, treatment may be delayed, doctors who conducted the study said.        
	The study, to be published in the journal Lancet, has shown that patients in India on average take five hours to reach hospital, in contrast to less than three hours in developed countries.        
	After reaching hospitals, patients wait on average for 50 minutes for potentially life-saving clot-busting treatment, instead of less than 30 minutes  the ideal standard of treatment.        
	In heart attacks, time is muscle, said K. Srinath Reddy, the president head of the Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi. The greater the time before treatment, the greater is the loss of heart muscle.        
	Heart attacks occur earlier in India than in the West, so we need to preserve as much heart muscle as possible as survivors are going to need it longer, he added.        
	Hospital emergency departments need to act faster, said Denis Xavier, a pharmacologist at the St. Johns Research Institute, Bangalore, and a regional coordinator of the study.        
	The treatment delay is probably the result of delay in diagnosis (of the heart attack), and a delay in the process of screening patients to decide what treatment is most appropriate, Xavier said.         
	Paramedical staff and nurses in emergency need training in triage, said Dorairajan Prabhakaran, executive director of the Initiative for Cardiovascular Health in Developing Countries, New Delhi. Triage is the medical practice of identifying patients in need of life-saving assistance to provide fastest possible treatment to them.        
	Inability to recognise heart attack symptoms, traffic congestion, and consultations with family physicians all contribute to the delays in reaching hospitals, Prabhakaran said.        
	The four-year study covered government, private, and large corporate hospitals. But Indias rich-poor divide showed up dramatically in both treatment patterns and death rates after heart attacks.        
	Deaths within a month after the heart attack was 60 per cent higher in the lowest economic group compared to the highest economic group.        
	Its not surprising, but its disturbing, Xavier said. The differences in death rates is almost entirely because of differences in the treatment patients get.        
	Three out of four patients in the study were from lower middle class and poor backgrounds and less likely to afford treatment. Sometimes even basic, life-saving clot busting drugs are delayed, quot; Xavier said.        
	Clot-busting therapy could cost up to Rs 3,000, he said, and most patients have to pay for their drugs. Sometimes, a patient may die only because theres no one to pay for clot-busting therapy, Xavier said.        
	The use of other drugs given after a heart attack is also lower among poor patients than rich patients. For instance, 36 per cent poor patients received lipid-lowering drugs compared to 61 per cent of the rich.        
	Doctors have long suspected that India has the highest burden of heart disease in the world. Four years ago, a study by Reddy and his colleagues had predicted that by 2010, India would account for 60 per cent of the worlds heart disease.

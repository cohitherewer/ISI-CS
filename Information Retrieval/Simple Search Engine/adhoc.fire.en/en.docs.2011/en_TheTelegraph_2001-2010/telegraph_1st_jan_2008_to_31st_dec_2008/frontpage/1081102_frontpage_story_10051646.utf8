          OUR BUREAU                              
	Guwahati/Nagaon, Nov. 1: Police last night detained a man while tracking the text message claiming responsibility for Thursdays serial blasts, but doubts persist on whether he was a player in the attacks or a pawn.        
	The face of Naziruddin Ahmed, 26, of Moirabari town in Morigaon district, does not resemble the photograph in the SIM application. Nor did he appear to possess the mobile used to send the message, purportedly from the little-known Islamic Security Force (Indian Mujahideen).         
	Ahmeds family denied that he had anything to do with any terrorist group or with the serial blasts.        
	Inspector-general of police (law amp; order) Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta told The Telegraph today that while the address provided for procuring the SIM for the mobile connection (98646-93690) was that of Ahmeds, the photograph belonged to another person. The name of the father given in the application form was found to be different, he added.         
	The SIM card from which the SMS was sent has not been recovered as yet.        
	Mahanta said Ahmed was being interrogated. Police recovered two other mobile handsets and two SIM cards from him with numbers 94012-97658 and 98645-28445.        
	Police sources in Nagaon and Morigaon said Ahmed could have become a pawn in the deadly game as someone may have used his name to obtain the SIM. As neither the photograph nor the fathers name matches, it is a possibility that someone used his name to procure the SIM, a police officer in Morigaon said.        
	Naziruddin Ahmed is such a common name that the police stumbled upon at least six persons of the same name in the small township but zeroed in on the detained as the address tallied with his.        
	A Moirabari police source said the owner of the retail outlet from where the SIM was procured, Najimuddin Ahmed, was under the scanner as documents seized from him showed that as many as 150 SIM cards were issued against fake addresses by him during the past few months. He was let off after questioning yesterday.

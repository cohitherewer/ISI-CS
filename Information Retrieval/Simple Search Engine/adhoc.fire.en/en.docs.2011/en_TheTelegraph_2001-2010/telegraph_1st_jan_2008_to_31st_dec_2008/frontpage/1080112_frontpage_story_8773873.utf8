              The Singhs with the Maruti 800 in 1983
                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: The first Indian to own a Maruti 800 wouldnt mind having a Nano before everyone else. Except that the worlds cheapest car isnt cheap enough for her.
    
	We are retired people, aap free dila do to le lenge (if you can get us one for free, well take it), Mrs Harpal Singh told The Telegraph.
    
	Twenty-four years have passed since the day her husband Harpal received the keys of the first M800 from Indira Gandhi, but Mrs Singh stays staunchly loyal to the iconic car that she still uses.
    
	The woman from Delhis Green Park became part of Indias automobile history, and an overnight celebrity, when Harpal bought the white car and gifted it to her on December 14, 1983.
    
	The Maruti stood out in a market dominated by three companies: Hindustan Motors (Ambassador), Premier Auto (Premier Padmini) and Standard Motor Products (Standard). The cheapest of them was the Standard at Rs 70,000.
    
	Pitted against the stodgy, costly, petrol-guzzling cars, the fuel-efficient M800, at a price of Rs 52,000, was a runaway hit. The car was a style statement, said Calcutta-based orthopaedist H.K. Deb, 75, whose M800 was from the first batch to roll out in India. 
    
	Both my sons and my daughter immediately obtained their driving licence. I had seen nothing like the M800 before on Calcuttas streets. Youngsters who owned it would flaunt it.
    
	Yes, in 1984-85, a Maruti 800 was a status symbol on Bangalores streets, said S. Srinath, a 74-year-old Bangalorean lawyer.
    
	Mrs Singh spoke of how Rajiv Gandhi, then a pilot with Indian Airlines, had told her husband  also an IA employee  that he had won the lottery to buy the first M800.
    
	Asked if the car was still running, she said, Haan haan, chal rahi hai first-class chal rahi hai (yes, yes, its running well very well).
    
	She added candidly: Of course, like other cars (it needed) repairs and maintenance.
    
	Unlike her, the Nano seriously tempts Dr Deb  because of its similarities with his first Maruti, which he sold a few years back and still misses somehow.
    
	The car gave me good service. Today I drive an Accent but I feel a little uncomfortable. Its very difficult to drive such a big car on Calcuttas roads. Parking is also a problem.
    
	So, he is thinking of buying a Nano. It would solve a lot of problems we face on the roads -- with space, fuel-efficiency and manoeuvring.
    
	Lawyer Srinath has kept moving with the times. I kept my chocolate-brown Maruti 800 for a little over four years, after which I felt the need for an upgrade and switched to the Maruti 1000 that had just been launched.
    
	But I have no complaints about the M800. I did several outstation trips with my family and the car behaved very well.
    
	How does he like the Nano?
    
	It reminds me of several European small cars, Srinath said. I saw it being unveiled on TV -- it has certainly exceeded all expectations. I feel it will do well in the coming years though it may be difficult for the company to hold the price line.

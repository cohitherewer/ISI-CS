The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Time to go for a check-up, doctor 
                                                                                                        Time to go for a check-up, doctor 
  - Physicians more at risk of heart disease than general public, says study          G.S. MUDUR                                                     
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: The custodians of the nations health do not seem to be practising what they preach.         
	Doctors have higher cholesterol, greater incidence of high blood pressure and more abdominal fat than the general population, the first large analysis of the health of doctors in India has revealed.         
	The survey of 2,499 practising physicians from seven states has shown that doctors had an above-average prevalence of all abnormalities that are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, except diabetes.         
	Doctors  men and women  also have larger waists and are more overweight than the general population, according to the findings published in the Journal of the Association of Physicians of India.         
	The medical community has repeatedly cautioned about Indias epidemics of diabetes and heart disease, said Ambady Ramachandran, the president of the India Diabetes Research Foundation, Chennai, and the principal investigator of the study.         
	But it looks like doctors here arent doing enough to keep their own health in check, Ramachandran told The Telegraph.         
	Not only were values of cholesterol, blood pressure and waist and weight readings higher among doctors than in the general population, the proportion of doctors with abnormalities was higher than the proportion of the general population. (See chart)                   
	The study showed that doctors had higher-than-normal levels of bad cholesterol and lower-than-ideal values of good cholesterol than the general population.         
	About 16 per cent of doctors drank alcohol, compared to 9 per cent of the general population, but prevalence of smoking was about 10 per cent in both groups.         
	To assess risk factors in the general population, the study picked 3,278 people in Chennai from the same socio-economic status as doctors with MBBS or MD degrees.         
	A third of the doctors with diabetes or high blood pressure did not know they had these conditions, Ramachandran said. Many participating doctors said they were surprised by the results, he said.         
	Doctors not associated with the survey said the findings, though paradoxical, highlight an aspect of medicine in India that has long been suspected but little discussed.         
	Some experts argue that medics transition to ill health begins when they join medical school. Food in medical college canteens can be as unhealthy as anywhere else, and students remain on campus for five years or longer, said Shifalika Goenka, a behavioural specialist at the Centre for Chronic Disease Control, New Delhi.         
	But several factors could be contributing to this situation, she said. Food habits may be family-driven and hard to change, or lack of time may prevent practising physicians from taking action to improve their own health, or healthy food may not be always available or affordable  even for doctors, Goenka said.         
	Preventive medicine specialists prescribe exercise of 30 to 60 minutes a day  typically a brisk walk  stress management and regular health check-ups. But doctors in India do not have to undergo any mandatory health check-up, nor are they forced to take time off.         
	Stress might also explain the high levels of risk factors.         
	Medical practice in India involves intense competition and extreme stress, said Shashank Joshi, a consultant endocrinologist in Mumbai and editor of the Journal of Association of Physicians of India.         
	A super-speciality in medicine takes about 12 years of study. Then the doctor has to start from scratch, Joshi said. Doctors might be unaware they are stressed and ignore their own health.

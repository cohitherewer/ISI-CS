	Dadra (Belpahari), March 18: Asim Dasguptas benevolence may have come too late for Jaleshwari Shabar.        
	The widow in her mid-60s is dying slowly of starvation before villagers eyes, but Dadras 25 tribal Shabar families cannot scratch together a bowl of rice for her. They have no food to give away.        
	The village in West Midnapores arid Binpur II block, 230km from Calcutta, is no stranger to starvation deaths. On December 29 it lost Kuna Shabar, a man in his early 70s, who had had his last proper meal a fortnight earlier.        
	Dadra is just 40km from Amlashol, where starvation reportedly claimed five lives four years ago.        
	The villagers care little about yesterdays promise by Dasgupta to feed the poorest of the poor, including beggars, every day. The state finance minister wants to launch the scheme in April but panchayat polls could delay the rollout ( ).         
	Dadras rough, dry soil yields no food and there are no jobs in sight. What you see are lines of crumbling huts, heaps of stones and engulfing darkness after sunset.        
	Jangoli aamader bharosha; okhan thekei aamra phal-mul kurai, khabar jogar kori (the forest is our only hope; we eat whatever little we can forage from it), said Kanai Shabar, 70.        
	State government records claim that the 50,000 people living below the poverty line in Binpur II, including Dadras 150-odd Shabars, enjoy three square meals a day. The office of the block development officer (BDO) did the survey a week after Kunas death, and its results echoed a previous one conducted in 2005.        
	But Jaleshwari cannot even get up on her feet. From her cot, in a barely audible voice, she begs her neighbours for a bowl of rice.        
	Here everyone is looking for food. Who can help us? her elder daughter Sukho Mahato said.        
	We have no record of starvation deaths. We dont know how exactly Kuna died, but it seems he had developed physical ailments, BDO Bhaskar Pal said.        
	Doctors say that starvation can lower immunity and lead to diseases that can kill the already weakened patient.        
	Kunas wife Mala spoke of the daily battle she waged to try and keep her husband alive.        
	I would walk 20 miles through the jungles and hillocks every day to beg for rice. But all the villages are impoverished, so I hardly got anything, she said.        
	Two days before my husband died, I received a bowl of puffed rice in Pathardanga (a nearby tribal village). But it wasnt enough. I stopped going out after he developed high temperature. He soon lost consciousness and never regained it.        
	The BDOs records claim that Rs 2.15 crore has been spent on the blocks development since April 2006. But Dadra saw its first ever development after Kunas death, when a tube-well was installed.        
	The villages 25-odd children all travel to the nearby primary school every day. They have just one reason  a free plate of khichuri.

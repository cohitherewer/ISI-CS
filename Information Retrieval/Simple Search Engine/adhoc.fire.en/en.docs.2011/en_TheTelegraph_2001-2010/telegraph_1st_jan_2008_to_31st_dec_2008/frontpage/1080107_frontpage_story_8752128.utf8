                Stress risk 
              
	New Delhi, Jan. 6: British callers may be infuriated when they discover that the company they are telephoning has moved its customer service centre to India.
    
	But their frustration is nothing compared with the heart attacks, ulcers and insomnia afflicting those on the other end of the line.
    
	Research carried out by the call centre industry has found the 1.6 million people who work in them, mostly in their twenties, are plagued by ailments arising from the stress of dealing with irate customers.
    
	A study conducted by Strathclyde University for the Union of IT Enabled Services, which informally represents call centre workers, found that 77 per cent felt very pressurised and 45 per cent identified difficult customers as the main source of their stress.
    
	Youngsters love spending the kind of money their parents only dreamt about, but Im worried that stress and illness will turn them into zombies, said Karthik Shekhar, the unions general secretary.
    
	The report, to be published later this month, supports the findings of a health survey by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations which found that the outsourcing industry was most at risk from diseases that would hit productivity. 
    
	Researchers estimated that heart disease, strokes and diabetes would cost India more than 100 billion in lost productivity over the next 10 years.
    
	Staff in call centres dealing with customers in Britain say they have been shocked at the ferocity of the verbal attacks they encounter.
    
	Nidhi Aggarwal, 24, said she had never heard some of the insulting language used  including the word Paki as a term of abuse  before she began taking orders for a British catalogue company, which routes its customers calls to a Bangalore call centre.
    
	At first, I thought Id get used to it, but its been a year now and its not getting easier, she said.
    
	On its own, maybe I could cope with the abuse, but theres also the stress of finishing calls in one minute and hardly having time for breaks.
    
	Aggarwal, an English graduate, said she planned to quit, tired of wishing customers a good morning only to hear: Oh, Im through to India am I? Put me through to someone who can understand English, you f****** cow.
    
	Some companies offer counselling to employees to help them overcome psychological problems.
    
	Archana Bishta, who runs the 1to1help.net advice service in Bangalore, said she had helped workers who were suicidal or having a nervous breakdown.
    
	Most call centre workers live in big cities, away from home, so they have no family support, she said. Dealing with angry customers can make them very emotionally fragile. They blow their top or cry over the smallest thing.
    
	The companys clients include IBM-Daksh, Dell International,CapGemini, Fidelity and Tesco Hindustan Service Centre, while other companies, such as Infosys Technologies in Bangalore, have set up 24-hour staff help lines, manned by psychologists.
    
	Worried call centre managers have also provided cafs, sports facilities and gyms for their staff and offer neck massages, disco nights and picnics in an attempt to ease the pressure-cooker atmosphere.
    
	But none of that helped Aradhana Kamath, 22, who left her job working for a British companys call centre in Noida last May, unable to stand the abuse from callers any longer.
    
	I think they were angry that their jobs had come to India. They were so emotional and angry, it was like instant hatred. Id want to cry but I couldnt, I had to take the next call, said Kamath.
    
	A spokesperson for Tesco confirmed the company had a contract with the counselling service in Bangalore, which was available to staff to discuss all kinds of personal problems, not just those related to their employment.

  - Time raises possibility of Israel satellite debris in Kurseong          VIVEK SINGH AND G.S. MUDUR                             The object that fell in Kurseong. Picture by Vivek Singh                                        
	July 11: Comrade Karat, while you were lost in the nuclear draft last evening, an intruder from Americas bosom buddy Israel  of all places  may have infiltrated the communist bastion called Bengal from the sky.        
	Hear it from Hari Bahadur Chettri of Kurseong: I was drinking tea when I spotted a glowing red object falling from the sky. It crashed near my cattle shed with a hissing sound. The heat was so much that the tin wall of the cattle shed also turned red.        
	The celestial object, around two feet wide and 18 inches high, had not been identified till late tonight.         
	But the time of the landing  6.30pm  raises a tantalising possibility. A US agency had forecast that chunks of a stage-3 rocket body of Shavit, an Israeli launch vehicle, would re-enter Earths atmosphere around the same time. Shavits trajectory would have taken it over India.         
	The Centre for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies in Los Angeles had predicted the re-entry of parts of the rocket body on July 10 at 13:28 Universal Time (6.28pm in India). The error margin had been kept at 75 minutes.         
	Whether the object is part of that debris or not, it has caused considerable excitement in the landing site, Lower Sirubari Busty, 4km from Kurseong town. No one was injured, nor was Chettris house damaged but the spot where the object hit the ground had a crater almost six inches deep, suggesting it came crashing at very high speed.         
	Residents flocked to take a look at the metal-like object which they described as round, and having fibres and many concentric layers inside. The thickness of the metal was said to be around half an inch.        
	Chettri said the object looked silvery after cooling last night. It turned black this morning, with Chettri saying it could be because of the overnight rain.        
	According to the US centre for debris studies, the intense heat caused by friction with the atmosphere leads to melting, vaporisation or disintegration of objects coming back to Earth. But a component of a satellite or a rocket might be intact if its melting point is high enough and if its shape allows it to lose heat rapidly, the centre said.        
	At least 20 objects that were once parts of rockets or satellites have fallen back since January 2008, according to the centre for orbital and debris studies, which has catalogued each re-entry and its expected path. The stage-3 of the Shavit rocket had been launched from Israels Palmachim Air Force Base on June 10 last year.         
	Back in Lower Sirubari, many were more relieved than curious. This is the first time we have seen such an object. It was a scary moment for us but we were lucky no one was injured. We did not allow the police to take away the object initially as we wanted higher-ups in the administration to see it first, said Kiran Rai.        
	The district administration said it would take the object to Kurseong police station and send it to technical experts for identification.         
	The object must have fallen from space. We cant confirm what it is, though. We have told the district magistrate, said Manish Verma, the Kurseong block development officer.

Law at wits end

	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Not even God can help this country, a dismayed Supreme Court said today, referring to how politicians scratch each others back by refusing to prosecute those overstaying in government bungalows.        
	Nothing can save this country. Only God can help this country. Not even God, if he were to come down, can help this country. We have no national character, Justice B.N. Agarwal said.        
	The two-judge bench angrily disposed of a four-year-old public interest litigation, which cited squatting by politicians and bureaucrats, after the Centre refused to amend the law to make such overstay a criminal, non-bailable offence.        
	Unless we have a mechanism of accountability of all sections in a democracy, nothing will work in this country, Justice G.S. Singhvi said.        
	Justice Agarwal, who had earlier observed that squatters should be arrested and given the third degree, today said: The whole government machinery is corrupt (and) non-functional.        
	He said if the government wasnt willing to co-operate, the court should not do anything at all about the problem.        
	The decision to wind up the case, however, disappointed lawyers. This shows a very non-judicial mind, said Prashant Bhushan, who has steered many PILs.        
	Counsel Sanjay Parikh said: Once a court takes cognisance of an illegality, it should take the case to a logical conclusion irrespective of the government attitude. He suggested the courts should set a timetable and initiate contempt if officials failed to act.        
	The court had directed the Centre to tighten the law against squatters on July 24 last year, and later issued several orders to evict many VIPs from bungalows in Lutyens Delhi. The government kept stalling and promising to bring in the amendment before enraging the court today by saying such a drastic step is not required.        
	Additional solicitor-general Amarendra Sharan said that of the central governments pool of 19,100 houses, only 300-odd were under unauthorised occupation, and the Centre was taking steps to evict the occupants.        
	He argued that state governments too were refusing to make overstaying a criminal, non-bailable, non-cognisable offence (where police can arrest without a warrant). Squatting in government quarters is a criminal offence only in Uttar Pradesh and Orissa, but a bailable one.        
	While the case was on, the Centre had regularised the bungalow allotments to people such as BJP chief Rajnath Singh, ex-minister S.S. Badal and former top cop K.P.S. Gill. They can stay as long as they like by paying a nominal rent.        
	Once a politician enters, he doesnt leave. Your government has no guts to evict anybody because of vote banks. This political party, some other political party, theres no difference, the court had then said.

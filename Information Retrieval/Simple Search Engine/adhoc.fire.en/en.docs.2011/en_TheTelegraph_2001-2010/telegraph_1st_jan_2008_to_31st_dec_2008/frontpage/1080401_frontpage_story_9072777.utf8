                                                                                                           Koda envoy jobless in Delhi
  - Jharkhand resident commissioner enjoys minister status          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                            Bijendra Goel                                        
	Ranchi, March 31: The Jharkhand governments special envoy in Delhi enjoys minister of state rank and perks. But he doesnt have much to do.        
	Appointed by Madhu Koda a year ago, Bijendra Goel is a frustrated resident commissioner and counted as achievements his sitting in for the chief minister at some meetings and occasional inspections of the Jharkhand Bhavan that is being constructed.        
	I have written several times to the chief secretary to frame the rules of business for the post. But I havent received any response. I have also brought it to the notice of the chief minister, said Goel, who played a crucial role in the formation of the Koda government by sheltering UPA legislators.        
	But now the CAG has pulled up the government. Its report said the special envoy wasnt assigned any duty. Yet, Rs 49.42 lakh was paid to him and his staff between April 2002 and June 2007 towards pay and perks.        
	The special representative is entitled to have a private secretary, steno, peon and a chauffeur-driven car. Besides, a house at the upscale Chanakyapuri area has been allotted to him. According to the CAG report, he was responsible for co-ordinating with the Centre as Jharkhands representative in Delhi. The commissioner was also supposed to facilitate staying arrangements of visiting dignitaries of the state.        
	The post of resident commissioner, according to government sources, was created by the Babulal Marandi government in 2001. In 2002, the Arjun Munda government appointed R.N. Tiwary  said to be close to L.K. Advani  as the special envoy. He held the post for six years, but called it a redundant post as the state government hadnt referred a single official matter to him.        
	The post is important if the government wants to utilise it. The bureaucracy does not want to make use of it, summed up Goel. Obviously, the CAG agreed. For it indicted the state government for frittering away Rs 50 lakh and dubbed the expenditure as futile.         
	What it didnt say was that the Jharkhand Bhavan in New Delhi  now operating out of a rented premises  was already over-staffed with two senior IAS officers posted there for co-ordinating with the Centre.

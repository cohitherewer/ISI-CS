  - No fresh incidents reported though four bodies recovered from two districts        HAREN KALITA AMP; P.B. CHOUDHURY                                          
	Udalguri/Kokrajhar, Oct. 7: For the first time since communal clashes broke out in the Bodo belt four days ago, there were no reports of violence today.         
	The riot toll, however, went up to 51, with four more bodies being found in Udalguri and Darrang. All four were killed at least three days ago.        
	The situation is normal today. Of those killed, 30 are from Udalguri and 21 from Darrang district. Our priority is now to maintain harmony, inspector-general of police (law and order), Bhaskarjyoti Mahanta, said from Udalguri.        
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi, however, knew better than to be complacent with todays peace and asked the district administration and security forces not to be lenient while dealing with those trying to fuel hatred in the warring communities.         
	I have asked them (security forces) to take preventive measures so that the violence does not spread, Gogoi said in a statement issued today, while claiming that there have been incidents since last evening. He has also requested Speaker Tanka Bahadur Rai to lead an all-party team to the violence-hit zone.         
	Ministers and MLAs are camping there to instil confidence in the people. The state government has been taking all measures to provide food and relief materials to the affected people living in relief camps. Additional officers have been posted there to look after relief operations. I appeal to all sections of people to maintain peace, calm and communal harmony and not to be provoked by the false and mischievous propaganda by the anti-social and anti-national forces, the chief minister said.        
	While Gogoi warned residents against mischievous propaganda, people in the riot-hit areas of Udalguri today asked Assam PCC president Bhubaneswar Kalita, who visited relief camps today, to ask Dispur not to make provocative statements, which would only compound the trouble.         
	Inmates at one of the camps, comprising Bodos, Rabhas, Garos, Bengalis, Nepalis, Assamese and Adivasis, asked Kalita to rein in health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. The minister had said the clash was to drive away non-Bodos from the district.         
	They also objected to the governments tendency to term the violence as clashes between Bodo and non-Bodo people.        
	Kalita told mediapersons after winding up his visit to the affected areas in both districts that the ruling party has moved the government for adequate security, relief, compensation and sanitary facilities for the affected.         
	Condemning the riots and seeking the arrest of the guilty, he attributed the spread of violence to inadequate security personnel in the state.         
	Kalita also urged party members to work towards restoring normality in the districts. Besides Kalita, BJP leader Bijoya Chakravorty visited three relief camps in Darrang today.        
	Earlier, Bodo ministers Chandan Brahma and Rihon Daimary, parliamentary secretary Parmeswar Brahma and BTC executive member Mitaram Basumatary were forced to leave the relief camps after being heckled by inmates.         
	The BTC leaders, including chief Hagrama Mohilary, are yet to visit the arson-hit areas.         
	Security must be the first priority for the indigenous people and Dispur must ensure it, said Photen Basumatary, a leader at the relief camp of Udalguri.         
	The camp inmates also asked for full compensation for the property destroyed in the clashes.         
	Cant the government see the sons of the soil so uprooted and evicted? There must be some legislation to provide security to the indigenous people of Assam or else the country will go into the hands of foreigners, for which history will never forgive them, Basumatary said.

	Imphal, Dec. 15: Three minor boys, rescued from a Bangalore orphanage three months ago, were brought to a shelter house here today.        
	Lisham Mala Devi, secretary of Imphal Childline, today said Childline Bangalore, with the help of police, rescued the boys, aged between 10 to 15 years, from Bethesda Home, located at Hennur crossing in Bangalore on September 11.        
	Childline Bangalore, along with the Karnataka Women Commission, lodged a complaint with the local police and thereafter, a case was registered against the orphanage for abusive care of children.        
	A member of Imphal Childline in Bangalore brought the children here today. The boys have been given temporary refuge at Children Home, an orphanage run by the Mahila Kalyan Samitee here.        
	Childline Imphal willhand over the boys to the Child Welfare Committee, Senapati district tomorrow for rehabilitation.        
	We are handing over the children to welfare committee in Senapati district tomorrow. The district welfare committee will decide the fate of the children, Mala Devi said.        
	 Two of the rescued boys are orphans while the third is fatherless.        
	Guardians of the boys said a person called Besai from Makhal village of Senapati district had taken the boys to Bangalore in May last year on the promise of giving them free education. Besai, who is a theological student in a Bangalore college, charged Rs 13,000 from the guardians of the boys as paymet for their passage and stay.         
	The boys said they wereill-treated at the Bangalore orphanage, being forced to work long hours and not given adequate food. The home admitted the boys to a local school but did not pay their fees or buy exercise books. As a result, their teachers used to punish them regularly, the boys said. People at the home thrashed us badly when we told them that we could not work till late in the night, one of the boys said.

	New Delhi, April 15: The Centre has for the first time endorsed the formation of a band of armed vigilantes to take on Maoists.        
	The virtual stamp of recognition came in the Supreme Court today when the Union government strongly opposed the disbanding of the Salwa Judum, an armed group of tribals that has the blessings of the Chhattisgarh government.         
	But the Centre today agreed to a probe into rights excesses by individual activists of the Judum.        
	Till now, neither the Centre nor the Congress had supported the Judum.

 - Aussies explore possibility of dropping or tweaking complaint

	Jan. 10: Captain Anil Kumbles public position notwithstanding, The Telegraphs sources have confirmed that the Indian cricketers want the Harbhajan Singh issue resolved before the third Test, in Perth, from Wednesday.
    
	Harbhajan has been slapped a three-Test ban for calling Andrew Symonds a monkey, deemed a racial abuse. He has appealed against the punishment handed out by Match Referee Mike Procter.
    
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), headed by politician Sharad Pawar, too has filed an appeal.
    
	Both appeals are now before appeals commissioner Justice John Hansen, a high court judge in New Zealand. He hasnt yet fixed a date for the hearing. 
    
	The BCCI, incidentally, is looking at assigning two lawyers, one of them from overseas, to pursue the case.
    
	If the racial abuse issue isnt resolved ahead of the upcoming Test, then anything is possible, said one of the sources from Canberra. 
    
	That, one assumes, means the cricketers could make themselves unavailable for the penultimate Test of the four-match series. The Australians have an unbeatable 2-0 lead.
    
	According to another source, the cricketers line of thinking was conveyed to hosts Cricket Australia (CA) during a pretty lengthy meeting between some of their officials and Team India manager Chetan Chauhan in Canberra this evening. 
    
	Chauhan is the BCCIs man on the spot and it was their first meeting after the Harbhajan controversy broke during the Sydney Test. 
    
	Nobody was available for comment, but the source indicated that CA might take legal opinion on the possibility of either withdrawing the complaint altogether or amending it, even at this stage, before Justice Hansen begins proceedings.
    
	The BCCI and the cricketers are firm about the racial abuse bit being removed from the charge. The complaint went from the Australians, so the ball is in their court... The issues involved are huge, the source pointed out.
    
	According to the International Cricket Councils Sami-ul-Hasan, though, the Australians cant do anything now as the appeal is in motion.
    
	The Indians, who are currently playing a three-dayer in Canberra, reach Perth on Sunday.

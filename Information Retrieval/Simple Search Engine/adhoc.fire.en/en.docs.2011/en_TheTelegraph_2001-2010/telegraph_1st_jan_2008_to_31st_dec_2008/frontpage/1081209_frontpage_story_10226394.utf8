	Ranchi, Dec. 8: The Jharkhand government is sitting on ArcelorMittals proposal for iron ore prospecting licences crucial for the 12 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) plant the worlds largest steel maker is planning in Jharkhand at an investment of over Rs 40,000 crore.        
	More than a month has passed since the Centre asked the state mines and geology department to rework its earlier proposal for the company in two parts, keeping in mind notified and non-notified areas of the Karampada forest. In the last week of October, the Union ministry of mines sent back the states proposal wherein the 1,087.75 hectare of forest land  including gazette notified and non-notified areas  was recommended for granting iron ore prospecting licences. However, according to the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, proposals for the areas must be sent separately. State mines secretary K.K. Khandelwal has admitted a fresh proposal was yet to be sent to the Centre. According to sources, the West Singhbhum district mining office had sent a fresh proposal to the government a fortnight back earmarking both types of areas.         
	But now, senior officials in Ranchi were said to be weighing two options: whether to send a fresh proposal limited to the notified areas or send two separate proposals for notified and non-notified areas. The reason for the dilemma, government officials explained, was that the government was empowered to recommend non-notified areas for prospecting licences.         
	According to norms, hearing by a government empowered committee was necessary for notified areas whereas for non-notified areas such a hearing wasnt necessary. If the state sends a single proposal, it would mean that only about 700 hectares would be covered which wouldnt be enough for ArcelorMittal given the scale of its project.         
	ArcelorMittal officials in Jharkhand were naturally concerned about the delay.         
	The Centre has already given its consent for a mining lease in another 500-acre area of the Karampada reserve forests for ArcelorMittal subject to an NOC from the Union ministry of environment and forests.        
	But the 500 acre area has reserves of about 65 MT, which would prove insufficient for the 12 MTPA mega project. ArcelorMittal would require about 600 MT of iron ore over the next 30 years (from the start of the project) to operate its plant to optimum capacity.         
	ArcelorMittal signed an MoU with the government in 2005. Barring the Centres consent for mining leases in sections of the Karampada forest area and Seregarha in Latehar district, nothing much has moved in its favour ever since. The crucial paperwork apart, the company is also finding it difficult to scout for land.

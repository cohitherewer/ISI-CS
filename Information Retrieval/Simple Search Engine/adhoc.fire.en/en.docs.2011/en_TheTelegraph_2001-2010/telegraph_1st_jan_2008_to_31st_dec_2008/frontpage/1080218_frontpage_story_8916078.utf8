The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ulfa calls bandh in support of Lachit
                                                                                                           Ulfa calls bandh in support of Lachit
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, Feb. 17: A court today sent Lachit Bordoloi to police remand for another two days while the Ulfa chief sat planning a statewide bandh on Tuesday seeking unconditional release of the human rights activist.         
	Bordoloi was arrested six days ago based on a rebels statement about a possible hijack conspiracy hatched by Ulfa. The police had sought another five days remand to question Bordoloi regarding 2,500 Ulfa e-mails investigators found in his laptop, Bordolois advocate Bijan Mahajan said. But the court today granted only two.        
	The chief judicial magistrate (Kamrup), Rabin Phukan, also rejected the bail petition of another MASS activist Khagen Talukdar, Deccan staff Sumanta Datta and a former employee of a private news channel Pradip Gogoi and sent them to judicial custody.         
	All three were arrested for alleged links in the hijack conspiracy.         
	The police did not seek their remand, so we had moved for their bail. But the court rejected it, Mahajan said.        
	Almost coinciding with the court order, Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa in a statement declared a 12-hour bandh from 5.30am of Tuesday seeking Bordolois release along with a complete halt of killing of Ulfa activists in false encounters by security forces.        
	Rajkhowa warned of more vigorous agitation if the government did not fulfil the outfits demands.        
	Dispur, however, said it would not bow to the outfits pressure tactics and would ensure enough security to thwart the bandh call.         
	At a rally in Nagaon this afternoon, chief minister Tarun Gogoi said the forces would continue the ongoing crackdown against the outfit.        
	Without ruling out the possibility of Ulfa trying to create panic ahead of the bandh by triggering blasts, a senior police official said the people have begun to defy Ulfas diktats , and the government expected a similar response this time too. Besides, that Ulfa has come out in support of Bordoloi only buttressed the polices claim that the rights activist had direct links with the outfit, the officer said.        
	Rajkhowa in his statement had said the police have wrongly implicated Bordoloi with false charges of plane hijacking plan, supplying arms and providing shelter to the outfits members. He claimed that the arrest has jeopardised the democratic rights of the people of Assam.

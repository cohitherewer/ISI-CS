	London, Nov. 16: Women today see balancing their work and home lives as their biggest challenge and Margaret Thatcher and Nelson Mandela as their greatest role models, according to a study for The Sunday Telegraph.         
	Almost two out of five women now see themselves as feminists, research for Stella magazine has revealed. However, nearly three out of four women would rather have a man, than a woman, as their boss.         
	Nearly half of women (46 per cent) think a couple should live together before they marry. This figure rises to more than three quarters (77 per cent) among women aged 18 to 24, but falls to nearly one in four (27 per cent) among women aged 55 and over.         
	Stella commissioned YouGov, a research agency, to interview more than 1,000 women of all ages and backgrounds on everything from family values to their eating habits, and from their views on plastic surgery to those on sex and shopping. Health and weight are clearly major issues for the modern woman.         
	Four in five (80 per cent) say losing their health is their greatest concern, followed by putting on weight (52 per cent) and losing their job (24 per cent). Nearly one woman in four (23 per cent) is currently on a diet.        
	Women have high expectations from a partner: two thirds (67 per cent) would rather hold out for the perfect, romantic partner than settle for a man whos good enough.         
	Those interviewed were questioned about family values and asked to choose three from a list of the biggest challenges faced by women today. Balancing work and home life was the main challenge (82 per cent) followed by raising happy children (56 per cent).        
	Almost half of women (49 per cent) think that between 25 and 29 is the best age to get married, and an identical per cent believe that between 25 and 29 is also the best age to have children.         
	Nearly three out of five women (59 per cent) think fathers should take more responsibility for their children.        
	More than half of women (51 per cent) think it is best for a couple to marry before having children, while nearly two out of five women (38 per cent) think a woman should stay at home until her child goes to school. More than half of women with partners (51 per cent) say they currently do three quarters of household chores.         
	It is known that 18 is the average age for women to lose their virginity, yet the survey shows that one woman in 50 (2 per cent) remains a virgin and 7 per cent of women lost their virginity aged 14 or younger.         
	The average number of sexual partners for a woman is seven, but the surveys shows that at least 17 per cent of those aged 18 to 24 have already had more than ten sexual partners.         
	The issue of famous role models throws up a range of names from Prime Ministers to pop singers and from actors to models. Margaret Thatcher is the most admired woman (7 per cent) followed by the queen (5.5 per cent). The most admired man is Nelson Mandela (5.6 per cent) followed by Winston Churchill (4.2 per cent) and David Beckham (3.1 per cent).         
	The famous man that women find most attractive is George Clooney (8.9 per cent) followed by fellow actor Brad Pitt (6.1 per cent). Actress Angelina Jolie (9.4 per cent) tops the list of famous women that fellow females find attractive, followed by singer Cheryl Cole (3.9 per cent) and actress Catherine Zeta Jones (2.6 per cent).

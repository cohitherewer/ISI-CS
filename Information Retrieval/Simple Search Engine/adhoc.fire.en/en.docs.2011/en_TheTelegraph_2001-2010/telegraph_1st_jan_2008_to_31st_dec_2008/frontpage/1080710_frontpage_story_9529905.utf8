	Washington, July 9: A 20-page text of the nuclear safeguards agreement circulated in Vienna today places India in the global non-proliferation regime a notch above Pakistan and North Korea.        
	But it leaves New Delhi in a category below the five nuclear weapons states  Russia, China, France, Britain and the US  that are recognised under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), according to diplomats who formally received the agreement from the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) this afternoon.        
	The text is titled Agreement with the Government of India for the Application of Safeguards to Civilian Nuclear Facilities.        
	India, Pakistan and North Korea are the only three countries outside the NPT regime that have tested nuclear weapons. Israel is well-known to have the bomb, but it refuses to acknowledge that it has even mastered the scientific cycles that precede the production of atom bombs.        
	Diplomats in Vienna are already referring to India and the five recognised nuclear weapons states collectively following the circulation of the agreement as five plus one.        
	This means India will be in a special category within the global non-proliferation regime if the IAEAs board of governors approve the safeguards agreement at its yet to be scheduled meeting.        
	IAEA spokesperson Melissa Fleming emphasised that the text of the draft agreement is not public and that the agencys officials have been told not to give any interviews to the media on the subject at this time.        
	But the Vienna International Centre on the banks of the Danube, the IAEA property leased from the Austrian government for 99 years, leaks like a sieve: it is, therefore possible to construct an idea of what India can expect from the safeguards pact from diplomats who are willing to talk about it on background.        
	Diplomats who have perused todays text said it has many structural similarities with the Hyde Act approved by the US Congress to facilitate the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	Like the Hyde Act, the IAEAs agreement with India is long on preamble which sums up the reasons for bringing India into a special category in the current global nuclear non-proliferation regime.        
	Like the Hyde Act, whose preamble and non-operative parts were necessary to satisfy the diverse lobbies and constituencies in the US Congress, the one in the Vienna document was also necessary to bring round those members of the IAEA board who have reservations about a safeguards agreement that overlooks New Delhis refusal to sign the NPT.        
	It was not immediately clear if todays document satisfactorily answers the five questions raised by Left parties in their joint statement about the UPA governments negotiations with the IAEA.         
	But diplomats said the safeguards agreement will definitely not permit spare parts or fuel  even in the event of any shortage  to be transferred between nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards and those outside it as part of Indias weapons programme.        
	Fleming said the chairman of the board, Milenko Skoknic of Chile, had already begun consultations with fellow governors to fix a date for convening a board meeting to approve the agreement.

          OUR BUREAU                                                    (From top) Minister Asok Bhattacharya stuck in the Darjeeling Mail, the chief ministers convoy on a deserted road and a tea-seller doing brisk business in front of the CPM headquarters when the rest of Bengal was shut down.

	Kishanganj/Siliguri, June 5: CPM minister Asok Bhattacharya got a taste of his partys own medicine today when fellow passengers on a bandh-hit train refused to let him complete his journey by car.        
	The municipal affairs minister was virtually confined for eight hours on the New Jalpaiguri-bound Darjeeling Mail, stranded at Bihars Kishanganj station because of squatting up the line in Bengal.        
	How does it feel now? The minister should get to know how the rest of us feel during these meaningless bandhs, said Dilip Singh, 33, a salesman from Siliguri who was later arrested on the charge of misbehaving with Asok and given bail.        
	This is the second instance of CPM leaders getting a taste of people power this week. On Monday, a Calcutta crowd had egged a policeman on to book six-time MP Tarit Topdars driver after he broke traffic rules and then tried to pull rank.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose dismissed any suggestion of public anger against bandhs, saying: Asok was stopped in Bihar. The passengers of the Sealdah-NJP train, which briefly touches Bihar, were mostly from Bengal, though.        
	Saheli Bhattacharya was Siliguri-bound with her children, aged 8 and 11. There was no food or water and the minister was about to leave; I and the others requested him to stay, she said.        
	Asok, whose act of travelling conflicted with the partys aim of paralysing the state, appeared to undermine the bandh further by pleading he had important work to finish. That infuriated Jalpaiguri-bound Biswajit Ganguly, who said: He knew his party had called the bandh, yet he told us he had important work. Well, were the rest of us travelling for fun?        
	Asok spent the hours reading a book on globalisation in his air-conditioned first-class coach till the journey resumed at 2.45pm. The train had arrived at Kishanganj at 6.45am but within 10 minutes, the station announced a delay because of squatting at Aluabari and Raninagar.        
	The minister immediately began flexing his political muscle. I rang up party members and got them to withdraw the (two) blockades. I informed the Katihar divisional railway manager (DRM) but no effort was made to get the train moving, Asok said.        
	Around 10.30, Kishanganj police chief M.R. Nayak arrived with an extra car for the minister, upsetting the passengers. Nayak said he had merely offered to take the minister to the Circuit House, and Asok too later claimed he had no intention of making it to Siliguri by road.        
	Dilip was threatening and abusive, the minister said. Some passengers led by this youth, who wore a red shirt, said they wouldnt let me leave. He kept yelling and sneaked into my compartment.        
	Even before this, some passengers had begun shouting at Asok, prompting Jalpaiguri police chief Tripurari  a co-passenger  to intervene.        
	At NJP, Dilip was charged with unlawful assembly, wrongful confinement and misbehaviour as Asok left for home in Siliguri. I protested like the others, Dilip said.        
	Katihar DRM Mehtab Singh said trains stranded up the line had delayed the green light to the Darjeeling Mail.

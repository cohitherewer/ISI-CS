            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Sachin after hitting his first ODI century in Australia. (AP)                                  
	Sydney, March 2: Sachin Tendulkar wasnt quite the Master Blaster at the SCG this evening, but theres no doubt that he was the Master in probably his last appearance at his favourite ground outside India.        
	Sachin, indeed, gave a lesson which world champions Australia would find hard to quickly forget. He was at the wicket for a shade over three-and-a-half hours, time enough to compile an unbeaten 117, an innings which gave Team India a 1-0 lead in the tri-series finals.        
	Its a best-of-three affair at this stage of the Commonwealth Bank-sponsored competition.        
	The hundred was Sachins 42nd in ODIs but, surprisingly, only his first in Australia. The 41st had come as far back as January last year and, in the interregnum, hed tripped six times in the 90s.        
	Sachin, though, reserved his best shot for those critics whod begun to question his worth in limited overs cricket. Hell soon be 35, but hasnt lost his sizeable appetite for either the cherry or the white ball.         
	Speaking shortly after collecting yet another MoM award, he stepped out nonchalantly: I dont worry too much about criticism because people say a lot of things. Sometimes they talk because theyve not been able to do certain things themselves.         
	I look at the credibility of the person who is writing and Ive got people who actually guide me. I listen to those people... those who really matter to me would always pick up the phone and tell me.        
	Recently, former India and Mumbai teammate Sanjay Manjrekar had taken Sachin apart in his column. The iconic Sunil Gavaskar, too, had indirectly questioned the wisdom of continuing to open with him when he wasnt among the runs for most of this tri-series.        
	Sachin didnt name anybody  hes a pro in every respect  but the message wouldve quickly reached those targeted by him.        
	Look, its not for Sachin to prove a point. After almost 19 years of international cricket, he doesnt have to prove anything to anybody. His hundred, however, couldnt have been better timed. A hundred in any final is special, but this one was a classic, former India captain Ravi Shastri told The Telegraph.        
	Sachin, for his part, confessed that hed been very keen to get an ODI hundred in Australia. Clearly, while taking guard, he remembe- red that his CV did have a blank.        
	He was, as a placard read after one of his early boundaries: Hotter than Mums curry.        
	A niggling groin injury didnt come in Sachins way nor, for that matter, an accidental beamer from Brett Lee which struck him on the left shoulder.        
	Lee apologised quicker than that illegal delivery and Sachin was quick to point out he had no reason to doubt the speedsters explanation (I know Brett very well).        
	A wonderfully refreshing change, really, after all the ill-will generated by the monkey business (at the SCG itself, during the Test series), allegations of abuse and Matthew Haydens obnoxious attack on Harbhajan Singh.        
	Harbhajan, though, had the proverbial last laugh: He evicted both tormentors, Andrew Symonds and Hayden. Their dismissals came at a critical moment and, predictably, the celebrations were josh-filled.        
	Having been outplayed by six wickets, the Australians must quickly get their act right as final No. 2 (in Brisbane) is on Tuesday.        
	Captain Ricky Ponting, who read the riot act after the defeat, was blunt. I gave them (the players) a kick up the backside.... Weve got to quickly get back on the horse.... We pride ourselves on our performances, but came up short.... The Indians outplayed us.        
	Actually, its an understatement and the thousands of Bharat Mata ki jai-chanting Indian fans who thronged the SCG would vouch for that.

	Bhubaneswar, May 18: Actresses Leslie Tripathy and Bidusmita Mantri and model co-ordinator Jubuli Sundarray today apprehended that a few police officers in the capital were helping Raja Acharya.         
	Today, the trio made public an audio-tape of the two-day-old recorded conversation between Leslie and Raja.        
	The three also demanded a CBI probe into the MMS controversy  in which both the actresses are said to be involved.         
	Following is an excerpt of the conversation.         
	Caller: I am A.K. Patnaik of the Students Congress. We came to know of you being harassed by Raja Acharya. We are with you Do you want him to be hanged?         
	Leslie: I am nobody to decide. Its for the police to decide. He is harassing my friends and me That is the reason I lodged a complaint.        
	Caller: If Raja dies, what will happen to his love?        
	Leslie today admitted that coach Biranchi Das had extended his support voluntarily and that Raja had threatened to kill Das in the Judo Association Hall a couple of times.         
	The trio pressed for a CBI probe into smut video case.        
	Meanwhile, following a court order, Raja has been kept handcuffed in the jail. He is being kept in a special cell and extra personnel have been posted in front of the cell to make sure that the gangster is unable to break jail rules.        
	Jail sources, however, said that Raja did not seem too perturbed by the fresh allegations (of the phone threats) made against him by the actresses.         
	Meanwhile in a separate development, Gitanjali Panda, widow of Biranchi Das, sought to dispel the fortnight-long speculations over Budhia Singh Trust funds.         
	Gitanjali clarified that the trust amount was less than Rs 1.6 lakh and not the Rs 9 crore as was being touted in different circles. With regards to the Rs 1.5 lakh, Gitanjali said: The amount would be given to Budhia Singh, when he turns 18. It was Biranchis desire and I will try to fulfil it.

	New Delhi, June 19: Flying turns costlier from Friday, by up to Rs 1,750 if you are travelling long-distance.        
	The big airlines  Air India, Jet and Kingfisher  have hiked basic fares depending on the distance whereas the smaller, low-cost carriers have increased the fuel surcharge.        
	Air India has fixed a minimum basic fare of Rs 1,000 for flights within the 750km range, such as one between Calcutta and Silchar. The basic fares on these routes earlier lay between Rs 500 and Rs 700.        
	For flights within a 750-1,000km range, the basic fare is up from Rs 700-2,000 to Rs 2,250; while for those beyond 1,000km, it rises from Rs 2,000-2,500 to Rs 3,000.        
	The various surcharges add up to another Rs 3,250 per ticket, whatever the distance. This means a Delhi-Calcutta ticket will now cost about Rs 6,250 or so, an official said. Jet and Kingfisher will also be effecting a similar hike.        
	The low-cost airlines have raised their fuel surcharge by Rs 350-500 depending on the distance, causing this segment to jump to three-fourths of a tickets price.        
	We have been forced to hike the surcharge because of rising jet fuel prices but we have decided to keep basic fares where they were. Low-cost airlines would not like to give up their USP, said Partha Sarathi Basu, chief financial officer, SpiceJet.        
	Raising only the fuel surcharge allows an airline to tie the hike directly with aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices and argue that the fares could fall if the fuel became cheaper.        
	The high jet fuel prices are expected to push airlines deeper into the red. The industry is expected to lose Rs 8,000 crore during the 2008-09 fiscal, double its estimated losses during 2007-08.        
	Airlines like SpiceJet and IndiGo have adopted measures such as refuelling in states where ATF is cheaper. They have also renewed their push for relaxation of the rules for flying international routes. These carriers say international operations would lead to better use of aircraft as well as cost-effective jet fuel, which is cheaper abroad.         
	The airlines have told the civil aviation ministry they would be forced to prune domestic capacity by 20 per cent.

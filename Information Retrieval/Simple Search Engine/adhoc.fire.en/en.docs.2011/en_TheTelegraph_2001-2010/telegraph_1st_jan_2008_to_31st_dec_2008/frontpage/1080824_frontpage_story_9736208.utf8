          KINSUK BASU                            Workers file past barricades lined up inside the boundary wall of the Tata project site in Singur. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                         
	Singur, Aug. 23: Becharam Manna has no time to waste as he bustles around in front of the Tata Motors factory, supervising and shouting instructions.        
	Theres a dull thump-thump-thump as Trinamul Congress workers put the finishing touches to the 21 camps being set up for tomorrows siege, each about 100 metres from the Tata Motors boundary wall across the Durgapur Expressway.        
	White, green and orange drape the main dais from where Mamata Banerjee will address the one lakh people expected to come to watch her flag off an indefinite dharna for the return of 400 acres to unwilling landlosers.        
	Behind the walls, the Nano factory hums with activity, apparently oblivious of the happenings outside. Officials cars keep whizzing in and out of the gates.        
	Theres a spring in Mannas step as the local Save Farmland Committee convener hurries from one camp to another, and you almost feel theres a festive air about the place.        
	Yet tension hangs inside the factory and outside, as thick as the dark cloud in the late-afternoon sky. Barely 100 metres from Manna, a huge team of police and Rapid Action Force commandos seems to be warming up in preparation for tomorrow.        
	Despite Trinamul promises of a peaceful dharna, the administration is deploying 2,500 police under IG (western range) Kuldiep Singh.        
	Inside the project area the workers arent too worried about tomorrow, a Sunday, when not too many of them will be coming.         
	The workers are afraid about Monday  I dont know how many of them will turn up, labour contractor Prabhat Bairagya says. They are always frightened anyway, given the controversy about the project.        
	Manna promises the workers would not be obstructed. Our leader has told us not to obstruct anyone, he said. But the police fear that the leadership may not have complete control over the 4,000-5,000 expected to continue the dharna from Monday, especially those coming from other districts.        
	We have made arrangements to escort the workers inside the factory if needed, IG Singh said.        
	Ratan Ghosh, 70, of Gopalnagar looks rather remote from all this activity though the battle is being fought in his name. He is an unwilling landloser and has refused to collect the cheque for his 14 bighas.        
	He dismisses the dharna as a tamasha (farce). How many of us are involved in this? For the past two years we have been watching meetings and michhils. For me the important thing is whether I shall get back my land.        
	But many in Singur are tense for a different reason. We dont want the Tatas to go, said Naba Kumar Das, an electrician at the project site. At least I have work now. There are many like me  we dont want to go back to our gloomy past.

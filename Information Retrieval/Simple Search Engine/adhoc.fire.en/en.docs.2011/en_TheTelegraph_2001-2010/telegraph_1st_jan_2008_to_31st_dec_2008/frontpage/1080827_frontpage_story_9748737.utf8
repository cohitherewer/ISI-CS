          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Ranchi, Aug. 26: Reposing faith in outgoing chief minister Madhu Kodas cabinet, JMM chief Shibu Soren is likely to retain almost all its Independent ministers except Chandra Prakash Choudhary.        
	Forward Bloc legislator Aparna Sengupta is likely to replace the Ajsu legislator, whose party has decided not to support the Soren government.         
	Sengupta might be given drinking water and sanitation and other departments held by Choudhary, said a Sorens close aide.        
	Governor Syed Sibtey Razi will be administering the oath of office to Soren and his cabinet members tomorrow.         
	Though Soren seemed to be in a fix over the JMM nominees in his cabinet, sources said he would be finally retaining Sudhir Mahto, Dulal Bhuiyan and Nalin Soren, the members of the Koda cabinet.         
	The decision to maintain status quo was taken at a Delhi meeting, said JMM MP Hemlal Murmu.         
	According to Stephen Marandi, the portfolios would be distributed after September 1, when Soren seeks the trust vote in the Assembly.        
	There is a possibility of some changes in the portfolios of the ministers, said a source, adding that allocation of portfolios could be a pain for Soren.         
	With new incumbents demanding fair deal, the JMM chief is unable to work out a definite formula. A marathon meeting, which Koda also attended, with the UPA partners today at the new circuit house failed to evolve consensus over the issue.         
	Tomorrow I and my cabinet colleagues will be taking the oath of office and secrecy at Morabadi grounds. If a few among them are unable to take oath tomorrow, they will be doing so later. Everything will be set right soon, said Soren.         
	Insiders maintained that the Independents, who constituted the Koda cabinet as well, were determined to retain their previous portfolios. But the mad race for grabbing home, road and mines ministries have put the chief minister-designate in a tight spot. He might have also made some promises to the Independents.         
	Against this backdrop, the JMM legislators are struggling hard to make it to the cabinet. Former agriculture minister Nalin Soren seems to be facing an extremely rough weather. It is widely being argued that how can two Santhals (the JMM chief and Nalin) from Dumka district be allowed to be in the cabinet.         
	Former deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahtos detractors are trying to highlight how he had recently appreciated Koda, but remained tight-lipped when asked to comment on Soren. He had even categorically said that change of guard was not needed at the moment.         
	Littipara legislator Sushila Hansda, who was quite unhappy after Soren refused to nominate her to the Koda cabinet, is again struggling hard to prove her point.         
	If insiders are to be believed, Soren would also have to accommodate the legislators joining his fold defying their party diktat.         
	Despite all the odds, Soren wants to reconstruct the state after becoming the chief minister. Pehele korenge, phir boenge (first I will dig the earth, then sow), he said while taking about his future plans.         
	Though tight-lipped on administrative shuffling after assuming the charge, Soren did admit that the bureaucrats too were responsible for the sorry state of affairs in the state.        
	Highlighting the challenges of Soren after assuming power, the state Congress chief, Pradeep Balmuchu, who was missing yesterday with his MLAs at Raj Bhavan, said the JMM chief has to curb corruption and speed up the development process.

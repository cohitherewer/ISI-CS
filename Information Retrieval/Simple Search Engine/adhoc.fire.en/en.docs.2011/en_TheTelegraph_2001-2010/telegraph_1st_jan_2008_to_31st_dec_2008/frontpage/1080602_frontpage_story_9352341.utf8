          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Silchar, June 1: The Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel) may have offered peace on a plate, but a disgruntled Delhi is busy drawing up an elaborate security menu to stamp out the outfit from the troubled North Cachar Hills.         
	Both Dispur and Delhi are considering a proposal to induct more troops from the Dimapur-based 3 Corps to bolster the strength of the army in the district, said reports reaching the North Cachar Hills headquarters in Haflong.        
	The district has 46 armed companies drawn from an array of central security forces, including the BSF, CRPF and the IRB, besides the army.         
	The army last week reshuffled its forces in the district, to replace the artillery formations, which were earlier moved to Haflong from the 57 mountain divisions headquarters in Masimpur.         
	The Prime Ministers Office has asked Union heavy industries minister Sontosh Mohan Dev to discuss the armys new role in the district with the defence ministry next week.         
	Dev, now in Delhi, ruled out any compromise with the DHD (J), which, according to him, is a pack of goons out to terrorise the people by their campaign of extortion and senseless killings.         
	The DHD (J) declared a unilateral ceasefire on March 25, following which at least one round of talks was held between its representatives and the Assam police top brass as spadework before a dialogue with the government.         
	However, the outfit picked up the gun again last month after the army allegedly gunned down a dozen of its members.         
	In swift retaliation, DHD (J) rebels gunned down a locomotive driver, 10 truck drivers and injured three railway personnel.        
	Fearing further attacks, the Northeast Frontier Railway withdrew its services on the 185-km stretch between Lumding and Badarpur and emptied a number of stations on the route.        
	While a couple of goods trains are back on track following assurances of security from Dispur, NFR has still not steamed off any of its passenger trains on the route.        
	With the broad gauge conversion and East-West corridor projects running way behind schedule thanks to rebels, the Centre now wants to root out the menace altogether.

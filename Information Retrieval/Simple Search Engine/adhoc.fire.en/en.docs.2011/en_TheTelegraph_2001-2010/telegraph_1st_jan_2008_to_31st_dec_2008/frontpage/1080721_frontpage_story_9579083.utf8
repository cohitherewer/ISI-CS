	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today moved a one-line motion on vote of confidence in Parliament. The Prime Minister began the trust vote saying that every single decision we have taken is in the best interest of the nation. " We are here after a tenure of four years. And the credit goes to all leaders of the UPA," he said.   During his brief speech, Manmohan Singh said, "I had offered to all parties that we will come to Parliament before we go to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) for implementing the nuclear deal. "The Prime Minister said "visionary" leadership of several leaders including Jyoti Basu and Harkishan Singh Surjeet from the Left enabled formation of the coalition government.   Speaking on the withdrawal of support by the Left parties, he said that the withdrawal of support came "when I was in Japan. The moment I came back, I met the President and offered to face Parliament". The one-line motion was moved soon after the Parliament commenced its two-day special session for the government to seek a trust vote in the wake of Left parties withdrawing support.   Earlier, arriving at Parliament, Manmohan Singh said, "We will prove our majority on the floor of the House". He also waved at them and indicated a "V" sign before entering his office.   The session of Parliament began with the swearing in of seven new MPs. Opposing the confidence motion moved by the prime minister, BJP leader L K Advani criticised the UPA Government on the Indo-US nuclear deal and inflation. Advani went on to compare the UPA government to a patient in the ICU.   Advani said the Indo-US nuclear deal seemed to be between two individuals rather than two countries.   The senior BJP leader also questioned the UPA' s hush-hush stand on the IAEA draft, saying that if other countries could see it, why couldn't the people of India.  "Coalition dharma was not followed, that is why we are seeking a confidence motion today. We want to defeat the government on the floor of the house not destabilise it," he later said in his brief speech.   Addressing Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, he said: quot;Please don't blame anyone else for having this kind of a special session. This is the first time in the history of the Indian parliament that a minority government has been allowed to continue... if anyone is to be blamed, it is your government."

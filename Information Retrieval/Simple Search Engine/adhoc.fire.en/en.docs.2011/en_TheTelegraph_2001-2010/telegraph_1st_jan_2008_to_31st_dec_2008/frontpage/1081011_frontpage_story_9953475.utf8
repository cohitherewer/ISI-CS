          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 10: German wholesaler Metro Cash amp; Carry has been given a key licence devoid of the stifling conditions once mooted by the Forward Bloc.        
	The licence lifts the hurdle that prevented the company from commencing operations in Calcutta and offers some relief to the state government still licking the Singur wounds.        
	The stage for the breakthrough was set by the chief minister through a dramatic directive on September 26, which triggered a near-rebellion by the Bloc that eventually agreed to issue the licence by October 10. The licence permits Metro to sell and buy farm produce at its EM Bypass store.        
	The terms do not mention the quantitative limits the Bloc leadership had been referring to. The party had demanded that the value of each transaction at the store should not be less than Rs 50,000.        
	The figure was eventually brought down to Rs 1,000 per item per customer but did not make it to a memorandum of understanding signed this afternoon between Metro and the state agriculture marketing department secretary.        
	Sources said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee spoke to Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh to avert any last-minute political hiccups. Both the chief minister and Ghosh thanked each other after the issue was resolved, said Bloc leaders who described the agreement as an honourable compromise.        
	According to the document, the wholesaler cannot cater to retail buyers (household customers) and it cannot go in for contract farming. Neither goes against the public statements Metro has been making.        
	Another condition requires Metros farm-produce buyers to hold a trade licence, regulated market committee licence or any other business licence issued by an appropriate authority.        
	The Bloc is viewing the rule as a victory. But industry observers said the norm was in line with accepted practice as some form of licence was needed for traders to establish that they were not household customers.        
	If possible, we will set up our office in their (Metros) office to monitor the transactions, said state marketing board chairman and Bloc leader Naren Chatterjee, who had been opposed to granting Metro the licence.        
	In line with existing rules, Metro will have to pay the marketing committee a fee equivalent to one per cent of the value of every transaction.         
	Chatterjee said the state marketing board would be the authority to settle any dispute. A court can be moved only when the issue doesnt get resolved at the level of the board, he said. The memorandum has confined itself to saying all disputes shall be dealt with by the courts under the jurisdiction of Calcutta High Court.        
	Chatterjee, whose board revoked in 2007 the licence issued to Metro and precipitated a near-pullout, seemed to take pride at the turn of events. The Metro people told us that they never had such an experience in the 29 countries where the company operates, he said.        
	A delighted Metro executive director Frits van Peski said he was hopeful of launching the facility in six to eight weeks.

	London, Jan. 16: A nine-minute video of Tom Cruise talking about his scientology beliefs has apparently been leaked on to the internet.
    
	In the video, the Hollywood star claims the religion is the authority on helping people off drugs, rehabilitating criminals and can unite cultures to bring about world peace.
    
	To strains of the theme tune from his hit film trilogy Mission Impossible, Cruise also claims that only scientologists could help out at the scene of road accidents.
    
	The video comes as a new book by the royal biographer Andrew Morton says the actor has become the de-facto second-in-command of the Church of Scientology and is consulted on every aspect of the controversial groups planning and policy.

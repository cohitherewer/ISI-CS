  - Twist to Biranchi case        OUR BUREAU                            Raja Acharya                                        
	Bhubaneswar/Bhopal, April 22: The Biranchi Das murder case took a curious turn today when Chagala, an accomplice of prime accused Raja Acharya, confessed to have killed the coach of wunderkid Budhia but gave a clean chit to his boss.        
	To everyones shock, he named album and video actresses Leslie Tripathy and Bidusmita, senior IAS officer Priyabrata Patnaik and album producer and co-ordinator Jubuli Sundaray as plotters of the killing.        
	Sundaray fired at Das with a Mouser. I was standing beside him, Chagala told a Bhubaneswar channel over the phone.        
	The accomplice of Raja was arrested from Bhopal today after he gave himself up before the same channels Bhopal office chief. Before surrendering, Chagala called up officials at the channels Orissa station around 10.30am, who set him up for a personal interview with their Bhopal boss. Chagala, who sounded panicky, said he was calling from an STD booth in front of the Bhopal railway station.         
	According to his version, the plan to kill Das was chalked out four days before the murder at the elite Bhubaneswar Club. They offered me a bungalow, prime land and money if I did a job, which I was not aware of, said Chagala.         
	When I came to know that the target was Das, Rajas friend, I declined. But Sundaray said he will go ahead and I will have to accompany him, Chagala said.        
	Sundaray allegedly took Chagala to the Judo Association Hall on the day of the murder on a Yamaha motorcycle, where Das stayed.         
	According to the Rajas right hand man, Sundaray dressed like Raja and covered his face with a helmet.         
	Before we left for the hall, Patanik wished us luck over the phone, he said. It was Sundaray who shot at Biranchi, he claimed.         
	Explaining the motive behind the murder, Chagala said Das had swindled Rs 9 crore meant for Budhia and had promised a share to all the four involved.         
	But he bypassed all after receiving the money.         
	I dont know what to do as I know that the police commissioner is planning to kill me in some encounter, while Raja is irked with me as he is being dragged into the case. I am afraid, said Chagala.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mamata terms for Cong tie-up
          INDRANIL GHOSH                                        Mamata, Mukherjee: Mums the word                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 18: A Congress-Mamata alliance can be possible only if the Congress can assure her about its post-poll stand on the Left, Trinamul Congress leaders said today.        
	A buzz about such a tie-up had begun after a one-and-a-half-hour meeting between Mamata Banerjee and Pranab Mukherjee at the foreign ministers Delhi residence last evening. Mamata was accompanied by Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh and Trinamul MP Mukul Roy.        
	Mukherjee, speaking to The Telegraph over the phone, underlined the importance of the meeting but declined comment on specifics.        
	Roy, however, said: Everything is possible. After all, there was some understanding between the two parties in a few Assembly byelections in Bengal.        
	Sources said Mamata had recently explained to Sonia Gandhi, while seeking support for her Singur battle, that she could decide issues of alliance or seat adjustment only if she was sure about the Congresss position on the Left after the Lok Sabha elections.        
	Aides said Mamata had expressed reservations about a pact with the Congress.        
	We are not new to the game (of an alliance with the Congress), an aide quoted Mamata as saying. The Trinamul chief was referring to the tie-up before the 2001 Assembly elections that had led to bitter disappointment for both Opposition parties.        
	If anything meaningful is to happen this time, Mamata reportedly said, there had to be an unequivocal statement of intent from the Congress about the Left.        
	Asked about the meeting with Mukherjee, Mamata said in Calcutta today: There was no political discussion. Please dont ask me about political alliances. We had gone to meet Pranabbabu to apprise him of the Jamianagar incident and express concern at the harassment of minorities of the area.        
	Asked about BJP leader Sushma Swarajs announcement that Mamata was no longer with the NDA, she said: I have nothing to say.        
	Senior Trinamul leaders said that at yesterdays meeting, Mamata had referred to what she had told the Congress president.        
	No specifics were discussed at last evenings meeting, which addressed issues of general concern, a functionary said. After noting the demand by the Samajwadis for a judicial inquiry into the recent fake encounter at Jamianagar in Delhi, the participants turned their focus to general political issues.        
	The Samajwadis and the Congress are keen to capitalise on the goodwill Mamata has enjoyed among Bengals Muslims since her support to the family of Rizwanur Rahman.        
	Trinamul legislature party leader Partha Chatterjee said: We are still not sure what position the Congress may adopt (if and when) it emerges as the largest single party in the next Lok Sabha. Why embrace the Congress at all if it cannot forsake the Left in a clear manner before the elections? If the past is anything to go by, we need a clearer demonstration of faith from the Congress.        
	Trinamuls allies, such as Somen Mitra of the Progressive Indira Congress, have also advised caution. They feel that Trinamul must continue its policy of equal distance from the Congress and the BJP till the Congress clarifies its stand on the Left.        
	Trinamul also wants to wait till a clearer picture emerges about the future shape of the Bengal Congress, in disarray since its president, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, fell seriously ill.                    INPUTS FROM BARUN GHOSH

          A STAFF REPORTER                            Ajoy Kumar in court. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 30: Ajoy Kumar today became the first IPS officer to be sent to jail in Bengal in recent memory.         
	The former deputy commissioner of the detective department, charged with abetting the suicide of Rizwanur Rahman, will spend the night in Presidency Jail along with colleagues and co-accused Sukanti Chakraborty and Krishnendu Das.        
	The trio were remanded in judicial custody for 14 days after they surrendered before magistrate Madhumita Ray and sought bail. On September 22, the CBI court had directed the three to appear before it on October 27.         
	The three decided to surrender before the scheduled date hoping the prosecution would accept it in good faith and they would smoothly get bail, a legal counsellor of Bankshall court said.        
	In case an accused in a non-bailable offence surrenders, the magistrate has the liberty to grant bail or remand them in custody.         
	Kumar, in white T-shirt and black trousers, looked stunned when Ray refused bail. He had been waiting on a bench in the courtroom along with assistant commissioner Chakraborty and sub-inspector Das, who had arrived at the CBI court with him at 10.30am.         
	At 12.15pm, the magistrate rejected the bail plea moved by their lawyer Bishnu Charan Ghosh. Almost immediately, Chakrabortys cellphone rang and he stepped out to tell the caller: Aamar choddo diner jail hoye giyeche (I have been remanded in jail for 14 days).         
	No one had opposed the plea and CBI lawyer Partha Tapaswi was not present.        
	The officers were taken to the Bankshall court lock-up, where they sat on wooden chairs, shielded from the media glare by a huge cupboard. Deputy commissioner (central division) Damayanti Sen and assistant commissioner Nasim Ali waited with them till 7.35pm. Tea and snacks were served twice.        
	Around 4pm, the policemens lawyer approached Chief Metropolitan Magistrate S.S. Anand for a stay. Public prosecutor Samir Majumdar opposed it on the grounds that the CMM court did not have the power to order a stay. After a three-and-a-half-hour hearing, Anand rejected the plea on the grounds that his court was not higher than the CBI court and could not stay its order.         
	A prison van was brought to take the officers to Presidency but it wasnt used. They went in a Bolero of the Radio Flying Squad with a pilot car escorting it. Damayanti Sen was seen wiping tears.        
	In Presidency, another concession was lined up. Arrangements were made for them to sleep in the outpatients department of the jail hospital.        
	The trio will move the city sessions court for bail tomorrow. Police officers in the state couldnt recall any IPS officer being sent to jail before this.

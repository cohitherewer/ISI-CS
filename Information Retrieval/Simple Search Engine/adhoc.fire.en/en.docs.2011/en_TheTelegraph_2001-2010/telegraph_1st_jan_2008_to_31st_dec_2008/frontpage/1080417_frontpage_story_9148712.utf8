                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Pervez a hunk: Pak beauty
                                Sarkari: Ready for a date                            
	Islamabad, April 16 (PTI): President Pervez Musharraf may be facing the heat from all fronts but one Pakistani beauty thinks he is a hunk.        
	Reigning Miss Pakistan World Mahleej Sarkari found time last week to write a post on Musharraf on the pageants website.        
	A little note to the people of Pakistan. Going to international pageants we have found out how much Musharraf is known to all beautiful young girls, the beauty queens. Some have replied: Oh yes, the general man (sic). While others have said: The man who rules Pakistan, wrote Sarkari.        
	Everything positive... I think personally Musharraf sahab is very good-looking. Some Pakistani politicians may not agree with these gorgeous women. But here they are kissing Musharraf.        
	You know like Benazir, all men around the world thought she was a beauty. Similarly, Musharraf is a hunk. He has enough charisma to have young girls going nuts, Sarkari says in her post.        
	The beauty queen said she would love to date Musharraf if he asked her out. Yes, any time... I like him a lot..., she told a news website.        
	Sarkari also said she thought Mrs Musharraf would nod her head in agreement that her husband is an icon no matter what happens.        
	Sonia Ahmed, founder of the Miss Pakistan World pageant, is also a huge Musharraf fan. On the pageants website, there are several shots of beauty queens holding up Musharrafs picture, blowing kisses and saying: We love you Mushy.         
	Sarkari represented Pakistan in the Miss Tourism Queen International contest earlier this month in China.        
	She was raised in Karachi and has been in Toronto, Canada, for the past six years where she runs a spa business.        
	We are showing people that young women from Pakistan deserve a voice and can do great things when given the chance, Sarkari added.

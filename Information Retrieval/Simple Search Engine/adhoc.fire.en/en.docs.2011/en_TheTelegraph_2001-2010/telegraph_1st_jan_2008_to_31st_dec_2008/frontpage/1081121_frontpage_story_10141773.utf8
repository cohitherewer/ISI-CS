          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, Nov. 20: A herd of 80 elephants that entered a tea garden on the fringes of the town has been staying put there since evening, wreaking havoc and even killing a villager who fell on their path.         
	Mohorgong-Gulma Tea Estate is 8km from Siliguri town.        
	The elephants came out from the Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary around 6.30pm and reached the Gulma railway station to the north of Siliguri town, said Kanchan Banerjee, the range officer of Sukna Wildlife Squad, who visited the tea estate.         
	Tegbahadur Rai, a 47-year-old resident of Khairanipunding Busty, which is near the station, fell in front of the herd while he was on the way home from the market at Debidanga, 6km from Champasari More. He was trampled to death by one of the elephants.         
	Kumar Mahali was one of those who had seen Tegbahadur leave the market.        
	While talking to Mahali whose hut is located near the station, the trumpeting of the elephants and the sound of crackers being burst by foresters could be heard. The foresters removed the body around 8pm.         
	 Around 30 to 40 elephants had broken away from the main herd and entered further into the plantation. It seems that Tegbahadur might have fallen before them after he crossed the rail tracks. We are keeping a watch as there are chances that elephants may leave the plantation and enter our busty, said Mahali, who lives in one of the fringe villages.        
	The presence of the herd has left residents of Debidanga, Karaibari, Bhaisamari and nearby areas panicky, with most of them staying indoors. Many of them stood watch near their windows.         
	 We had been to Tegbahadurs busty. After the body was taken away, foresters told us to return saying they would start steering the herd back into the sanctuary, said Bikram Rai.        
	 Our men have been posted in strategic positions and they are trying to drive back the elephants, the range officer said.        
	In another incident, four to five elephants entered the Tukra-Jateswar area in Falakata in Jalpaiguri district this morning. Foresters from Binnaguri and Dalgaon went to the spot and drove them back into forest.

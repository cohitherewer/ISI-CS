	Mumbai, Jan. 30: An urn containing the Mahatmas ashes was emptied into the sea today by one of his granddaughters on the peace icons 60th death anniversary.
    
	The rites were performed by Neelamben Parikh, the frail 75-year-old daughter of Gandhis eldest son Harilal who remained estranged from his father until his death and did not participate in the funeral.
    
	As Neelamben emptied the urn into the Arabian Sea this morning, it marked a moment of reconciliation for the extended family that had come together in a brief but poorly-attended ceremony at Girgaum Chowpatty.
    
	The family  Ushaben Gokani, the daughter of another of Gandhis four sons, great-grandson Tushar and others  took small boats from Chowpatty for the ceremony.
    
	Neelamben, happy to be part of the event, said the controversy over her fathers troubled relations with the Mahatma  the subject of books, plays and films, including last years Gandhi My Father  was unwarranted. 
    
	I have shown in my book that the father and son had love for each other, even if they were not together. Its an emotional day for us, one meant for deep thought. This is a day we should remember him and remind ourselves of his teachings, said Neelamben, who has authored Mahatma Gandhis Lost Treasure: Harilal Gandhi. 
    
	Hindu customs require the eldest son to perform the last rites but Harilal was not on talking terms when the Mahatma fell to Nathuram Godses bullets this day in 1948. Harilal had died a lonely death in utter penury after spending his last days on the streets of Mumbai.

	Bapus three younger sons have been present at earlier rituals. So, Neelamben scattering the ashes is the right thing to do, said Ushaben, suggesting that the gesture to allow Harilals family to take part in todays event marked a symbolic healing of the rift.
    
	After the Mahatmas cremation, urns containing his ashes were sent to followers across the country, to be displayed at memorials. One of those urns was with Dubai businessman Bharat Narayan, whose father Sriman, a Gandhian, had kept the ashes with him.
    
	After Srimans death last year, the urn was given to Mani Bhavan, a Gandhi museum, here. But the Gandhi family objected to the public display and wanted the ashes to be emptied into the sea.
    
	It is not known how many such urns are still around. Ashes from an urn found in a bank vault in 1997 were scattered by Tushar Gandhi in the Ganges, but only after he won a court battle for its custody.
    
	Todays ritual followed a ceremonial guard of honour attended by Union home minister Shivraj Patil, Maharashtra governor S.M. Krishna and deputy chief minister R.R. Patil.
    
	Congress MP Priya Dutt was there, too, but her brother Sanjay, whose Lage Raho Munnabhai gave the Mahatmas messages a contemporary ring, was away in Goa, shooting for Kidnap.
    
	The small crowd of 200 people surprised visitors. I thought this would be a big event. I am surprised that not many people have turned up, said Frank Grosser, a German tourist. 
    
	But Rachana Parikh, a descendent of the Gandhis, felt it was worthwhile. It makes me feel closer to Mahatma and his principles. It is humbling to be present along with freedom fighters who once worked with Bapu.
    
	Urmila Vora, 72, turned emotional as she watched the ashes being scattered. It is an emotional moment for me to see the last remains of a great man being immersed. Hope he is reborn, said the doctor, who was a child in Gujarats Bhavnagar when the ashes of the Mahatma were taken around after his funeral.

  - NREGA norms flouted, Drze team report with Jharkhand govt           SANTOSH K. KIRO                             Jean Drze at the social audit programme in Palamau. Telegraph picture                                        
	Chhatarpur (Palamau), May 26: Fake muster rolls, forged signatures and fraudulent job applications. Thats the reality facing Naxalite-hit Palamau district as it struggles to implement the UPA governments showpiece employment scheme conducted under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA).        
	Twelve days after the murder of Lalit Mehta, an associate of economist and NREGA architect Jean Drze, while conducting a social audit of the scheme, thousands of villagers from the villages of Chhatarpur and Chainpur blocks today marched together to confirm what the team had found: massive irregularities in the implementation of the scheme.        
	Angered by Mehtas murder, the villagers willingly took part in a public hearing held at the Government High School, Chhatarpur, and left government officials red faced with their stories of exploitation: no one got the mandatory 100 days work, no one got paid and, most of all, all were in the clutch of middlemen who cornered all benefits.         
	Even a message from UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi condemning Mehtas murder  it was read out at the venue  failed to pacify the angry villagers.        
	The Palamau administration has flouted all norms of NREGA in its implementation. The middleman has usurped all the benefits, which actually is for the villagers, said Drze.         
	A team of students of the GB Pant Social Institute, Allahabad, led by Drze, and members of local NGO Gram Swaraj Abhiyan had been visiting door-to-door to carry out a social audit of NREGA since May 13, the day before Mehta was murdered.         
	They were in the villages of Khendra Khurd, Cheeru, Mandiya Toli, Ghamariya, Goriyathan, Huttukdag, Arrar, Gamhariyadih, Shushiganj, Kachnarpur Madva, Charai  all in Chhatarpur block  and Samariya and Khura Khurd  both in Chainpur block.                           
	Known for its poverty, illiteracy and malnutrition, Palamau district is one of the states most backward districts. Its hilly terrain and thick forest cover make it a Maoist haven.        
	The social audit pointed to several specific instances of irregularities. For instance, in Khedra Khurd where a pond was being dug, there were 108 names in the muster roll. But in reality only 18 had been working at the site.         
	Likewise, in Cheeru village of Chhatarpur block, several names in the muster rolls were fake. Suresh Thakur, the first name on the rolls, is illiterate and does not know how to sign his name, said Reetika Khera, a survey co-ordinator. But there is a signature in the muster roll against his name. It has been forged, she added.         
	Also, in several places, tractors had been used for the work which was not allowed under NREGA. This apart, there were several payment issues: the minimum daily wage was Rs 86, but block officials were said to be paying different amounts for men and women.         
	The team, has already handed over a report to the state government. We have formally apprised the matter to NREGA commissioner and advised him to take corrective measures to ensure proper implementation of the act, Drze said.         
	Government officials, including state NREGA commissioner Amitabh Kaushal, Palamau deputy commissioner N.P. Singh and block development officers, had a tough time trying to explain the issues to the people.         
	Earlier, before the start of the public hearing, Annie Raja, member, Central Employment Guarantee Council, read out a message from Sonia. I am shocked and saddened at the murder of Lalit Mehta, the message said. I have been told that Mehta worked in the region for the right to food. I also have learnt he had been carrying out social audit on the NREGA implementation. May be his work became a threat for those involved in the irregularities, which ultimately led to his killing.         
	Sonia asked the people of Chhatarpur not to give up in their struggle for right to food, and added, I would extend all help if asked.        
	Among the others present at todays public hearing were state activists Balram Singh, Binay Ohdar, Kapileswar Ram, Gopinath Ghosh and Ramdev Viswabandhu. PUCL members Shashi Bhushan Pathak and Nandlal Singh were also present.

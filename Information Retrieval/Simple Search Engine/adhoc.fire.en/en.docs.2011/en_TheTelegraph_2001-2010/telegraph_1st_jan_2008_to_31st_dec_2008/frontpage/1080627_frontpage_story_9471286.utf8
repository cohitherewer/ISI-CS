          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                                              
	Calcutta, June 26: Home loans, which had reversed a trend and started turning cheaper from early this year, have become costlier again.        
	The hike, on the cards since inflation hit double digits, became a mere formality after the SBI announced an increase in its prime lending rate (PLR) by 0.5 percentage point to 12.75 per cent from tomorrow.        
	The bank raised the benchmark lending rate following the RBI announcement on Tuesday to increase its repo rate (short-term lending rate) and cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 0.5 percentage point each to tame inflation.         
	HDFC, Yes Bank and Jammu and Kashmir Bank had increased their PLR by 0.25 to one percentage point last week anticipating the RBI move.        
	If the hike by HDFC, the home loan giant, set the tone, the SBI move is expected to have a ripple effect as it is the market leader in banking.        
	Echoing the SBI, the Union Bank of India said it would raise its PLR by 0.5 percentage point from July 1. Other banks and financial institutions are expected to follow suit this week or early next month.         
	The implication will be a rise in home loan rates for both existing borrowers, especially those with floating rates, and new ones.        
	If you think a fixed rate loan is a better option, there is a catch. Besides HDFC and ICICI Bank, no one is offering a home loan for over five years with a fixed interest rate. Even HDFC and ICICI Bank are charging 3 to 4 percentage points more than the floating rate.         
	Public sector lenders such as the SBI are charging 2 percentage points more for a fixed rate loan than a floating one but have included a clause from February that the fixed rate would be revised every two years.         
	The home loan party started souring from June 2005 with the gradual increase in interest rates from 7.5 per cent to around 12 per cent by April 2007. Interest rates on home loans had nearly halved from 14 per cent to 7.5 per cent between 2000 and 2005.         
	From June 2007, however, home loan rates started declining again. By February this year, many banks offered a five to 10-year loan (up to Rs 30 lakh) for as low as 9.25 per cent.         
	But after successive increases in CRR and repo rate by the RBI, interest rates for home and car loans are set to go up again.

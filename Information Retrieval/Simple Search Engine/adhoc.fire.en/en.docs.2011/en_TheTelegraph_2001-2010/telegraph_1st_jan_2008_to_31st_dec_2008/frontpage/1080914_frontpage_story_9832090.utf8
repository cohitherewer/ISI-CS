	New Delhi, Sept. 13: Five blasts targeted upscale weekend shoppers in Indias capital this evening, killing at least 25 and leaving young women in jeans and cargoes bloodied on the lawns of a Connaught Place park.        
	More than 100 were injured by the bombs, most of them placed inside dustbins, that went off between 6.11 and 6.45 at crowded shopping districts frequented by the well-to-do. The evening peak hour and proximity of the festival season ensured a high number of women victims.        
	The places targeted are household names in India  Connaught Place, Karol Bagh and Greater Kailash  marking a contrast to the July Ahmedabad blasts where most of the bombs had picked out downmarket roadsides.        
	But the intended hit list was longer: one bomb was defused near India Gate, two near Regal cinema and a fourth on Parliament Street.        
	One similarity with Ahmedabad was an email from the shadowy Indian Mujahideen to TV offices, although it isnt clear if it was a warning preceding the blasts or a claim of responsibility afterwards.        
	The first bomb littered Karol Baghs foreign-goods hub of Gaffar Market with glass shards and torn limbs. Two blasts followed at Connaught Place  at Central Park where young people had gathered, and near a Metro entrance on Barakhamba Road, lined by foreign banks and multinational offices.                  
	Both bombs were hidden in dustbins. Police are questioning two persons, one of them a 12-year-old who claims to have seen two men in black clothes lower a grey tiffin box into a dustbin.        
	The last two blasts took place in M. Block market of Greater Kailash I, one bomb planted in a dustbin and the other on a rickshaw.        
	The Karol Bagh bomb, placed near a Maruti, shattered windowpanes within 50 feet, damaged cars and two-wheelers and hurled an auto-rickshaw against the overhead electric wires, eyewitnesses said.        
	I cant find my son. He was playing in the street, a mother cried. Two ladies lost their legs, said Sanjay, driver of a school van who took three injured to hospital.        
	Around 6.30, we heard a loud noise. People were running all over the place, said student Chanchal Kumar at Connaught Place, his shirt soaked in the blood of victims he helped shift into ambulances. Police vans and auto-rickshaws too ferried the injured to hospital.        
	No one was killed in Greater Kailash I where, immediately after the first, low-intensity blast, market authorities asked people over the public address system to hide inside the shops or gather in an open park. The next blast was stronger but only injured two persons.        
	Ball bearings of bicycles and a chemical that doesnt look like RDX seem to have been used, south Delhi deputy commissioner of police H.G.S. Dhaliwal said, drawing a parallel with the May explosions in Jaipur that killed 65 and the Ahmedabad blasts where the toll was 49.        
	The attack brought back memories of the pre-Diwali, pre-Id bombings in Delhi that had killed 68 shoppers on October 29, 2005.        
	There was chaos on the roads as people rushed back home. Mobile lines were jammed as frantic families  many from outside Delhi  tried to contact loved ones. The police set up a helpline, 011-23490312, for information about victims.        
	The Indian Mujahideen email has been traced to Mumbais northeastern suburbs, a police officer said, adding that a team had left for Mumbai.        
	Sources said the email came from Turbhe, sandwiched between Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. The previous Indian Mujahideen email had been traced to Navi Mumbais Nerul, and had been sent probably by hacking the wi-fi network of an American resident, Ken Haywood.

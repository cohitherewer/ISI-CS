	Calcutta, Dec. 30: A drowsy Royal Bengal Tiger died in captivity tonight, two days after it was trapped and tranquillised when it strayed into a village in the Sunderbans and attacked a girl.         
	Septicaemia (poisoning of blood) from a wound on the right front paw had possibly caused its death, Atanu Kumar Raha, Bengals principal chief conservator of forest, said.        
	The age of the tiger was put at 14. The average life span of the big cat, an endangered species, is 15.        
	The tiger died at 8.30pm on Tuesday at Bony Camp, a wild-animal shelter 300km from Calcutta, where the animal was taken after it was tranquillised by the deputy ranger of the Sunderban Tiger Reserve on Sunday.        
	The tiger was examined by a doctor from Alipore zoo today. During the examination, the oozing of pus was detected, Raha said.        
	He denied suggestions that the tiger had died because of tranquilliser overdose. The drug Katamine has been used in 50 previous cases and there was no problem. Even if there is overdose, the tiger will oversleep and the drug is excreted through urine, Raha said. The tiger was on intravenous drip and had been drinking water, Raha added.         
	However, some forest department sources said the possibility of tranquilliser overdose could not be ruled out. Katamine was combined with Xylazine drug, which makes the tranquilliser stronger, an official said. The tiger was old and may not have been able to withstand the dose.        
	The tiger, which had strayed into Kantamari village in Kultali, 210km from Calcutta, was taken to the rescue shelter in the middle of a river by van and launch.        
	It slept till 7.30pm on Sunday. When it awoke, the tiger was given some chicken but did not eat it. Officials took it by launch down the Kulmi River to release it into Ajmal forest yesterday. But since it was drowsy, they brought it back to the camp.         
	This morning, the tiger was still drowsy. Again it was taken near the forest to see if it would react to its natural habitat, but it did not.        
	This evening, another old tiger was trapped in a South 24-Parganas village.         
	The last census in 2004 put the number of tigers in the Sunderbans between 250 and 375, Raha said.

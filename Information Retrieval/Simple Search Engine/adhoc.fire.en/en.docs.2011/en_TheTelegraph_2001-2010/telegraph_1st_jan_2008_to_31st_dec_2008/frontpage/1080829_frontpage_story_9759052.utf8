  - Prime Ministers balm for bihar          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar welcomes Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Union home minister Shivraj Patil at the Purnea airbase on Thursday. (PTI)                                        
	Patna, Aug. 28: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today promised Rs 1,000 crore and 1.25 lakh tonnes of foodgrain to people hit by the worst-ever flood in the state.        
	With the Kosi playing havoc in five districts bordering Nepal, Singh declared the floods to be a national disaster. It has already submerged Madhepura and Supaul towns.         
	The Prime Minister assured all help to the state to tide over the situation after carrying out an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas. The Prime Minister, with UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, Union home minister Shivraj Patil, railway minister Lalu Prasad and chemical and fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan in tow, carried out a survey of Supaul, Saharsa, Araria and Madhepura districts.        
	Singh, Sonia and the rest of the Union ministers landed at Purnea airbase in a special air force plane, where Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar received them.        
	Later, Nitish thanked Singh for the generous grant and said: I am grateful to the Prime Minister and Sonia for responding to the needs of the marooned millions.         
	Encouraged by the Prime Ministers announcement, the chief minister said that his government would build relief camps fully equipped with food, drinking water and healthcare.         
	The state government will not let its people feel helpless, he said, adding that the Union governments relief had come just on time.        
	The chief ministers camp plan has come in time, too, as experts predict that victims would have to stay in relief camps till March and April, because there is little possibility of water receding before that.         
	Nitish appealed masses and NGOs to come forth with cash and kind to help the state rehabilitate displaced people as the process would require at least Rs 950 crore.         
	The government is now faced with an enormous task of rebuilding homes and habitation washed away by the Kosi, he said. Three columns of the army and over 650 motorboats have already been engaged in evacuating people trapped in the new channels the Kosi has created.         
	Nitish, who met the Prime Minister yesterday in Delhi, confirmed that the devastation had claimed 55 lives, besides rendering 20 lakh people homeless.         
	Dinesh Kumar Mishra, a flood expert from Saharsa and an author of several books on the Kosi, told The Telegraph: I have seen 40 bodies floating in an Araria village. The officials have no foolproof mechanism to count the number of people trapped and drowning in the remote and inaccessible areas.

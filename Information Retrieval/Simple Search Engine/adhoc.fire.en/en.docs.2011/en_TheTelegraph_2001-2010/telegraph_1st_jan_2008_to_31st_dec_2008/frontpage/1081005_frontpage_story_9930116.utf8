The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nano or no, Puja party goes on
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Nano or no, Puja party goes on
  - SRK cheers city with dhaak amp; dhunuchi           A STAFF REPORTER                            Shah Rukh Khan celebrates Durga Puja in Calcutta on Saturday. Picture by Aranya Sen                                        
	We have taken this decision today, perhaps not the best day to make such an announcement on the eve of your Puja  Ratan Tata, saying bye-bye Bengal on Friday evening.              
	Ratan Tata need not have been apologetic about the timing of the pullout because it just gave Calcutta something big to beat the small-car blues with  Durga puja.        
	With hours to go for the Devi to arrive on an elephant (signifying plenty of water and an earth full of crops), the crowd crush at shopping addresses and the buzz around pandals on Panchami proved that the city had swiftly found something to clutch on to.        
	Whether the Tatas are there or not will make no difference to the pujas. The number of people thronging the pandals, eating out and enjoying themselves for five days will remain the same. Compared to Durga Puja the Nano is a very small issue, said Dipankar Mukherjee of Adi Ballygunge Sarbojanin Durgotsab Samity.        
	Those looking beyond the fleeting festive week spoke about a bleak industrial future and brand Bengal taking a hit  but they were all, of course, armed with overflowing shopping bags.        
	If it was bye-bye yesterday, it is buy-buy today, smiled Surajit Sen, a young entrepreneur raiding the racks at South City, who felt the blow of the Tata pullout would actually be softened by its timing.        
	If Puja shopping and preparations werent enough to lift the spirits of a city bruised by the Nano battle, in stepped Shah Rukh Khan with dhaak and dhunuchi.        
	Yeh ab mera city hai Coming from the airport today, I realised I have been away for quite some time and I have really missed Calcutta, said Shah Rukh on the Science City stage, within 24 hours of state industries minister Nirupam Sen admitting that he no longer felt like living in Bengal.        
	Timing played a key role with the Khan Dada of the Kolkata Knight Riders beating the festive drum, doing a few dhunuchi steps, grooving to the team anthem of Korbo, lorbo, jeetbo re and announcing: It was my dream to share my love with everyone in this city during the Puja.        
	Fans like Smita Gupta, a teenager waiting in the hotel lobby to catch a glimpse of her hero, lapped it up. Yesterday, the mood was korbo na, lorbo na, harbo re. Thanks to Puja and SRK, the city is buoyant again, even if that feel-good factor lasts just a few days, she said.        
	The next few days are all that matter to Animesh Chakraborty, the treasurer of Barisha Club in Behala, for whom rain can be a damper, not Ratan. A rain-free and hassle-free Puja is what is on our minds, not the Tatas, he stressed, praying for the grey clouds over the pandal  depicting various timekeeping tools  to clear.        
	One pandal where the focus will firmly be on the Nano is the Santosh Mitra Square off Sealdah. The showpiece of the pro-industry theme here is a prototype christened Nata Mano. We had earlier planned to put up one large billboard with a pro-industry message. After the pullout yesterday, we have decided to put up another one near the entrance and raise our pitch for industrialisation in Bengal, said Pradip Ghosh, president of the puja committee.        
	At most of the 2,000-plus pujas around town, the Tata pullout will be no more than a talking point, felt organisers and revellers. Yes, everyone will be talking about it at the pandals but I dont think that will spoil the festive mood at all. These five days are just too precious for us, said Sayon Dutta, a software engineer.        
	The belligerence of the Puja party mood was evident at City Centre, flooded by families and friends.         
	Lets face it, we live for these few days of the year. Not even security concerns can keep the Calcuttan indoors for the next few days, forget about sulking over Singur, said Sundeep Mishra, a 24-year-old call centre employee discussing the Nano duel with friends while debating which Nokia cellphone to buy for the pujas.        
	If its all about the urge to splurge and the temptation to have a good time, Calcutta could soon have new-found citizen Shah Rukh to thank for some more action. I will bring my Temptations tour to Calcutta. Main pura ek show leke aoonga. Shotti! he promised. (And no, he didnt say he would bring it despite Mamata.)        
	But the writing for a state in festive denial could be in the scriptures. The Devi departs on palanquin this Dashami, apparently leaving in her wake famine and want.        
	Maybe Ratan Tata was right about the timing of the pullout being wrong, after all.

          OUR BUREAU                            Ishmeet                                  
	Calcutta, July 30: An official of the Maldives hotel where Ishmeet Singh, the STAR Voice of India winner who died yesterday, stayed has said the youth did not know how to swim but had ventured into the deep end of the swimming pool.        
	He didnt know how to swim but went to the deep end. The deep-end is 2.3 metres, Marlon Robert, an assistant manager of Dhonveli Beach Resort, told The Telegraph over the phone.        
	Initial reports had suggested that Ishmeet had jumped into the shallow end of the pool.        
	The incident happened between 5 and 5.30pm, Robert said, adding that his version was based on the account of two witnesses. One of the guests jumped into the pool and pulled the 20-year-old Ishmeet out in 30 seconds.        
	By then, he was dead. Our resident doctor found no pulse. But since he is not qualified to make a pronouncement, Ishmeet was rushed in a boat to hospital. Our front office manager, who is a CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) specialist, tried to revive him all the way, Robert said.        
	The hospital, ADK, is in Male, the capital of the Maldives, about 20 minutes by boat from the island-resort. Ishmeet was definitely not drunk. We can guarantee that, Robert added.        
	Ishmeet was dead when he was brought to us. We tried our best to revive him, but failed. We also wanted to conduct a complete scan of his body but needed a close relatives consent. But no one from his family was present, ADK Hospital managing director Mohamed Affal said.

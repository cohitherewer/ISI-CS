                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Abducted boys in Prepak custody
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Imphal, July 10: The two schoolboys who went missing from their neighbourhood in Imphal West on Sunday evening were in the custody of the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (Prepak-general secretary group), their mothers said today.         
	Yengkhom Ibeyaima and Angom Rita, the mothers of Yengkhom Naobi Singh and Angom Langamba Singh, today told the media that on Monday morning a caller who identified himself as a member of Prepak (GS) told them that their sons were in their custody and would be brought to their homes after two days. The boys had brief conversations with their mothers.         
	The caller did not mention any motive for keeping the boys in their custody. No one has, however, claimed responsibility for the abduction.         
	The two women appealed to the kidnappers to send their sons back and urged the government and the people of Manipur to help them find our sons.         
	 The Prepak Cobra Task Force apparently paraded the two children before journalists this evening somewhere in Bishnupur district, where the children told the media that they had gone willingly to join the movement.        
	The mothers, however, had a totally different account. My son told me that he wanted to come home but was not released by his captors, Rita said. A day after our sons went missing, a caller, who identified himself as a member of Prepak (GS), told us over phone that Langamba and Naobi were in the custody of the outfit, she said.         
	There was no further contact since the telephone conversation on Monday morning. The boys have remained untraced since. A case has been registered with Lamphel police station of Imphal West.         
	We are conducting raids in several areas, the police said.         
	The residents of Eroisemba have formed a joint action committee demanding that the two boys be released at the earliest.         
	Meira paibis (women activists) in Manipur today staged a sit-in at the local community hall demanding their release. The adviser to the committee, N. Sorojini, who was present at todays news conference, urged all armed groups to rescue the boys.         
	We do not want to launch a mass movement fearing that the children could be killed as was done in the case of Lungnila Elizabeth, Sorojini said.         
	In 2003, the eight-year-old daughter of then education minister Francis Ngajokpa was kidnapped and murdered by some unknown persons. The police are yet to crack the case.         
	Sorojini said the committee would hold a meeting soon to chalk out its future course of action if the boys were not released in the next few days.         
	Student escapes        
	A student kidnapped by two unidentified youths from Imphal city yesterday escaped from his abductors. He was walking towards Kangjabi for tuition when the duo snatched him. Yengkhom Lanchenba, 14, told journalists today that after being kidnapped at gunpoint at 4.30pm from the Thangal Bazar area, he was taken to a house under construction in an undisclosed location in Imphal West. He reached home around 8pm.        
	 After passing Class VIII from Holy Home School in Srirampur near Calcutta, he is yet to get admission to any school.

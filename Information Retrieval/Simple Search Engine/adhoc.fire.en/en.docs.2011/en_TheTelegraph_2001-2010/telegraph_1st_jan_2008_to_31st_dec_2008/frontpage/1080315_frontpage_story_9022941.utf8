The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Welcome to Calcutta, but pay strike cess
                                                                                                           Welcome to Calcutta, but pay strike cess
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Calcutta, March 14: Calcuttas strike culture has pushed its airport authorities into an embarrassing scrap with domestic and international carriers.        
	At the centre of the row is the Airports Authority of Indias demand this morning that the airlines pay up for the delay in clearing their cargo from its warehouse during the March 12-13 strike.        
	The airlines, protesting the delay was the fault of the AAIs own striking employees, stopped booking cargo in or out of Calcutta.        
	Red-faced AAI officials, who had gone by the book in clamping the fine, were tonight hinting at a waiver if their Delhi headquarters okayed the concession tomorrow.        
	The mess, however, threatens to make a laughing stock of Calcutta, the lone airport to be hobbled by the March 12-13 country-wide strike.        
	I received a fax (from the Calcutta AAI) this evening and was extremely surprised, K. Mishra, executive director (cargo), AAI, told The Telegraph from New Delhi. Cargo uploading and offloading were normal in all other airports during the strike.        
	Airlines can stock cargo in the AAI warehouse free of charge for 48 hours. After that, they must pay a sort of late fee or demurrage charges of Rs 1.50 per kg per day.        
	Sources said over 100 tonnes of cargo  including leather goods, machine parts, foodstuff, sports goods, silk fabrics and tea  was lying in the warehouse.        
	The goods could not be cleared because airport employees were not co-operating. The authorities cannot now ask us to pay demurrage charges, said Louis Alphonso, chairman of the airports cargo facilitation committee, which represents the airlines.        
	Usually, airport staff wheel the cargo out to a part of the terminal where the airlines receive it. Not a single trolley left the Calcutta warehouse during the strike.        
	Airlines had already lost crores because the strike not only stopped cargo movement in and out of Calcutta but caused perishable stuff to rot in the warehouse. Whatever cargo was flown in during the strike was dumped outside the warehouse.        
	Told of the demurrage charges, the 20-odd Indian and foreign airlines that use the warehouse stopped booking cargo or uploading goods.        
	Two Singapore Airlines freighters, bound for Amsterdam, took off without any cargo although the carrier has over 20 tonnes of goods stuck at the warehouse. Emirates, with 30 tonnes of cargo stranded, cancelled import orders from Dubai.

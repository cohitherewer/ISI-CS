	Santiniketan, Jan. 7: Amaresh Kundu chased Saswati Pal around a bed as she begged for mercy and tried to hide behind a friend from the Webley Scott her spurned lover pointed at her.
 
	Sangit Bhavan student Poushali Mukherjee told police today the young man threw her out of her Ananda Sadan hostel room before he shot Saswati twice.
 
	Investigators said Amaresh, 29, fired four bullets, not two as thought earlier. While he pumped two into Saswati, he shot himself twice.
 
	A police officer said one bullet pierced his temple and the other ploughed through his neck and out of his body.
 
	Investigators said Saswati, 21, entered the ground-floor room Poushali shared with Tanya Chakraborty, another Sangit Bhavan student, after she saw Amaresh talking with the hostel cleaner.
 
	Talking to students close to Poushali and Tanya, we came to know they were inside the room around 12.10pm yesterday when Saswati came in. A little later, Amaresh barged in, whipped out the Webley Scott revolver and shouted tokey aaj marbo (I will kill you today) at Saswati, an officer involved with the probe said.
 
	Amaresh took out his gun and Saswati ran behind me, Poushali, who has gone back to her home in Jamshedpur, told relative Gagan Sarkar, a Visva-Bharati employee.
 
	A police officer said Amaresh kept screaming at Saswati, who pleaded with him to control his anger and begged for her life. Tanya stood near the door perplexed before running out of the room. 
 
	I shouted for help, Tanya told The Telegraph tonight from her home in Barasat, North 24-Parganas.
 
	Deputy inspector-general (Burdwan range) Anuj Sharma said Amaresh then caught hold of Poushali and threw her out of the room. 
 
	He slammed the door shut and fired four bullets, added another officer.
 
	Birbhum police chief L.N. Meena said the investigators were also checking three mobile phones seized from the spot along with the revolver.
 
	The autopsy on Saswatis body was carried out at Bolpur sub-divisional hospital.
 
	At Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, where doctors conducted the post-mortem on Amareshs body, his father Bijoy said: They left my son virtually unattended at Bolpur hospital and he was sent to Burdwan Medical College where there is no neurosurgeon. Had there been no delay, he might have survived.

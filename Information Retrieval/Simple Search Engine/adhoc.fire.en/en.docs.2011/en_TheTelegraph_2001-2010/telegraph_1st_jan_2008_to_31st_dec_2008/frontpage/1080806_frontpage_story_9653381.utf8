          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: A Delhi High Court tribunal today overturned the ban on the Students Islamic Movement of India (Simi), ruling that the Union home ministry has insufficient evidence against the organisation blamed for the recent serial blasts.        
	Home ministry sources reacted immediately, saying they would appeal in the Supreme Court against the ruling of Geeta Mittals one-judge tribunal. The sources asserted that todays ruling does not alter the terror-label on Simi and that it did not mean the organisation could resume functioning as a legitimate body.        
	Even if the higher court reimposes the ban, todays order will leave the government vulnerable to charges of negligence at a time the wounds of the Bangalore and Ahmedabad are raw and the Opposition has been targeting the Centres record in fighting terror.        
	The governments refrain of blaming Simi for every terror attack could also begin to sound hollow with the revelation that the official machinery had not been able to furnish any new proof.        
	Tribunal head Justice Mittal held that no new evidence was submitted by the government to justify the extension of the ban on Simi, a PTI report quoted a law officer as saying.        
	The government confined itself to furnishing evidence linked to the Malegaon blasts in Maharashtra in 2006 to show the complicity of the organisation in unlawful activities, but that was not sufficient to come out with the notification to ban it, the tribunal ruled.        
	Beginning September 2001, Simi had thrice been banned by the government on suspicion of involvement in terror attacks across the country. The last notification on the ban, which was challenged in the tribunal, was issued by the home ministry on February 7 and was supposed to have been in force till 2010.        
	Initially, the tribunal had conducted the proceedings in an open court. But later it decided to hear the matter in-camera in the presence of the home secretary and senior intelligence officials.        
	Tridip Pais, counsel for Simi, welcomed the tribunals ruling and said the organisation had been prosecuted by successive governments based not on any evidence but merely on half-baked suspicions.        
	Pais agreed with the contention that Simi might not be able to resume overground activity because it was still tagged a terrorist organisation. But he said no government agency had ever been able to prove that any member of Simi had indulged in a terrorist activity.         
	A former head of Simi, Shahi Badr Filahi, also welcomed the ruling, saying justice had been done to a deliberately tarnished organisation.         
	The opposition BJP, however, was quick to term the ruling another instance of the UPA being soft on terror. BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar claimed that there was sufficient evidence of Simis involvement in terrorist activities across the country and the government should make amends by bringing forth the evidence to challenge the lifting of the ban on Simi.

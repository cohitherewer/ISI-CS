	Ranchi, Sept. 12: The state government today decided to continue with advocate-general S. B. Gadodia, but Governor Syed Sibtey Razi is understood to have summoned him to explain that he had to follow constitutional convention and immediately resign before being re-appointed again.        
	According to Raj Bhavan sources, the governor cited a report of The Telegraph published on September 11 and reminded Gadodia that the Madhu Koda government which had appointed him had resigned. Convention required that the advocate-general also quit. But you are not following the convention of quitting along with the chief minister, Razi is learnt to have told Gadodia.        
	But Gadodia, according to sources, told him that the new government wanted him to extend his services. To this, the governor clarified there was no provision of giving an extension to the advocate-general under the Constitution. The new government headed by Shibu Soren might like to reappoint him, but for that he would have to resign from the post first, Razi told him.        
	The sources said that the governor, upset with Gadodias reluctance, made it clear that he was not taking the harsh action of dismissing him keeping in view the dignity of the constitutional office.         
	Under Article 165, the governor appoints the advocate-general and he holds office during the pleasure of the governor. He is said to have also cited a complaint, submitted by a set of lawyers against Gadodia, giving details of corruption charges against him.         
	Meanwhile, deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi said the cabinet had decided to extend Gadodias service. We have two cases involving panchayat elections and related to the forest act pending in the Supreme Court. So, it would not be proper for the government to change him now.

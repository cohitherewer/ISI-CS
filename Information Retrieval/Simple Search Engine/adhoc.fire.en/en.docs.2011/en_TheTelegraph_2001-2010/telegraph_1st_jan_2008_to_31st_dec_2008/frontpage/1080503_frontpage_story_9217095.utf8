          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 2: Actress and model Leslie Tripathy today admitted to have sought the help of bureaucrat Priyabrata Patnaik and Biranchi Das to fend off gangster Raja Acharyas overtures.        
	Raja alias Sandeep Acharya, the prime suspect in the Biranchi murder, was reportedly stalking Leslie and wished to marry her.         
	Leslie was interrogatwed for nearly two-and-a-half hours yesterday. Besides Leslie, her father S.N. Tripathy and album co-ordinator Jubuli Sunderray were also quizzed. The interrogations were video recorded.        
	The actress revealed that she was being continuously threatened by Raja to accept the offer. He (Raja) was after me and my life, a police officer quoted the model saying. It was then that I sought the help of Patnaik to tackle Raja, she admitted.        
	Meanwhile, Jubuli also admitted to have known Raja for quite some time and he had requested the gangster to not bother the starlet.         
	Talking to the media, police commissioner Binay Behera repeated that the police got clues during Leslies interrogation. Events that happened before the murder and Rajas obsession with the starlet has come to the fore with yesterdays interrogation and will help us to investigate the case better, he said.        
	Along with Leslie, another actress Bidusmita was also quizzed for the second consecutive day today. The location was kept a secret.         
	Two more key persons, who are involved in the case, are likely to be quizzed in the following days.         
	Though Behera refused to divulge the names, he hinted that the two were out of station at present and would be interrogated as soon as they arrive.

          INDRANIL GHOSH                               
	Calcutta, Aug. 30: Back-channel mediators racing against odds to salvage the Singur project see a glimmer of hope in their apparent success in identifying areas where the main concerns of both Mamata Banerjee and the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government can be accommodated.        
	Forty-eight hours into their job, the mediators have come up with a handful of proposals and begun to sound out the Trinamul Congress, the state government and the Tatas. After they respond, the formula could be fine-tuned over the weekend.        
	We cannot yet say the deadlock over negotiations has been broken, an official involved in the mediation efforts said. But whats an important achievement is that all the sides are now talking to one another. They are doing it through us. We want to keep it going.        
	The development comes at a time when, sources said, the dominant view within Tata Motors is to take a call on the future of the project in Singur around Tuesday-Wednesday.        
	The key issue would be how Mamata Banerjees supporters behave on Monday when the engineers and workers are brought back to resume operations that were stopped yesterday after Thursdays blockade outside the factory gates.        
	There is no other option but to timetable the final call, a senior Tata Motors source said. We cannot be expected to operate in such a hostile environment. We wrote to her (Mamata) several times, but she did not respond.        
	The back-channel discussions have centred on three issues, sources said.        
	One, whether Mamata has her math right in talking of 400 acres being taken over without consent, which she wants returned. Two, if the government is correct in claiming that returning any part of the land would be legally impossible. And three, whether the cash compensation can be increased for all the landlosers, willing or unwilling, with active support from the Tatas.        
	A source involved in the back-channel communications  the mediators include politicians, lawyers and bureaucrats  said the proposals would require all sides to scale down demands and (make) other sacrifices.        
	What gives us some hope is that each side has begun to realise that everyone can emerge a winner by tempering their individual positions, the source said.        
	Tata Motors is apparently averse to a government suggestion to relocate some of the ancillary units that havent been set up yet.         
	The sources said the company told the government it was willing to increase the cash compensation and build public facilities like hospitals, health centres and educational institutions in the area.        
	It should not be assumed that we are open to the idea of vendor relocation, but on other issues we are, a source quoted a Tata Motors official as having told the government.

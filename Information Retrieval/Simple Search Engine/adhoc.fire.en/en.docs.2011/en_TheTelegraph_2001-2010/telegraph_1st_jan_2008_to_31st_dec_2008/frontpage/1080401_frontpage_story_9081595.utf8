The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bypass hotel-or-house tussle 
                                                                                                           Bypass hotel-or-house tussle 
          INDRANIL GHOSH                               
	Calcutta, March 31: A 10-acre plot off Eastern Metropolitan Bypass has put the state government on the horns of a dilemma: whether to build a cluster of budget hotels or a housing and hospital complex for minority communities.        
	Tourism minister Manab Mukherjee wants to use the land for the budget hotels while minority development minister Abdus Sattar is keen to promote the housing-and-health scheme for the weaker sections among the minority communities in the run-up to the panchayat elections.        
	The issue is awaiting the intervention of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who is now in Coimbatore for the CPM congress. My department will release the land in accordance with the chief ministers wish, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said. Only he can arbitrate on the debate on whether we should have hotels or facilities for Muslims and other disadvantaged sections.         
	But chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said: There is an acute shortage of quality hotel rooms at affordable tariffs in Calcutta, which is now on the national radar and witnessing a demand. We must work towards creating them and fulfil the demand, more so when we have come into possession of a suitable plot.        
	The government got the land in exchange for clearing an application by promoters to regularise large tracts for building an NRI complex.        
	We have chosen this site near EM Bypass for a cluster of budget hotels, Bijoy Chatterjee, additional chief secretary, tourism department, said. Our objective is to create as many affordable hotel rooms as possible. Calcutta is a major destination today for many budget-conscious company executives, businessmen, government officials and tourists. I am not aware of the contending claim to the plot.         
	The state tourism development corporation is preparing to invite expressions of interest from players in hospitality, especially those in the budget hotel segment. Our basic idea is to offer a two-acre parcel each to four or five best bidders, Chatterjee said.        
	If bids are invited, Emaar-MGF, the Ambuja group and the Tatas Ginger brand of budget hotels are expected to show interest.        
	But minority development minister Sattar said the chief minister had assured him that the plot would be set aside for the housing and hospital complex for weaker sections.         
	I cant see this (budget hotels) happening on a site which has already been identified for the project my department has planned and gone forward for execution, Sattar told The Telegraph.        
	Hotel rooms already exist aplenty and there will be many more in the days to come, Sattar added. But we must not forget that the minority communities or the economically challenged havent got many things going for them. Besides, the government first committed itself on my project. I will have to have a serious talk with Buddha-da and other leaders of my party about this.         
	Tourism minister Mukherjee, who is also in Coimbatore for the congress, could not be contacted.

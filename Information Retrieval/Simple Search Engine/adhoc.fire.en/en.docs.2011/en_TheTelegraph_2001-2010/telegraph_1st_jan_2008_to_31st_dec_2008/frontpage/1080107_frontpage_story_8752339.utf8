     OUR CORRESPONDENT
                       
	Santiniketan, Jan. 6: A young man with a gun walked into an unguarded womens hostel at Visva-Bharati today and shot a student dead in her room before putting a bullet through his own temple.
    
	Calcutta youth Amaresh Kundu, 29, searched out Saswati Pal, 21, by opening the doors of one room after another down a deserted corridor around noon.
    
	The murder of the third-year Sangit Bhavan student, the first shooting on the campus set up by Tagore, could be the result of a broken engagement, police said.
    
	Saswati died on the way to Bolpur sub-divisional hospital. Amaresh, a graduate who works in the Tollygunge police barracks mess, died while being shifted to Calcuttas SSKM Hospital. 
    
	There were no guards at the entrance of Ananda Sadan when the young man walked in with a Webley Scott he apparently stole from a constable at Tollygunge police station, where Amaresh often doubled as part-time driver for additional OC Jayanta Chowdhury.
    
	Hostel supervisor Nafisa Ali was not in her office and the youth was confronted only by a woman cleaner who asked him to leave but did not wait and make sure he did so.
    
	Both killer and victim are from Ghatal in West Midnapore, where Sunima Kundu said Saswati had ended her three-year relationship with her son last Thursday.
    
	Amaresh, who police believe caught a morning train to Bolpur, 190km from Calcutta, accosted the girl outside Sangit Bhavan around 11.20am and was rebuffed, students said. 
    
	Sunday being a working day at the university, most girls were in their classes when Amaresh, who wore a maroon sweater and grey trousers, entered the hostel. Just then Saswati, in a red ankle-length dress and a black-and-red shawl, appeared up the corridor with an empty water bottle.
    
	As soon as she saw Amaresh, she signalled to cleaner Fuchi Birbangshi, 38, that she didnt want to speak to him. The cleaner again told Amaresh to leave, turned and walked up the stairs. Saswati disappeared down the corridor.
    
	When Amaresh pushed the door open, she was standing at the window. As she turned round, he shot her in the chest. Then he put the nozzle against his right temple.
    
	We found her covered in blood, lying on one of the beds with her face upwards, an officer said. Amaresh lay unconscious near the door.
    
	Neighbours at Ghatal said Saswatis father Shyamal, a government clerk, was better off than Amareshs father Bijoy, an attendant at a Ghatal hospital. Saswatis family was against the relationship, a resident said.
    
	Amareshs mother said Saswati had called her up on Thursday night. She said she would not be able to marry my son. She told me, Fix his marriage with some other girl.
    
	Saswatis younger sister said: Neither of us would ever have gone against our parents wishes.
    
	Tollygunge constable Sunil Majhi told his superiors he had forgotten to lock the box where he had replaced his revolver after his night shift ended at 6am.
    
	A police source cast doubt on this, saying that if Amaresh had travelled by train as is likely, he would have had to take the 6.05am Ganadevata Express. So he must have got hold of the gun before 6am. 
    
	The constable has been suspended for negligence. A probe has been ordered, Calcutta police chief Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said.
    
	Sangit Bhavan students said they saw Saswati speak angrily to a gesticulating Amaresh after class near a mud house known as Black House. Then she walked quickly to her hostel, about 150 metres away.
    
	Amaresh kept pacing up and down before the three-storey building, frantically trying to make calls from his mobile, before he walked in.
    
	Visva-Bharati students will boycott classes from tomorrow in protest against the lack of security.

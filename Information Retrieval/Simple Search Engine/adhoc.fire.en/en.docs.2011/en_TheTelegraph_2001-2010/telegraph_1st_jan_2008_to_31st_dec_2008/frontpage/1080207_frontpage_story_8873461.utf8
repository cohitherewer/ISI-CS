	The fiancee of Indrajit Chakraborty, who was killed in the police firing, tried to commit suicide on Wednesday.        
	Paramita (name changed) drank pesticide, unable to bear the death of Chakraborty who had recently joined a vocational school as a teacher in tailoring.         
	The 18-year-old girl, whose marriage was fixed for next month, is said to be out of danger.

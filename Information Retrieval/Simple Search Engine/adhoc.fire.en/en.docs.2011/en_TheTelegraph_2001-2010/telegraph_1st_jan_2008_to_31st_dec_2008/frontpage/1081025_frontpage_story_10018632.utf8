	Why is the market falling despite so much of cash infusion by the RBI and the finance minister saying fundamentals are strong?   
	The market is a beast with its own logic few can fathom. Money infusion into the financial system eases pressure on cash-strapped banks and enables them to meet credit demands from a variety of borrowers. The market does factor this in. But the market also takes its cues from a variety of other sources. In a global financial turmoil, fear grips the Street  and the market reacts on gut instinct.  
	If stock prices fall, does it have any impact on the economy?   
	Well, it normally shouldnt. Stock prices ideally react to the news from the economy. But when there is a convulsion in the market, investors bleed. A lot of the investment in stocks is pure speculation: money poured into stocks because the sensex yielded 40 per cent gains every year since 2005 and provided the best investment return among all asset classes. When investors churned their portfolios, some of them scooped out their profits and put them into tangible assets like property. Now that those gains have evaporated, the hot money isnt flowing into those sectors any more. So, realty is down in the dumps. Soon, other sectors like travel and tourism, aviation and consumer durables will start feeling the heat as consumers put off purchases. When the cogs stop turning, the giant wheel slows down.  
	Does the market fall have any impact on my life if I dont invest?   
	Inflation is running at over 11 per cent now. It is projected to go down to 7 per cent by the end of March next year. Its a lot like running on a treadmill: you need to run harder when the treadmill picks up pace, just to stay in the same place. A savings bank account gives you 3.5% interest  which means you are actually losing money when you factor in inflation. At the moment, the best bet is a bank fixed deposit that yields just above 10 per cent. Gold looked like a good bet but it is turning volatile now. Stocks and mutual funds are gutted in this turmoil  so you wont lose sleep if you have not parked your money there.  
	Is this a good time to buy stocks? What if prices fall after I buy stocks now?   
	If you have waited for so long to decide, you are probably faint-hearted. In that case, it is probably best that you wait for the market to stabilise. Contrarians, however, believe that this may be the best time to buy cheap-priced stock but only if you have the stomach for a long, jolting ride.

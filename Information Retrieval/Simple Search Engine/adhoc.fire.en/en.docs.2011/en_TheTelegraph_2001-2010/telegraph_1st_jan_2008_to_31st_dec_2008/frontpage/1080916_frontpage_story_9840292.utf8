          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, Sept. 15: In a move that will go a long way in easing the power crisis in Assam, Neepco and ASEB has decided to set up a 250MW coal-based power plant at Margherita in Tinsukia district.         
	This was revealed by Union minister of state for commerce and power Jairam Ramesh on the sidelines of a two-day Northeast Business Summit here today.         
	I met chief minister Tarun Gogoi today along with power minister Pradyut Bordoloi and officials of the ASEB and Neepco about the project. It will be a joint venture project with Neepco having 51 per cent stake. The first phase will have 250MW and it will be gradually increased to 500MW. The MoU will be between the two companies by October 15, Ramesh said. He, however, made it clear that according to government policy Assam can get only 200MW.         
	Bordoloi, on his part, dropped broad hints that Assam would like to keep all the power for itself. He declined to elaborate, saying Assam was looking forward to a favourable outcome for itself.         
	Sources in the chief ministers office said the Union minister had put the cart before the horse.         
	Asked if the chief minister had agreed to Rameshs proposal, he said he was committed to the revival of Neepco. I also requested Gogoi to retain Neepco for commissioning the 150MW Lower Kopili project to the PSUs as it had implemented the Upper Kopili project, Bordoloi added.         
	The state government was keen on giving the contract to a private company, as Neepco had not done anything in the past 15 years. The chief minister has said he would look into the request, he said.        
	While Ramesh went all out on revival plans for Neepco by asking the other states to involve the company in their new power projects, he was unhappy with the performance of the NTPC vis--vis the 750MW Bongaigaon thermal power station.               
	It is a priority project. The Prime Minister himself had laid the foundation station in 2006. There has hardly been any progress. I visited BTPS in May and will begin again on September 21, he said.         
	Ramesh also said that work has started on the Rs 550-crore Kaladan transit-cum-transport project in Myanmar on June 23. It envisages development of 225-km waterways connecting Myanmar with Mizoram. The completion of the project will make the Kaladan river in the neighbouring country navigable, giving direct access to the northeastern region through Vishakapatnam via Sittwe port in Myanmar. This route would serve as an alternative to the one used through Bangladesh.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Imphal, Jan. 5: A militant threat has forced guardians to withdraw their wards from the hostels of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya located at Khumbong in Manipurs Imphal West district.         
	Sources said a militant group had demanded Rs 3.5 lakh from the school authorities earlier this month and had set today as the deadline for payment.         
	Two militants visited the school on Wednesday and told the teachers to pay upon time, they added.         
	When news of the militant threat reached parents and guardians, they started flocking to the school to get first hand information and discuss the situation with the school authorities.        
	Today, they held a meeting on the school campus to review the tension and uncertainty that has prevailed in the school for the past week.        
	However, the school authorities refused to discuss the situation with them in the absence of principal N. Dhiren Singh, who is on an academic tour outside the state.         
	Given the scenario, most of the guardians decided to take their children away, fearing that trouble may befall the boarders.         
	I do not want to keep my son in the hostel in this situation. I will bring him back as soon as the school arrives at an agreement with the militants and normalcy is restored, a parent said.        
	More than half of the 500 boarders living in the boys and girls hostels of the school left today, even as the others students continued to stage a sit-in to demand restoration of a normal academic atmosphere.         
	The students and their guardians are concerned as the final year examinations for Classes X and XII are scheduled to begin onMarch 1 and classes are being disrupted because of the threat.        
	Some teachers have been staying away from class while some others have not been able to concentrate because of the militant threat.        
	Police said the school authorities had not lodged any complaint with them.         
	A police officer, however, said they had received information about the militant threat and had beefed up security in the school and its hostels.

          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                            Former chief minister Madhu Koda with former deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi in a car outside Birsa Munda airport after his arrival in the state capital from Delhi on Saturday.

	Ranchi, Aug. 23: Chief minister Madhu Koda couldnt hold on any longer. Goaded by the UPA central leadership and convinced he didnt have the numbers to face Mondays trust vote, he tendered his resignation to Governor Syed Sibtey Razi today, exactly seven days after JMM chief Shibu Soren withdrew support to his 23-month-old government.         
	Five of his ministerial colleagues  Independents Stephen Marandi, Harinarayan Rai, Joba Manjhi, Bhanu Pratap Sahi and Chandra Prakash Choudhary  also signed on the letter and accompanied him to the Raj Bhavan.         
	The governor has accepted Kodas resignation and asked him to continue in a caretaker capacity till alternative arrangements could be made. He also called off Mondays special session of the Assembly.         
	That Koda and a band of five ministers went to Raj Bhavan together is indicative of how difficult it might be for Soren to win over the Independents to help him become chief minister.         
	Guruji realises this. He reached the capital today along with Vishnu Bhaiya and Manohar Tekriwal, the two BJP rebels who have turned to him, but appeared to be in no hurry. We have enough time in hand. Let us see what happens on Monday, he said,         
	But sources close to the JMM chief maintained, he would begin calling the Independents immediately. Guruji will be talking to the Independents. He will tell them that Presidents Rule followed by mid-term polls are not viable alternatives, said his close aide Mithilesh Thakur.         
	So far, the RJD and the Congress have decided to support Soren. A group of RJD MLAs, Annapurna Devi, Uday Shankar Singh, Videsh Singh and Prakash Ram, left for New Delhi to join their colleagues for a strategy session with their party chief Lalu Prasad. And Congress chief whip in the Assembly Neol Tirkey said a letter of support was being faxed to the governor tonight.         
	Even then, Soren would be short of the magic figure of 42 as Koda and his group of Independents havent committed support to him.         
	Earlier, Koda admitted having lost the majority in the Assembly, but remained non-committal on extending support to the JMM in its bid to form a new government. He even refused to accept the UPA steering committee chiefs chair and added that securing a fresh public mandate was the only option.         
	Koda decided to resign after holding a meeting with the five Independents who helped him topple the Arjun Munda government in September 2006 to form a new government. He predicted Soren, too, would have to face great difficulty in forming a new government.        
	Koda said his priority now would be to fight for the completion of his governments pending agenda. He would go to the people to tell them about the achievements of his government and work towards securing a positive public mandate afresh. I never lusted after power. The BJP denied me a party ticket. So I fought alone. All the UPA partners unanimously agreed to make me chief minister. Thats why I wanted them to unitedly decide whether I should continue or step down. Now that I dont seem to be enjoying a majority in the Assembly, there is no point going in for a floor test on Monday, he said.        
	However, Koda claimed all the Independents were with him and were in favour of fresh elections. Even rural development minister Anosh Ekka was with him, even though he couldnt make it to Raj Bhavan as he was stuck in traffic, he added.         
	The decision to quit together seemed to have been taken earlier with Manjhi, Chandra Prakash and Sahi holding a meeting even before Koda reached Ranchi. Marandi and Rai arrived from Delhi along with the chief minister.        
	Members of the NDA kept up the pressure, meeting the governor again to urge him to allow Soren to form a government only if he had the support of at least 42 MLAs. They also requested Razi to verify the credentials of the MLAs before taking a final decision, undoubtedly referring to its own MLAs, Vishnu Bhaiya and Tekriwal, suspended from the party for backing Soren.         
	The NDA will hold another meeting tomorrow. Weve received positive assurance from the governor. Fresh elections in the state is the only viable alternative, said party state unit chief P.N. Singh.

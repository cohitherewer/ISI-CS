          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 9: Following in the footsteps of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati, Shibu Soren has ordered his cabinet co-ordination department to grant the post of the principal secretary to an outsider, Neeraj Kumar.        
	Kumar is currently the officer on special duty (OSD) at the chief ministers office (CMO). There is little information regarding his background, apart from the fact that he is Delhi-based and not an IAS officer.         
	Ask him and he will point out his long association with the JMM and Soren to claim his new post. Kumar would be guiding the bureaucracy to turn Gurujis vision of Jharkhand into a reality.         
	Mayawati, in her new innings, created a special post of a cabinet secretary in the CMO to accommodate Shashank Shekhar Singh, a pilot with no connection to the IAS cadre, whatsoever.        
	Sorens directive means that there would be two principal secretaries in the CMO, one from the IAS cadre  B.K. Tripathy  and the other from outside civil services.        
	Shashank Shekhar Singh was a former army officer, commissioned in 1970 and an ace helicopter pilot. Several state, that unlike Kumar, Singh had to work his way up in the ladder. Sorens decision, the first-of-its-kind in Jharkhand, has also made the IAS officers sit up. It is unjustified and will give a rise to a lot of complications, pointed out a senior IAS officer, requesting anonymity. It would erode the authority of the post of the principal secretary. The principal secretary happens to be the administrative head of the chief ministers secretariat, he added.        
	Though Shibu Soren could not be contacted for his comments, his son Hemant Soren, however, justified the decision. We want to improve the governance with whoever it tales. You can blame us if and when it does not show up in the next two days, he said.Soren, who has picked up most of his team members from outside, has managed to offend some members.         
	Does it mean that Soren has no faith in either the IAS or the IFS? said an officer.         
	He pointed out that IAS officers have always accessed the CMO files and it would be for the first time that a non-IAS person would be accessing them.

  - Drunk slur on accused constable          A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, April 29: Two policemen and a civilian driver were seriously wounded when one of their colleagues, who was allegedly drunk, suddenly opened fire inside the vehicle in which they were travelling at Jagiroad in Morigaon district today.         
	The team was on its way to Guwahati from Diphu in Karbi Anglong when the incident occurred around 2.30am on National Highway 37 near the Hindustan Paper Corporations mill at Jagiroad, nearly 60km away from Guwahati.         
	The injured policemen were identified as sub-inspector of Dispur police station Wazidur Rahman, 53, constable Ramen Basumatary, and civilian driver Matiur Rahman, both in their thirties.         
	Morigaon superintendent of police Madan Chetia said from preliminary investigation it appeared to be a case of accidental firing. We have arrested havildar Khargeswar Das and a detailed investigation is on, he said.         
	Asked whether Das was under the influence of liquor when the incident occurred, Chetia said, We cannot rule out the possibility but only a medical examination can confirm it.         
	Das is a havildar of Assam Police Commando Battalion based at Mandakata in north Guwahati.         
	Morigaon police have registered a case at Jagiroad police station and conducted the necessary formalities such as medical examination of the accused.         
	All the injured persons were admitted to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. The condition of the driver, who was hit by a bullet on his neck, is critical. The condition of the two injured is not life threatening, a doctor at the GMCH said.         
	Wazidur Rahman sustained bullet wounds on his right hand while Matiur Rahman was injured in his leg. Wazidur told The Telegraph from his hospital bed that they had gone to Diphu to bring back three car-lifters arrested by Karbi Anglong police in connection with a case registered at Dispur police station.         
	We were bringing the accused and a stolen car recovered from them. I was in a Tata Sumo hired by the police while the stolen car was behind us. We were at Jagiroad when a bullet hit my hand. The driver was also injured but he somehow slammed the brakes and brought the vehicle to a stop, Wazidur said.         
	According to him, he was in the front seat while Das, Basumatary and one of the car-lifters were on the rear seat of the Sumo. The other two accused were with other policemen in the recovered stolen car. The sub-inspector is still in a state of shock while the other two injured were unable to speak.         
	I am clueless how the incident happened. Nor do I know if Das was drunk. I do not have any idea why he opened fire but I can say that I do not have any animosity towards him, Wazidur added.         
	A source in city police said from preliminary information it appears that Das was inebriated. But it is upto Morigaon police to confirm it as they are investigating the incident. We will wait for the medical report, the source said.

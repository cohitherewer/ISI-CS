	Sao Paulo, April 13: President Pratibha Patil, on her maiden foreign tour after being in office for nine months, could arguably be in the Guinness World Records after her visit to Brazil starting today.        
	She will be witness to international diplomatic history when India and Brazil sign their 41st bilateral agreement in her presence in Brasilia at the end of her state visit on Wednesday.        
	Veteran diplomats cannot recall any other two countries that have signed as many bilateral agreements in so few years in the centuries-old history of global diplomacy.        
	The surge in Indo-Brazil partnership, which has so far produced a rare crop of 37 agreements, began when Brazils President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, was in New Delhi in 2004 as chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations.        
	Four more agreements will be added to that tally when the minister of state for new and renewable energy, Vilas Muttemwar, signs them on Indias behalf during Patils visit.        
	The President will set other records, too, during her nearly fortnight-long trip that will take in three Latin American countries.        
	She will address legislatures in both Brazil and Mexico. South Block veterans cannot recall any Indian head of state or government who has addressed the parliament in more than one country during a single overseas trip.        
	But the jewel that crowns her state visit to Brazil is the $1.2-billion trade balance in Indias favour last year.        
	India, which lags behind China  and even smaller Asian trading entities such as Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong  in aggressive international commerce, has such a favourable balance of trade with few other trading partners.        
	Indias economic relations with Brazil have recorded a sterling performance in the last two years.         
	Exports to Brazil jumped last year alone from $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion. Brazils exports to India rose only modestly from $939 million in 2006 to $959 million last year, resulting in a huge balance in Indias favour.        
	Lula and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have set a target of $10 billion for their bilateral trade by 2010.        
	The four agreements to be signed between India and Brazil during Patils visit are an extradition treaty, a pact for joint efforts in hydrocarbons, an agriculture cooperation agreement and another in the area of civil defence that includes mitigation of natural and man-made disasters.        
	An unusual area that the President will wade into in Brazil relates to collaboration between the judiciaries of the two countries.        
	A team of businessmen under the auspices of the Confederation of Indian Industry will be with Patil in Brazil, Mexico and Chile.

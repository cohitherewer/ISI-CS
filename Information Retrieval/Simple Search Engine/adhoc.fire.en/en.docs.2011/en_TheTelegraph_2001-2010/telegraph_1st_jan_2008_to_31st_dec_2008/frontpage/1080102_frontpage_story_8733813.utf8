              Madonna: Lesser-known fort or luxurious tent? 
                 
	Jaipur, Jan. 1: The Material Girl had only to land in the country of karma before she turned ethereal.
    
	Pop star Madonna seems to have vanished into the thin winter air over Rajasthan since her arrival yesterday afternoon on a six-day trip.
    
	She touched down at Jodhpur airport with five others, including her children, around 3.30pm by a chartered flight on her first trip to India, sources confirmed. Then the trail grows cold.
    
	Certain sources suggested she may have ignored Jodhpurs five-star hotels like Taj Hari and Umaid Bhavan in favour of the lesser-known but more exotic Rohetgarh Fort, about 30km from Pali town in nearby Pali district. There is speculation that she has booked all 28 rooms at the heritage hotel.
    
	Some, however, said Madonna was at the Manvar resort and others claimed she had pitched a luxurious tent at Dechu village in the Thar desert, about 110km from Jodhpur.
    
	Till this evening, the Rohetgarh Fort seemed the best bet. This 16th-century desert palace of the descendants of the Rathores from the Champawat clan is rather unusual among heritage hotels. It has remained a family home, where the former royals still welcome the guests personally.
    
	The fort boasts the finest Persian carpets and dazzling chandeliers and has its interiors adorned with a collection of local arms, paintings and hunting trophies. The royal familys retainers wait on the guests as they savour a rugged landscape and the local cuisine of dal, bati and churma.
    
	It is not clear if the pop stars itinerary includes Jaisalmer and Udaipur.
    
	Sources, however, said she would be in Jodhpurs Umaid Bhavan on January 5 as a guest at a private party thrown by Maharaja Gaj Singh.
    
	Madonnas Indian connection can be traced to the lessons she took over the phone from Varanasi-based Vedic scholar Bhagirath Prasad Tripathi several years ago to perfect her recital of Sanskrit shlokas for an album.
    
	Rajasthan has long been a favourite destination with foreign celebrities. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were in Jodhpur last October.

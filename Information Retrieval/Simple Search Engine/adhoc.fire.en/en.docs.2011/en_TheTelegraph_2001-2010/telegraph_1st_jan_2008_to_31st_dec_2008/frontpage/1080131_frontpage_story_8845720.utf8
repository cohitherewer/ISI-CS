     SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA AND PTI
               
	Ranchi, Jan. 30: Shibu Soren may have claimed he bought life for the Madhu Koda government. Lalu Prasad, too, may have put his weight behind the beleaguered chief minister. But the Congress seems determined to pull down the UPA coalition government after the February 4 Simaria by-election.
    
	Nobody should misun- derstand our decision to wait till the by-election. Our stand has been consistent and there is no question of devia- ting from it even if we lose the elections, AICC general secretary and Union minis- ter of state for urban deve- lopment Ajay Maken told The Telegraph.
    
	However, Maken, in-charge of party affairs in Jharkhand, ducked queries on Sorens claim that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had been kept in the dark about the goings on in the state. 
    
	Maintaining that he (Soren) was a very senior leader of the state, the union minister said: I will not comment on his claim. But I am speaking as the AICC in-charge who happens to be eyes and ears of the Congress leadership. 
    
	On if he had kept Sonia Gandhi informed, Maken was evasive. 
    
	The Congress is a national party and has certain laid down norms. Our stand on corruption and development has been consistent. Now, instead of a two-month framework, we have given it (state government) three months to improve. But that has not happened, he pointed out.
    
	The minister elaborated on the reasons behind the Congress not withdrawing support after January 15, the initial deadline. 
    
	First, the Simaria by-election was announced after we set the deadline. Any decision to withdraw support would lead to Presidents rule in the state. It would not have been politically correct to dislodge the government when the election process was on. 
    
	Secondly, in that eventuality, the people and other parties would have accused the Congress of being afraid of facing the electorate. 
    
	Maken insisted even if the Congress Simaria bypoll nominee, Yogendra Baitha, loses, the Congress would not back out. That will be a barome- ter to show that the Congress revival was on its way, he pointed out.
    
	On Lalu Prasads decision to campaign against the Congress nominee in Simaria, Maken said: It is not new. He had campaigned against the Congress in the 2005 elections, too. It does not make much of a difference. 
    
	The AICC general secretary said the Congress had brought the development agenda to the fore and was pursuing it in a transparent manner. We are showing disgust with the government for its utter failure to take the state on the fast lane of development, he said.
    
	This, he clarified, has nothing to do with the state government not awarding mining leases to parties of our choice. 
    
	The AICC general secretary said he did not want the Congress to play B team to either the JMM or the RJD. 
    
	We want the UPA to be stronger, but want the Congress to be strengthened. We will not allow anyone playing big brother in the next Lok Sabha elections, he said.
    
	Poll security
    
	The Jharkhand government would press into service Central Reserve Police Force and Jharkhand Armed Police for the Simaria Assembly bypoll, to be held on February 4.
    
	Chief secretary P.P. Sharma today held a meeting at Chatra with additional director-general of police (special branch) G.S. Rath, zonal inspector-general B.B. Pradhan and senior government officers of bordering districts of Palamau, Hazaribagh and Bihars Gaya to review the security and arrangements for the bypoll, sources said.
    
	Around 26 companies of the Central Reserve Police Force and the Jharkhand Armed Police would be deployed to oversee the polling process, sources said, adding a helicopter would maintain vigil on the constituency on the polling day.

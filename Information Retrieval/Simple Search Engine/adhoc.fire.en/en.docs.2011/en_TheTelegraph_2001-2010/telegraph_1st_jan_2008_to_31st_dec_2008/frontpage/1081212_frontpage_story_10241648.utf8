The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hill tripartite talks on Dec 29 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Hill tripartite talks on Dec 29 
  - Home secretary confirms Morcha presidents claim           OUR BUREAU                            Gurung: Ready for next round                                        
	Dec. 11: The tripartite meeting on the Darjeeling hills will be held on the 29th of this month.        
	A state government official today called me up and told me that the meeting has been scheduled for December 29 at 3pm in New Delhi. I have told him to send a formal letter and he has promised to do so as early as possible, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha president told The Telegraph in Darjeeling today.        
	In Calcutta, Bengal home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti has confirmed the date scheduled for the talks to be held at the secretary-level. Our chief secretary (Amit Kiran Deb) and myself will represent the state government, he said. Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta and other senior officials will be present on behalf of the Centre.         
	 The second round of meeting was supposed to be held in the second week of November, but there had been no word from either the Centre or the state. Following the silence, the Morcha announced that it would not press for the talks. Instead, it called for an indefinite closure of state government offices from December 8 onwards.        
	The first meeting was held on September 8 and was attended by a 20-member delegation comprising leaders from seven outfits in the hills. The Centre had been represented by Gupta, while Deb and Chakrabarti had attended on behalf of the state.        
	However, with Gurung declaring in public that the all party chapter is closed, it is unlikely that this time the Morcha will be taking any representatives other than its own.        
	The Morcha had refused to speak on any other issue except Gorkhaland in the first tripartite meeting and the party is expected to take a similar stand during the second rounds of talks too.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, June 11: The demand for a CBI probe into the murder of social activist Lalit Mehta gathered steam today with Union rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh writing to chief minister Madhu Koda seeking his intervention in the matter.         
	Politicians  CPI politburo member D. Raja  and other senior activists  Aruna Roy and Swami Agnivesh  joined thousands of villagers yesterday to press for a CBI probe into the killing.        
	They even called on Koda personally and urged him to look into their demand seriously. In fact, they issued a 24-hour ultimatum for the state government to act, failing which they threatened to hold a dharna in front of Parliament.         
	Mehta, a member of economist Jean Drzes team conducting a social audit of the UPA governments flagship National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, had detected widespread corruption thats plaguing its implementation in Chhatarpur in Palamau district.        
	Gopinath Ghosh, coordinator of the committee formed to seek justice for Mehta, confirmed Singhs letter to Koda. But it was unlikely Koda got to look at it today, busy as he was with the visit of Shivraj Patil.         
	Jury Bordoloi, secretary of the National Youth Congress, said those who were working towards improving the implementation of NREGS were being threatened regularly.

	New Delhi, Jan. 23: High density of poultry across Bengal has aided the rapid transmission of the virus and could lead to dangerous persistence of the infection for months, scientists warned today. 
 
	The warning came as Hooghly mdash; across the river from the northern fringes of Calcutta mdash; and Cooch Behar joined the bird-flu list, drawing almost half of Bengals districts into the footprint of the disease. 
 
	The number of poultry, including chickens, ducks and ducklings, in Bengal is many times higher than in Nandurbar and Jalgaon in Maharashtra and in Imphal East in Manipur, the sites of previous bird flu outbreaks. 
 
	The number of hens in Birbhum is 860,000, a figure higher than all major poultry birds in Nandurbar, where the H5N1 avian influenza virus had surfaced in February 2006, according to the latest poultry census. 
 
	Some of Bengals affected districts are smaller in area than Nandurbar or Jalgaon. The result is a very high density of poultry that can facilitate quick transmission of the virus, a senior scientist said. 
 
	Bengals districts also have a higher density of human population, which is also worrying, an official said. Nandurbar had a population density of 260 people per sqkm, but Birbhum has 658 people per sqkm, while Hooghly has 1,590 people per sqkm. 
      
	Murshidabad is home to more than five million major poultry birds, including 1.8 million hens, 800,000 chicks being raised for eggs, 400,000 chicks for meat, and 890,000 ducks. 
 
	Jalgaon is twice the size of Murshidabad, but had a total poultry population of 600,000 birds. Nandurbar, slightly smaller than Murshidabad, had 670,000 birds. 
 
	In a high poultry-density zone, the virus can jump from bird to bird far more easily than it would have in a low density zone. 
 
	A laboratory study in the US had shown that domestic ducks infected with the H5N1 virus may be silent carriers of the infection that can shed the virus without symptoms. 
 
	Ducks are far more common in Bengal than in any of the three previous Indian sites. Burdwan has 1.1 million ducks, while Hooghly has 800,000 ducks.
 
	The US study had prompted the World Health Organisation to recommend that people living in a bird flu-affected area take the same precautions with healthy ducks that they take with sick or dead birds. 
 
	The WHO had said ducks should not be kept as pets or allowed to enter households and that water for human use should not be drawn from open ponds used by domestic ducks. 
 
	The spread of the virus aided by the high density of poultry could also allow it to persist longer and have a greater chance to move into humans, said Shahid Jameel, head of virology at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi. 
 
	The H5N1 virus is now highly inefficient in infecting humans. But scientists fear that it could acquire mutations in genes that will allow it to efficiently infect humans.

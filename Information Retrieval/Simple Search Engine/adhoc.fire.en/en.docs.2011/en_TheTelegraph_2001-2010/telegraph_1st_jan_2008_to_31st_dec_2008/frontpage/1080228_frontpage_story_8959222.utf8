The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rs 10000: Ransom for a leopard 
                                                                                                           Rs 10000: Ransom for a leopard 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                             A file picture of a leopard                                  
	Srinagar, Feb. 27: A 36-hour hostage drama ended today after a ransom of Rs 10,000 changed hands  for a leopard.        
	Villagers in Handwaras Lash Mawar, 100km from Srinagar, wouldnt let wildlife officials take away the animal caged on Monday unless their demand for jobs was accepted. They also wanted no less a person than chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad to stand witness to the hand-over.        
	We had kept an automatic cage in the village after people terrified by the presence of animals approached us. Yesterday morning, we sent a team, which tranquillised the leopard. But the moment we started lifting it, the villagers arrived and pushed us back, said Mushtaq Ahmad Parsa, the wildlife warden of north Kashmir.        
	Parsa and his colleagues negotiated with the villagers over their demands, including government jobs for five youths, all of Tuesday but couldnt persuade them. With the deadlock unresolved, they left that evening.        
	Police were wary of stepping in because they feared it would lead to more trouble. We approached the police but they told us they didnt want a law-and-order problem. We resumed the talks today with the help of village elders. Thank God, we got the animal today, Parsa said.         
	The release, though, came at a price of Rs 10,000. The problem is that the ransom is unauthorised. We have paid from our own pockets. We have no provision (for such payments) and arent sure if the money will be reimbursed.        
	For the police, however, the payment wasnt a ransom but a reward promised for catching the animal.        
	The villagers put forth their demands peacefully. Wildlife officials had promised a reward if they caught a man-eater. The negotiations were about that, Handwara police chief Haseeb Mogul said, adding that there was no trouble.         
	Warden Parsa refuted the police version, saying the leopard, trapped on Monday night, wasnt a man-eater. We caught the animal, not they (the villagers). Besides, the reward (that the police referred to) had been announced on another man-eater leopard trapped recently.        
	Officials said that the leopard had killed seven persons last year, including one from Mawar village, and the families of the victims had been paid Rs 1 lakh as compensation.         
	It is possible the female leopard caught on Monday had come in search of its mate, the animal trapped recently and shifted to the Dachigam National Park, an official said.        
	Several animals, most of them leopards, have been killed or trapped in recent months after heavy snowfall forced them to stray into human settlements in search of food.

  - Stunned by chaos and hysteria, Maradona marches off          OUR BUREAU                            Maradona with girlfriend Veronica. (Pabitra Das) See Sport amp; Metro                                        
	Calcutta, Dec. 6: Shock and awe defined Diego Armando Maradonas date with Salt Lake stadium this evening.        
	The soccer legend was shocked by the mismanagement  he left the ground in a huff as the felicitation organised by the sports and youth affairs department went haywire  but awed by the mass hysteria  thousands desperate for a glimpse of a sportsman long past his prime  before bottles and brickbats began to pepper the football turf.        
	This is bad, Maradona muttered as he broke free from the VIPs and volunteers who had mobbed him and marched off, leaving in the lurch a horse-drawn carriage waiting to take the prince of football around the stadium and rendering the laser show redundant.        
	A ballboy was hit on the head by a missile as a section of the crowd erupted after yet another Subhas Chakraborty show of strength gone wrong.        
	I had paid Rs 200 for my ticket but thanks to the minister and his men who were let into the ground with VIP or volunteer passes, I could not even catch a glimpse of my hero. The anger was justified, said an irate fan who had come from Burdwan.        
	It was left to Maradona to try and restore order, motioning to people in the front rows to sit down. I know you want to see me. But I am not being able to do much to help, shrugged Maradona, referring to the mob of special invitees who surrounded him.        
	Minutes before leaving for the stadium, Maradona had called George W. Bush an assassin  the US President had gifted the world the military term of shock and awe during the Iraq attacks  not knowing he would find himself in a battleground of bottles and bricks in soccer-crazy Bengal, with the police looking on.        
	Even Maradona could have been hit as the missiles were landing all around us and bouncing in all directions after hitting the tracks that border the grass, conceded a policeman posted inside the ground.        
	The North 24-Parganas police pleaded helplessness, not for the first time. We had made all necessary arrangements but minister Subhas Chakrabortys writ rules at the stadium. He flooded the field with cadres and officials and they all mobbed Maradona, said an officer overseeing security at the ground, who was shocked at the chaos but too much in awe of the political heavyweight to protest.        
	Chakraborty blamed the chaos on the media.         
	A poor turnout at the stadium was something Chakraborty could not risk, with the CPM leadership divided over the Maradona show.         
	Subhasda had mobilised cadres from North 24-Parganas and Hooghly to make this event a success. With local leaders close to the chief minister choosing not to lend their support, he had taken it upon himself to flood the field with supporters, said a CPM state committee member.        
	The discomfort within a section of the CPM, said sources, stems from the fact that the now-expelled Somnath Chatterjee had set the ball rolling for the Maradona visit when he met the Argentine as part of a parliamentary delegation during World Cup 2006 in Germany.        
	Project Maradona had then become a Subhas Chakraborty-Samik Lahiri show with the MP from Diamond Harbour hosting the Argentine coach at the Maheshtala sports complex this morning and the minister helming the stadium show in the evening.        
	The divide was not just political, with the us and them syndrome evident in the police ranks as well. Within hours of the state police bungling the Salt Lake stadium security, the city police announced a host of essential measures to be taken for Maradonas Mohun Bagan ground visit tomorrow.        
	No bags or bottles will be allowed, gates will be closed well in advance, very few officials and no spectator will be allowed to get close to Maradona, and a special security ring will be thrown around him, said an officer at Lalbazar.        
	But the damage, according to former footballers like Prasun Banerjee, an awestruck fan of Maradona, was done. What happened at the Salt Lake stadium was shameful. I am shocked, he said.

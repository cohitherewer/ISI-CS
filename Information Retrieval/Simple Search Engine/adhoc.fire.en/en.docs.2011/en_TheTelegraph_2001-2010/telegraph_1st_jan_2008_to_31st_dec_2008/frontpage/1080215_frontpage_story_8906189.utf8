The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | An Indian invasion Pakistan loves
                                                                                                           An Indian invasion Pakistan loves

	New Delhi, Feb. 14: This is an Indian invasion Pakistan is welcoming with open arms.         
	Unprecedented numbers of Indian journalists are being approved for travel as the neighbour prepares for its most widely-watched general election on February 18. Suddenly, a red carpet appears draped over barbed fencing along what is arguably the most cantankerous frontier on Earth.         
	More than 50 media visas have been stamped till last count this afternoon and probably an equal number anxiously awaits sanction from consular offices at the Pakistan high commission here.         
	Apart from these, half-a-dozen journalists are travelling with observer status, part of a South Asian Free Media Association delegation; theres nothing to suggest they are barred from reporting out of Pakistan.         
	Weve never been through this kind of thing before, said a senior Pakistani official, there are so many of you, we could hold a press conference in our waiting halls through the day.         
	He sat buried behind stacks of rubber-banded passports awaiting sanction on his desk. There were more bulging out of his desk-drawer. Kya karenge itne journalists wahan jaake, kuchh hoga kya (What will so many journalists do there, will something happen)? he wondered cynically.         
	The visa section - accustomed to somnolent ways because the mission is usually picky and sparing about what it grants - suddenly finds itself stretched to happy weariness under the weight of requests. The queue just doesnt appear to end, the official said, but thats good, we dont mind it too much, it is probably an indication of our growing importance in the region and Indias growing interest in us.         
	There are more reasons than just those, but it would perhaps have been undiplomatic for a Pakistani official to spell them out - President Pervez Musharrafs keenness to showcase the elections as free, fair and fearless, and Pakistans desperate need to accomplish an image makeover; it cant be any cause of comfort to them that the Pakistani passport is gathering the reputation of being the worst travel document in the world.         
	Its Delhi mission is, consequently, working under informally liberalised visa norms for the media. Standard instructions have apparently arrived from Islamabad to grant visas across the board to legitimate applicants unless there are specific individual snags.         
	Five Pakistani cities rather than three - Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi - have been opened for some journalists. Others have been granted the benefit of extended stay, should they so wish - 10 days instead of the regulation week.         
	One journalist, who hadnt been able to go to Pakistan for nearly a decade because the ISI had blacklisted her, was pleasantly surprised to get a call from the mission, saying, Please come and pick up your visa, be our guest.         
	A Pakistani visa has always been a prized and dear thing on an Indian journalists passport. At the moment, its coming quick. And at Rs 15, it is also a steal.

	Raipur, Sept. 29: Maoists blew up a vehicle transporting CRPF personnel near Barsur killing four of them, while President Pratibha Patil was visiting the picturesque Chitrakote waterfall, 27km away.        
	The rebels triggered the landmine blast 350km south of the state capital around 12 noon, deputy inspector-general of police Pawan Deo said.         
	A team of seven CRPF jawans from the 41st Battalion was on a road opening operation when their vehicle fell in the rebels trap laid around 8km away from Murdur under Barsur police station.         
	Following the explosion, the Bolero in which the jawans were travelling was thrown up several feet high.         
	Diwakar Mahapatra, a deputy commandant of the CRPF, and the driver of the vehicle died on the spot, while five other jawans were seriously injured. Sources said two others succumbed to injuries in the government hospital in Bastar.         
	The condition of the three jawans was reported to be critical.         
	When the rebels struck, President Patil was enjoying the beauty of the Chikrakote falls on river Indrawati, about 40km from the district headquarters of Bastar.         
	Patil landed here yesterday evening on a two-day state visit and flew to Chitrakote this morning. She returned here in the afternoon. A thick security blanket was thrown around Chikrakote in the wake of her visit.        
	The President was informed about the incident at the airstrip while she was boarding the special Indian Air Force (IAF) chopper for the state capital, where she attended a function at a city college before leaving for New Delhi late in the evening.         
	I condemn this incident and the nation will remember the sacrifice of the jawans, Patil said at the end of her 15-minute speech at the golden jubilee function of a girls degree college in Raipur in the evening.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Hayden to retire before 2011 Cup
                            
	Melbourne: Bowlers the world over who have suffered at the hands of Matthew Hayden will heave a sigh of relief with the Australian opener announcing to call it quits before the 2011 World Cup in the Indian sub-continent.        
	Aware that he would have to pave way for the next generation Australians to play for the country just as Mark Waugh had done to make room for him, 36-year-old Hayden has earmarked a transitional period after which he will step down from one-day cricket.        
	I appreciated what Mark Waugh enabled me to do prior to my first World Cup (in 2003) and that was why I had about 50 games under my belt to get well settled and well prepared for the World Cup, Hayden said.        
	Ive got no intention to go on to the next World Cup (in 2011). There will be a transition period between now and that World Cup. From there Id like to think I can step aside in a manner which is very unselfish to the preparation of the team moving forward to the next World Cup, he was quoted as saying by an Australian daily.        
	Plagued by tendon injuries over the past 12 months, there have been growing calls for the broad-shouldered opener to step down from one-day cricket and concentrate on Tests.

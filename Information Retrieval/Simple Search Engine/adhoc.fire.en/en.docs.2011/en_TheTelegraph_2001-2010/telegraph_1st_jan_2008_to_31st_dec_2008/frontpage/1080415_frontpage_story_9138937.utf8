   Gandhars minus has a chance to be plus       SUJAN DUTTA                             A Bangladeshi woman waits to receive Indians at Darshana. (Amit Datta)                                        
	On board the Maitree Express, April 14: The train takes a breather before crossing the flat watery expanse that is the Jamuna  as the Brahmaputra is called here  from Sirajgunj to Tangail. It is only a seven-car train but even then the platform at Sirajgunj is too small. Passengers clamber down to air themselves.         
	Rongolol Choudhary, the retired income-tax officer from Baguihati-Keshtopur, flaps his arms for exercise. Two railway guardsmen come up to him inquiring where he is going, where he is from. Soon enough, they have traced common acquaintances to a village in Mymensinh. Before Choudhary boards the train for Tangail, he has picked up the whereabouts of a few more classmates he knew in school.         
	The Bong Train that is the Maitree Express is the latest in a list of communication links in formerly colonial countries that are making room for reconciliation. But the emotions that accompany the opening of such connections are scarcely strong enough to stand the test of time in the Indian subcontinent.         
	Embossed in the collective Bengali memory is the scene from Ritwik Ghataks Komol Gandhar where protagonist Bhrigu is looking into the middle distance of a snapped railway line and telling his theatre group: At one time, these tracks were like a plus sign, adding Bengal with Bengal, now it looks more like the minus.         
	Sundered lines and broken roads are, sadly, the markers across pan-South Asian borders even today when the world is getting increasingly networked. Is this largely because efforts to go beyond the markers are too feeble?         
	Or is it because the connections rest on fragile pacts that emotions alone cannot bind? Governments across South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan, have been notoriously fickle in quickly dismantling bilateral confidence-building measures. After the 2001 attack on Parliament, for example, India steadily rolled back the train service with Pakistan, as also the bus service, and in Delhis hawkish quarters there were suggestions that threatened to strain diplomatic relations even more.         
	In July 2006, in the week that India and China re-opened Nathu-la in the heights of Sikkim for seasonal border trade, its defence establishment decided to test-fire the China-specific Agni III missile. Delhi, seen from Beijing, was sending out contrary signals.         
	And, only yesterday, in Delhi again, India asked Bangladesh to hand over Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua. While there is little doubt that militants operating in Indias Northeast have taken refuge in Bangladesh, Delhi still has to get Dhaka to acknowledge its concerns. Gifting six horses to Bangladeshs power-behind-the-throne, General Moeen Ahmed, is no guarantee of his support. Symbolism risks being trapped by its lack of substance.         
	Yet, the eight years of the current century have seen some of the most vigorous cross-border linkages the world over, even in countries among which hostilities have, technically, not ended  such as the Koreas. The 1953 war ended in a truce, not a peace pact. But in December, South Korea decided to underwrite the costs of a cross-border goods train into North Korea.        
	Years before that, in Britains first colony, Ireland, the Enterprise Express connected Dublin Connolly in the Republic of Ireland with Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland.        
	Last year, western Europe began going through a rail revolution that will make travel from Barcelona to Bratislava seamless. The revolution is led by the state railways of France and Germany, bitter foes in the Second World War.        
	These are histories that the Indian establishment is neither unaware nor forgetful of. Indeed, the most important central government official overseeing the Maitree Express run today, the railway adviser to the Indian high commission in Dhaka, Jaya Varma Sinha, is sharply up to date. She brought up the Korean example herself during a short conversation on board.        
	There is, in fact, the real possibility that the Maitree Express is the harbinger of a Bengal that goes beyond borders.         
	Not only that, the restrictions and rigidness of controls that were experienced today on the Indian side of the border at Gede may be eased.         
	The scene during checks at Gede was pathetic. The staff compounded their inexperience with overzealousness. Unpractised hands riffled through passports without knowing how to read it and feed particulars into the computer. They subjected passengers to repeated unnecessary checks. And there were only 65 passengers on the train to Dhaka today. What would they do with a train running on full capacity?

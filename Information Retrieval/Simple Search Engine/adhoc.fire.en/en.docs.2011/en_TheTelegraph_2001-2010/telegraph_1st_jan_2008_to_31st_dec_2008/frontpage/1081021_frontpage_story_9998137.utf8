  - Loan goon goof-up hits Bloc boss, Naren not convinced          OUR BUREAU                            Naren Chatterjee                                        
	Oct. 20: Describe an act of foolhardy bravery in this time of credit crisis.        
	American answer: An investment banker who irons five shirts on a Sunday evening.        
	Bengal answer: Loan recovery agents who have the gumption to pounce on Naren Chatterjee.        
	The Forward Bloc leader who almost forced German wholesaler Metro Cash amp; Carry to leave Bengal was stunned to find himself looking down the wrong end of the barrel this morning.        
	Chatterjee was on his way to the party office in Calcutta from his home in Baidyabati, Hooghly, when a silver-coloured Tata Sumo screeched to a halt in front of his car.        
	A group of nine alleged loan recovery agents had apparently mistaken his Scorpio for someone elses and stopped it on Delhi Road near Serampore, about 25km from Calcutta.        
	As four men swaggered towards Chatterjees car mouthing expletives, his driver Raju Bhowmick reversed the Scorpio, took a U-turn and drove to a police outpost. Bhowmick told the police he had seen a revolver pointed at him.        
	Chatterjee, the agriculture marketing board chairman, had refused to renew Metros licence till Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee issued a do-it-now directive.        
	After lodging a complaint, a shaken Chatterjee returned home to Baidyabati with a police escort. He then went to the Bloc vice-chairman of the local municipality, Rabindranath Ghosh, and told him he was feeling unwell.        
	Ghosh took Chatterjee, a diabetic whose blood pressure had shot up, to a nursing home where he rested for an hour. He was later admitted to a private hospital in Calcutta.        
	As the word spread, Bloc supporters blocked GT Road for two hours from noon.        
	The police traced the Sumo to Bhadreswar, barely a kilometre from where the Scorpio had been stopped, and arrested seven youths. They said they were loan recovery agents of a private financial company and had stopped Chatterjees car by mistake. We are looking for two others who have fled, said Salil Ganguly, inspector in charge of Serampore police station.        
	No revolver was found on the arrested youths, the police said.        
	Officers informed Chatterjee about the arrests tonight but he was not convinced. Why should recovery agents carry a revolver? My car has the official plate of the marketing board and an Assembly car-park sticker. It also has a red light on the bumper. Why should they mix up my car with any other? he asked.        
	The Supreme Court has told banks and financial institutions they cannot hire musclemen to threaten and humiliate loan defaulters into paying up, but the tactic continues and leads many to suicide.

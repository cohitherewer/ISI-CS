Obama? Plunk, plunk
  - Congresswoman hangs up on worlds most prized caller           TOM BALDWIN                                        Obama, Ros-Lehtinen                                        
	Washington, Dec. 5: A telephone conversation with Barack Obama is prized, even craved, by politicians across America and the world. But when the US President-elect called Ileana Ros-Lehtinen she hung up on him. Twice.        
	Thinking that the call was a hoax, the Republican Congresswoman greeted him the first time, saying: You know, youre a better impersonator than that guy who does Obama on Saturday Night Live.         
	When he insisted that he really was Obama, Ros-Lehtinen said: Youre so good, but honestly Im too jaded for this. Its a great prank. I love it when they do it to everybody, including me. Thank you very much.        
	According to the account by Ros-Lehtinen, Obama persevered, saying: How can I convince you that this is Barack? She replied: Yeah, sure, have a great day. Then, she said, it was a case of Plunk, I hung up.        
	A few minutes later Obama tried again through his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who told her: Ileana, I cannot believe you hung up on the President-elect.        
	The Miami Congresswoman remained suspicious, however, refusing to believe that he really was Emanuel. Then Obama, who has been calling Congressional leaders to congratulate them on their re-election, came on the line only to be told: Guys, its a great prank, really. I love it, but Im not falling for it. Plunk.        
	In a third attempt Howard Berman, the chairman of the House of Representatives committee on foreign affairs, on which Ros-Lehtinen is the most senior Republican, telephoned urgently to inform her she risked offending Obama.         
	Even then she was sceptical, asking him to recount a private joke.         
	When he passed that test, Ros Lehtinen said: I know this sounds very presumptuous, but please tell President-elect Obama he can call me now and I will take his call.        
	Ros-Lehtinen defended her incredulity, saying she had thought that even though he sounded a lot like the President-elect, why would Obama want to call a little slug on the planet like me?        
	Obama, who has perhaps grown tired of fawning conversations, apparently found it all quite funny. She said he told her: Hey, in Chicago our radio stations are just as bad. They do these calls all the time. My staff will get a kick out of it. Whenever they think my ego is too big, theyll remind me that even a lowly Congresswoman hangs up on him not once but twice.        
	They went on to have a chat about policy in Israel and Cuba, where she was born and a subject she has strong views about, having once apparently called for the assassination of Fidel Castro.        
	She had good reason to fear such calls after Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, was recorded talking to a Canadian radio broadcaster pretending to be Nicolas Sarkozy, the French President.        
	Ros-Lehtinen has also had her fingers burnt. Earlier this year, the Latino show Enrique y Joe enticed her to climb up a strippers pole and placed the resulting video on YouTube.         
	She described to Fox News her embarrassment over Obama, saying: Oh man, did I blow it big time. But little did I think that it was really going to be him because, you know, all of our radio stations all over the United States ... they are wicked bad.

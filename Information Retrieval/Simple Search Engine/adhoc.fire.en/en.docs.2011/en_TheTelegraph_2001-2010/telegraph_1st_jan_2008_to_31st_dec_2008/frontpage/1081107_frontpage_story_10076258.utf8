  - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Appreciation from icons first India captain					 					      LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Azharuddin                                        
	Nagpur: Mohammed Azharuddin, now 45, was the India captain when Sourav Ganguly (playing his 113th and last Test) made his ODI and Test debut. The other day, Azhar spoke to The Telegraph exclusively on Sourav.              
	The following are excerpts        
	Q You were the India captain when Sourav was picked for the first time, in 1991-92. What was your first impression of him?        
	A Youve got to be talented to be selected at a young age... Sourav, I think, was 19 then... While he had the talent, we had a number of seniors in the team and, somehow, things didnt work out for Sourav on that tour of Australia.        
	Forget a Test, Sourav played only one ODI (against the West Indies in Brisbane) on that tour...        
	But youve got to appreciate that we had a number of seniors then... Of course, today, I do feel he shouldve played more... Having said that, what happened has happened.        
	Word had then got around that Sourav had an attitude problem. As the captain, did you too get that feeling?        
	(Laughs) What attitude can a 19-year-old have? Somebody on his first tour will be concerned about finding his feet... About not giving the impression that hes out of place or something... Sourav, perhaps, was immature then but I never felt he had an attitude issue.        
	Sourav disappeared for the next four-five years and, when he made a comeback (England, 1996), you were still the captain. Did you expect him to make a return?        
	Hed begun to perform in domestic cricket... Look, somebody with talent can always make a comeback... For that reason, I wasnt surprised... Never write off anybody who is gifted.        
	What were your expectations from Sourav on his Test debut?        
	I didnt expect hed get a hundred, but hed done well in some of the lead-up matches... I knew hed be hungry for runs.         
	Your memories of Souravs hundred (131)?        
	It was a good innings... I remember walking down to receive and congratulate him when he returned to the dressing room.        
	Sourav got a hundred (136) in the next Test too, at Trent Bridge...         
	I wasnt surprised, given the confident way hed batted on debut. I wouldve been had he not done well at Trent Bridge.        
	What stood out in those two innings?        
	Souravs confidence, his application and stroke-play. His timing was such that, after Trent Bridge, one felt hed get a hundred in every innings... Sourav brought back memories of my own start in Test cricket (a hundred in each of his first three appearances, against England, in 1984-85).         
	Those two Tests made all the difference for Sourav. Whats your assessment of him as a batsman?        
	Sourav learnt to make the best use of situations, most of the times, that is ... I found him hard-working and, clearly, willing to fight his way out of a corner... Early on, Sourav would hook and pull very well, but that changed in the later years... Everybody has some shortcomings... I dont know why that bit of Souravs game changed... Could have been because of a thicker handle or a heavier bat... Dont know, really.         
	Would you endorse Rahul Dravids much-quoted first theres God and, then, Sourav on the off-side observation?        
	Yes, why not?        
	Where would you place Sourav among the top batsmen of the present times?        
	Thats a difficult question...        
	If you had a role to play, would you too have dropped Sourav in late 2005?        
	I dont know what actually happened... But, yes, it shouldnt have happened the way it did.        
	Did you expect Sourav to make a comeback?        
	Id given him a 50-50 chance However, I knew that if he did make a return, he would make the most of opportunities. Thats what happened (December 2006).        
	The Nagpur Test is Souravs last. Is he going at the right time?        
	Sourav still has lots to offer in Test cricket, but the decision to retire is a personal one and he must have given it plenty of thought... I wish him well.        
	To talk of Sourav the captain (Indias most successful in Tests), how many marks would you give him on 10?        
	Id give eight... Sourav has had good leadership qualities and I liked the way he got the best out of his players... I dont want to take names, but many players should be thankful to Sourav for getting opportunities.        
	Whats the biggest challenge for a captain?        
	Getting the players to rally around him when the going is tough... Its important for a captain to understand his players and to make them understand their role in a team. Sourav, I think, gave the players the importance they deserved.        
	Sourav is credited with making the team tough, getting them to look the opposition in the eye...        
	Absolutely, he brought about that aggression needed to take on the best teams.        
	Do captains have a shelf life?        
	I suppose there is one.        
	During the years you played with Sourav, what did you make of him as a person?        
	Very respectful of seniors. Thats a fine quality to have.        
	How will you be remembering Sourav?        
	As a good batsman and a good leader.        
	Do we, in India, make an unnecessary hue and cry over age?        
	Age shouldnt be a factor if a cricketer is able to compete at 70-80 per cent (on the fitness scale) with youngsters. If he cannot, then theres a problem.         
	The final one: How do you keep yourself busy?        
	I shuttle between Hyderabad and Mumbai... I have this gym/fitness centre... I also do private coaching and do a bit of travelling because of that as well... I go wherever Im required.

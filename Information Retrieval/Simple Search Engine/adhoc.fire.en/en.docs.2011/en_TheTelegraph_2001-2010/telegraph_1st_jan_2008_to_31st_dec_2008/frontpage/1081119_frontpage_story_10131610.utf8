          CLAUDINE BEAUMONT                            iPhone                                  
	London, Nov. 18: A married man has told his wife that a technical glitch with his iPhone is to blame for a series of naked photos that have been mysteriously emailed from his handset.         
	The remarkable story came to light after his wife, identifying herself only as Susan042764 from New Jersey, posted a question on the Apple support forums asking whether such a technical mishap was possible on the iPhone.         
	Please help!, she writes. I took my husbands iPhone and found a raunchy picture of him attached to an email to a woman in his sent email file. When I approached him about this, he admitted that he took the picture, but says that he never sent it to anyone.         
	He claims that he went to the Genius Bar at the local Apple store and they told him it is an iPhone glitch  that photos sometimes automatically attach themselves to an email address and appear in the sent folder, even though no email was ever sent. Has anyone ever heard of this happening? she asks. The future of my marriage depends on this answer!         
	Fellow users on the Apple forums were quick to let Susan042764 know that no such glitch had been identified, and that her husband had clearly come up with the first excuse that came to mind to lie his way out of trouble.         
	Your husband is lying to you, responded a user called Hellovon. The iPhone has fairly reasonable security measures and would not do such a thing. Not only is your husband cheating on you, he LIED TO YOU AS WELL.         
	Another user, Victoriaaa is equally blunt. My professional opinion is that YOUR HUSBAND IS HAVING AN AFFAIR. The iPhone doesnt do that.         
	Some other posters on the thread are less sympathetic. Its a glitch, but only happens if the pic is sufficiently raunchy, writes Cutthru. I think your marriage has a glitch, writes Dedhero0.

	Chandigarh, Oct. 8: Harbhajan Singh has landed in trouble with Sikh religious leaders for playing a TV Ravan, two years after being rapped for letting his hair down in a liquor ad.        
	The jathedar (head priest) of Akal Takht, the highest Sikh temporal body, is upset the spinner dressed as the 10-headed demon king with a tilak on Colors channels reality show Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena with actress Mona Singh.        
	Harbhajan must apologise to the community for appearing in a show with tilak, dancing and portraying Ravan. For a Sikh, it is highly objectionable and cant be tolerated, Gurbachan Singh said today. The Sikh clergy forbid wearing tilak or playing Hindu gods and goddesses.        
	Gurbachan insisted Harbhajan had to follow Sikh tenets. He may not be a baptised Sikh but action can still be initiated against him.         
	The cricketer could be reprimanded severely if a formal complaint is lodged with the Takht, Gurbachan said. Harbhajan is known as a Sikh everywhere and his actions reflect on the community. He should desist from doing things that hurt or portray Sikhs in a wrong manner.        
	Harbhajan is in Bangalore for the Australia Test. His mother Avtar Kaur and sisters werent available for comment.

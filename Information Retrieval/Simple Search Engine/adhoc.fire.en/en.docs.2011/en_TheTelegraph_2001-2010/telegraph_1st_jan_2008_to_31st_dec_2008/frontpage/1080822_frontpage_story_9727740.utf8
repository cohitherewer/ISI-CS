          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Aug. 21: Chief minister Madhu Koda has no reason to feel left out.         
	Finally, he and his associates have been summoned to Delhi tomorrow to have their say on the states current political crisis.         
	From the very beginning I have been demanding that everything should be discussed with an open mind at a closed door meeting. I will definitely be going to Delhi for talks. I havent spoken to my colleagues yet about their plans to go to Delhi, Koda told The Telegraph.        
	The chief minister spent the day discussing future strategy with Stephen Marandi, Bhanu Pratap Shahi, Joba Manjhi, Harinarayan Rai and Anosh Ekka. The meeting, held at Marandis place, was followed by lunch.         
	Kamlesh Kumar Singh and Chandra Prakash Choudhary, however, did not attend.         
	State Congress leaders of consequence are already in New Delhi.         
	All have been called here (Delhi) tomorrow, Congress chief whip in the Assembly, Niel Tirkey, said from Delhi. State Congress chief Pradip Balmuchu and Congress legislature party leader Manoj Yadav are also there.         
	The state Congress leaders are trying to impress upon the high command that the new terms and conditions of support to the JMM be defined clearly before leaping forward.        
	The Congress had already announced its decision to help Soren become the chief minister.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Purushottam at Safdarjung Hospital. (Prem Singh)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: The alleged suicide of schoolgirl Pushpanjali Raj, 16, who fell from the fifth floor of her hostel yesterday, remained unexplained today with other boarders unable to provide any clue to the quiet girls state of mind.        
	Girls at the Delhi Public School hostel at RK Puram could only say that Pushpanjali dreamt of studying in an IIT and always talked about studies.        
	One of her friends had said yesterday that Pushpanjali had been tense because of academic competition, and the authorities too suggested today that she may have been under exam stress.        
	Pushpanjali, who was from Hazaribagh in Jharkhand, had joined the school two months ago. She was a quiet girl she didnt make many friends. During our rare conversations, she would talk only about her dream of cracking IIT, a classmate said.        
	Pushpanjali fell through a bathroom window, whose wire netting was cut, yesterday afternoon but her local guardian said she was too short to have cut the mesh herself.        
	Her family, who reached Delhi today, have demanded a CBI investigation. She was a very strong girl. I just want to know that there was no foul play, said brother Purushottam, an MTech student who arrived from Hyderabad.        
	An officer said police were waiting for the post-mortem report, expected tonight.         
	The girls father, Shiv Narayan Raj, broke down in front of the hospital where the body lay and needed his sons help to stand up. She was not someone who would commit suicide. We want a CBI probe, he said.        
	Principal Shyama Chona denied foul play. Pushpanjali was competing with herself. She may have been under stress because of her studies. She had scored less in two Monday tests, Chona said. She got 26 out of 40 in English.        
	Experts said adolescent suicides had grown fourfold worldwide in the past few years. Its possible that change in domicile, exposure to a different culture, peer pressure and her own high aspirations pushed her over the edge, said Samir Parikh, a psychiatrist.

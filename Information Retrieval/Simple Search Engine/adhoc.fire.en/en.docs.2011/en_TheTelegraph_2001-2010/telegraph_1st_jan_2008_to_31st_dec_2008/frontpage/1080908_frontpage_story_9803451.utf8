The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tata eye on fine print
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tata eye on fine print
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 7: Tata Motors will go through the fine print before taking a decision on resuming work at the Singur plant, sources said.        
	The company had earlier indicated it would start work only when a permanent solution acceptable to all stakeholders was found.        
	A senior Tata official is said to have reached Calcutta this evening and held a meeting with colleagues late in the night to assess the situation. Ratan Tata is now abroad.        
	The decision on resuming work will be taken after the assessment is over, a source said, suggesting that work is unlikely to resume on Monday morning.        
	In the mother plant, 85 per cent of the work has been done. Most of the remaining work concerns the vendor park, where construction cannot take place for seven more days, according to the statement read out by the governor.        
	Since the site has been effectively inactive since August 29, as many as 17 days will be lost if the seven-day freeze stays in place.        
	There is no guarantee that the seven-day deadline will be met. If the stop-work at the vendor park drags on, the fate of the project could turn uncertain again, an industry analyst said.        
	In the evening, Tata officials were upbeat about the talks between chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee.        
	However, once the chief minister returned for a second round at night  when the seven-day freeze covering the entire vendor park was included in the statement  the mood changed.        
	The Tata officials were a bit disappointed, a source said.        
	After the statement was read out by the governor, a Tata Motors spokesperson said: We do not have any reaction at this point of time.        
	Industry association Ficci termed the agreement a very big step in the right direction.

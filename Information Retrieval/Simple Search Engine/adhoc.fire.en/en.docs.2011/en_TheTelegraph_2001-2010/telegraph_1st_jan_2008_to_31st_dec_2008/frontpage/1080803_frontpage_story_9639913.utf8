  - Deepak Tirkeys winning performance floors audience           OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Ranchi, Aug. 2: Jharkhand is back in Indian drawing rooms. Well, not for any wrong reason or cricket. But because a city lad floored Bade Shehar Ke Metro Rockers in the final of a reality show today.        
	Team India ODI skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni gave away the prize to the state lad.        
	Youngsters from Ranchi to Raipur, and from Chennai to Delhi, preferred staying indoors this Saturday night to watch the contest between Chhote Shehar Ke Desi Dhurandhars  Deepak Tirkey from Jharkhand and Nishtha Nag Choudhury from Udaipur in Rajasthan  and Bade Shehar Ke Metro Rockers  Varun Sohal from Ludhiana and Loria Doshi from Jaipur  on a TV channel.        
	While Deepak, the latest dancing star of the capital city took part in a reality TV competition Chak De Bachche (on 9X) in Mumbai, his fans in Jharkhand took to the streets dancing in his support.         
	Deepaks performance was aired live on a giant screen at the Town Hall in the capital.         
	The art and culture department organised the screening. Art, culture, sports and youth affairs minister Bandhu Tirkey, the host this evening, welcomed other ministers, MLAs and guests to watch Deepaks show.         
	Tirkey told The Telegraph that after Dhoni, Deepak has done the state proud.         
	Deepak comes from a humble background and has risen due to sheer hard work. Winning the contest is not important now, but the fact that he made it to the final is enough, he said.        
	The youth affairs minister inspected the Town Hall personally to supervise the dcor and check the facilities.         
	Deepaks neighbourhood in Dibdih was also abuzz with activities. Everyone wanted to wind up work before 9pm to watch the show.         
	A Class VII student of Lala Lajpat Rai School, Deepak received several messages wishing him for the contest.         
	Deepaks school principal Rozy Sharma said: Deepak is a bright student and deserves to win.

  - Arms for villagers to combat rebels        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Imphal, May 2: A month after issuing a licence to kill militants, the Okram Ibobi Singh government has decided to provide the weapons too.        
	By next month, villagers of Heirok in Thoubal district and Chajing in Imphal West will be trained in the use of arms to help defend themselves against militants.        
	The move is part of the governments plan to bring militancy under control by arming those who are most vulnerable to rebel attacks.        
	If successful, the model will be replicated in other parts of the state as well.         
	Yes, the cabinet today resolved to recruit 300 volunteers from Heirok and 200 volunteers from Chajing, who will be provided arms by the government, a senior cabinet minister said.         
	The volunteers will be called special police officers and be given a monthly remuneration of Rs 3,000 each.         
	To function under the district police, the volunteers will man camps to be set up in their respective villages.         
	The camps are expected to be opened by June and the police recruitment process will begin within a week.         
	The recruits will be given a 303 rifle each and a months police training in weapons and unarmed combats.        
	The police housing corporation will construct barracks for the villager-policemen.        
	The Ibobi Singh cabinet took the decision after residents of Heirok and Chajing demanded weapons for self-defence following rebel attacks.         
	Two teenaged girls and a boy were killed while another girl was wounded by militants of the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak during Yaoshang (Holi) at Heirok in March.         
	A 58-year-old man was shot dead by rebels of the Kangleipak Communist Party at Chajing last month.         
	Sources said the state government put its stamp on the decision to arm villagers only after receiving a clearance from the Centre.         
	The action committees of Heirok and Chajing refused to react to the cabinet decision.         
	We learned about the cabinet decision unofficially. We cannot say anything without knowing the complete details, a leader of Heirok action committee said.         
	The decision, however, surprised the Opposition.        
	Former chief minister and leader of the Opposition Radhabinod Koijam said the government should be cautious while arming civilians because it might entail unwanted developments.         
	There are doubts whether arming civilians will contribute to the efforts to solve the problem of insurgency. The government should take the step after taking into consideration all pros and cons, Koijam said.         
	L. Chandramani Singh, the president of Manipur Peoples Party, said the working committee of his party would discuss the matter soon.

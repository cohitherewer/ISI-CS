          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Jamui, June 2: Passengers of the Calcutta-bound 5048 Purvanchal Express narrowly escaped a major mishap last night when Naxalites blew up a part of the track between Ghorparan and Narganjo stations under Asansol division of Eastern Railway.         
	The blast occurred about 8km from Jhajha railway station at 2.45am. The Maoists damaged both the up and down tracks and damaged two luggage and a parcel van adjacent to the guards van.        
	The rebels reportedly tried to stop the train as soon as it crossed the outer cabin of Narganjo halt. After the blast, rebels fired indiscriminately on the compartments. Except the guards van, other compartments managed to pass the damaged tracks but the guard, luggage and parcel vans derailed with a loud noise. No one, however, was hurt.         
	Since the train was travelling rather slowly, a major mishap was averted. After the blast, I applied the emergency brakes, Kedar Ranjan Das, the guard, told reporters in Asansol, where it reached this morning.         
	Panic-stricken passengers were forced to spend the night in the area surrounded by dense forests and hills. Gun-toting, uniformed men and women asked us to stay quiet and then vanished into the forests, a passenger said.         
	Rescue teams reached the site with Asansol divisional railway manager B. Devsingh leading the teams and work began around 9am. There was a delay as officers expressed their inability to start relief immediately. The area has earned a degree of notoriety due to the rebels, said G.R. Kantha, the deputy station superintendent of Ghorpharan halt.        
	Jamui superintendent of police Vinay Kumar, present at the site, said teams had started search operations. Last night, armed rebels in army outfits also demolished two rooms of the office of sub-divisional officer of Havali Kharagpur in neighbouring Munger.        
	 The police said more than 12 men and women raided the office, some 47km from the district headquarters, around midnight. The building developed cracks due to the blast, sources said.

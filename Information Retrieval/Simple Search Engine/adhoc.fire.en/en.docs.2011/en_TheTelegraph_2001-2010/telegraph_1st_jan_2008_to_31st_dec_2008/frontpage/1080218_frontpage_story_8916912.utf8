The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Anil offers free shares, cries rigging by rivals 
                                                                                                           Anil offers free shares, cries rigging by rivals 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Anil Ambani                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 17: Anil Ambani is buying his peace with 4 million angry shareholders of Reliance Power: he has offered to issue bonus shares to offset the losses they suffered after the stock sank on listing last Monday.        
	At the same time, Anil raged against a cabal of manipulators for hammering the stock. In a statement issued today, Reliance Power blamed the market reverses on a vicious and orchestrated campaign of market manipulation and market abuse unleashed by unscrupulous rival corporate interests.        
	It added that these interests wanted to hammer all Reliance ADA group stocks and cause losses to millions of genuine investors.        
	The company has written to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) demanding an investigation into the market manipulation.        
	The statement didnt buttress its claim with any evidence of manipulation or state who the rivals were, but Anils relations with elder brother Mukesh and his Reliance Industries have been acrimonious since the Reliance empire formally split in January 2006.        
	The Reliance Power board will meet on February 24, when the proposal to issue the bonus shares  basically free shares  will be considered.        
	Reliance Power said the bonus shares could be issued to all categories of shareholders, excluding the promoter group comprising Reliance Energy and the ADA group, thereby protecting investors even from notional short-term losses.         
	The Reliance Power debacle had tarnished Anils reputation  it was the first time that an issue bearing the Reliance tag had failed to make money for investors from the very first day. It had been sold out over 60 times in mid-January.        
	The stock had been offered to the investors at Rs 450 a share (and at a discount of Rs 20 to retail investors) but fell by almost Rs 80 on the first day of listing.        
	When the issue was announced, investors were speculating that the stock price would double on the first day of listing.        
	Observers said the announcement should lift Reliance Power shares when it opens for trading on Monday. This is the first time that a company is mulling a bonus issue within a week of listing.         
	The ratio of the bonus issue will be known on February 24. It is not yet clear whether the bonus shares will be issued only to investors who had subscribed to the issue and continue to hold them or whether they will also be given to those who bought Reliance Power shares after the stock listed.

     A STAFF REPORTER 
                  
	Guwahati, Jan. 12: Dinay Jyoti Naths fourth day in school turned out to be his last as the schoolbus he was about to board ran over him, killing the four-and-a-half year-old on the spot.
    
	He was so thrilled to have accompanied his sister to school, was the only sentence his mother Bonita could utter as she cried inconsolably at the Naths resident in Gorchuk. 
    
	Dinays elder sister Tinamoni, a Class II student of the school  Shankardev Sishu Vidya Niketan in the Tula Factory area, could not utter a single word, reeling from the shock.
    
	His father Jeleswar Nath, an employee of a biscuit factory, said negligence of the school authorities had led to his sons death.
    
	School principal Ratul Lahkar has been arrested on charges of negligence. A case has been registered with Latasil Ambari police station.
    
	The officer-in-charge of the police station, Gouri Kanta Borah, said the case had been registered on the basis of an FIR filed by Denoys father.
    
	The driver will also be booked on charges of negligence, he added. Driver Hanif Ali and handyman Rafiqul Ali are absconding. 
    
	Eyewitnesses and local residents also blamed the school authorities for negligence and a mob damaged two schoolbuses in protest. 
    
	A senior traffic police officer said haphazard parking of schoolbuses had become a major cause for concern.

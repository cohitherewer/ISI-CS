          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Tezpur/Guwahati, Feb. 27: A bicycle bomb ripped through garrison town Tezpur today, killing one person and injuring 14 more.        
	It was the first bomb explosion in a public place in Tezpur, the headquarters of the 4 Corps army formation that spearheads counter-insurgency operations in Assam.        
	The improvised explosive device went off around 2.30pm at Borgolla Chariali, about 50 metres from Tezpur Sadar police station. Schools in the vicinity were about to close for the day and parents and guardians were on their way to pick up their wards when the explosion occurred.        
	 Had the bomb exploded about 15 minutes later, many children might have come to harm, Ranu Devi, who was on her way to Sacred Heart School to pick up her child, said.        
	The lone casualty was Ajit Ghosh, the owner of a grocery shop at Panchmile. He had just reached Borgolla Chariali for some shopping when the bomb exploded.         
	Ghosh died while being taken to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, 175km from Tezpur.        
	Three other critically injured persons  Mustaque Alam, Samir Ghosh and Phanidhar Basumatary  were shifted to the same hospital. The list of injured include three women and two minors. Several cars and two-wheelers parked at the blast site and a couple of shops in the vicinity were damaged.         
	One of the witnesses, Abidur Ali, said he heard a big bang and saw parts pieces of metal flung up in the air moments after parking his motorcycle about 50 metres from the blast site. I instantly ran to safety.         
	Raju Barman was not so lucky. There was a deafening sound and people ran helter-skelter. Splinters struck me before I could react, he said from his bed at Tezpur Civil Hospital.         
	Superintendent of police M.P. Gupta said the bomb was in a bag kept on a bicycle parked by the side of the main road. He named Ulfa as the main suspect.         
	Minister Ripun Bora, who is the local MLA, visited Tezpur Civil Hospital and announced Rs 10,000 as interim compensation to Ghoshs family and Rs 2,000 each to the injured.         
	Tezpur has been almost untouched by militant-orchestrated violence in the past decade. But the town madeheadlines last year when the police arrested the commander of the Ulfas 28 Battalion, Prabal Neog, there. Neog was headed for Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh.

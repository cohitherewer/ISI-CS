The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pond fight after Subhas mission
                                                                                                        Pond fight after Subhas mission
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                     (From top) The terrain described as paddy field by the company, quoting the land department, and as water body in corporation documents. The stretch is divided by a tree-lined wedge of land that, according to a resident, had a passage for water; Subhas Chakraborty; Chandan Neogy. (Pradip Sanyal)                                   
	Calcutta, Jan. 5: Bullets were fired, dogs unleashed and lathis wielded in Maniktala today after the failure of an unexplained mission by transport minister Subhas Chakraborty to persuade residents of a housing complex to allow the filling of a watery tract by a developer.         
	At the root of the row lies the muddled status of the terrain, which figures as a water body in Calcutta Municipal Corporation documents, according to civic officials. However, the developer, Mani Group, said the state governments land and land reforms department described the area of contention as either land or paddy land. No state government official was available to verify the statement.         
	The distinction is crucial because levelling up a water body is prohibited unless the government issues a notification in public interest.         
	The residents of the complex adjoining the contentious land near Maniktala Main Road have been protesting since December 11 when a payloader entered the land. The company said the machine was brought in to clear up the land  around 11 bighas on which a housing complex is being planned. But the residents feared that the water body was being filled up, prompting them to complain to authorities and hold meetings.         
	The matter came to a head this morning when the transport minister turned up in the area and requested the residents to allow the development work to continue. Chakraborty, whose interest in sports is known as he handles that portfolio also, did not tell the residents why he was playing the mediator but apparently claimed that government work was involved. The minister was not available to clear the air till late this evening.         
	The West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation, which reports to Chakraborty, has a garage next door. Before Chakraborty spoke to the residents, another payloader had rolled in from the garage and headed towards the contentious stretch.         
	The minister then told Madan Pramanik, a resident, to desist from any form of protest as this was government work. But a Mani Group spokesperson later said he was not aware of any association between the project and the minister.         
	The minister gave us an appointment at Writers for Monday and left, saying that work should continue, said Chinmoy Mukherjee, a senior citizen from the Purbasha Housing Estate.         
	As soon as the minister left, about 40 workers got into the water  about a foot deep on Saturday afternoon but residents said a lot had been pumped out  and began removing water hyacinth.         
	The residents said that when they protested, some of those in the water rushed towards them with lathis. Chiranjib Deb, 35, was hit on the arm. Chandan Neogy  who, along with local CPM MLA Rupa Bagchi, had been spearheading the protest  was also whipped near the head. Four people were injured with Neogy being admitted to hospital for some time.         
	The residents said security guards and some goons also joined the assault. The security guards fired in the air and set four Alsatian dogs on the residents to scatter them, police said.         
	We have arrested 11 persons, including five guards, for attacking the residents, said P.K. Chattopadhyay, joint commissioner of police. The bullets that were fired in the air were not rubber bullets. We have also seized a pump the company was using for flushing out water.         
	But the Mani Group said the guards fired rubber bullets in the air in self-defence after being attacked mercilessly.         
	Corporation officials said rules define a water body as a stretch that is inundated without a break for at least six months. The Mani Group said there had been no inundation for six months but, according to the residents, water was there for decades.         
	If the state land department indeed has certified the tract as paddy land, the corporation is unaware of that.         
	We checked our records and found that the land in question was a water body, quot; said CMC commissioner Alapan Bandopadhyay. We have even sent them (Mani Group) a stop-work notice. Mani Group officials, however, said they had received no such notice.         
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said he was amazed. A stop-work notice has been issued.

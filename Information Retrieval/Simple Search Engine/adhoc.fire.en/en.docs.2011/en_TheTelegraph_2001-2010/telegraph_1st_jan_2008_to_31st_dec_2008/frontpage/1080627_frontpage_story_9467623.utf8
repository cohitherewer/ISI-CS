          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Board secretary P.K. Samal tries to calm irate students and parents in Cuttack. Picture by Badrika Nath Das                                  
	Cuttack, June 26: Thousands of students may be facing a years loss after the Orissa Board of Secondary Education lost marks of 9,262 students, while tabulating results.        
	Board officials conceded that the results of 9,262 students, who had appeared in the annual high school examination in the regular category, was withheld as their marks in different subjects went missing at the time of final tabulation.         
	The scripts either never reached the examination section or entries were not mentioned in the tabulation register of the board. The discrepancies were mostly in history, civics, geography and science subjects, officials said. Steps are been taken to locate the scripts and publish results as soon as possible, said board president Arun Samantaray.        
	Pragyan Samantaray of Badambadi New Colony High School is one of the 307 unfortunate students of Cuttack to be in the receiving end of the boards callousness. She had scored 570 out of 800 in the school test. We expected her to be among the top eight of the 60-odd students who sat for the exam this year, said K.C. Das, the headmaster.         
	Shocked by their delayed results, some students tried to contact the board officials yesterday. They were made to run from pillar to post and at the end of the day were asked to get in touch with their respective schools. The schools, in turn, told them that despite the completion of all formalities, the board had withheld the results because their marks were missing.        
	The biggest worry before the students is missing the deadline for admission to Plus Two. If the results are not declared within a fortnight, many would lose out a year.        
	In Khurda, 534 students did not receive their results on time.         
	The number of students whose results were withheld owing to missing marks was reportedly highest in Balasore (1,123) and Keonjhar (1,121), followed by Bhadrak and Jajpur (847 and 812, respectively).

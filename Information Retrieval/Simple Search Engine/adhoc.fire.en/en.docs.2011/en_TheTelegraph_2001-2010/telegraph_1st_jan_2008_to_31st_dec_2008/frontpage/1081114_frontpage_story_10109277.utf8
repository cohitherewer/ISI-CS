The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hit in hand, KRK breaks into prime-time news
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Hit in hand, KRK breaks into prime-time news
          PRIYANKA ROY                                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 13: Between Barack Obama and Sourav Ganguly, a Khan has been making waves.        
	Literally, because Kamal Rashid Khan, the lead actor and nearly everything else in Deshdrohi, is all over the airwaves.        
	Khan, whose films latest claim to fame is a ban by the Maharashtra government, keeps popping up on prime-time TV between news of Obamas new innings and Souravs last.        
	KRK the next SRK is his unofficial tagline, though he was slightly more modest when The Telegraph spoke to him. I havent reached the level of Shah Rukh Khan or Salman Khan yet, but I hope to when my film releases, he said.        
	Khan is the hero, producer, scriptwriter, dialogue and screenplay writer, and lyricist of Deshdrohi, which deals with the recent anti-migrant attacks.        
	The film first grabbed eyeballs with its incessant stream of television promos. I have a publicity budget of Rs 7 crore and so I put up the promos on all leading channels, KRK said.         
	Deshdrohi has now made it to prime-time news with the two-month ban. I hyped up the anti-Maharashtra dialogues in the promos so that the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena would notice, Khan said.        
	Notice the party did, triggering the ban on the film that releases tomorrow. I have decided not to bow to them. Maine bahut achchhi picture banayi hai (I have made a very good film). Thousands of people are waiting to see it. Deshdrohi will be a big hit, said Khan, the son of a farmer who heads a construction company in Dubai.        
	KRK claims he had penned the script in January, when Raj Thackerays anti-migrant movement had not gathered momentum.         
	Deshdrohi is about how a young man travels from Gorakhpur to Mumbai in search of a job but is discriminated against because he is a north Indian migrant. Whether corrupt politicians or cops who are hand in glove with them, I had written all of this before it (the attacks) happened. Now everyone in my unit calls me an antaryaami (soothsayer), laughed the Amitabh Bachchan fan.        
	Co-star Gracy Singh shares his optimism. The film gives out the message of unity among the countrymen who speak 1,618 languages and are divided into 6,800 castes. It is very interesting and topical. People, we are sure, will enjoy it, she said in Patna, where the cast had gathered for a promotional.        
	But Deshdrohi wont make it to screens in Mumbai and Calcutta tomorrow. Calcutta multiplexes INOX and Fame have their headquarters in Mumbai and dont want to anger the MNS by releasing Deshdrohi in the city. But I will make sure that the film comes to Calcutta on November 21, KRK promised.        
	Patna, however, is maintaining a special vigil at movie halls and many VIPs are expected to catch the first day first show.        
	I am not a movie connoisseur. But I plan to watch it tomorrow, Congress leader Munna Shahi said.         
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar refused to react on the ban. In principal, I do not favour a ban on the right to expression or any creative work. But I cannot comment on Deshdrohi for I have not watched the film. I am waiting for its release to see what message it gives, he said.                     WITH INPUTS FROM NALIN VERMA IN PATNA

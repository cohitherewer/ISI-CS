	Dumka, April 28: Declaring a virtual war against Naxalites, who have made Santhal Pargana a major hub, director-general of police Vishnu Dayal Ram said a modernisation drive would be undertaken in police stations in the region.        
	He said that the activities of the outfit in this region has crossed survey stage, the initial part of the five stages of operation level by the Maoists, and reached an advance stage. Ram, who flew to Dumka this afternoon to attend a divisional-level meeting with superintendents of police of six districts, termed the situation here alarming.        
	Later, talking to the reporters, he also admitted that the men in khaki in these districts were not well-equipped and even not competent to meet the red challenges.        
	Though none of the districts, including Dumka, has yet been declared Naxalite-hit district, the police headquarters would soon initiate massive modernisation drive in the 29 police stations, Ram said. We also have to equip our men with sophisticated arms, he added.

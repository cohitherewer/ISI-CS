          HENRY SAMUEL                            Simply carla                                  
	Paris, July 9: Carla Brunis new album, in which she sings of her love for her husband, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, can be heard for free online from today, her record label has announced.         
	The 14 tracks of Comme si de rien tait (which means As if nothing happened but will be sold internationally as Simply) can be heard on www.carlabruni.com until July 21, according to her label Naive. Listening time will be limited to two hours in total in that period.         
	Such is the feverish speculation over the former supermodel and French First Ladys third album that its formal release has already been brought forward by ten days to Friday.         
	Bruni-Sarkozy has been splashed over countless magazine covers in recent weeks, with the French media poring over her artistic and political merits.         
	She plans to give an interview on the French state radio station France Inter, which will play two of her tracks, while she will appear on primetime French television news on the night of her albums official release.         
	The Left-leaning singer who married a conservative has created headaches for the Left-wing press, who despise her husbands politics. When Libration published an in-depth interview with her last month, it received thousands of angry emails saying it had sold out but its sales went up 40 per cent.

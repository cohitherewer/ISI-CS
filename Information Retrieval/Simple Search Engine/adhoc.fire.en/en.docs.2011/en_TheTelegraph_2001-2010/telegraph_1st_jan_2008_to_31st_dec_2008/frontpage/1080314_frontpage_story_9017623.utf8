The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CBI wants Riz report out
                                                                                                           CBI wants Riz report out
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                            Rizwanur                                  
	New Delhi, March 13: The CBI feels that all the confusion over its conclusions in the Rizwanur Rahman case will vanish the moment Calcutta High Court makes the probe report public.        
	Many people and parties affected by the case have publicly questioned several aspects of the probe. A steady stream of counter claims has flowed from the accused police officers and Rizwanurs father-in-law Ashok Todi, the Bengal government, and even the dead mans own family.        
	Legal experts say the high court should make the report public to lay all speculation to rest and allow the CBI to proceed with the case by drawing up charge-sheets.        
	That the report, handed over two months ago, has been hanging in the high court for so long is a dangerous trend, criminal lawyer Ashok Arora said.        
	The court has revealed that the probe says Rizwanur killed himself, and that the CBI wants seven people  including Todi and three police officers  criminally prosecuted for abetting the suicide and five other officers to face departmental action.        
	But the court has not said how the CBI reached its conclusions, thus turning the agency into a soft target, lawyers feel.        
	Todi has filed an affidavit claiming his daughter Priyanka had never married Rizwan  when such a marriage was all along believed to be the root cause of the events that led to Rizwanurs death.        
	The businessman has told the court the CBI report is motivated, biased and arbitrary and its conclusions perverse, incorrect and baseless.        
	The Bengal government, which had asked for the CBI probe, has accused the agency of acting beyond its brief by initially registering a murder case. The state said the court had only ordered the CBI to investigate the cause of the death, so the agency had no business filing an FIR for murder or recommending anyones prosecution for abetting suicide.        
	Four of the accused police officers have challenged the probes legality and alleged they were falsely implicated.        
	The Rahman family has alleged that the body found near the tracks on September 21, 2007, was not that of Rizwanur.        
	CBI sources said the probe report answers all these questions. Once the report is in the public domain, there will be no room for any confusion, a senior official said.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	June 13: Hopes of an early consensus on Darjeeling receded today when Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee decided not to invite the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha to an all-party meeting on June 17 and the group rejected the governments offer for talks the following day.        
	The chief minister sent a letter to Morcha president Bimal Gurung, requesting him to come to Calcutta on Wednesday to discuss measures needed to restore normality and speed up execution of development work in the hills.        
	Rejecting the invitation, Gurung said: We had earlier said the Morcha would not accept preconditions to talks. But the state government has done just that and hence we cannot attend the June 18 meeting. We still demand a tripartite meeting (including the Centre) without preconditions.        
	Yesterday, Bhattacharjee had hinted that he might invite the Morcha to the all-party meeting. Sources in the state secretariat said the CPMs compulsions kept him from doing so.         
	The party did not want to risk having the Morcha accuse it of attacking Nepalis in Siliguri at the meeting, especially since the Trinamul Congress has levelled similar charges.        
	The feeling was that a heated debate could have broken out on the role of the CPM in the Siliguri violence with some of the unpredictable Left Front partners also joining in, a CPM source said.         
	Instead, the government wanted to present the Morcha with an all-party resolution on June 18 that would make it clear that all the parties were against the statehood demand and the Left was not alone to blame.        
	But with elections less than a year away, Mamata Banerjee was not willing to let the CPM emerge as a saviour of the states integrity by getting an all-party resolution passed against the Gorkhaland demand. Her party would join the June 17 meeting only if the Morcha was invited, she said.        
	We can join provided all the sides are invited. But the meeting will be futile if it is held in isolation of the Morcha. Their presence is necessary since all the parties should know about their grievances. Together, we can persuade them to drop the statehood demand and discuss how more powers can be given to the hill council, she said.         
	We wont attend the meeting to put our stamp of approval on any resolution framed by the CPM politburo.        
	The governments explanation for keeping the Morcha out is that it is not a recognised political party and doesnt have representation in the Assembly.         
	It would have been better had we been called to the June 17 meeting as we could have conveyed our stand also to other parties. But that, too, would have been possible only without preconditions, Gurung said. The Morcha has been insisting that the talks cannot be only about development and must cover statehood.        
	Bhattacharjee would only say: Wait and see what happens.

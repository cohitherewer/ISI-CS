The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kafeels death wish in email
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Kafeels death wish in email
          AMIT ROY                                           Kafeel, Sabeel       
	London, April 11: Kafeel Ahmed sent his younger brother Sabeel a chilling email with an attachment to be read after his death, two days before he rammed his Jeep Cherokee into the airport terminal in Glasgow last year.        
	In the email, Kafeel urged Sabeel to try to put off telling Abbu-Ammi (father and mother) for as long as possible about his likely death. The disclosure emerged today at the Old Bailey in London in what is believed to be the first terror trial involving Indian nationals in Britain.        
	Of the two Indian brothers from Bangalore, Kafeel, aged 28, an engineer with a PhD, suffered 90 per cent burns on June 30 and died without gaining consciousness on August 2. He is buried in an unidentified grave somewhere in the UK.        
	Sabeel, a 26-year-old doctor working for the North Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust, did read the message after the Glasgow incident. Today, Sabeel admitted in court he did not pass on the information to police after he was arrested near Liverpool on the evening of June 30.         
	When the police searched Sabeels Liverpool home, they discovered a laptop carrying Kafeels messages. The court heard that Sabeel refused to help the police when he was interviewed. It was alleged Sabeel did not exercise his right to silence but tried to mislead the investigators.        
	(AP reported that Sabeel was given an 18-month jail term. But since he has already served half his sentence and agreed to leave Britain, he will be released from jail and deported back to India, judge David Calvert-Smith said.)        
	If Kafeels email is anything to go by, Sabeel knew nothing of what his brother was up to. In Australia, their cousin, Mohammad Haneef, was arrested and he had to return home despite being cleared of all charges.        
	For the prosecution, Jonathan Laidlaw said Kafeel directed Sabeel to online documents containing his will and instructions on how to mislead investigators.         
	The message tells the story of an Indian tragedy. Inshallah by the time you get this message I should have achieved one of the two goals by the will of Allah. I sincerely apologise and pray that you forgive me for keeping this from you. It was for your safety and for the sake of the project. And after much deliberation I have decided to write this message so that you are prepared to take the knock-on effects of my actions.         
	Kafeel was specific: My sincere request that you do the following:         
	1. Pray to Allah for acceptance of my deeds.                     
	2. Pray to Allah to give you calm and composure and strength (for you will need this)         
	3. Do not inform any one about me or my deed (and I mean anyone).         
	4. If they figure out it was me (I have tried to clear up my tracks as much as possible) then go ahead and tell them whatever they ask of you (about my PhD and the project on global warming and my trip to Iceland and give them my comp if they ask).        
	And of course this is going to put you in trouble (Allah forbid).         
	He went on: Say only that which is necessary. And please dont argue. Try to continue as normal but appear shocked. Try to put off telling Abbu-Ammi (mother and father) for as long as possible. I am sorry for putting you in this situation. But its about time that we give up our lives and families for the sake of Islam to please Allah. And you will inshallah get the reward for this.        
	Kafeel wanted to deal with various scenarios as though answering a multi-choice exam paper:         
	5. If they cant figure out who it was, then keep me alive for as long as possible.         
	6. If I am caught, then try to maintain calmness (and if asked, repeat my story of PhD and project on global warming) and dont try too hard to get me released, I am prepared for the long haul (May Allah save me from the dreaded prisons).         
	It will be your task to explain to people at home. I and the team are making maximum efforts to prevent this.         
	7. In any of the above cases, leave this place and go back home or elsewhere as soon as possible.         
	8. Please take care of Abbu and Ammi...         
	There are bits of the email that the judge directed not to be made public.         
	Kafeel continued:         
	11. At any time, dont hold back from joining the Jihad, by money, words and actions. Allah makes it easy for those who do so...         
	The following suggests that Sabeel did not have any role in Kafeels plans. This is the project that I was working on for some time now...Everything else was a lie. And I hope you can all forgive me for being such a good liar. It was necessary, just so that you know. Everything since last week was executed by me and my team. This is confidential on behalf of our Emir. (If you got a sms, then the plan was stalled mid-way).         
	Kafeel told Sabeel what to do and what not to do: The other email contained my will. In case I am caught please delete it before reading. Otherwise please delete once you have gone through. Never check this email again on your computer. Delete internet files, and delete cookies. Delete the downloaded text file. May Allah... reward you for the troubles.         
	It was signed, your brother Abu Abdurahman.         
	In Bangalore, Zakia Ahmed, Sabeels mother, said this evening: My son is innocent. I am sure he will come back soon.

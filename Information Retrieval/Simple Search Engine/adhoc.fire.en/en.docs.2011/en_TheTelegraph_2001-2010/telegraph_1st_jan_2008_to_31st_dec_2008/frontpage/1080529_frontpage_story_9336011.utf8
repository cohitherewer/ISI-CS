	Calcutta, May 28: For the second year running, a girl has come first in Madhyamik.        
	The city, too, has something to cheer about. Jadavpur Vidyapith student Ronita Jana, who scored 798 out of 800, has put Calcutta back on top of the Madhyamik charts after 13 years.        
	Last year, too, a girl had come first. But Bipasha Pal, who clinched top spot after a review of her results, was from a Hooghly school.        
	The last time a student from the city had stood first in Madhyamik was in 1995, when a boy from Scottish Church Collegiate School topped the list.        
	Ronita, who grew up in an eight-foot-by-eight-foot one-room house, studying between daily household chores while her parents worked to keep the home fires burning, said she was determined to figure among the top 10 but never expected to stand first.        
	The Garia girl, whose father is a teacher and mother a nurse, said she never got much time to study. I had to do a lot of household chores. My mother works during the day and my fathers job has taken him to the Sunderbans, she said.        
	Her parents couldnt afford to keep many tutors. But my father used to come once a week and help me with physical science, she added.        
	Ronita also set a new trend along with fellow girl students. They bested the boys.        
	Girls outshone boys in Calcutta this year. This is a new trend for the city. The success rate among girls in Calcutta is 77.37 per cent compared with 76.83 per cent among boys, said Mamata Ray, president, West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.        
	Boys, however, fared better overall in the state, Ray added.        
	The board of secondary education, which conducts the Madhyamik exams, also held up another achievement. Though the number of examinees had increased by more than 76,000 this year, the pass percentage, it said, had dropped by just 2.11 per cent.        
	This is satisfactory as most of these extra examinees were from educationally backward families, Ray said.        
	A total of 73,5578 candidates appeared for the exams this year.        
	The number of examinees increased this time mainly because of the state governments successful implementation of the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (universal education project) which aims at bringing more children from backward families into the mainstream education system, Ray said.        
	A large number of students who wrote the Madhyamik examinations this year were first-generation learners. So the 2.11 per cent fall in the success rate does not indicate a qualitative decline.        
	The 2008 exam was also the last time examinees were evaluated on a traditional system.        
	In keeping with recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework, 2005, the board will introduce grades along with numerical marks from 2009 and stop citing divisions and total marks on students mark sheets.

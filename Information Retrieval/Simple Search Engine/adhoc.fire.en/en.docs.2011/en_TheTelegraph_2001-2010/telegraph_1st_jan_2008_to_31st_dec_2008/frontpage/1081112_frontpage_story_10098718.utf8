	New Delhi, Nov.11: The Centre has decided to grant special decision-making powers to security forces in the Northeast in the wake of the terror attacks in Assam.        
	The CRPF and BSF will soon have a special director-general each stationed at Guwahati, sources said. Both forces have a substantial presence in the region  the CRPF for internal security and BSF along the Indo-Bangladesh border. With closer inter-state and intra-state co-ordination on the anvil and to facilitate a massive drive to seal the international border, the home ministry has decided to empower these forces.        
	A joint secretary in the home ministry had been overseeing internal security in the region till date.        
	Meghalaya director-general of police, B.K. Dey Sawian, will be the new special secretary (internal security) here, sources confirmed from Shillong.        
	The special directors-general will be able to take quick decisions regarding sanction of funds and operations against militants. They are expected to play a pivotal role in the intelligence co-ordination group  a new mechanism created after the serial blasts in Assam.The move is part of a decision to create three posts of CRPF SDGs, four additional directors-general and 21 inspectors-general.         
	One SDG each would be stationed in Patna, Guwahati and Jammu.

	Calcutta, Feb. 8: The citys famed protest culture today robbed railway accident victim Rajen Hazra of his chance to live.        
	The 49-year-old, hanging precariously out of a packed compartment, had hit his head against a signal post near Sonarpur and fallen off when a mob gathered around him.        
	As Hazra lay bleeding, about a thousand voices shouted slogans against the railways callousness in erecting the post so close to the tracks.         
	The crowd formed a ring around the injured man for 45 minutes, refusing to let police take him to hospital till the railways had given an assurance about removing the signal post.        
	He was alive for almost an hour after the accident. Had he been taken to hospital immediately, he may have lived, Hazras cousin Shefali Manna said this evening.         
	Crowds are known to agitate with bodies and refuse to let the police get near them  but Hazra was alive and conscious. Witnesses, however, said he made two calls from his mobile, and this may have led the crowd to underestimate the seriousness of his injuries.        
	One of the calls was made to his home and the other to his 13-year-old daughters school.        
	Hazra, an Asian Paints employee, had left his home in Sonarpurs Milan Palli  on the citys southern fringes  with Sanchita at 8.15am to drop her at Loreto Sealdah, where she studies in Class VIII.        
	But the 8.30am local was unusually crowded this morning. Hazra shoved his daughter inside a compartment and then held on to the handrails himself. The accident took place as the train approached the Kamrabad level crossing 500 yards from the platform.        
	Sanchita, separated from her father by a sea of heads and shoulders, realised nothing.                  Rajen Hazra      
	Hazras first thought was not of his injuries. He felt for his mobile, which had stayed lodged inside his pocket, and called up the school. He asked the authorities to pick the girl up from Sealdah station.        
	After getting down at the station, I realised my father was missing, Sanchita told The Telegraph. As I began looking around me, I saw a person from my school. He said my father was unwell and that he would take me to school.        
	Hazras second call was an SOS to his family to send someone to take him to hospital.        
	We immediately set out for the station but the road was clogged by crowds who were either demonstrating or just watching, cousin Shefali said.        
	The mob was stoning the police, abusing the railways and setting fire to wooden sleepers stacked beside the tracks. The Government Railway Police, hugely outnumbered, asked for reinforcements.        
	We didnt even know he was still lying on the tracks, Shefali said. We thought he had been removed to the platform. We didnt realise his condition was so serious because he had been quite coherent on the phone.        
	By the time the Rapid Action Force arrived, life was fast ebbing out of Hazra. A lathi-charge broke up the mob. A local doctor declared Hazra dead and he was taken to the Mominpur morgue.        
	We have arrested three persons from the crowd, said the GRP superintendent, Sealdah, Barun Mullick.

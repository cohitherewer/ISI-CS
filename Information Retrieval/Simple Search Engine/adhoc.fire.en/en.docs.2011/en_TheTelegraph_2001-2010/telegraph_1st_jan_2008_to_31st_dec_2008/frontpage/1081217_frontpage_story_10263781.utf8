          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            A throw-a-shoe game on a website                                   
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: The world will not miss George W. Bush. It is practising its aim hard, with boot-camp commitment.        
	Netizens across the planet are flinging virtual shoes at Bushs likeness in impromptu flash games that sprouted on the Web within hours of his Baghdad misadventure.        
	And the lame-duck President, who sure ducked well when Iraqi journalist Muntazer al-Zaidi launched his Size 10s at him at a news briefing, isnt faring as well on www.        
	Can YOU throw a shoe at Bush on games website kroma had 546,886 hits by 8pm today  the number of shoe-hits Bush has suffered are anybodys guess. While Zaidi had just two shoes in his arsenal, players here have an unlimited supply. The game ends with a very political crowing of Yes You Can.        
	Bushs Boot Camp by Glasgow-based T-Enterprise mocks Bushs security by giving players the chance to play agent and shoot at a torrent of boots flying at him. The game makes sure Bush gets pelted on his shoulders and face, reducing his virtual health quotient. When it reaches zero, the game ends.        
	In Flying Babush, from France, players try to mock-defend Bush, victory depending on how long they can keep him ducking and weaving the barrage of boots. Hyperlinks to these games have ambushed cyberspace, being pasted on myriad sites.        
	Actual videos of the incident were being uploaded on YouTube at 209 clips per hour, with over 5,000 versions and 8.15 million hits at 8pm. Fourteen of the top 20 most-viewed YouTube clips are versions of shoegate.        
	While each hit means money for the portals, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof has hit on an idea about how to fight recession. Learning that a Saudi national has offered $10 million for one of Zaidis shoes, Kristof has advised Bush to trot before a series of, er, unfriendly audiences and his aides to collect the shoes and auction them off. Considerately, he has suggested attendees only wear slippers.

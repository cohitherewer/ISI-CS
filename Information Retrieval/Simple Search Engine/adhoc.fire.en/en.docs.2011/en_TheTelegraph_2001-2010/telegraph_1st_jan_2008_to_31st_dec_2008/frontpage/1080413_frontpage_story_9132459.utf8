The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Men grow thrice as fast as women in India 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Men grow thrice as fast as women in India 
          G.S. MUDUR                             unequal?                                  
	New Delhi, April 12: Men are growing taller three times faster than women in India, according to a new study that researchers say reflects the social inequality between the sexes.         
	The study by a British economist at Princeton University in the US has revealed that on an average, men in India have grown taller 0.05 cm a year, while women have grown taller by 0.016 cm at the same time.         
	The study, to be published in the journal American Economic Review next month, has also shown that the height differences between the sexes in India has increased from 7.8 per cent among people born in 1960-65 to 8.2 per cent among people born in 1975-80.         
	I do not know how to explain this change other than through differential access to whatever improvements there have been in health or food or both, Angus Deaton, professor of economics at Princeton, said in his paper.         
	Deaton used for his analysis the countrys National Family Health Survey of 2006 that for the first time collected data on heights from tens of thousands of men and women across India.         
	Previous studies have indicated that people grow taller with development and as a nations wealth increases. Although height is partly determined by genes, nutrition and health can also influence the maximum height of each person.         
	We have comparable data (about heights) from only a few other countries, but in none of them do we see whats happening in India, Deaton told The Telegraph over email.         
	An earlier study by Yale University economist T. Paul Schultz had shown that men and women are growing taller at equal rates in Brazil, Ivory Coast and Vietnam. In Ghana, women are growing taller faster than men.         
	Income may not be the most important factor, Deaton said. It is possible that other factors such as access to health care may also influence height differences.         
	Social inequality can explain the pattern we see in India, said Aravinda Meera Guntupalli, a research fellow at the University of Southampton in the UK, who was among the first to establish the link between height differences in India with social inequality across castes during the early 20th century.         
	The mechanism we see operating on womens height is the same that in the past operated on the lower castes, Guntupalli said. Height is a good indicator of all the insults during the first two decades of life in the form of poor nutrition or disease. Discrimination in women in recent years has been similar to the discrimination against lower castes in the past.         
	The differences in height could be explained on the basis of boys getting better nutrition and health care, she said.         
	While pursuing a doctorate at the University of Teubingen in Germany, Guntupalli and her colleagues had shown that early in the 20th century, landlords and merchants in India were taller than people from the lowest castes.         
	Their research also showed how during years of infections or big famines in India, the height differences between the castes narrowed.

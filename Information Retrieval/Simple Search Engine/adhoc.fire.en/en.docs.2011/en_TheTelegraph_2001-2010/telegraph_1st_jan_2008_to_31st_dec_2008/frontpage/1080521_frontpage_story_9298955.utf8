  - Auxiliary squad to battle insurgents        A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, May 20: Once a bitter critic of the Prafulla Kumar Mahanta government for utilising the services of surrendered militants, chief minister Tarun Gogoi today fell back on the old trick  setting an(ex-)thief to catch a thief  in a desperate bid to tackle insurgency in the state.         
	Gogoi today said the government had decided to set up an auxiliary force comprising former militants to make up for the shortfall in security forces to deal with insurgents. He said raising the force had become necessary because of inadequate manpower to take on militants.         
	The chief minister said the new force would have the strength of one battalion with 1,000 personnel.         
	He said even the Centre could not send additional forces as those were hardpressed with many other states in the country facing a similar law and order problem.         
	Defending his decision to involve former masters of crime, Gogoi said the move was guided by exigencies. It will take a long time to raise a force if we go through the normal recruiting process. Moreover, such recruits will need to undergo arms training. By recruiting from the surrendered militants we will not only save time on the lengthy recruitment process but get men who are well trained in arms.         
	He said it would be raised in another two to three months and that the home department had been asked to submit a proposal to raise the force. The state has around 13,000 surrendered militants who had given up arms in batches since 1991-92. This figure includes 2,600 activists of the now disbanded Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT).         
	But sources said the new force would mostly comprise recruits from among those who had surrendered since 1998. The number of such former militants is around 8,000.         
	The chief minister said the force would be utilised as and when required. It will be just like the auxiliary army to be deployed on specific need. Only recently the state government had deployed some ex-servicemen to provide security to the ongoing gauge conversion and highway projects in the troubled North Cachar Hills district.         
	Gogoi said he would strictly ensure that the force did not misuse its power. To ensure discipline, he said some NCC personnel would also be recruited along with the surrendered militants. We will study the track record of the former militants before recruiting. We will further discipline them during training, he added.         
	Sources, however, said the auxiliary force could boomerang on the Gogoi government given the penchant of the former militants to create trouble and court controversy.         
	Authorised weapons in their hands could cost the government dear politically, one of them said, recalling the discomfiture that former chief ministers Hiteswar Saikia and Prafulla Kumar Mahanta had faced because of acts of former militants.

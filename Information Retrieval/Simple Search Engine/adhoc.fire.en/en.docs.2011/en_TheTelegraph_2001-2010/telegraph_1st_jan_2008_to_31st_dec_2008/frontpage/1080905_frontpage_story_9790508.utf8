          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Sept. 4: Five security personnel, including three jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), were killed in a Naxalite ambush in Balrampur district, bordering Jharkhand, this morning.         
	Sources in the central police headquarters said seven jawans were injured in the attack, which took place around 11.30am, some 5km before Chunchuna village under Samri police station area, 550km north of Raipur. CRPF personnel with policemen of district force were patrolling the area around the Chhattisgarh-Jharkhand border when they walked into a landmine trap. The rebels detonated a powerful mine and then opened fire before the jawans could retaliate, said a senior police officer. Three CRPF jawans and two policemen died on the spot, while the rest took cover.        
	After a brief gun battle, the rebels ran into the forest cover. The police officers believe the rebels have probably crossed over to Jharkhand. The seven injured jawans have been admitted to the government hospital in Balrampur, where condition of two was reported to be critical. This is the second major casualty in the state.         
	On August 29, rebels killed six CRPF personnel including an official by detonating a landmine near Cheribedi in Narayanpur district, some 350km south of Raipur.

Test for Gurujis patience ahead of vote of confidence          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                                Shibu Soren		    
	New Delhi, July 15: For the four valuable votes from JMM, the political game has only just begun.        
	The JMM wants its share. The Congress, however much it might want numbers from Shibu Sorens JMM, it is still testing Gurujis patience in his insistence for the top seat in Ranchi or being coal minister once again.        
	The JMM, angry at the Congresss lack of showing any interest in wooing Soren, is not ready to say anything on which way it will go in Parliament in about a week.         
	The party is holding a meeting on Saturday, just two days before the Parliament session that will decide the fate of the nuclear deal and the UPA government.        
	In fact, the UPA partner has even been flirting with the BJP since late last month in order to get what the Congress is shy of giving. Presently, we are in our constituencies not saying anything, just as the Congress is silent and not coming forward to seek support from us, said a visibly irritated JMM Lok Sabha MP in the state.        
	The attitude is similar in other sections of the party which has felt betrayed after Sorens coal portfolio was not restored after he was acquitted by the Delhi High Court and released from jail in the case involving the murder of his secretary Shashinath Jha.        
	Two clear-cut alternatives have been laid down by the tribal leader.         
	One, give him the cabinet berth for coal. Two, move out incumbent chief minister and RJD chief Lalu Prasads blue-eyed boy Madhu Koda and let Soren lead the state.         
	Sources said the BJP was approached for the same reasons on the strength of the JMMs 17 legislators but Arjun Munda is unlikely to yield much. On the outside, JMM argues that the bureaucracy in Jharkhand is in a state of inertia due to political instability made consistent by an Independent legislator in charge of affairs.         
	Sources said it was through efforts of Ahmed Patel, political adviser to Sonia Gandhi and Lalu, that Koda came and called on Sonia Gandhi and returned to apply balm on the JMM back in Ranchi.        
	Though the JMM believes it is possible for the Congress to upset the present political equation and bring back Soren to power, the Congress itself does not want to sound overly impatient in inviting the JMM chief over and offer him goodies on a platter.         
	Anyway, in the JMM camp there is a long list of goodies that are required in return for support of four vital Lok Sabha members.         
	Why not bring the Coal India headquarters to Jharkhand when the state is contributing 37 per cent of the total coal production of the country, said an angry JMM leader. They accused the Congress of not showing any interest in seeking support.         
	If numbers is what the Congress will look for to muster the magic figure of 272 and more, JMM is unlikely to lose this opportunity to bargain hard. In the difficult situation, the ball of course, is in the Congresss court.

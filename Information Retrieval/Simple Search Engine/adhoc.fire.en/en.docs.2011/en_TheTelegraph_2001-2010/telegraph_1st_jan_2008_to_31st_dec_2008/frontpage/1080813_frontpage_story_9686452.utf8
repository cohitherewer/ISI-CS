          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, Aug. 12: The Congress and RJDs assurance of support to Shibu Soren notwithstanding, the chief ministers chair is still far from the JMMs chiefs reach.        
	At least five of the eight Independent ministers  Stephen Marandi, Joba Manjhi, Kamlesh Singh, Bhanu Pratap Sahi and Hari Narayan Rai  are opposed to a change in leadership of the state now.         
	Moments after Soren announced his threat to withdraw support from the Madhu Koda government, Independent ministers swung into action, mobilising support among Independent MLAs against a change of guard.        
	Deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi, the most vocal of them, said parties like the Congress and RJD could not take the Independents for a ride. We fail to understand why there is a need for a leadership change. Soren should point out lacunae in the Koda governments functioning which warrants a change, he said.        
	With three ministers, the JMM was a part of the Koda government. But they never pointed out the shortcomings of the government, he added. A change of guard now would be detrimental for the state, said Marandi trying not to appear prejudiced against Soren. He said though he fought and won the elections against Sorens son, Hemant, he once had role in helping Guruji become chief minister in 2005.        
	He said the UPA leadership never consulted the Independents. The process of installing Soren as chief minister should have begun by consulting the eight Independent ministers, he said.         
	Sahi agreed. It was ironical to see UPA MPs backing Sorens demand for chief ministership. The fact is that he needs MLAs support to assume the hot seat, the health minister said.        
	Marandi may have his own political compulsions to oppose Soren. But for the others, there are more basic reasons to prevent him from becoming state boss. First, they dont want elections now  Assembly polls are due only in 2010. Also, if Soren were to become the chief minister, they would no longer enjoy the kind of clout in the government as they do now with Koda at the helm of affairs.         
	As Independent ministers we were able to have our way with Koda, at times even arm-twist him But we would not be able to take such liberties with Soren. That is the main reason why we are opposed to Guruji, said one of them.        
	There is another factor. The green signal from the Congress as well as the RJD has come with a rider: that Soren should himself work on the Independent ministers support.         
	The JMM has called an emergency meeting of its central committee as well as the legislature party on here August 17.

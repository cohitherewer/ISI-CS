  - Security forces declare NC Hills safe        A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, May 29: Northeast Frontier Railways reluctance to resume passenger train services in the Lumding-Badarpur section in North Cachar Hills has annoyed Dispur.        
	A meeting of the strategy group of the Unified Command, presided over chief minister Tarun Gogoi, reviewed the law and order situation in the militancy-ravaged North Cachar Hills today and deemed it secure enough for the railways to steam off its passenger trains in the district.         
	Services on the 185-km-long Lumding-Badarpur stretch were withdrawn after DHD (J) rebels gunned down a locomotive driver and injured three on May 15  the day 10 truckers were gunned down by members of the outfit elsewhere in the district.         
	With the outfit having declared unilateral cessation of hostilities, the railway no longer had any reason to fear, the security agencies said.        
	They wondered why the railway found the stretch fit for goods trains and not passenger ones.         
	We have done our bit. Now the ball is in the railways court. It is for them to resume services. As for providing bullet-proof locomotives and safety jackets to the engine drivers, it is the railways call and it will have to take a decision in this regard, said a senior home department official.         
	Gogoi today renewed the peace offer to the militants saying the government was ready for discussions with any group provided it eschewed violence and was willing to talk within the framework of the Constitution.        
	After the meeting, Dispur shot off an angry letter to the railway ministry apprising it of the situation in the district and urging it to take necessary measures for resumption of passenger services in the Lumding-Badarpur section.         
	An NF Railway spokesperson, however, put down the delay to track maintenance work.        
	Very soon we will be resuming the passenger train services in the section. We are currently on some track maintenance job.         
	In the meantime, we have begun running goods train in the section so that food supply is not hit.         
	He said two pairs of goods trains plied in the section even today and that eight railway stations out of the 27 stations functioned today.         
	A couple of two-bogey trains, carrying railway and security personnel, had plodded gingerly through the Lumding-Badarpur stretch on Sunday for an inspection of the route.         
	On Tuesday, the NF Railways promised to resume passenger train services within five days, but only goods trains have plied on the route so far.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 5 years on, tribal tide turns 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         5 years on, tribal tide turns 
  - Hope for Congress in MP belt as bijli-paani plank haunts BJP          MANINI CHATTERJEE                                                     
	Jobat (Jhabua district), Nov. 23: As we leave behind the city lights and move deeper into the Adivasi belt of southwestern Madhya Pradesh, the non-committal stance of the urban voter gives way to passion and candour. And almost everyone in the dozen-odd constituencies that make up the Dhar-Jhabua belt is openly rooting for the Congress this time.         
	Magan Singh Rawat, an elderly Bhil, sits huddled in a mud-and-thatch hut in this tiny tribal hamlet and shrugs off the BJP flag flying atop his hovel. Jhanda koi bhi laga sakta, dil ki baat kuchh aur hai (anyone can plant a flag, what we feel is another matter), he says, drawing chuckles from a group of impoverished women and men around him.         
	Warming up to the theme, he points to this reporters greying hair and adds: Purana hi achchha hai, purana ko jeetana hai, pichhli baar galti ho gayi thi... (old is gold, we want to bring back the old, we made a mistake last time).         
	To approving nods from his older kinsmen, he goes on to invoke the greatness of Indira Gandhi who, if she had lived, would have wiped off the dard (pain) of the garib (poor) from the face of this corner of the earth.         
	But more than misplaced nostalgia for the Indira years, it is the BJPs betrayal, we discover, that is fuelling the pro-Congress sentiment in these parts.        
	Till the watershed election of 2003, the tribals of Madhya Pradesh  as indeed much of India  had been staunch supporters of the Congress. This blind loyalty was one reason that the party, barring brief interregnums, could rule from Bhopal decade after decade.                     
	Five years ago, that compact was rudely shattered. The BJPs campaign against the lack of development under Congress rule suddenly struck home even among those who had expected little but given a lot to Indira Gandhis party. Of the 41 reserved tribal (ST) seats in the states, the BJP won as many as 36. It did equally well in the seats reserved for Dalits, winning 30 of the 36 seats.         
	After delimitation, the number of ST seats has gone up to 47 but if the Dhar-Jhabua belt is anything to go by, the BJP has little to cheer. The partys electrifying slogan of bijli, sadak, paani (power, roads, water), which was first used in the 2003 Madhya Pradesh polls before becoming part of the political lexicon, has returned to haunt it.         
	Villagers who had come to terms with sarkari apathy over the decades had become mesmerised by the BJPs slogan of change. Five years on, not only has the promise of change proved hollow but the bitterness is also greater because the expectations were so much higher from the new BJP than the old Congress.         
	The BJPs failure on the power front seems to be the biggest grouse of the villagers in this belt, followed closely by the alleged corruption of local BJP leaders.         
	At Rajgarh in Dhar district, a group of farmers dont mince words about why they are angry with the BJP. When we point out that the roads are pretty smooth even in interior Madhya Pradesh, Babubhai Chaudhuri snaps: What does a farmer need? He needs electricity and water. Without electricity, he cannot draw water so bijli is the most important thing. Roads are for rich people who have cars and trucks  not for us.         
	Chaudhuris is not a lone voice. The further we travel, the more familiar become the complaints. We get electricity for only four hours, our transformers keep getting burnt, the BJP MLA has no time to listen to us, young men who joined the BJP five years ago have built three-storey mansions but our life has only got worse the villagers chant like a litany.         
	Given this level of bitterness, the Congress is set to do well almost by default. The biggest Congress name in these parts (after Indira Gandhi, that is) is Jamuna Devi, the feisty leader of Opposition in the Assembly for the last five years.         
	Jamuna Devi, who moved to the Congress from the socialist movement, won the Kukshi Assembly seat for the fourth time in 2003. Her supporters are bitter that she has not been in the reckoning for the chief ministers position despite her grassroots support. In case the Congress wins the state on the strength of the return of the Adivasi vote, she ought to be rewarded, they insist.         
	But outside Kukshi, no one seems to know or care about the Congress infighting at the top and the race to be chief minister. Indeed, some do not even know the name of their own Congress candidate.         
	Sitting under a giant neem tree at a place called Ranapur near Jhabua town, a woman selling peanuts tells us that she is illiterate and doesnt know anything about the polls. But as we chat a little longer, she says shyly: Is baar phool mein nahin daalna hai, haath mein daalna hai (this time we will not vote for the lotus but for the hand).         
	That is sign enough of an anti-incumbency wave in the making but no one is sure yet whether it is a local weather condition or symptoms of a wider state-wide phenomenon.

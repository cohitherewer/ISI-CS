  - Tokyo faces Singh-Bush dilemma        SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                     
	New Delhi, June 27: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs Japanese hosts at next months G8 summit in Hokkaido suddenly find themselves confronted with a perplexing diplomatic dilemma: they dont want any discussions on the nuclear deal happening between Prime Minister Singh and President George W. Bush on Japanese soil, but dont know how to put it to the two sides.        
	As the only nation subjected to atomic devastation  the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 by the Americans  Japanese sensitivities against anything nuclear run high.         
	Even though it may possess the technology and wares, Japan has stuck to a 1971 parliamentary resolution that states that she shall never manufacture, possess, nor allow the introduction of nuclear weapons into its territory.         
	Japan does have a nuclear energy programme  it is the third largest producer after the US and France  but it is philosophically and politically anti-proliferation, often taking the global lead in opposing the spread of nuclear technology.         
	It was among the first countries to suspend economic ties with India after Pokhran II in the summer of 1998 and took a long time  and many assurances on a moratorium on N-testing  to resume normal relations.        
	There are fears in some Japanese quarters that the meeting between Singh and Bush on the sidelines of the summit could spark off political trouble for Prime Minister Yasuo Fukudas unstable Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) government.        
	The Japanese are only too aware that its inevitable the nuclear deal will come up for discussions between the two leaders. For the Indian media, at any rate, that will probably be the story of the summit.         
	The row over the deal between the UPA and the Left has peaked yet again, and the international deadline for its completion is running close; what will Singh and Bush talk about if not the future of the deal?         
	But diplomatic nicety stands firmly in the way of the Japanese being able to prevent domestic embarrassment.        
	You cant, after all, advise, much less tell, heads of government what to talk about and what not in a one-to-one meeting. Despite their deep unease, the Japanese have stuck to propriety and demurred making any requests to their guests, formal or informal.        
	 Their unspoken hope: if Singh and Bush must discuss the deal, they will keep it low key while in Hokkaido; talk, but try not to tell.        
	It is being suggested in diplomatic circles here that playing down the nuclear aspect of the exchanges that Singh might have in Hokkaido will serve Indian interests well.        
	Japan is a key member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which must sanction the Indo-US nuclear deal before it reaches the American Congress for ratification. Japan has yet to commit to a position on the deal but the odds are it may quietly wave the deal on in the broader interests of ties with India.        
	However, that could change if Singhs Hokkaido stay generates too much nuclear noise, as is expected.        
	Pointing out that Premier Fukuda has only a slender majority in the Japanese lower house and no control over the upper chamber, a diplomatic source said: The political opponents of the Fukuda government could exploit the fact that Japan has been used for nuclear negotiations by third countries and raise a storm over it.         
	That may not endanger Fukudas future but it may make it tough for the Japanese to take a favourable position on Indias case in the key international negotiations that are to take place before the deal goes through.

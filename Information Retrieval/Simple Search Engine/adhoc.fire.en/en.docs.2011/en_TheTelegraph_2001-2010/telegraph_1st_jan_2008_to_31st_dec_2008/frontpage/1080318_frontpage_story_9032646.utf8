	London, March 17: Oscar-winning actress Halle Berry has become a mother for the first time.         
	Berry, 41, gave birth to a baby girl on Sunday. According to People.com, her publicist, Meredith Sullivan said in a statement that both mother and infant are doing great.         
	The father is male model Gabriel Aubry, 32. The two met in Los Angeles two years ago while they were shooting an ad for Versace.         
	Berry said that it was her experience playing a mother in her latest film, Things We Lost In The Fire, that opened her mind to the possibility of motherhood herself.         
	Speaking on the Oprah Winfrey show last year, Berry said: I think it validated that I was meant to be a mother because every day I dealt with the character as a mother and thinking as a mother. It let me know that I must be a mother. The sometime James Bond girl  who played opposite Pierce Brosnans 007 in Die Another Day  won the best-actress Oscar for 2001s Monsters Ball.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Praveen to turn out for Bangalore
                                                                                                           Praveen to turn out for Bangalore
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Praveen Kumar                                  
	Sydney: Medium-pacer Praveen Kumar, whose MoM-award winning effort against Sri Lanka in Hobart helped take Team India to the tri-series final, will be turning out for Bangalore in the Indian Premier League.        
	News that Ive signed for Delhi is incorrect... Ive joined Bangalore, Praveen, who comes from a family of wrestlers in UP, told The Telegraph.        
	Bangalore, incidentally, will be captained by Rahul Dravid and the team includes specialist new-ball bowlers Zaheer Khan and Dale Steyn.

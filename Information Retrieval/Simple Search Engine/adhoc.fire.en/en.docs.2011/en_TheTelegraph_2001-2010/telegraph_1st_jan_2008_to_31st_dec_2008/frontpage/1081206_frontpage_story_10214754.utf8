  - Home minister admits lapses           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, Dec. 5: P. Chidambaram today said he was deeply sorry for the Mumbai terror attack which has triggered furious criticism of the countrys politicians, and admitted intelligence and security lapses.        
	To the citizens of Mumbai, I can only say this, I am deeply sorry for what happened, Chidambaram, appointed Union home minister after the carnage, said on a visit to the city.        
	The minister acknowledged failure on the security forces part and accepted that the Centre and state governments needed to change their attitude towards combating terror. There have been lapses. I would be less than truthful if I said there had been no lapses. These are being looked into. We will address the causes, said Chidambaram who, according to PTI, arrived on a commercial flight instead of the usual BSF aircraft.        
	Flanked by state police chief A.N. Roy and city police commissioner Hasan Gafoor, Chidambaram told a questioner: I agree there has been a failure on the part of the security forces, but this attack will help the government be more determined in combating terrorism.        
	He alluded to an ISI role but would not name it, nor comment on a possible Dawood Ibrahim link.        
	About the investigations, he merely said: A lot of evidence has been gathered. When the full picture is drawn up I expect to be able to make a statement in Parliament.        
	The minister said he had asked the state to hand out compensation to the families of the dead and injured before December 31. The Centre will also help the families get their insurance claims settled within three to four weeks.        
	However, Chidambaram ended with an appeal that may sound cliched to most in Mumbai: I would request Mumbaikars to summon once again the spirit of Mumbai so that it rises as the premium city of the country.

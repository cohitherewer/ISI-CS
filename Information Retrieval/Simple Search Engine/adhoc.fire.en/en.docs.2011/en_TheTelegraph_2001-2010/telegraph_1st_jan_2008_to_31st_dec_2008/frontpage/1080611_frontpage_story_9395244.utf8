  - Govt waits for people to feel pinch of strike and pile pressure on spearheads in Darjeeling         OUR BUREAU                            Three hill residents, among the many forced to stay overnight in Siliguri by the shutdown, start walking back home to Tindharia, 20km away, on Tuesday.

	Calcutta/Darjeeling, June 10: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today urged the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha to drop its statehood demand and sit for talks, launching a four-pronged strategy that includes withholding of force and a wait for the hills to start feeling the indefinite bandhs pinch.        
	At the political level, the government plans to soften the hills with the carrot of more autonomy while the CPM runs a grassroots propaganda against statehood, sources said.        
	I appeal to the Morcha not to insist on statehood because we are peaceful people and should stay united, the chief minister said.        
	They should join discussions at bipartite or tripartite (the Centre being the third party) levels and allow the government to maintain law and order in the hills. This bandh should not have happened and should not continue.        
	Morcha president Bimal Gurung welcomed the call for talks but said the Gorkhaland demand would have to be part of the agenda. We have no problem sitting for a tripartite meeting. But we will definitely raise Gorkhaland.         
	Top government and CPM sources said the Morcha would be countered politically with a four-point strategy:        
	The chief minister will continue to appeal for talks and against the statehood demand and the government would desist from using force immediately.        
	Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said: We are not thinking of police action now. We havent discussed army deployment either.        
	The government will wait and watch. It believes the indefinite bandh will put the Morcha under pressure as the hill economy suffers and the transport-tourism sectors get fidgety.        
	The government will offer wider powers to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC). Bhattacharjee dropped a broad hint today.        
	Earlier, when the Morcha came to talk to me, I had said I would welcome wide-ranging discussions on how to improve the DGHCs functioning, he said. I am willing to discuss this to any extent.        
	The CPM will try to convince the hill people that a united Bengal is a better bet for peace and prosperity than a separate state. Hill affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya reflected this line of thinking today.        
	CPM supporters today campaigned on Siliguris streets against the bandh. They will hold rallies tomorrow on the need for peace in the hills and the benefits of staying together, he said. Our chief minister has said we should counter the Morcha politically rather than the government using force.        
	Gurung relented to an extent saying the bandh would be relaxed for a few hours in a day or two to allow people to stock up and ease their problems. Also, the tea gardens and cinchona plantations, which employ nearly three lakh people, would be exempt from Thursday.        
	But Morcha leaders said it would be suicidal for Gurung to back down from the statehood demand anytime soon.        
	The Morcha is in a more difficult situation than (Subash Ghisinghs) GNLF had been in, because it can accept neither the DGHC nor Sixth Schedule status, a source said. A possible way out is for Delhi to open a dialogue.        
	Bhattacharjee said he had spoken to Delhi on the bandh, but only to discuss the blocked highway to Sikkim.

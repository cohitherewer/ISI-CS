     G.S. MUDUR 
                       
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: Bengal jumped from the Calcutta fire to the bird-flu frying pan today but rapid and persistent action can prevent the affliction from spinning out of control like the blaze.
    
	A worrying factor in Bengal is the affliction of backyard poultry, which is harder to tackle and requires house-to-house surveillance.
    
	Flu-fighters such as Indias animal husbandry commissioner Shantanu Bandopadhyay are about to go to war  for the fifth time in two years.
    
	He is plunging into a coordinated, multi-agency, centre-state operation against the H5N1 outbreak in Birbhum in central Bengal and South Dinajpur in the north.
    
	Bengal is the fifth state in the country to have been struck by an outbreak of H5N1 since the first one in a district of Maharashtra in February 2006, and others in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Manipur.
    
	The action plan remains pretty much the same, said Bandopadhyay. Culling of poultry around the core areas of the outbreak and intensive surveillance.
    
	An assessment by the state government has indicated that about 35,500 poultry birds have died in 102 villages across six blocks in Birbhum, and a single state-run farm in South Dinajpur has reported 350 poultry deaths.
    
	In the coming days, the states rapid response teams will be expected to fan out across the six blocks in Birbhum to cull around 400,000 birds.
    
	The number of poultry birds to be culled in a 3km radius around the affected farm in South Dinajpur is estimated to be only 28,000. 
    
	These figures might change as we go ahead with surveillance, Bandopadhyay told The Telegraph.
    
	Avian influenza experts said speed in extinguishing the outbreak is crucial. The state government will need to prevent the movement of poultry from the affected districts to other parts of the state. The government banned sale and purchase of chickens from the affected areas on Sunday.
    
	The culling operations need to be efficiently carried out without exposing the personnel to sick birds, said Hare Krishna Pradhan, former director of the High Security Disease Laboratory in Bhopal, during whose tenure H5N1 had first surfaced in India.
    
	Each of Indias earlier outbreaks had been contained within about six weeks. The longest and hardest operation was in Jalgaon, Maharashtra, where the virus had spread among backyard poultry. In Birbhum, too, the deaths are among backyard poultry. 
    
	Backyard poultry poses peculiar problems, said Bandopadhyay. We need house-to-house surveillance, and every owner has to be convinced.
    
	Most of the owners are very poor. Theres a human and economic angle to this operation. We need to use gentle persuasion, he said. 
    
	Although H5N1 is not efficient at infecting humans, state and central medical teams will also begin house-to-house surveillance, looking for people who have been exposed to sick poultry and have suspicious symptoms such as high fever, cough, and other respiratory symptoms.
    
	Individuals who have had exposure to sick poultry and have such symptoms would need to be kept in isolation wards.
    
	A government medical officer in Birbhum said about 50,000 people are expected to be covered in the survey.
    
	The Bengal government has deployed 60 teams for culling and surveillance. The Centre will send 5,000 pieces of protective gear and masks for personnel deployed for the culling operations. 
    
	Although H5N1 is primarily an avian virus, it has been known to infect humans  very inefficiently.
    
	Over the past five years, only 316 people across 14 countries have been infected with H5N1, but 216 are dead, indicating a high mortality in humans.

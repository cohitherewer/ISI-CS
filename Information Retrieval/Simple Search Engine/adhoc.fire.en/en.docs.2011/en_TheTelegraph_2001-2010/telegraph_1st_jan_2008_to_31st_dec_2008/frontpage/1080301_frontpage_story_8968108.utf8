	Perhaps for the first time in the history of India a very big tax exemption hike has been witnessed by individual income tax payers under the new amendments introduced in the Finance Bill 2008.        
	For individual taxpayers, the basic income tax exemption limit has been raised to Rs 1,50,000. This means individual taxpayers having a total income of Rs 1,50,000 in financial year 2008-09 will not be required to pay any income tax.         
	Likewise, the basic exemption limit for women income tax payers would be Rs 1,80,000, while the basic exemption limit for senior citizens (65 years) has also been increased to Rs 2,25,000. The increase in these limits is really a matter of joy for all categories of taxpayers.         
	In monetary terms, the increase in the exemption limit will translate into income tax saving ranging between Rs 4,120 and Rs 45,320 for individual taxpayers with an income of Rs 5 lakh. Likewise, for women tax payers, the net saving as a result of the hike in the basic exemption limit will be a minimum of Rs 6,695 and a maximum of Rs 44,805 on an income of Rs 5 lakh. Finally, for senior citizens, the tax saving will be a minimum of Rs 6,180 and maximum of Rs 39,655 if the income is Rs 5 lakh. The above saving is inclusive of the saving on education cess.         
	Another special enhanced deduction to be enjoyed by individuals is for those who make payment of medical insurance premium for his/her parent or parents. They will enjoy an additional deduction to the tune of Rs 15,000. If parents are senior citizens, the deduction will be Rs 20,000. This additional deduction has been made available over and above the existing deduction to taxpayers up to Rs 15,000 on insurance policies for themselves, their spouse and children.         
	The new budget proposals have not amended the existing tax provisions relating to surcharge and education cess. The tax on short term capital gains of listed securities would now be 15 per cent against the present system of taxing them at 10 per cent. There is, however, no change in tax treatment of long-term capital gains on listed securities, which would continue to be exempted as in the past.        
	The clarification on reverse mortgage would surely help senior citizens and would help them to take liberal advantage of reverse mortgage because no income tax liability is attached on transactions involving reverse mortgage.         
	Reverse mortgage is not treated as a transfer, so no capital gains tax. Likewise no income-tax is payable on the amount received consequent to reverse mortgage as it would not be considered as income of the assessee.         
	Expenses during festivals would mean lower payment of Fringe Benefit Tax, while the expenses incurred on company guest houses would be outside the scope of Fringe Benefit Tax. This provision would make salaried employees happy.         
	Now Permanent Account Number would be required to be quoted in most financial transactions. Details are expected in due course. If you do not have your PAN card it is time now to apply so that there is no problem for you in future.        
	Just like Securities Transaction Tax a new tax is introduced known as Commodities Transaction Tax (CTT) to be levied in respect to taxable commodities transactions in a recognised association.

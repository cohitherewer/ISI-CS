          JAYANTH JACOB                            Singh and Gilani before their meeting in Colombo on Saturday. A behind-the-scenes US and a forthright Afghanistan President boosted Indias case linking the ISI to the July 7 embassy bombing in Kabul. (AP)                                         
	Colombo, Aug. 2: Pakistan today offered to conduct an inquiry into the bombing of Indias Kabul embassy which Delhi, Afghanistan and the US have linked to Islamabads spy agency, the ISI.        
	The suggestion came from Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani at his meeting with Manmohan Singh on the sidelines of the Saarc summit here this evening, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said.        
	Islamabad is ready to conduct an independent inquiry, Menon said, adding that Gilani would bring the subject up also at his meeting with Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai, who today spoke of Pakistan as a hotbed of militancy.        
	Within an hour after the (July 7) blast, the Afghan President had blamed a section of the Pakistani establishment for the incident. I would ask him to share the proof and we would look into it, Gilani later said.        
	Whether or not the probe leads to anything, Pakistans willingness to hold one is significant. Since the attack came on an Indian embassy in Afghanistan, Pakistan is a third country in the matter.        
	Islamabads move may be an indirect admission of the pressure it has been facing since US intelligence claimed proof of an ISI role in the attack  which Delhi sees as vindication of its long-standing allegations linking Pakistan and militant attacks.        
	At the meeting with Gilani, Singh took up issues that Delhi says have put bilateral ties and the dialogue process under strain: the embassy bombing, Kashmir ceasefire violations and rise in cross-border infiltration.        
	The Bangalore and Ahmedabad blasts figured in the talks but were not discussed with the specificity that India has attached to the Kabul attack, the foreign secretary said, adding that investigations into the explosions were still on.         
	It was a detailed exchange, Menon said and described the meeting as a candid and open conversation between two leaders who want to see a way forward.        
	According to Menon, Gilani told Singh the ceasefire was the most important CBM (confidence-building measure) between the two countries.        
	Singh had earlier told the Saarc summit: Terrorism remains the single biggest threat to our stability. We cannot afford to lose the battle against the ideologies of hatred, fanaticism, and against all those who seek to destroy our social fabric.        
	Karzai said: Terrorists in our region receive institutional nurturing and support. It is this imbedded nature of terrorists that make it a much more sinister threat.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: The body of Wangba Khamancha, a senior leader of the Kangleipak Yawol Kana Lup (KYKL), was found on an isolated stretch on the Gurgaon-Delhi border near Mundela village on Saturday.         
	Khamancha, in his fifties, was the chief of the outfits Operation New Kangleipak, and is suspected to have been killed by his outfits own members.         
	News of his death was heard in Imphal a day later.         
	On October 4, a villager from Mundela noticed that a body was lying near Jitwala Jod. He informed Jafarpur Kalan police station about the body.         
	The dead man had bled to death from a bullet wound, sources said.         
	The police have picked up one person and are said to have got a lead in the case that points to Gurgaon.         
	Sources said the detained man has named a person named Boy as one of the persons involved in the crime.         
	The police were unwilling to confirm the identity of the man but said investigation was on in Gurgaon with help from Haryana police.         
	Wangba is known for an operation under which, education ministry officials were punished for alleged corruption. One story doing the rounds is that the members of the outfit met in New Delhi and discovered that Khamancha was planning to float his own outfit. He was then killed in cold blood.        
	The outfit is under close scrutiny by security agencies after its rapprochement with the United National Liberation Front, another valley-based outfit in Manipur.         
	The outfits were planning to forge a joint front but Khamancha was said to be opposed to it.

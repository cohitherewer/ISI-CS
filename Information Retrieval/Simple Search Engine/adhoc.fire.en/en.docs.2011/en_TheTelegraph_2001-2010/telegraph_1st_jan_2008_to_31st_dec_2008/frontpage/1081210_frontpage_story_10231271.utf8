          TARA PARKER-POPE                            An asthma patient taking medication                                  
	New York, Dec. 9: How, when and where a child is born may all play a role in lifetime asthma risk, new studies suggest.        
	Asthma occurs when airways in the lungs spasm and swell, restricting the supply of oxygen.         
	The incidence of asthma in the US has risen steadily for more than two decades, and about 6 per cent of children now have asthma, up from less than 4 per cent in 1980, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.        
	The reasons for the increase are not entirely clear. Genetics probably plays a role in the risk for asthma, but an array of environmental factors  pollen, dust, animal dander, mould, cockroach feces, cigarettes, air pollution, viruses and cold air  have all been implicated in its development.        
	This month, The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine is reporting that children born in the autumn have a 30 per cent higher risk for asthma than those born in other seasons. The finding is based on a review of birth and medical records of over 95,000 children in Tennessee.        
	A possible explanation is that autumn babies tend to be about 4 months old at the peak of the cold and flu season. By that age, many babies are in day care and regularly exposed to the outside world.         
	And while their lungs are still developing, they have yet to develop strong immune systems. As a result, autumn babies are at particular risk to contract a severe winter virus, which may in turn increase their risk for asthma.        
	The lead researcher, Dr Tina V. Hartert, director of the Centre for Asthma Research and Environmental Health at Vanderbilt University, says some parents with a high familial risk for asthma may want to consider timing conception to avoid an autumn birth.         
	But since that is impractical for many people, Hartert says, all parents should take precautions to reduce a babys risk of a respiratory infection.        
	Its premature to say you should time conception so children arent born in the autumn, she said. But its good sense to use typical hygienic measures to try and prevent illness.        
	As for how a baby is born, Swiss researchers are reporting in the journal Thorax this month that a Caesarean delivery is linked to a much higher risk for asthma compared with babies born vaginally.         
	In a study of nearly 3,000 children, the researchers found that 12 per cent had been given a diagnosis of asthma by age 8. In that group, those born by C-section were nearly 80 percent more likely than the others to develop asthma. The explanation may be that a vaginal birth primes a babys immune system by exposing it to bacteria as it moves through the birth canal.        
	Finally, researchers at Tufts reported last month in The Journal of Asthma that a babys place of birth also influences asthma risk. In a study of black families in Dorchester, Massachusetts, they found that babies born in the US were more likely to have asthma than black children born outside the country.         
	(An Indian pediatrician who specialises in respiratory illnesses said the study has established an association between asthma and season of birth, but further studies would be required to explain the season-asthma link, reports our special correspondent in Delhi. An association does not establish cause-and-effect, said Gulshan Rai Sethi, a pediatric pulmonologist at the Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi.)

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: IIT hopefuls can no longer afford to ignore school and focus entirely on coaching classes. From next year, they may need to score at least 70 per cent in their Class XII board exams.        
	Students seeking admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology are required not only to clear the IIT Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) but also to score a certain percentage in their Class XII exams. Next week, the institutes are likely to raise this cutoff from the current 60 per cent to 70 per cent, top IIT officials said.        
	The matter will come up at a meeting of the institutes Joint Admission Board, the top policy-making body for the IIT-JEE, in Kharagpur on August 24.        
	A stamp of approval may still be needed from the standing committee of the IIT Council, headed by human resource development minister Arjun Singh. But sources said IIT directors had been discussing the proposal for some time informally with ministry officials and were reasonably confident it would be accepted.        
	The proposal does not appear to have any problems, a senior HRD official said. The ministry, he added, is considering raising the eligibility (board) marks for the All India Engineering Entrance Examination from 50 to 60 per cent.        
	IIT officials do, however, expect some opposition from parents to the increased cutoff since some school boards are perceived to be less generous in awarding marks, or to set tougher papers than others.         
	This move to raise the eligibility marks to 70 per cent is aimed at discouraging students from depending purely on their coaching classes, neglecting school, an IIT director said.         
	Institute officials estimate that over 95 per cent of students who clear the JEE take coaching classes.

  - Chatterjee hints at staying on as Speaker           OUR BUREAU                            Chatterjee in Noida. (PTI)                                        
	Aug. 1: Somnath Chatterjee today signalled that he would continue as Speaker for the rest of his term and said the CPM had no right to give him any direction as long as he presided over the House.        
	In a statement issued in Delhi, Chatterjee stressed that the CPM general secretary had on several occasions, in public and in private, said the final decision (whether to remain Speaker) would be taken by me.        
	Prakash Karat  who went unnamed in the statement, described each time as general secretary  had telephoned him on the morning of July 9 to say that a section of the party wanted him to step down but that it was up to him to decide, Chatterjee said.         
	I was surprised to learn from the media that my name was on the list the CPM submitted to the President the same day, the Speaker said, adding that even after this Karat repeated in public that any decision would be Chatterjees own.        
	On July 20, the Speaker said, he was for the first time told verbally by a politburo member that the party had decided that he should resign and vote against the government. After he refused, he was told he could resign but abstain from voting, a suggestion that he again rejected.        
	So far, Karat had not said in public that he had personally discussed the resignation issue with Chatterjee. The partys stand has been that Chatterjee should have resigned after learning that the central committee wanted him to. CPM leaders, who have refused to be identified, have claimed that he had agreed to step down but changed his mind.         
	No responsible person or authority can treat the Speaker as belonging to or extending support either to the government or its allies or to the Opposition. Thus the question of the Speaker withdrawing support to the government can never arise, Chatterjee said.         
	I have consciously taken the principled decision to uphold the Constitution of India at the risk of being unjustifiably dubbed as anti-party, Chatterjee said.         
	Chatterjee described July 23, when he was informed through the media of his summary expulsion from the party he had been associated with for nearly 40 years, as one of the saddest days of my life.         
	The CPM should have appreciated that as Speaker, I did not represent it nor could it at all give any direction to me.         
	The Speaker, who leaves for Kuala Lumpur tomorrow to attend a meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, thanked people for their overwhelming and unprecedented support and said it gave him give me renewed strength to continue to fulfil my obligations and responsibilities as the Speaker during my tenure.        
	Two CPM leaders  Pramod Dasgupta, one of the builders of the party who had asked him to become its member, and great leader Jyoti Basu, who has always given me unstinted support and encouragement  were also singled out for special thanks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | How the Vienna ball was set rolling 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   How the Vienna ball was set rolling 
          MANINI CHATTERJEE                            Pranab Mukherjee                                  
	New Delhi, July 12: Indias ambassador to Vienna, Saurabh Kumar, was authorised to initial the India-specific safeguards agreement and inform the IAEA to circulate it among its board of governors on the evening of July 8  a day before the Left parties went to Rashtrapati Bhavan to withdraw support to the UPA government, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee confirmed to The Telegraph today.        
	The authorisation was directly given by Mukherjee and not Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who was attending the G8 summit in Hokkaido at the time.        
	Mukherjee also underlined that he had not spoken out of turn when he told reporters in a televised news conference on July 8 that the government would not seek the approval of the IAEA board before winning a confidence vote on the floor of the Lok Sabha.        
	At the press conference, I said we will go to the IAEA board for approval after attaining the vote of confidence. That does not mean that we cannot circulate the draft among the members, Mukherjee said, rebutting criticism from the Left and the BJP that the government had committed midnight deceit and betrayed the people by going to the IAEA before establishing its majority in Parliament.        
	The external affairs minister, who was the governments chief interlocutor during the interminable and intractable negotiations with the Left parties on the nuclear deal, sought to draw a fine distinction between approaching the IAEA and seeking its approval, although the two are interlinked.        
	He said that in order to come up before the board of governors for approval, the draft agreement would first have to be circulated among the members  usually 45 days in advance.        
	With the IAEA board expected to hold a meeting on July 28, India was already behind time. So, once it became clear that the Left would withdraw support (and hence lose their veto over the next steps of the deal), the government decided to allow the (till then) frozen text of the safeguards draft to be circulated among the members.        
	Outlining the sequence of events that took place on July 8, Mukherjee recalled that CPM general secretary Prakash Karat informed the media around 12.30pm that the time has come to withdraw support and said they would formally convey that decision to President Pratibha Patil the next day (July 9).        
	Soon after that announcement, Mukherjee met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and told her of the Lefts decision. They both agreed that the government should seek a trust vote in Parliament in view of the Lefts withdrawal of support. Otherwise, the Left as well as other Opposition parties would take to the streets and demand the governments resignation.        
	Mukherjee did not elaborate on the decision but it was significant since a section within the Congress and the Samajwadi Party had suggested that there was no need for a trust vote and letters of support for the UPA to the President should suffice.         
	But Mukherjee felt  and Sonia concurred  that the government should not let things drag but unilaterally announce its readiness to face a vote of confidence by convening a special session of Parliament.        
	Mukherjee then spoke to the Prime Minister in Japan  around 2.30-3.00pm IST  who readily agreed to the proposal. Since the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs (CCPA) decides on the dates of regular Parliament sessions but only the Prime Minister can take a call on special sessions, it was agreed that the dates of the special session would be finalised after Manmohans return to the country.                    
	It was later in the evening that Mukherjee made his now-controversial remarks at the media conference about the governments readiness to face a trust vote and not operationalise the nuclear deal or even seek the IAEAs approval of the safeguards agreement if it failed to win it.        
	The same evening, Mukherjee formally authorised Indias ambassador to initial and circulate the draft. International agreements, the minister explained, can be signed by the Prime Minister or the external affairs minister or any other senior official under authorisation. Since the ambassador in Vienna holds the rank of minister plenipotentiary, he was entitled to initial the document with the authorisation of the external affairs minister.        
	Mukherjee dismissed queries as to why the government was so secretive about the whole thing, saying it was plain common sense applicable to all organisations that an agenda note had to be circulated among members in order to get approval. The government had committed no wrong by keeping this step under wraps till it was revealed by the IAEA spokesman late on July 9 (Indian time), he insisted.        
	He also chose not to comment on the fact that none of the top officials  national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon included  who briefed journalists on the flight back from Japan on the night of July 9 chose to remain curiously tight-lipped about Indias decision to circulate the safeguards draft.        
	It was only after the Prime Ministers flight landed in Delhi well after midnight that the media learnt of the governments decision  taken well over 24 hours before.        
	Mukherjee did not allude to the other controversy about the Prime Ministers mid-air we will go to the IAEA very soon remark made within an hour of take-off on the morning of July 7.         
	Mukherjees letter to the Left leaders scheduling a meeting of the UPA-Left committee on July 10 was dispatched later that same morning  but the Prime Ministers remarks made the letter redundant. The letter to the Left parties had been drafted well in advance and the Prime Minister had seen it before he left for Japan, the external affairs minister said.

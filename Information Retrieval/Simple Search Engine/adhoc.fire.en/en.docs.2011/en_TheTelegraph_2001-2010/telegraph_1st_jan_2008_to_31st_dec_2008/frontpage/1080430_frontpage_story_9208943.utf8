          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	New Delhi, April 29: The Empire has struck back.         
	The Centre today slapped measures on the steel industry to curb exports and encourage imports in a bid to bring down domestic prices.        
	The RBI stepped up its offensive by raising the cash reserve ratio by 25 basis points to suck nearly Rs 9,000 crore out of the system. Analysts said banks may marginally raise lending rates for cars and personal loans but home loans between Rs 20 and 30 lakh may become slightly cheaper.         
	The Prime Minister, too, weighed in by telling companies that they have a societal obligation to assist the government in moderating inflationary expectations.        
	A measure of sobriety in corporate lifestyle and compensation can also help cut costs and maintain the price level, Manmohan Singh, who has had a skirmish with the Left over price rise, told a CII meeting.        
	But the heavy hammer was wielded by the finance ministry that had accused the steel industry of behaving like a cartel.         
	The government slapped a 15 per cent export tax on steel, cut import taxes on mild and semi-finished steel to zero and removed a 14 per cent countervailing duty (additional customs duty) on construction bars and structurals.        
	The export levy and the import duty cut have left steel makers seething, though few would comment on record.         
	Bringing down import taxes to zero, Indian steel makers feel, will bring global competition on their shores, while a huge tax on exports will force them to sell the products at home.         
	Prices abroad are said to be 20 to 30 per cent cheaper for local delivery than Indian domestic prices.         
	The state-run SAIL and the Tatas had heeded the call to refrain from increasing prices. But other steel makers had ignored the governments appeal. Steel prices have increased by as much as a quarter since December last.        
	More than a fifth of the current price spiral in India is believed to have been contributed by steel and cement prices.

                                The Famous Five: Julian, Timmy, Dick, Anne and George                            
	London, May 5 (Reuters): British youngsters now have the chance to pen their own Famous Five novel, as one of the countrys best known childrens book series makes its television debut as a cartoon.        
	Almost seven decades after Enid Blyton created the child detectives, publishers of her popular novels announced they were hunting for a modern day version of the author.        
	They said they would give two youngsters the chance to write their own adventure, which will be turned into a limited edition book and audio podcast.        
	It is part of the Disney Channels 21st Century makeover of the characters who are starring in a 26-part cartoon series, titled Famous Five On the Case.        
	It begins screening in Britain for the first time.        
	The lashings of ginger beer and cream buns have gone, replaced with mobile phones, laptops, iPods and pizza, as the five teenagers follow in their parents daring footsteps.         
	As the children of the original heroes Julian, Dick, Anne and George, the new adventurers set about catching fake environmentalists, rather than kidnappers and smugglers  along with Timmy the dog.        
	Executives from Disney and Blytons publisher, Hodder, said they were looking for creativity, originality and success in capturing the spirit of adventure, mystery and friendship epitomised by the Famous Five.        
	We want to inspire a new generation of Famous Five fans and to get them to tap into their creativity, the Disney Channels head of global programming, Steve Aranguren, said in a statement. The publisher of Hodder Childrens books, Margaret Conroy, added: The enduring popularity of the original Famous Five books is testament to the quality of the stories.        
	Critics have long branded her books sexist, racist and overly simplistic, but Blytons stories are still hugely popular, selling more than 10 million copies a year, drawing readers into a bygone world of carefree kids and beastly grown-ups.

                                                                                                           Blame on Lapang for tie-up delay
          E.M. JOSE                               
	Shillong, March 9: As Congress leaders blamed one another for the fractured electoral verdict in Meghalaya, the Nationalist Congress Party-led alliance quietly got its act together for a shot at power.        
	The newly formed Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA), fronted by NCP leader Purno A. Sangma and United Democratic Party chief Donkupar Roy, will most likely parade 31 legislators before the governor tomorrow.         
	All 31 legislators of the MPA will be paraded before the governor tomorrow. We would like the governor to invite us to form the government and prevent the Congress from indulging in horse-trading,a member of the new alliance said.        
	While Sangma made plans to approach the governor, the Congress leadership came under fire from the young Turks.         
	Most of the younger MLAs raised questions about their partys failure to renew the alliance with other regional parties, leaving the field open for the Sangma-led coalition.         
	One Congress MLA admitted that there were differences of opinion among the legislators and party supporters about former chief minister D.D. Lapangs ability to forge an alliance with the regional parties.         
	How long will we wait? Time is running out. Lapang should have contacted the parties in advance, another party MLA said.

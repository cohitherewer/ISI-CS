          HENRY SAMUEL                             Sarkozy and Bruni in Carthage in Tunisia (Reuters)                                  
	Paris, May 21: French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozys next album, in which she sings of her love for husband Nicolas Sarkozy, will be released in July, her agent has revealed.         
	The Italian-born model-turned-singers third album contains her own rendition of Bob Dylans dewy-eyed ballad You Belong To Me, with blatant references to exotic destinations she and the French President visited last year during their lightning romance.         
	See the pyramids along the Nile.... Just remember darling, all the while, you belong to me, she croons in the Dylan song.         
	Egypt was the couples first foreign destination last December, where they were photographed smooching and strolling hand in hand by the edge of the desert sands.         
	The President proposed to her in Egypt on Christmas Day, offering her a pink heart-shaped diamond Dior engagement ring. They were married in Paris on February 2, just three months after their first meeting.         
	See the market place in old Algiers.... Just remember till your dream appears, you belong to me, the Dylan lyrics go on.         
	Commentators suggest this refers to the Presidents trip to Algeria, when he left his fiancee alone back in Paris amid controversy over their public displays of affection.         
	The final line includes the words, Fly the ocean in a silver plane.... Just remember till youre home again.... you belong to me. This is said to be a parallel with Sarkozys frequent overseas trips on the presidential jet.         
	French daily France-Soir, one of the first to hear Carlas version of the track, said: Bruni is an intelligent woman and will be well aware of all the references to her own life and her romance with the President. She is far too clever for this to be a coincidence.         
	Her agent Bertrand de Labbey said 95 per cent of the tracks on the album were either written or chosen before she met the President.         
	Carla, 40, composed the music and wrote the lyrics to most of the songs.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

          RAJ KUMAR                              
	Rahe (Ranchi), Dec. 5: In a first-of-its-kind attack in the state, Maoist guerrillas stabbed five special task force (STF) jawans before shooting them at a village market here this afternoon.        
	Around 2.15pm, the jawans were returning to Rahe outpost of Bundu police station after finishing duty at the State Bank of India branch here, about 6km from the market, when 25-odd rebels  all in plain clothes  ambushed them.         
	According to police, the jawans were stabbed with knives before being shot.        
	The jawans  identified as Bhalku Lakra (26), Pintu Kumar Singh (27), Vinod Kumar Oraon (29), Ranjeet Kerketta (26) and Vishnu Dayal Yadav (29)  had joined the force about four years ago.        
	At least five Maoists were there to take on each jawan, returning from the bank to the outpost on foot. The rebels dragged the jawans to different places in the market, stabbed and shot them before the men in uniform could even react. We are not certain whether the Naxalites used looted Insas rifles from the jawans or brought firearms, senior police superintendent M.S. Bhatia said.        
	Bhatia added that at least one rebel sustained injury during the scuffle with STF jawans. We noticed bloodstains on the path leading to the Rahe river, about 500 metres from the market, which has about 60 shops. It appears that the rebels rescued some of their injured friends from the spot before the police could reach them, he added.        
	Even at 4pm, bloodstains were clearly visible at three places at the Rahe market, about 47km from Ranchi (picture by Prashant Mitra on left). While we recovered bodies of two jawans at one place, bodies of three others were found some metres away from the first spot, one of the police officers said.        
	The police said the villagers were not co-operating in the investigations. None of them were there when the police team reached the spot, about 15km from Bundu. A shop owner at the market did not even hesitate to say that it was not his duty to help the police in the investigation, said Bundu police station inspector Vijay Kumar.        
	Kumar added that Yadav was to go on a five-day leave from tomorrow. The leave had been granted as his wife was seriously ill at his village in Buxar, he said: but he could only perform the duty of a policeman, not a husband.        
	Late in the evening, director-general of police V.D. Ram visited the spot.

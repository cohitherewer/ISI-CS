  - Reunited in Kerala          CITHARA PAUL                             Panchami with her father in Kozhikode                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: Panchami, 16, who got on the wrong train over four years ago that took her all the way to Kerala, has been reunited with her family in an East Midnapore village, thanks to the CPM.        
	The girl had run away from her employers home  it isnt clear where it is located  to escape their torture and taken what she thought was the train home. Her father, Kamal Burman, is a fisherman and mother, Sabitha, a maid in Ilashpur village.        
	Panchami reached Kozhikode instead. (There is, however, no direct train to Kozhikode from Bengal.) Shopkeepers at the station took the lost girl to a government-run juvenile home, where she lived till last year when she turned 16.         
	Since girls over 16 are not allowed in the juvenile home, a former employee, Rafiya, took the teenager with her. Several attempts by the authorities to trace her parents had failed.         
	That is when the CPM stepped in and reported her story in party mouthpieces Desabhimani and Ganashakti. The story was repeated in Apanjan, a pro-CPM daily in Midnapore.        
	Kerala CPM leaders also activated the party machinery in Bengal to trace Panchamis family. The CPMs Bhagawanpur zonal secretary, Gourkanti Bhal, and the DYFI district secretary, Madhusudan Guchayit, then helped trace Kamal.         
	The father, accompanied by Bhal and Guchayit, left for Kerala immediately. Panchami, who had somewhat forgotten her mother tongue, was stunned to see him.         
	The two hugged and wept for a long time. When Panchami was told that her mother, Sabitha, has become mentally unstable after losing her, she cried aloud, said T.K. Biju, a local CPM worker who was there when the father and the daughter met.         
	The CPMs Kozhikode unit arranged a public farewell for Panchami that was attended by the party top brass, including secretariat member and power minister A.K. Balan.        
	Panchami was handed a sum of Rs 30,000 collected by the partys local units.         
	The teenager returned to a warm welcome in Calcutta yesterday. A reception at the Ganashakti office was followed by a visit to the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street. State secretary Biman Bose, who received the father and daughter at Alimuddin Street, promised to help her earn a living.         
	Bose has directed Bhal to arrange a sewing machine for Panchami, who learnt to stitch during her years at the juvenile home. He has also promised the family, not known to be affiliated to the Left, a house.

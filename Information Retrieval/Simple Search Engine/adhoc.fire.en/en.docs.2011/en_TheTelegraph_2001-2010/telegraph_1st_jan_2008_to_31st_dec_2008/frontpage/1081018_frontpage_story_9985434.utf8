	Mumbai, Oct. 17: Both Sachin and the sensex shattered records today: one triggered euphoria, the other despair among investors.        
	The sensex plunged below 10000, falling to its lowest level since June 2006 as fears of a global economic downturn increased, prompting investors to hammer front-line stocks.        
	The index shed 5.7 per cent, or 606 points, to close at 9975.35. The fall snuffed out Rs 1,63,346 crore of paper wealth.        
	The scary ride from irrational exuberance to chilling gloom in just nine months opened up one question: how many more peaks will the sensex topple from before the close of what has been a horrific year for investors?         
	Eleven 1000-point peaks have crumbed since early January  some have fallen within a day, others in less than two months. The prophets of doom predict the sensex could sink below 9000 long before December  and perhaps head lower.        
	The index had opened strong with a gain of nearly 182 points over Thursdays close. But it soon crumbled under the weight of heavy selling by foreign funds. A string of weak second-quarter earnings numbers and a cut in revenue guidance by Satyam Computer Services added to the gloomy outlook. By noon, there were reports that US index futures had fallen, precipitated by a report that new housing construction in America had fallen to its lowest level in 17 years.        
	Reliance Industries  the highest-weighted stock in the sensextumbled over 6 per cent to Rs 1305.25, its lowest level since March 16 last year. Infosys sank 4.8 per cent to a three-year low.        
	The deeper worry for the investors was the wild swing in the index: today, the difference between the index high and the low was over 875 points  the sharpest single-day oscillation this month.         
	Between March and June, the index took 67 days to lose a thousand points; but the past two 1000-point drops have come in just three and five trading sessions, respectively.

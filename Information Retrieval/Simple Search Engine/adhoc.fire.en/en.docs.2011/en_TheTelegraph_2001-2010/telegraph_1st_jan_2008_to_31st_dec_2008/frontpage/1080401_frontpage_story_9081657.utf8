          OUR BUREAU                                              
	March 31: Basant Kumar Birla, the patriarch of one of the most well-known business families of the country, is out of the running in the legal battle to decide the fate of the empire of the late M.P. Birla.        
	The Supreme Court today held that B.K. Birla, K.K. Birla and Yashovardhan Birla have no right to contest the 1999 will of the late Priyamvada Birla, MPs wife, which made Rajendra Singh Lodha the beneficiary of Rs 5,000-crore assets, including Birla Corporation.         
	The court decision sets the stage for the real battle: hearings can now begin on the probate petition, the principal case to decide the status of the will, filed by Lodha in Calcutta High Court in July 2004. Probate proceedings are held to authenticate and execute a will.         
	The Supreme Court has essentially upheld an earlier decision of the high court but the ruling marks a milestone in the war of the will that has captivated Indias business community.         
	The battle ahead will be bereft of a direct role for the patriarch. Although the Lodhas have been saying BKs confidants were behind a raft of petitions filed against them, this was the sole case to which the elder had lent his name.        
	The Supreme Court took note of the tortuous route of the case, slapping costs (fine) of Rs 2.5 lakh each on the Birlas. The court noted with concern the tendency of both sides to oppose each and every application filed by the other and then blame each other for the delay in disposal of the case.        
	The court, however, admitted that MPs sisters and G.P. Birla could take part in the probate proceedings of the 1999 will, according to which MPs assets will pass on to Lodha.        
	The Lodha camp was ecstatic. It is a landmark judgment, Debanjan Mandal, the counsel for Lodha, said in Calcutta.        
	The Birlas conceded it was a setback that BK, who owns companies like Kesoram Industries and Century Textiles, was out of the case. But they found solace in the fact that the hearings on the 1999 probate petition would start first.         
	Three wills are in contention. Two mutual wills of 1982 attributed to MP and Priyamvada promised the assets to charities. GP was one of the executors of Priyamvadas will of 1982. The third will of 1999, purportedly that of Priyamvada, made Lodha, the chartered accountant, the custodian of the assets. Lodha was also appointed the sole executor.        
	The court has upheld Lodhas caveat in the probate proceedings of one of the 1982 mutual wills and allowed his petition challenging the appointment of Yashovardhan Birla as executor of MPs mutual will.        
	The real battle will now begin, Nand Gopal Khaitan, the counsel for the Birlas, said, adding that it was only a peripheral matter who could contest the will.        
	The court has asked the Birlas to deposit the cost within a month with the member-secretary of the West Bengal Legal Services Authority. Khaitan accepted that it was a loss of face. The court may have done this because we filed a petition at the division bench of the high court and then to the apex court, he said.        
	The Supreme Court has directed the high court to take up probate proceedings as expeditiously as possible. Legal experts said the hearing on the 1999 will would be followed by that on the 1982 mutual wills, but there would be a common judgment.

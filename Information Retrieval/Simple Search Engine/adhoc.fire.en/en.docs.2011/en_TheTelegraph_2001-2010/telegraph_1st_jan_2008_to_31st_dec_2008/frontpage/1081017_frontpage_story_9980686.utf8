          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 16: Ratan Tata has warned Bengal of the consequences of letting history repeat itself and asked a series of searing questions in an open letter explaining why he was compelled to withdraw the Nano project from the state.        
	The people of West Bengal  particularly the younger citizens  will need to express their views and aspirations as to what they would like to see West Bengal become in the years ahead. Would they like to support the present government of Mr. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to build a prosperous state with the rule of law, modern infrastructure and industrial growth, supporting a harmonious investment in the agricultural sector to give the people in the state a better life?        
	Or would they like to see the state consumed by a destructive political environment of confrontation, agitation, violence and lawlessness? Do they want education and jobs in the industrial and high-tech sectors or does the future generation see their future prosperity achieved on a stay-as-we-are basis? Tata asked in the open letter to the citizens of West Bengal.        
	An environment of politically motivated agitation and hostility compelled Tata Motors to withdraw the Nano project, he added.        
	Tata wrote the letter in response to statements by vested interests that the pullout decision was hasty and politically motivated.        
	In the letter, Tata named Mamata Banerjee and referred to confrontative actions taken by the Trinamul Congress and supported by vested interests and certain political parties that disrupted work at the plant.        
	Tata praised the Bengal government, saying all our interactions with the chief minister and the industries minister in particular, as also with several other officers, have been exemplary.        
	Trinamul has been claiming that the Tata pullout was a game plan to malign the party. A section of the CPM had described the Tata withdrawal as unreasonable  a view articulated by party mouthpiece Peoples Democracy.        
	However, Tata said the final and painful decision to move the project out had not been taken in haste but with great regret after a great deal of deliberation.        
	Tata reminded Bengal of the situation 30 years ago. Agitation and violence drove away many industries around 30 years ago, and it has only been in recent times that the present government has been able to rebuild the confidence of investors to invest in the state.        
	Tata added: It is therefore ironic that, at this crucial time and moment of hope for the state, history appears to be repeating itself. Agitation, violence and terror are overtaking the state in the name of the agricultural community, to serve political goals  stalling progress and destroying the new-found confidence in the state, while doing nothing for the rural poor, other than making promises.

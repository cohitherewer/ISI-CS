     NISHIT DHOLABHAI 
                        
	New Delhi, March 3: Delhi today tried to silence those questioning the seriousness of its response to Chinas claims on Arunachal Pradesh with another statement in Parliament about that state being an integral part of India.
    
	Honourable members are aware that Chinese officials have expressed regret at the Prime Ministers visit to Arunachal Pradesh in end January. The fact that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India has been clearly conveyed to the Chinese side by the government, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said in a suo motu statement in the Lok Sabha. 
    
	The content of the statement was not much different from the ministers reply to a question in the Lok Sabha last week. But the tone today was more assertive, possibly in response to criticism that the government was handling China with kid gloves. 
    
	Mukherjee said China illegally claims approximately 90,000 square km of Indian territory, including Tawang in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. 
    
	The Opposition has been haranguing the government for reacting only to media reports on the informal Chinese protest that followed Singhs visit to Arunachal Pradesh. Even in 2006, the general impression was that the government made a statement against Chinas claim to parts of Arunachal Pradesh under pressure from the Opposition. 
    
	BJP president Rajnath Singh conceded that the tone and tenor of the governments statements had changed, but said this is not enough.
    
	He was even less appreciative of the governments response when it came up for discussion in the Rajya Sabha earlier in the day.
    
	The BJP chief said not only did the Prime Minister not cancel his visit to Beijing in January; the government did not bother to say it was unfriendly of China to eye parts of Arunachal Pradesh.
    
	The MP from Arunachal Pradesh (East), Tapir Gao, said it took visits to China by the Prime Minister, the external affairs minister and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi for the government to realise how serious the Chinese were about Arunachal Pradesh. They had not taken it so seriously earlier. 
    
	Mukherjees eight-page statement today began by describing Delhis relationship with Beijing. He said the Prime Minister visited Aruna-chal Pradesh to assure residents that the government was aware of their needs and ready to assist them through a series of projects. 
          
	Gao said the Prime Minister should make a statement on this in Parliament. 
    
	Mukherjee is scheduled to visit China later this year. His Chinese counterpart will make a trip to New Delhi.

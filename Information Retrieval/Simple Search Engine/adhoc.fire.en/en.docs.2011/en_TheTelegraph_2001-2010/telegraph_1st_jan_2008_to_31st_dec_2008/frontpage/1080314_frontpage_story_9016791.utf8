          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, March 13: The Darjeeling district police chief has showcaused the inspector-in-charge of Darjeeling Sadar police station, N.T. Sherpa, for raiding the houses of retired DGHC officers without search warrants to retrieve official files in their possession.        
	Police had already made an inventory of the files seized on Tuesday. On that day, the supporters of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters were demonstrating outside the houses of Tshering Bhutia, Tika Khati, Tshering Wangchuk and M.N. Pradhan, accusing them of removing the files on the sly. The law enforcers initially arrived to control the law and order situation.         
	Suddenly, Morcha supporters started demanding that the houses be searched. Without any warrant, the police conducted raids and seized 200 files, a source said. The Morcha later lodged a complaint with the Sadar police station, alleging that files had been removed from DGHC offices.        
	It is mandatory to have a court order to conduct a search or seize articles, a senior police official said. As for taking home official files, it depends upon the administrative capacity of the person concerned.        
	I have showcaused the inspector and asked him to explain under what circumstances he had searched the residences and seized the files, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of Darjeeling police, today. He will also have to explain the role his subordinates had played.         
	Rajesh Pandey, the district magistrate of Darjeeling, who is now the principal secretary of DGHC, said the police had been instructed to hand over the seized documents to the council authority. There had been no instruction from our side to the police to retrieve the files, he added.         
	B.L. Meena, the divisional commissioner of Jalpaiguri as well as the caretaker administrator of the council, said an inquiry would be conducted to find out whether the files had been misplaced or not. I expect a detailed briefing tomorrow. Only then can I speak on the alleged misappropriation of funds.        
	The Morcha has alleged that the files were taken home since they would shed light on the misappropriation of funds.         
	I.N. Pradhan, the Kurseong branch president of the GNLF, said: We have no problem with the police conducting a search according to the rules. But how could they allow the Morcha cadres to direct the process?

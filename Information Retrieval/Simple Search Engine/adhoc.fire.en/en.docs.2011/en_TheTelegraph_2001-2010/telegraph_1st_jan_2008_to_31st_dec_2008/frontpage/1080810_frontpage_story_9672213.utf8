          OUR BUREAU                                        Prasun Adhikary (top), Rajiv Mehra. (Swarup Mondal)                                  
	Midnapore/Calcutta, Aug. 9: The producers and crew of a reality show to be hosted by actor Prosenjit allegedly threw a hotel employee off the roof last night in Midnapore town where they were to shoot an episode today.        
	Hotel Ritz Bengals manager said kitchen supervisor Prasun Adhikary, 27, was attacked around 1.30am after staff objected to the guests drinking bout and rowdy behaviour on the terrace of the four-storey building.        
	Adhikary has suffered head injuries, multiple brain haemorrhage and leg fractures, a doctor said at Calcuttas SSKM Hospital where he is admitted. He is unconscious and critical.        
	Midnapore police today arrested Gautam Jain and Rajiv Mehra  whose company Grandiose produces the talent hunt Lux Fatafati Filmy Fight or F3  and unit member Somnath Roy Chowdhury on the charge of attempted murder. They are looking for a woman unit hand who is in hiding.        
	The crew and contestants had arrived from Calcutta yesterday and checked into hotels in Midnapore. About 60 were staying at Ritz Bengal. Todays shooting, scheduled at the Midnapore Sports Complex, was cancelled and the entire group returned to Calcutta.        
	F3, whose two winners will act in a film produced by Rose Valley, which owns Ritz Bengal, was scheduled to go on air from August 14.        
	Prosenjit, who is to mark his TV debut with F3, was in Midnapore last night but at a different location. Its too early to say what will happen to the show; I will sit with the television channel, he said.        
	Hotel manager Rajen Chatterjee said he had gone to the terrace hearing drunken shouting by men and women. Prasun and a few other employees were quarrelling with some 15 unit members. A scuffle broke out and Prasun was pushed towards the parapet. When we tried to rescue him, other unit members began beating us. One man lifted Prasun by his legs and he was thrown off the roof.        
	Dipankar De, regional manager of Rose Valley, lodged an FIR against four persons. The three arrested men have been remanded in five days police custody.        
	We are interrogating them and searching for the woman, West Midnapore police chief Rajesh Singh said.        
	Actress Sudipta Chakraborty, creative director of F3, said the charges were false. A drunken hotel employee had tried to enter a room where some girl contestants were staying, said Chakraborty, who was in Calcutta last night.        
	The girls panicked and alerted those at Hotel Hindustan. Jain and Mehra rushed to the spot and were attacked by hotel staff. The girls said the man fell while trying to escape by climbing down the pipes.

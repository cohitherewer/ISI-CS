	Calcutta, June 21: Sitting for Madhyamik next year? Dont forget to brush up on what you learnt in Class IX, too.        
	The Bengal government has shelved plans to test candidates only on the Class X syllabus from Madhyamik 2009 after teacher bodies, mainly the CPM-dominated ABTA, and academics warned it could affect standards.        
	The exam now covers whatever is taught in Classes IX and X, and the bifurcation  like in ICSE and CBSE board tests where students are assessed on the Class X syllabus  was aimed at reducing stress.        
	The 2009 Madhyamik examinations will cover the topics taught in both Classes IX and X. There is also no instruction from the government so far regarding implementing the proposed bifurcation in 2010, said Swapan Sarkar, secretary, West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.        
	Sources said academics had pointed out at a meeting that the Madhyamik syllabus was compact and bifurcation would encourage students to neglect what is taught in Class IX, which could lead to a fall in standards, particularly among rural students.        
	We are opposed to the proposal to bifurcate the syllabus because the course has been designed in that way, said senior ABTA member Aparesh Bhattacharya. We will never allow this to happen, as having the exams based on the syllabus of the two classes makes it composite.        
	Sources said the CPM-led government, which had announced early this year that it was working on a plan to bifurcate the Madhyamik course as it has done with the higher secondary syllabus, had been thinking of bringing in parity with other Class X board exams.        
	But a senior CPM academic who attended the meeting said the Madhyamik syllabus could not be compared with that of the CBSE and ICSE.        
	CBSE and ICSE schools mostly cater to students from middle-class and upper-middle class families. But there are a large number of schools under the Madhyamik board, particularly in remote rural belts, where most students are first-generation learners, the academic added.        
	Students in these areas may not understand that the aim of the bifurcation is to ease exam stress and, instead, somehow manage a promotion to Class X. This might have an impact on their performance in Madhyamik as well.        
	Veteran academic Sunanda Sanyal, too, said Madhyamik should cover both classes. There is continuity between what is taught in Class IX and in Class X. So the final assessment should be on what is taught in the two classes.        
	Amal Mukherjee, former principal, Presidency College, said a childs academic foundation began with school education and any attempt to make the school education system easier should be discouraged.

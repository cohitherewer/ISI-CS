	Calcutta, Jan. 13: Trader Tej Kiran Baid collapsed on his terrace and died a few hours later on Sunday, unable to bear the sight of a lifetime of toil going up in flames.
    
	Baid, 50, suffered a heart attack on Saturday after he saw flames leaping out of the eighth floor of the Nandaram market complex. One of the godowns on the floor belonged to the clothes trader, who was watching the fire from his home 200 metres away.
    
	He was taken to a hospital in Salt Lake, where he was declared dead on Sunday morning. 
    
	Baid had two other godowns and a shop, Dilip Textiles, in the same building. The family did not want him to see the flames. But he was so insistent that they had to relent around 8pm on Saturday. He went to the terrace, saw the eighth floor in flames and collapsed, said Mukesh Karnawat, Baids neighbour for 20 years. 
    
	Baid regained consciousness after a while and had his dinner but did not speak to anyone. Later, he complained of restlessness and was moved to the hospital.
    
	Baidji was a self-made man who began life in Calcutta as a labourer. He could not bear the sight of the devastation, said Karnawat, whose shop was also damaged in the fire.
    
	The extent of the damage is still not clear but a relative of Baid said the three godowns had stocks valued at Rs 35 lakh. The relative said he did not think the goods were insured.
    
	Baid, who came to Calcutta 35 years ago from Churu district of Rajasthan, is survived by wife Manju and three children  two sons and a daughter. 
    
	The eldest, Dilip, 23, had recently joined his fathers business after graduation while the youngest, Chirag, 17, is a student of Class XI.
    
	Daughter Deepika, 19, a commerce student in Bhowanipore Gujarati Education Society College, has fallen ill since the fire broke out.
    
	A lot of Baidjis business transactions were done on credit. His sons do not even know who owed their father money, said Om Prakash Mishra, a family friend.

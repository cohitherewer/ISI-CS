	New Delhi, Aug. 14: Manmohan Singh has liberated central government employees from a four-figure bondage on the eve of Independence Day.        
	The lowest gross monthly salary for central staff will be at least Rs 10,000, according to a pay package tweaked by the cabinet tonight that promised hikes ranging from 12 to 21 per cent a year.        
	The proposals, based on the Sixth Pay Commission report, will kick in with retrospective effect from January 1, 2006, and are expected to benefit 5 million civil servants and soldiers. The arrears will be paid in two instalments in the ratio of 40 and 60 per cent over the next two years. The first instalment is likely to be paid in October to coincide with the festive season.         
	With elections not too far away and the economic landscape scarred by price rise, the Prime Minister and his colleagues have put a few layers of icing on the cake baked by the pay commission in May. (See chart)        
	The commissions recommendations would have raised the governments annual expenditure on salaries by Rs 12,561 crore. The cabinets changes will push that amount up to Rs 17,798 crore  which means the fresh dose of benevolence will cost Rs 5,237 crore a year over and above that proposed by the pay commission.        
	A segment that has benefited the most because of the cabinets intervention is employees on the lower rungs. The pay increases, taken together with changes in allowances, at the bottom of the ladder translate into handsome hikes. The junior-most peon will now earn more than Rs 10,000 as gross monthly pay, said expenditure secretary Sushma Nath.        
	Had the government stuck to the commissions recommendations, the lowest salary would have been a little less than Rs 9,000. The raise may not mean much in the season of high inflation but it does take the pay to five figures  a status symbol that fell off the pedestal when salaries boomed in the private sector.         
	The salary for the top bureaucrat in the country  the cabinet secretary  at Rs 90,000 a month (besides allowances and perks) is still far lower than what the corporate sector pays its chief executives.        
	Junior employees, numbering nearly a million, and soldiers were the most vocal in demanding more after the pay panel submitted its recommendations, forcing the government to set up another panel to finetune the proposals.        
	The junior employees, who wanted a 40 per cent hike, have expressed dissatisfaction with the revised pay, while the defence forces are still assessing the impact.        
	In the revised package, some ranks such as colonels and brigadiers in the army, directors in the civil service and deputy inspectors general in police who were in a lower pay band have been pushed into a higher segment. The Centre also increased the rank pays of middle-level defence officers.        
	The fitment rate, which helps in arriving at higher allowances in view of the merger of 50 per cent DA with basic pay, will be 40 per cent, instead of the 28 per cent recommended by the pay commission, according to PTI.        
	Existing pensioners will have their new pension fixed at half the starting salary of the rank at which they retired, besides the dearness allowances they are entitled to.

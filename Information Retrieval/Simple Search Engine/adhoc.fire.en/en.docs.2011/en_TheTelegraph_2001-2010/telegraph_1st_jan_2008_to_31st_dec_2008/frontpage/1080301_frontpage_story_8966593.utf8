          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                Bonus point      
	New Delhi, Feb 29: If you held off buying a car until the budget, take a bow. The price of small cars and two-wheelers will go down after finance minister P. Chidambaram cut excise duty on both, to 12 per cent from 16 per cent earlier.        
	Maruti Suzuki will cut prices of the Maruti 800 by Rs 6,500 while the Swift Diesel will go down by Rs 18,000.        
	Hyundai Motors India (HMI) also said it would reduce prices and pass on the benefit to the consumers.         
	The price cut will range between Rs 8,730 for its flagship model Santro and Rs 19,419 for the Getz Prime, said Arvind Saxena, senior vice-president, sales and marketing, HMI.        
	The duty on buses and their chassis will also come down to 12 per cent from the current rate of 16 per cent.        
	In the case of hybrid cars, the duty will be lowered to 14 per cent from the current 24 per cent.         
	S. Nakanishi, managing director and CEO of Maruti Suzuki India, said, In the short term, the reduction in excise duty will make small cars more attractive for customers and offset the negative impact of higher interest rates.        
	This is an encouragement for companies like us, which are making major investments in capacity, research and exports, he added.        
	Tata Motors said it would reduce the prices of its small cars and commercial vehicles including buses, bus chassis and bus bodies.         
	The new applicable prices will be announced in the next few days, after the company has studied the details of the policy changes, said the company in an official release.         
	Other car makers such as Daimler Chrysler India and Porsche India were peeved that the budget was so heavily biased in favour of small cars.         
	We expected the budget to be more progressive in terms of a decrease in import duty on luxury and high end cars, while maintaining stability in tariffs, said Ashish Chordia, CEO of Porsche India.        
	Companies such as Honda Siel Cars India are also feeling the pinch and feel a 10 per cent excise cut on hybrid cars will not make much difference.        
	The proposals made by the finance minister will create a further gap between small and big car segments. This will further skew the market, said Jnaneswar Sen, senior general manager, Honda Siel Cars India.        
	The two-wheeler sector, too, had reasons to cheer but some said availability of finance is a concern.        
	Atul Gupta, vice-president of Suzuki Motorcycle India, said, It has been a very good budget for the auto sector, but is unexpected to stop de-growth. Finance availability is also a major issue.        
	Hero Honda managing director Pawan Munjal said his company would cut prices between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,400.

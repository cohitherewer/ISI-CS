  - Highway crash kills six Indians driving to the falls                                      
	West Springfield, Pennsylvania, May 11 (AP): Six Indians on their way to see the Niagara Falls were killed when their van spun out of control and was hit by an oncoming car on a Pennsylvania highway, police said today.         
	Four of those killed worked at the Michigan-based Syntel Inc, an information technology company in Troy.         
	The two others were spouses of two employees, company spokesman Jonathan James said today.        
	The van had just crossed the Pennsylvania-Ohio border last afternoon when it crossed the highway median and began flipping and rolling, coming to rest on its roof, authorities said.        
	It was then struck by a west-bound car, whose driver was treated in a hospital and released last night, said state police official Kevin Havern.        
	The driver of the van, Kaushik Deb, 26, of Troy, Michigan, in suburban Detroit died on impact. The others who were killed were identified as Manoj Jharia, 35, and wife Mili, 28; Nitin Agarwal, 29, and wife Swati, 25; and Shubham Choudory, 24.         
	The sole survivor in the van, Nitin Gupta, 28, was sitting in the front passenger seat, Havern said. He was also treated and released from a hospital yesterday.        
	State police said they had not determined what caused the accident.        
	Syntel has 27 offices and 12,000 employees worldwide. The 27-year-old company also has offices in Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune.

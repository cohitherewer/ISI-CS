          CHRIS IRVINE                            French President Nicolas Sarkozy, 53, whose romance and subsequent marriage with Carla Bruni (left) created ripples worldwide                                  
	London, Oct. 14: Men are most romantic aged 53, showing experience beats youth when it comes to showering your partner with love.         
	More than three quarters of those aged 51 to 55 believe saying I love you every day is the most romantic gesture of all, a poll of 2,000 men aged 18 to 65 found.        
	The research showed the majority of men do not embrace romance until they are well into their fifties, despite dating from their early teens.        
	Men in their fifties are also more likely to appreciate a bit of romance in their lives and tend to surprise their wives or partners more often than their younger counterparts.        
	The survey, conducted by Warner Leisure Hotels, found a third have recently surprised their partner with champagne on ice, while more than one in four have written their partner a poem. Almost half will surprise women with flowers, chocolate and perfume, compared to only 24 per cent of men aged 25.        
	Other surprises include grand gestures such as organising romantic weekends away or pampering days.         
	Jim Forward, of Warner Leisure Hotels, said: By the time a man reaches his fifties he has a wealth of experience under his belt, and will be wiser about the things which please a woman.         
	He will have endured countless arguments with his partner, made hundreds of mistakes and blundered his way through the early years of his relationship.         
	When a man reaches the grand old age of 53, he will be wiser about what works for his partner, and will be more likely to make an effort.         
	Of the 20 to 25-year-olds, only one in four said they had recently treated their loved one to a candellit dinner, compared to almost half of the over 50s.        
	Forward added: Another major difference with the empty nesters generation is that many will have children who have flown the nest and their partner is the only person they come home to at night.         
	This means couples have more time to spoil each other, more freedom to enjoy weekends away and more privacy to enjoy each others company.

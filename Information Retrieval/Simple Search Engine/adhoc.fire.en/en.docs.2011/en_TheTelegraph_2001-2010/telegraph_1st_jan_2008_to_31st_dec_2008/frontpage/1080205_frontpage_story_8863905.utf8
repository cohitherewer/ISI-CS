        Real failure 
   
	Paris, Feb. 4 (Reuters): President Nicholas Sarkozy might have just got re-married, but his love affair with the French electorate appears well and truly over.
 
	An opinion poll published today said Sarkozys popularity rating plunged 13 points in January to 41 per cent on the back of widespread voter discontent over the Presidents handling of the economy and the rising cost of living.
 
	It is a slump of rare proportions, independent pollsters LH2 said in a commentary on their survey. The poll was published just two days after Sarkozy married his girlfriend Carla Bruni, a supermodel-turned-popstar who had been dating the President for three months.
 
	The French and Sarkozy ... Divorce, Left-wing daily Liberation said in a front page headline, commenting on the monthly poll, carried out on February 1 and 2 among 1,300 people. LH2 said Sarkozys high-profile romance with Bruni, which was played out across the French press, was poorly perceived by voters who thought his celebrity-drenched private life had dented the dignity of his office. He is vulgar and rude.

          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 21: The anti-Posco protest returned last evening after a brief lull of a few weeks.        
	The protesters, under the banner of Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, blocked the arterial Dhinkia-Govindpur road linking Posco project area to the rest of the state since 10pm alleging bomb hurling by supporters of the steel plant project.        
	Although the protesters claimed to have detained two police officers throughout the night, Jagatsinghpur superintendent of police R.K. Sharma said they had not been held back but negotiated with the protesters so that the blockade could be lifted soon.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who returned from Delhi today, said: My government believes in peaceful industrialisation. We have brought out a liberal rehabilitation policy and we will have a dialogue with the displaced.        
	Abhay Sahu, president of the samiti, said: The anti-plant protesters detained additional superintendent of police Jitendra Patra and Kujang police station inspector-in-charge Anil Mishra all through the night at Govindpur village. They were released today only after the police were withdrawn from the village.        
	Sahu said villagers of Govindpur, 130km from Bhubaneswar, had taken out rallies last evening and burnt copies of the rehabilitation package announced by Posco. When samiti members Subhakanta Dash and Gunia Rout were on way to attend a meeting, some plant supporters hurled bombs injuring the two, alleged Sahu.        
	The anti-Posco group then detained a youth, Manindra Rout, at Patna village and beat him up severely, alleged plant supporters. On the other hand, the plant supporters adducted a youth, Kalia, from Balitutha area, alleged the protesters.        
	 Patra and Mishra rushed to the spot to avert an imminent clash and rescue the abducted youths from both the sides, Mishra later said.        
	The villagers lifted the road blockade after they were assured of action. We told them that action would be taken if they lodged an FIR, said Sharma. However, no one was arrested so far.

	New Delhi, May 3: The Centre is set to table the womens reservation bill next week and will hold a cabinet meeting on Monday to clear the decks, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said today.        
	Cabinet meetings are usually held on Thursdays and it is rare for one to be held on any other day of the week. Congress sources hinted a nudge may have come from Sonia Gandhi to get the long-stalled bill introduced before the budget session ends on May 9.        
	It is not clear if the Congress has its allies consent on the bill, which reserves a third of Parliament and state legislature seats for women and had nearly brought Mamata Banerjee and Samajwadi Party MP Daroga Prasad Saroj to blows in the House 10 years ago.        
	Pro-Other Backward Classes (OBC) groups such as the RJD, DMK and the Samajwadi Party have for years stalled the legislation, which is officially backed by the Congress, BJP and the Left.        
	A team of women Congress MPs and All India Mahila Congress Morcha officials, led by Morcha president Pratibha Thakur and AICC general secretary Mohsina Kidwai, had met Sonia last Monday to push for the bill and found her response very positive.        
	According to Morcha general secretary Kamalakshmi Sharma, Sonias reaction had encouraged them to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and urge him to get the bill tabled by May 9.        
	Junior parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Kumar Bansal said the bill was likely to go to a House committee after being tabled, since there wasnt enough time left for a discussion in the budget session.        
	It will go before the parliamentary standing committee in the interim period between (the budget and monsoon) sessions. If the committee passes it, it can be taken up for discussion and further action in the monsoon session, he said.        
	The Centre may need to keep up pressure on the House panel so that it doesnt sit on the bill.        
	The NDA government had tabled the bill in December 1998 but resistance from the regional parties  and from lobbies within the national parties  led to it being sent to a standing committee, where it lapsed.        
	The UPA government had come close to introducing it in Parliament in end-2006 but Lalu Prasad buckled before his RJD colleagues pressure at the last minute.        
	Apparently frustrated at the delay, the BJP recently endorsed the Election Commissions compromise formula: reserve 33 per cent of poll tickets instead of House seats for women. The catch is, the women are likely to get the un-winnable seats.        
	Another suggestion was to increase national and state legislature seats so the men do not lose out, but it meant a logistical nightmare apart from a delimitation exercise.

 - Militant stronghold in Manipur falls after a decade
    OUR CORRESPONDENT
                     
	Imphal, Jan. 15: A part of free India that was controlled by militants for more than a decade and fully liberated by the army only last week is beginning to discover all that it had missed. 
    
	Brig. Raymond Noronha, who commandeered the armys final assault on the headquarters of the United National Liberation Front (UNLF) in the Somtal region of Manipur on January 10, told a media team visiting the area yesterday that the next big challenge was to restore the civil administration.
    
	The villagers who had fled started returning home after we busted the UNLF headquarters at New Lajang. They now want the civil administration to take over quickly, the army officer said.
    
	The army intends to set up base permanently in Somtal, located along the Indo-Myanmar border in Chandel district, to ensure that the militants do not come back. We are providing relief materials to the villagers, but much more needs to be done, Brig. Noronha said.
    
	The UNLF, on the other hand, is already planning to wrest control of the area for the second time. It claimed this week that Operation Somtal was only partially successful.
    
	The militant group took over the area after forcing the withdrawal of a Border Security Force post and a police station in the nineties. 
    
	The army admits that it still needs to find all the improvised explosive devices planted there by the militants. 
    
	The army began its offensive against the UNLF to liberate nearly 1,000 square km of Somtal in December 2006. But it was not until November 18 last year that troops managed to make inroads into the headquarters of the militant group.
    
	Brig. Noronha said the happiness on the faces of the villagers was worth all the trouble the army took. The local population celebrated Christmas in a free atmosphere after a decade. Our operation broke the stranglehold of militants in the area.
    
	The army gunned down 14 militants and defused nearly 200 IEDs planted by the rebels during the final assault. Five camps were busted and 19 villages liberated. 
    
	Troops also opened the 200-km New Somtal Road that links the region with the Imphal-Moreh route. The flushout operation did displace a large number of villagers, but most of those who fled during the fighting have returned in batches.
    
	Hundreds of villagers were in Myanmar when the army was fighting the militants. 
    
	All 200 families of our village had fled to Myanmar. One-third of the villagers have come back and the rest will be returning soon, the village chief of New Somtal, Chumkhoyang Haokip, said.
    
	Villagers have started returning to Old Somtal and its neighbouring villages. 
    
	Haokip said residents of the Somtal region wanted a civil administration to take over without delay. We want a police station, a healthcare centre and government schools.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 7: Shodashi Mahotsav, a special programme observed in memory of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati, was performed at Chakapada in Kandhamal, some 270km from Bhubaneswar, amid unprecedented security.         
	The 84-year-old swamiji was gunned down at a Jalespeta ashram in Tumudibandh in Kandhamal on the night of August 23, with four of his associates. Chakapada was the swamijis workplace, where he had set up an ashram 40 years ago. There, the seer was given a bhu samadhi or a burial on August 25.         
	According to rituals, sadhus are buried and not cremated unlike other Hindus, and on the 16th day of their death a Shodashi Mahotsav is held.         
	Though a supposed kalash yatra proposed by VHP secretary-general Praveen Togadia on the occasion was banned by the district administration according to an assurance made by the state government to the Supreme court, the Shodashi Mahotsav was allowed to be performed amid tight security today. Kandhamal was declared a no-entry zone, with all its six entry points being sealed to prevent mischief makers from entering the violence-hit district during the special programme, said superintendent of police Praveen Kumar.         
	Even forest roads connecting Chakapada with neighbouring districts of Gajapati, Rayagada, Ganjam, Nayagarh and Kalahandi were blocked, the police sources said.         
	As many as five companies of CRPF, two companies of Rapid Action Force and 30 platoons of the Orissa State Armed Force were deployed in the district.         
	No vehicles or groups were allowed to enter the district and travel near the ashram. Those who attended the ceremony had to walk down kilometres to reach the venue.         
	A days curfew continued in Tikabali, Baliguda and K-Nuagaon as a precautionary measure, while in six other places it was relaxed during the day, said Praveen Kumar.         
	District collector Krishna Kumar, SP Praveen Kumar and senior officers camped at Chakapada to keep a strict vigil on the situation.         
	Revenue divisional commissioner (southern division) Satyabrata Sahu, who visited the venue in the morning told The Telegraph: The situation is peaceful and under control. No untoward incidents were reported.         
	Thanking the people for their co-operation, Sahu said the administration was contemplating to relax the curfew during the day.         
	He added that adequate security had been taken to protect life and property of people of Kandhamal according to a Supreme Court directive.         
	More than 1,000 sadhus, followers of the slain seer and activists of VHP, RSS and Sangh Parivar, including VHP national-general secretary Ashok Tiwari, participated in the mahotsav.         
	Sixteen Shivlingas were installed near the swamijis burial amid special prayers, sankirtan, shlokas and yagna. However, hundreds of sadhus and followers could not reach Chakapapada and had to return disappointed as vehicles and groups were not allowed.

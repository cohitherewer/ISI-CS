          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dibrugarh, June 27: Thousands of people gathered at Chapakhowa in Tinsukia district under the banner of the Nirjatan Birodhi Aikya Mancha today to welcome Ulfas unilateral ceasefire.         
	They called on Delhi and Dispur as well as top Ulfa leaders to respond positively to the peace initiative set in motion by the leadership of the Alpha and Charlie companies of the outfits 28 battalion.         
	The rally comes a day after the leaders of the two companies spelt out their reasons for declaring the ceasefire and their plans for the future.         
	The meeting at Chapakhowa open stage (mukoli mancha) was presided over by Tankeswar Baruah, president of the forum. The meeting comes a day after the two companies of Ulfas 28 battalion, which had already declared an unilateral truce, appealed to various sections to respond positively to their initiative.         
	A procession was also taken out from the meeting venue during which there was an overwhelming response from various organisations and people from different sections of society.         
	The meeting also adopted two resolutions. The first called on the Ulfa leadership as well as the other battalions of the outfit to come forward and respond positively to the peace initiative. The second was to hold a series of meetings across the state to garner support for permanent peace.         
	We have seen enough of insurgency and bloodshed. Now we want to see life and development, said Pabitra Borsaikia, a retired schoolteacher who had assembled for the meeting.         
	With todays meeting and procession we have begun a new journey. We are hopeful of getting overwhelming response from the whole state. This is only the beginning, the president of the forum said.         
	Significantly, there was also a sizeable number of people from the Hindi-speaking community in todays meeting and procession.         
	The community had been a prime target of the outfit in the past. The Ulfa leaders believed that by killing people from the Hindi-speaking community they could deliver a strong message to Delhi to accede to their demands.         
	We have been witness to the killing of the members of our community in the attacks by Ulfa. We have always been made the scapegoat in the battle between the outfit and security forces or the government. For us it is really a very good development and that is why we have come up to support this peace initiative, said Dinesh Shah, a small grocery shop owner.        
	PCG cancels meet        
	The Ulfa-constituted PCG has cancelled its public meeting scheduled for Saturday. It will now hold an internal meeting on Saturday before deciding on the date of the public meeting.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, May 30: A lieutenant colonels wife was run over by a lorry as she returned home after seeing her husband and elder son off at the airport today.        
	Jeeta Devi Singh, 40, lay with her head crushed on A.J.C. Bose Road near the race course around 3pm, yards from her home in Turf View, where younger son Nikhil, 16, waited impatiently for her.        
	Husband A.N. Singh and elder son Neeraj learnt the news after getting off their plane at 4pm in Imphal, their hometown. They had gone there to get Neeraj, who has just passed his Class XII exams, admitted to a college, said a neighbour, Col Michael Mathews. Father and son are expected back tomorrow.        
	Younger son Nikhil, who passed his Class X exams this year, made a call to his mothers mobile, which we found in her handbag, around 4.15pm, an officer of Hastings police station said. We asked him to turn up at the hospital.        
	Four-and-a-half hours later, the teen was handed over his mothers body after a post-mortem.        
	Officers said Jeeta Devi had possibly gone to her computer classes from the airport and then probably taken a cab home. She had just got off the taxi when the lorry came speeding from the Vidyasagar Setu end.        
	One of the wheels went over her head, an officer said. No one saw her reach the spot. We found some books containing computer lessons in her handbag.        
	As Jeeta Devi, who wore a pair of blue jeans and a white top, lay blood-splattered, traffic constable Dipak Das arrived at the spot and took her in a cab to SSKM Hospital, where she was declared dead.        
	The Singhs have been living at Turf View for the past two years since Lt Col Singh arrived in Calcutta on study leave to do a course in management.        
	Jeeta Devi was a jovial and popular neighbour who loved to socialise, Turf View residents said.        
	The lorry driver abandoned the vehicle at the Bakery Road-St Georges Road crossing, where police found it and towed it to Hastings police station. A case of rash driving has been lodged and a hunt is on for the driver.

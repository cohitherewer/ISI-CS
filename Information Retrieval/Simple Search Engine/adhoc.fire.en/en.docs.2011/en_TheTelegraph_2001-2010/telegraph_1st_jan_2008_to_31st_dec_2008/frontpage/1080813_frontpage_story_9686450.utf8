   Cong, RJD play along with CM aspirant          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug 12: The UPA leadership today extended support to JMM chief Shibu Sorens pursuit to grab the chief ministers post in Jharkhand but tried to reason with him that the government in the state was not made to order.        
	Desperate Soren, however, was not ready to see the imponderables and issued an ultimatum to withdraw support to the Madhu Koda government.        
	Sources said Soren has begun to smell betrayal as neither the Congress, nor the RJD made any sincere attempt to convince Koda to relinquish the chief ministers post despite the lapse of three weeks since the trust vote in Parliament.        
	The Prime Minister is not keen to induct Soren into the Union cabinet and wants the Congress leadership to arrange for his chief ministership in Jharkhand. But the Congress has not been able to fix the numbers for Soren primarily because, as party sources say, things are not fully in its control in the state.        
	It is indeed true that neither RJD chief Lalu Prasad nor some of the Independent MLAs are enthusiastic about a change of guard in Jharkhand. Lalu, who also extended support to Sorens quest, however, pointed out what would happen if the government fell in the process of changing the chief minister.        
	What Congress leader Ajay Maken said after Soren met Sonia Gandhi here today is no less interesting. He said: The Congress will support Soren if he forms the government in the state.         
	The Koda government precariously hangs with the fragile thread of Independents support and none of the allies  Congress, RJD or JMM  is in a position to convince all the MLAs on the change of guard. In this backdrop, even Sonias writ  whom Soren today described as high command  wont run in the state.        
	But these political niceties mean little for Soren who is waiting for his reward after saving the Manmohan Singh government on the floor of Lok Sabha. After hedging his bets for so long, he un-bosomed himself today, declaring that he would indeed be the chief minister of Jharkhand very soon.        
	After a meeting of state MPs, Soren said: The high command has directed that the chief minister should resign. The resignation should come immediately any time.        
	The Congress reacted cautiously, hoping that the problem would be sorted out within a week. Party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said: This is an intra-UPA affair. We are attentive to the aspirations of different sections of supporting parties. We are hopeful that the problem would be sorted out amicably within a week to the satisfaction of all concerned.        
	Lalu Prasad, however, was not so cautious. He said: I have no problem if Soren became the chief minister. But if Soren falls short of majority, it will lead to the imposition of Presidents rule there.        
	Koda confident        
	Chief minister Madhu Koda returned to Ranchi from New Delhi in the afternoon today and said he wasnt worried, before going ahead with his official engagements as though it was business as usual.        
	He put up a brave front saying none of the UPA heavywe-ights in New Delhi, like RJD chief Lalu Prasad or Congress president Sonia Gandhi, had so far told him anything.        
	Hence he did not foresee a threat to his chair. Let the UPA first decide who they wo-uld like to have as chief minister. I will decide my future action plan only after the JMM formally withdraws support to my government. Shibu Soren is our guardian and the JMMs support is very important for us. As of now I need not worry about anything.        
	He looked confident and sported a wide smile as he posed for photographers. When reporters asked him to display the customary victory sign, he, however, refused.

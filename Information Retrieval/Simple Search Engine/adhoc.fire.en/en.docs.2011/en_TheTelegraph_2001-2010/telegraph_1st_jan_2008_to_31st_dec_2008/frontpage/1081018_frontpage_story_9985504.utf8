	New Delhi, Oct. 17: Indias first moon-bound spacecraft rolled 900 metres to its launch pad at the Sriharikota space centre this evening where it will wait for its scheduled dawn launch on Wednesday.         
	Perched atop an upgraded version of the Indian Space Research Organisations Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Chandrayaan-1 was wheeled on a bogie from an assembly building at a slow 10-metres-per-minute pace and anchored to a tower on the launch pad.         
	Isro engineers began a series of health checks on the spacecraft that will continue until its scheduled launch at 6.22am on October 22. The countdown is expected to begin about 50 hours before the launch, a senior engineer said.         
	The scientists hope to guide Chandrayaan-1 into a lunar orbit, about 100km above the moons surface, where it is expected to spend two years mapping the lunar surface and exploring the geology of the moon.         
	Its a peculiar feeling to see the roll to the launch pad, said Chandra Dattan, director of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on the Andhra Pradesh coast. Its almost like the beginning of its journey.         
	Senior Isro officials reviewed the status of the mission and gave a go signal, said T.K. Alex, director, Isro Satellite Centre, Bangalore. Well have more such review meetings in the coming days.         
	Over the next four days, engineers will run checks on systems aboard Chandrayaan-1 as well as the PSLV. These will be monitored by scientists in Sriharikota and Bangalore, Alex said.         
	Around 6.30 this evening, the PSLV with Chandrayaan-1 arrived on its launch pad where scientists will anchor it to a tough steel umbilical tower.         
	The PSLV ferrying Chandrayaan-1 into space will use larger strap-on motors than its previous versions. It is expected to release the spacecraft into a highly elliptical orbit around the earth from where it will be nudged twice into higher orbits before it approaches the moon around November 8, a scientist said.         
	Weather scientists at Isro are tracking the atmospheric conditions in the Bay of Bengal for a forecast of the morning of October 22. Light rain is unlikely to affect a launch but, Dattan said, a severe thunderstorm, depression or cyclone could postpone it.         
	Isro has a six-day window  till October 28  to launch Chandrayaan-1. But any change from the scheduled October 22 date will force engineers to retune orbital manoeuvres as both the earth and the moon are in constant motion.

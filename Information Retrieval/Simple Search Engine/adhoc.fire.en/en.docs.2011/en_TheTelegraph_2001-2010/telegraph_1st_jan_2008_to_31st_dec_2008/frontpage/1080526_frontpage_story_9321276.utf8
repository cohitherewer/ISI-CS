	Bangalore, May 25: Flying into Bangalore? Get ready for a swathe of green and an unfamiliar skyline of low hills.        
	Welcome to Bengaluru International Airport at Devanahalli, 40km from the city.         
	The airport has finally taken off after a seven-week delay. The informal inauguration took place last night with the landing of the Air India flight IC609 from Mumbai at 10.40.         
	We werent told we would land at the new airport. It was a pleasant surprise when the captain made the announcement, said Girish Babu, after being welcomed with Bangalores export-quality roses, grown around the airport.         
	Snehashis Ganguly, on the same flight, said he was surprised to find a spacious baggage enclosure and the fact that his luggage had rolled out almost simultaneously as he walked into the conveyer belt area.        
	The management appeared to have worked hard to ensure a smooth take-off  or touchdown, for those flying in.        
	Our aim is to ensure the passenger walks out with the checked-in baggage within 10 minutes of landing, said Monica M. Prabhu, an official of Bangalore International Airport Limited, which has built the new hub.        
	CEO Albert Brunner beamed as he escorted the first few fliers out. Its been a dream. We were suffering losses of Rs 1.1 crore a day for weeks. We are happy we finally opened.        
	The airport was to have opened on March 30 but trials by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) led to a delay. A fresh date, May 11, was set but the opening was put off because of the Assembly polls.        
	The Election Commission objected to the next date, May 23. The go-ahead from the panel came only at the last minute  almost when the Air India flight was about to land last night.        
	The first take-off, an Air India flight for Singapore, was at 12.05am today.        
	Passengers seemed impressed with the international look and feel of the airport, whose car park can pack in 2,000 vehicles. Its a relief from the crowded HAL (old) airport. The only concern is connectivity, said I.P. Das, whose brother was to board a late-night Lufthansa flight to the US.        
	Patrick Wofgong said he had come three hours early for his Thai Airways flight. The road to this place is a long one. But once here, there is the feel of an international airport. I am sure it will make Bangalore proud.         
	Most airline employees were, however, still trying to get used to the new system.        
	We are still getting used to the software in the common user terminals set up here, said a ground hostess, struggling to move the queues faster.        
	One advantage of common user terminals is the check-in counters can be used by any airline.        
	But those used to long farewells will be disappointed: goodbyes will have to be said outside the departure terminal as visitors are not allowed inside. Only the arrival terminal is open to visitors, on a ticket of Rs 80.         
	Joint commissioner of customs Radhakrishna was happy with the facilities. We were ready in March. We have posted enough men and I am sure traffic will pick up.         
	Women, against whom crimes in Bangalore arent rare, might have a reason to feel safer with special cab services.         
	Sandhya Holla, one of those who used the facility, said she wouldnt mind paying the Rs 15-a-km charge for vehicles that are GPS-enabled and have a disable button to stop the car.         
	Help will be at hand within minutes. Its a blessing for women travellers who are alone, Holla said.        
	For those who dont want to hire a taxi, there are buses operated by the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation.        
	A fleet of 140, including 40 air-conditioned buses, with luggage racks and ramps for the disabled, will leave from all parts of the city.

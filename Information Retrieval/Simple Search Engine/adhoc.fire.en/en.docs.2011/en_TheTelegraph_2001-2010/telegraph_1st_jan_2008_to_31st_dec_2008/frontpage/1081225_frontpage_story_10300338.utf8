	Dec. 24: On Christmas Eve, Union home minister P. Chidambaram put the onus of maintaining peace in Orissa on chief minister Naveen Patnaik.         
	I have impressed upon him that it is the responsibility of the state government to maintain law and order and protect the lives and property of all sections of people in the state, Chidambaram said in a statement after speaking to Patnaik over phone.        
	Communal riots that started in the last week of August and continued through September left 60 people dead in Orissa, most of them Christians. Hundreds were injured.         
	The Centre has provided a large number of security personnel to assist the state. Apart from 24 companies of the CRPF deployed on a long-term basis in Orissa, Delhi has sent 49 additional companies of the CRPF and four companies of the Rapid Action Force (RAF). A helicopter was provided today to patrol Kandhamal, the worst hit by the riots, and Sambhalpur districts.         
	The situation in Orissa has been engaging the attention of the central government in the past two weeks, Chidambaram said, adding he had requested Patnaik to keep him updated and also offered him further assistance.        
	Sangh parivar outfits had called a bandh on Christmas to press for the arrest of the killers of Lakshmananda Saraswati, a VHP monk whose death had triggered the riots. The bandh was later called off.        
	The chief minister has assured me that there will be no bandh on December 25, 2008, Chidambaram said.         
	But members of the Christian community, including church leaders, expressed fears for their safety and that of their places of worship. Representatives of Christian organisations had called on Chidambaram soon after he took over as home minister.         
	The archbishop of the Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese, Raphael Cheenath, said he was satisfied with the security in urban areas. But there is tremendous fear among the Christians in Kandhamal, especially in rural pockets. They are afraid that they may be attacked, he said. Tonight is crucial for us.        
	Last week, Juvraj Digal, a Christian, was allegedly abducted in Kandhamal. The home of another Christian was torched yesterday after he refused to reconvert to Hinduism, Cheenath said.         
	All this creates an atmosphere of panic. Everybody is afraid that he may be the next target, the archbishop added. There are reports that a group of people have crept into Kandhamal before Christmas. Thats why we are more afraid.         
	The Orissa government said seven persons suspected in the murder of Lakshmananda Saraswati have been arrested.

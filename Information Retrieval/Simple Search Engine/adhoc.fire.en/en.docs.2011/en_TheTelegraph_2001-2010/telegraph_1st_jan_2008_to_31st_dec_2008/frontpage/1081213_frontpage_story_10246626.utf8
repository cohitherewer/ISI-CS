The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Guruji to tread carefully in Tamar
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Guruji to tread carefully in Tamar
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Bundu (Ranchi), Dec. 12: Shibu Soren, who has to become a member of the state Assembly within the next two and a half months if he wishes to remain chief minister, filed his nomination papers today to contest the bypolls to the Tamar seat. But, this is one election he would have surely avoided if he could.        
	For, this bypoll scheduled for December 29 has exposed the fissures in the ruling UPA combine like never before: Sorens cabinet colleague, Anosh Ekka, has defied sack threats and is standing by his Jharkhand Party candidate, who is one among 20 names in the fray.        
	Adding to Sorens woes is the poll demographics of Tamar, which was represented by the JD(U)s Ramesh Singh Munda till he was brutally gunned down on July 9 to necessitate the bypoll. The JMM has never been at ease in Tamar.        
	Today, even as Sorens poll juggernaut rolled in at the Bundu sub-divisional office, Ekkas nominee, Gopal Krishna Patar, alias Raja Peter, fired from all cylinders to decalre he was in no mood to make way for the chief minister.         
	In our country no eligible candidate can be stopped from contesting elections, he said. Even if the Jharkhand Party denies me the party symbol, I will try my luck as an Independent. If Shibu Soren is such a big leader, why is he scared of locking horns with a small person like me.        
	Yesterday, Peters mentor, Ekka, was at the receiving end of an ultimatum from Soren: pull out our man or lose your ministry.         
	To that Ekka sought time diplomatically, even claiming he fielded someone from his party after getting a go-ahead from the chief minister.        
	Today, Soren filed four sets of nomination papers against Peters two as a Jharkhand Party candidate and an Independent. The nominations will be scrutinised tomorrow and December 15 is the last date for withdrawals.        
	According to Bundu SDO Anil Kumar Poddar, 20 candidates have filed nominations for the byelections _ three belonged to recognised political parties, JMM, JD (U) and CPI (M); seven belonged to other registered political parties and 10 were Independents.        
	The JD (U), backed by the BJP, is out to grab sympathy votes by fielding Mundas widow, Vasundhara Munda. And, Soren, who had been saying he wouldnt try his luck in Tamar, reluctantly agreed later as he was left with few options _ he has to become a member of the state legislature in the next two-and-a-half-months.         
	Having spent three-and-a-half-months in office already, the chief minister is now left with two choices: Either he wins the Tamar Assembly seat or gives up his chief ministerial chair after around February 2009.        
	For, even if any MLA offers his Assembly seat to Guruji later, the election commission cannot be compelled to hold a byelections within a time-frame.        
	 Soren realises this. And even though Tamar has never been quite the happy hunting ground for JMM, he put up a brave front. I struggled hard for years for the welfare of the entire Jharkhand region. I did not give special priority to any particular area. Now, I do have the right to ask the common people in Tamar to vote for me.        
	 Apart from Soren, Vasundhara and Peter, JVM (P)s Ram Durlabh Singh Munda, Samata Partys Hari Singh Munda and AJSUs Vijay Singh Manki were significant names in the fray who were likely to make a dent in the late JD(U) leader Mundas support base which could prove beneficial for Soren.        
	While Ram Durlabh Singh was closely associated with the slain legislator, Hari Singh Munda is his nephew from one of Tamars more influential families known for having donated land for the famous Sun Temple in Bundu.         
	Also, the AJSU has roped in the late JD(U) leaders son, Prahlad Singh Munda, who seems only too willing to campaign against Vasundhara Munda, his stepmother since she was Ramesh Singh Mundas second wife.

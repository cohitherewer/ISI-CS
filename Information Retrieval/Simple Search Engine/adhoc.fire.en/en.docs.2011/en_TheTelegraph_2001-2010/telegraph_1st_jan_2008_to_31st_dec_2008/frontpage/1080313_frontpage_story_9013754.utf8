The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Wikipedia Wales in donations row
                                                                                                           Wikipedia Wales in donations row
                                Wales: False claims                            
	London, March 12: The co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, has been accused of offering to edit an entry on the online encyclopaedia site in return for a donation.        
	Jeff Merkey, a former computer scientist at Novell, claims Wales proposed in 2006 that, in exchange for a substantial donation from Merkey, he would edit his uncomplimentary Wikipedia entry to make it more complimentary.        
	Merkey claims he made a 2500 donation in 2006 and the edit history for his Wikipedia entry showed that, around the same time, changes were made to the entry after it had been wiped out completely before editors were allegedly ordered to start all over again.        
	Merkeys allegations were published in a statement on a Wikipedia mailing list. On the same mailing list, Wales called the allegations nonsense.        
	Jay Walsh, a spokesman for Wikipedia, said it was an absolutely false allegation.        
	Jimmy never made this offer, and of course this is a practice the Wikipedia Foundation would never condone, he said. The claim is the most recent in a spate of allegations against Wales, who was accused last week by a former Wikipedia executive of improperly using the non-profit organisations funds for his own lavish recreation.

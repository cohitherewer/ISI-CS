The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Distasteful for Advani is riveting for Jaswant
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Distasteful for Advani is riveting for Jaswant
  - Former foreign minister sends author letter with fulsome praise for book on Benazir          MANDIRA NAYAR                                                     
	New Delhi, June 11: L.K. Advani may have gone to great lengths to distance himself from the contents of Goodbye Shahzadi, the controversial new book on slain Pakistani leader Benazir Bhutto, but his colleague Jaswant Singh has been fulsome in his praise for it.        
	Following the Pakistan Peoples Partys ire at some of the contents of the book, Advani, who graced its release on May 21, regretted his decision to be part of the event and called the book distasteful. Singh, on the other hand, found it riveting.        
	In a hand-written letter to author Shyam Bhatia, Singh said: I wanted to speak to you, firstly, to say how very much I enjoyed Goodbye Shahzadi  a riveting narrative so moving in its contents and written with such a lucid, arresting flow I read it almost at one sitting, well almost, metaphorically, not literally speaking.        
	Bhatias book has earned the ire of PPP spokesperson Faratullah Babar, who has threatened to sue the author over portions that say Benazir illicitly exported her countrys nuclear secrets to North Korea.        
	The other touchy issue concerns Benazirs boyfriends during her Oxford stint and her plucking body hair before she got married  elements that may have the potential perhaps to hurt the slain leaders image in a conservative country.        
	This is not the first time that the two BJP big guns have fired at cross-purposes in public.         
	Their differences came out in the open at the release of Advanis biography My Country, My Life earlier this year. Ironically, those differences, too, concerned a prominent Pakistani  Mohammad Ali Jinnah.        
	Singh had said, in Advanis presence, that he disagreed with his leaders view on the founder of Pakistan, adding that he was working on his own assessment of the man in a new book.        
	But perhaps the more embarrassing spat between the two was on Advanis version of the Kandahar hostage rescue. Advani had claimed  in a television interview  that he was unaware about the decision to send Singh, at that time the external affairs minister, with terrorists who were given away as part of the deal to free passengers taken hostage on IC 814.        
	Singh had countered this by accusing Advani of amnesia and said: It was a collective decision and Advani might have forgotten what happened at the Cabinet Committee on Security.        
	While the differences between the two leaders of the BJP on this book have not been aired publicly, it is clear that they are speaking in two distinct voices.        
	Advani, who claims to have been close to Benazir, has apparently been embarrassed by certain very personal details Shyam Bhatias book purports to reveal.         
	Since more and more contents have tumbled out, much to the chagrin of the PPP and sections of the Bhutto family, Advani has taken great pains to quickly disassociate himself from book.        
	He has also clarified that he had not read the book, leading Congress spokesman Manish Tiwari to take it caustic dig. The least he (Advani) can do is to read the book, I hope he does not say now that he has not read the book he has written.        
	The books publisher, Roli head Pramod Kapoor, told The Telegraph that the choice of Advani was an out of the box idea because his views on Pakistan are not known to be particularly friendly.        
	He did say he hadnt had time to read the book, but he did offer some words of praise for it, Kapoor said, adding: He didnt convey to either the author or me that he found it distasteful.        
	I understand if these personal details have hurt the familys sentiments, said Kapoor. We are willing to delete this portion as it is not relevant to the political story of the book, if the author agrees.        
	The fallout of the book  not a quickie, but the result of a long association between Bhatia and Kapoor  may have created fresh embarrassment for the BJP leader but the hoopla surrounding it appears to have done wonders for Goodbye Shahzadis sales which are reported to have picked up on both sides of the border.

	New Delhi, Dec. 22: India is feeling let down by the world and frustrated by the fragmented system in Pakistan. The country also knows that ultimately it must deal with what is its own problem.        
	An armada of Indian ambassadors and high commissioners will take this message  probably couched in diplomatese  around the world after a meeting that began today and ends on Christmas-eve.        
	We will take all measures necessary as we deem fit to deal with the situation (arising out of the Mumbai attacks), sources quoted foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee as telling the first meeting of all Indian mission heads since 1969. Around 130 envoys have been summoned to a three-day briefing, including a meeting with the Prime Minister tomorrow.        
	Later, asked by reporters about possible military strikes in Pakistan, Mukherjee said: If there will be any military conflict, nobody declares it in the media. We have kept all our options open.        
	He added: To achieve that objective (of bringing the plotters of the Mumbai carnage to justice), we are not closing any options because our people have died.        
	Briefing the mission heads on Delhis stand on diplomatic issues relating to the Mumbai carnage, Mukherjee told them no one should take Indias restraint as a sign of weakness, the sources said.        
	The envoys will carry back a tough message to the capitals they came from  that the world needs to do more to tackle the terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan, what Mukherjee bluntly referred to as the greatest terrorist danger to the peace and security of the entire civilised world.        
	There has been some effort so far by the international community but this is not enough, Mukherjee later told reporters. We are not saying this because we are affected.        
	The seasoned ministers suggestion of inadequate international action betrayed the growing frustration within the Indian establishment over what it feels has been lukewarm response from some world powers.        
	Mukherjee reminded the world of Indias praise-earning restraint but added that eventually the country will have to tackle the problem on its own.         
	We have so far acted with the utmost restraint and are hopeful that the international community will use its influence to urge the Pakistani government to take effective action, Mukherjee was quoted as telling the mission heads. While we continue to persuade the international community and Pakistan, we are also clear that ultimately it is we who have to deal with this problem.        
	India has had to rely heavily on American intelligence for help so far, sources said. John Michel McConnell, the director of the US National Intelligence, today met the home minister and senior officials. Considered the most powerful intelligence berth in the US now, the post of director of National Intelligence was created after the 9/11 attacks.         
	The foreign minister scrupulously refrained from commenting on the internal affairs of Pakistan but others from the establishment today spoke of a growing fear.        
	Sources said Indias biggest problem was how to deal with a fragmented Pakistan  a euphemism for multiple power centres that suggests Delhi is lending more credence to an earlier apprehension that the army is tightening its grip over the civilian government in Islamabad.         
	We are dealing with a fragmented Pakistan where formal authority is separate from real power. We dont know who runs Pakistan, one of the sources said.        
	An observer based in Pakistan also told The Telegraph that it was becoming more and more apparent that the government could not stray too far from the line drawn by the army.        
	If the brinkmanship between India and Pakistan increased, there could be a more overt takeover by the army, the observer said. The jingoism in India is not helping the civilian government here, added the observer who did not want to be named in the current atmosphere.        
	If the Pakistan Army is treading with some caution, it could be because of the economic challenges facing Pakistan. The country had to approach the International Monetary Fund for a $7.6-billion loan to prevent it from defaulting on debt and to help stabilise the economy. The IMF has approved the loan but should another bailout be needed, democracy is always more useful than dictatorship to help loosen the purse strings of the world powers.        
	The sources in India explained that the way Islamabad was going back and forth on action against suspects in the Mumbai attacks showed it had multiple power centres. They cited some examples:        
	Within hours of Pakistans civilian government agreeing to Manmohan Singhs demand to send the ISI director-general to India, Islamabad backtracked        
	Days after President Asif Zardari said the alleged airspace violation by India was an inadvertent incident, Islamabad sought an explanation from Delhi        
	Foreign minister S.M. Qureshi told Dawn TV last week that Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar was in custody, but hours later, the state-run APP news agency quoted him as saying Azhar was at large        
	The alleged hoax call to Zardari by someone posing as Mukherjee and threatening a war. The sources said this was a piece of mischief to divert attention from the terror attack.

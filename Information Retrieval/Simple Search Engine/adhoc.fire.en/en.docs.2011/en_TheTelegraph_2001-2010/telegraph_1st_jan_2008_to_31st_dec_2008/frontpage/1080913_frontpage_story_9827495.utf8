	Islamabad, Sept. 12: As the American campaign against suspected al Qaida and Taliban militants in Pakistans tribal areas seemed to intensify, two missiles fired from American pilot-less drones killed 14 people today in an attack on a village compound in North Waziristan, according to a local journalist and television reports.        
	At the same time, fighting between Pakistan security forces and militants elsewhere in the wild lands bordering Afghanistan killed 32 militants and two soldiers, The Associated Press reported, citing a Pakistan army spokesman, Major Murad Khan.        
	The missile strike was said to have taken place near Miran Shah, the main settlement in North Waziristan, before first light today and was aimed at the home of a local tribesman, Yousaf Khan Wazir, who was among the dead, a local journalist said.        
	A Pakistani intelligence official said most of the dead in the attack were Punjabi Taliban. The term refers to militants from the Punjab province of Pakistan. The target was said to be a militant training camp, the official said, asking not to be named because he was not authorised to speak publicly.        
	The missiles were fired at a village called Tole Khel, two miles east of Miran Shah, and the dead included women and children, according to residents speaking to Pakistani reporters. There was no immediate word on the reported attack from American or Pakistani military authorities.         
	Some Pakistani officials have made it clear that they prefer the CIAs Predator drone aircraft as the means of killing Qaida operatives without the deployment of American troops on the ground.

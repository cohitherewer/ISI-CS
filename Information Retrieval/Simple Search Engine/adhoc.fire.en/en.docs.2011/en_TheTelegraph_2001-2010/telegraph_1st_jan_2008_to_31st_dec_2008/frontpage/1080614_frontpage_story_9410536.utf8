          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 13: Shakuntala Mukherjee is lucky that her late husband was one of Bengals topmost police officers. She has had to wait only 12 years before being handed the director-generals retirement benefits today.        
	On Tuesday, widows Madhubala Saha and Renubala Saha received the pension due to them after a 40-year delay  their husbands were PWD labourers.        
	The government had tried to prolong Shakuntalas wait as long as it could, first holding out against a decade-old Calcutta High Court order and then ignoring a second one passed last February.        
	It was only when the hearing of a contempt case was about to begin today that the government counsel pulled out the three cheques: Rs 17 lakh for Shakuntala, all dues cleared at one go.        
	The money will be in court custody till she comes with a receipt, but its now just a formality.        
	Shakuntalas husband Shayama Prosad had retired as DG (prosecution) in 1996 and, soon after, was asked to vacate his quarters in Jadavpur. The norms, however, required the government to pay any retired employee his benefits before asking him to leave his quarters.        
	Since his dues were unpaid, Mukherjee refused to leave. But he was forcibly evicted with his wife and daughter Sujasha. The retired IPS officer approached the high court which ordered the state to clear his dues at 15 per cent interest and let him stay in his quarters till then.        
	The government let him live in the quarters but did not pay his arrears. Mukherjee died in 1998 and soon afterwards, his wife and daughter were told the sum would be paid quickly if they vacated the apartment, Shakuntalas lawyer Suman Ghosh said.        
	The state, however, paid the widow only Rs 3,000 as gratuity in 2001, although the arrears under this head were over Rs 1 lakh.        
	Officials told her the rest had been deducted as rent for the quarters, Ghosh said. She wrote to the government. They paid her Rs 8.80 lakh, but Rs 15 lakh was still outstanding.        
	After waiting seven years, Shakuntala moved court again. In February, the high court ordered the state to pay the dues in two months. When that wasnt done, she moved the contempt petition last month.

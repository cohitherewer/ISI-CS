                                Flood victims move with their belongings to safer places in Saharsa on Sunday. (AP)                            
	Patna, Aug. 31 (PTI): With water of the Kosi engulfing fresh areas in Bihars north-eastern 16 districts, the flood situation in the state worsened today affecting more than 30 lakh people.        
	However, there was some good news for the first time since the region was gripped by the deluge about two weeks ago with a senior official saying the flood situation would improve as the flow of water from Nepal has come down.        
	Over 30 lakh people in 16 districts are in the grip of floods, with 23 lakh in worst-hit Supaul, Saharsa, Madhepura and Araria districts alone. Chief minister Nitish Kumar said five army columns were pressed into service for relief and rescue, while the state has requisitioned 25 more columns.        
	IAF helicopters and army columns deployed to assist the state governments flood fighting machinery continued relief and evacuation operations. The floods caused by the breach in the eastern embankment at upstream Kuaha village in Nepal on August 18 is the worst in the region.        
	For over 1 lakh people who have taken shelter in Saharsa town, the situation is serious with fresh discharge of 2.5 lakh cusec of water into the Kosi by Nepal. People are making a frantic search for their dear ones separated during their flight to safety. Even college, school buildings and dharamshalas face the threat of collapse with thousands of people having taken shelter on rooftops.        
	Madhepura town is submerged under water ranging from knee-deep to 6ft. The swirling waters are entering the township with heightened fury. Saharsa district magistrate R. Laxman said around 1 lakh people, who had taken shelter in adjoining Saharsa town from Madhepura and Supaul were a harried lot. In Supaul, nobody was in a position to say from which river the water was flowing as the river has several streams which meet the Ganga near Kursela in Katihar district.        
	In Madhepura town, the people had left their houses unattended and were seen marching towards Saharsa town and other places for safety. The condition of marooned people of Madhepura is beyond description with two important points of the town  Karpoori Chowk and BP Mandal Square  under water.        
	Those who did not leave the town earlier were seen ruing their fate. We should have left the place earlier. With essential supplies running out, we might starve if no fresh stocks are reached, Sukhwali Devi of Sinaul Bariyari said. I am not worried about the loss of property. I am searching for my husband and three children missing since August 18 when floodwaters entered our village.        
	With people leaving their houses in haste to escape floodwaters, burglars were thanking their stars. They hired boats and struck at houses in the flood-affected districts. R.K. Yadav of Murliganj said his house was burgled last night and demanded adequate protection. With the situation in Birpur and Supaul worsening, 20 army boats with 124 personnel were engaged for evacuation.        
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad held the state government responsible for the catastrophe. He announced a slew of measures for the victims and appealed to railway employees to donate a days salary to the Railway Ministers Welfare and Relief Fund.

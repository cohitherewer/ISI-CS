  - Morgan and Goldman transform themselves and Wall Street                                                   
	Sept. 22: Rest in peace, risk. The high priests of investment banking have been buried.        
	Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the last big independent investment banks on Wall Street, will transform themselves into bank holding companies subject to far greater regulation, reshaping an era of high finance that defined the modern Gilded Age.        
	The self-prescribed metamorphosis was a blunt acknowledgement that their model of finance and investing had become too risky and that they needed the cushion of bank deposits that had kept big commercial banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase relatively safe amid the recent turmoil.         
	The move effectively returns Wall Street to the way it was structured before the US Congress passed a law during the Great Depression separating investment banking from commercial banking, known as the Glass-Steagall Act. It is in many ways a shift to the business model used by banks in Europe, where large firms engage in both investment banking and commercial banking.         
	The change, approved by the Federal Reserve with unusual haste, gives Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley greater latitude to borrow from the monetary authority and access to stable sources of funding  namely, deposits from ordinary people and businesses.        
	But the firms are also accepting regulation by the Federal Reserve that will make it far more expensive for them to borrow huge sums of money  long an essential ingredient in their investment strategy  and restrict what sorts of business they can engage in.                  
	The development completes a sweeping transformation of Wall Street. Now extinct are the specialised trading houses that broke off from larger financial companies during the Great Depression, enterprises that once prized their independence of regulation and exploited their agility to make fortunes. Over the past 30 years, these firms even surpassed commercial banks as the prime funding source for corporate America.        
	Seven months ago, there were five major independent investment banks, selling stocks and bonds, advising companies on mergers and engaging in ever more arcane financial engineering. Since then, Bear Stearns was bought in a fire sale by commercial bank JPMorgan Chase, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and Merrill Lynch agreed to be bought by Bank of America.         
	Now, the two biggest, strongest and most prestigious of those firms will become traditional commercial banks, too.         
	Hours after Morgan Stanley announced the transformation, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japans largest bank, said it planned to acquire as much as 20 per cent of the US entity as part of a broader strategic alliance. The Mitsubishi investment is estimated to be as large as $8.5 billion.        
	As bank holding companies, Goldman and Morgan will be forced to put more money on the table when they make investment bets. Goldman Sachs, for example, holds about $1 for every $22 in investments. Morgan Stanleys ratio is even more dramatic. By contrast, Bank of America, which will soon be the nations largest bank holding company, holds about $1 for every $11 in investments.         
	Goldman and Morgan will be sharply limited in their ability to make equity investments in non-financial companies. The marketplace wont give them leverage, the regulators wont give them leverage and so now we have formal confirmation that the model of free-standing investment banks is kaput, said Ed Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association.         
	In exchange for subjecting themselves to more regulation, the companies will have access to the full array of the Federal Reserves lending facilities.        
	Just a year ago, investment banks, the titans of global finance, considered bank regulation a millstone to be avoided at all costs. Lobbyists for firms like Goldman spent years fending off closer supervision of their business.        
	With reports from The New York Times News Service and Los Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service

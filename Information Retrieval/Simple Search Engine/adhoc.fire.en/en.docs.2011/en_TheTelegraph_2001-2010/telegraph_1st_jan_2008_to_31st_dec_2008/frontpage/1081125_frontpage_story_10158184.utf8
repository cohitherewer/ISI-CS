          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 24: The Kandhamal administration today prevented members of the tribal community to hold a rally at Daringibadi by clamping prohibitory orders fearing a breach of peace.         
	We have promulgated prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC in Daringibadi and banned the rally as it may flare communal tensions, explained collector Krishna Kumar.         
	The Kui Samaj Samanwaya Samiti, a body of Kandha tribals that has been seeking ST status for Christian Dalits since the past year, had planned the rally at Parampanga village to protest alleged police atrocities on tribals.         
	The police detained samiti leader Lamodar Kandhar at Nuagaon while he was on way to Daringibadi to the rally. Last December, violence had erupted in Daringibadi, an area dominated by minorities.         
	A senior police officer conceded the situation at Daringibadi was under control, though there was palpable tension in the morning.         
	CRPF and State Armed Police were deployed in the area, while senior officials, including district collector and superintendent of police, have been camping at Daringibadi to ensure that there were no untoward incidents.         
	Kandhamal district had witnessed widespread violence following the murders of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and four aides at an ashram on August 23.         
	The violence had claimed at least 38 people, while thousands of homes were torched.         
	In a related development, the court of Baliguda sub-divisional judicial magistrate today asked the crime branch to file chargesheets in the nun rape case by December 6. On November 19, the court had directed the crime branch that was investigating the case to apprise the court on the progress made by today.         
	The nun, who was raped at K-Nuagaon under Baliguda police station area of Kandhamal on August 24 has, so far, failed to appear before the sub-divisional court. The court had summoned her for the test identification parade of the 10 accused. The parade could not be held at Baliguda because of the victims absence.         
	She had sought a months time and prayed for a change in venue. However, the court rejected the plea and asked the crime branch to proceed with its investigation.

  - Calcuttans score high in work ethics survey          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	Calcutta, July 30: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee must be tired of losing out to Narendra Modi in every department of the investment game.        
	But heres something that should cheer the Bengal chief minister: Calcutta scores high  and Ahmedabad low  on work ethics.        
	Employees in Calcutta are least likely to report sick when they arent and will rarely, if ever, bribe their way to contracts, according to a survey on workplace ethics.        
	The Bengal capital has come through as a city with a high level of integrity and consciousness about ethics, scoring 76 per cent in an ethics index computed by TeamLease, one of the countrys largest staff solutions firms, which carried out the eight-city survey in May and June among 401 respondents.        
	Ahmedabad  known for rapid-fire decisions that facilitate investments much faster than the system in Calcutta  has come through as the city with the least ethically inclined employees.         
	The lenient Gujarat city languishes at the bottom of the ethics index, clocking 21 per cent. Even Delhi, the butt of jokes about cutting corners, fares better with 53 per cent.        
	Almost 78 per cent of the Calcutta employees polled believed it was unethical to fake a stomach upset or mummys illness and skip office. Almost 75 per cent of those in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune, the countrys IT backbone, found nothing wrong about lying on such occasions.        
	Calcutta also showed a strong aversion to bribes, with 67 per cent saying it was not acceptable, unlike employees in other cities who appeared to have reconciled to the blight as a way of life.        
	Bribery  and sexual harassment  evoked high recall among the respondents of Calcutta as examples of unethical behaviour.         
	Even inflation and the high cost of living didnt seem to dent the Calcuttans resolve to stay away from dressing up expense reports and bills handed in for reimbursement. Their reluctance to resort to fudging appeared to be the strongest among all those surveyed.        
	Sixty per cent of all respondents saw nothing wrong in gossiping under the garb of networking. The figure was higher, 70 per cent, in Ahmedabad, Pune, Bangalore and Hyderabad.        
	Delhi shone through on one count, though. Almost 51 per cent of its staff disagreed with the notion that making discreet STD/ISD personal calls from the office phone was fine. Most employees in other cities deemed it acceptable.        
	Nearly 78 per cent of the employees in Calcutta, Delhi and Hyderabad believed it was unethical to fudge entry and exit times at the office. In Ahmedabad, 74 per cent found nothing wrong in the practice.        
	TeamLease said it was heartening that 96 per cent of the respondents wouldnt back off confronting a colleague who they thought was doing something unethical.         
	The ways of resisting would differ, though. In Ahmedabad, the tendency would be to tell a senior about it and avoid a confrontation. Calcuttans were the least likely to take these indirect methods  they were more likely to approach their co-workers directly.        
	Only 14 per cent found running errands for the boss unethical. Calcutta didnt stand out from the rest on this count.

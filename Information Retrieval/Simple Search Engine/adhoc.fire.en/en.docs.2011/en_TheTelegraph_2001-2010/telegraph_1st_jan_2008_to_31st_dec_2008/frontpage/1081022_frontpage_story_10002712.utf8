  - Bomb fitted on moped goes off in village on Imphal outskirts, killing 17 playing lagao      OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Imphal, Oct. 21: At least 17 people were killed this evening in one of the most powerful blasts in Imphal city in recent memory, just two days after a grenade exploded near the office of Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh.         
	The director-general of police, Yumnam Joykumar Singh, said the bomb was fitted on a Luna moped parked near the entrance to Ragailong, a tribal village on the outskirts of Imphal, where a group of people was enjoying a game of dice called lagao, a popular sport before Diwali.         
	The site is also close to the western perimeter wall of the rear headquarters of 20 Assam Rifles and about 200 metres from the Manipur Police commando complex.         
	Police said 11 people died on the spot in the explosion around 7.30pm, while others died of their injuries at the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences and a private hospital. A score of people who were injured have been admitted to RIMS, Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital and a private hospital here.         
	No group has claimed responsibility yet, but the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak, which had claimed responsibility for the grenade explosion near the chief ministers office complex on October 19 night, denied any role in todays blast.         
	The police, as in the grenade explosion case, are clueless but suspect the bomb was fitted with a timer device.         
	The site of the blast presented a ghastly picture with mangled bodies and severed limbs scattered over a radius of 20 feet.         
	A senior police officer said the bombers could have targeted the Assam Rifles and police commando establishments. But the police were not sure if any defence personnel were among the dead or injured.         
	The scene at RIMS was chaotic with doctors and nurses finding it difficult to cope with the sudden rush of wounded patients.        
	The director of the institute, L. Fimate, and superintendent, Y. Mohen Singh, supervised proceedings themselves.         
	This is the second time after the Iskcon blast that so many injured persons have been brought to the hospital. We are finding it very difficult to attend to all these patients, a young doctor said. The Iskcon blast that took place on Janmasthami day two years back killed four persons and wounded more than 50 devotees, including foreigners.         
	As the doctors grappled with the wounded inside the hospital, there was panic and hysteria outside. People thronged the hospital to check if any of their relatives were among the injured.         
	My son Rajen has not come home. He is not picking up his mobile phone either. I have come here to find out if he is wounded, K. Mangle Singh, a resident of Minuthong, a neighbouring village, said.         
	The security staff at the hospital also had a tough time controlling the crowds.         
	Told about the blast by Joykumar Singh, chief minister Ibobi Singhs zoomed in shortly after the injured persons started arriving. He was followed by a host of other ministers  flood control minister N. Biren Singh, works minister K. Ranjit Singh, education minister L. Jayenta Singh and MLA Bijoy Singh  who met the injured at the ward and consoled them.         
	This is an act of cowardice. We will not let them go after this act. We will help you, Ibobi Singh told a wounded person.         
	I was in my room. I heard a loud blast. I thought the explosion was inside our complex. I rushed out and was shocked to see the mangled bodies, a commando said.         
	As the police cordoned off the area, Baidyanath Prasad, a pan-shop owner, wept inconsolably next to the body of his son, Raju: My son went near the lagao venue to relieve himself. He was innocent. Why would anyone kill innocent people like my son?        
	A villager from Ragailong told The Telegraph that gambling was in full swing for the past five days as Diwali was approaching.         
	He did not know who the organisers were, but said people from other parts of the state came to the place to gamble before the festival.        
	On October 19, a grenade exploded near Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singhs office-cum-residence, half a kilometre from where the state police were celebrating their victory over insurgency.        
	Fed up with frequent grenade attacks, Manipur police were mulling an action plan to cut off arms supply from Myanmar.

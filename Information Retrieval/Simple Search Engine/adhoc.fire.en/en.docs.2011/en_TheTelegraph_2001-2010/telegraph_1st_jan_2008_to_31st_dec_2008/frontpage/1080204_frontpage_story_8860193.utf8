 - Blame on rebels for Adivasi rally 
    A STAFF REPORTER
                     
	Guwahati, Feb. 3: The root of the street violence that stripped this capital city of its honour on November 24 was not some protesters going overboard or residents retaliating shamefully, but a plan probably hatched by two Adivasi militant groups.
    
	This stunning revelation came from the vice-president of the All Adivasi Students Association of Assam a day after the Adivasi woman who was disrobed and forced to run naked through Beltola told the Justice (retd) R.K. Manisena Singh Inquiry Commission that Guwahati appeared to her a land of animals.
    
	The arrested vice-president of the student union, Raphael Kujur, said after appearing before the same judge that he and other leaders of the organisation were in the dark about the Adivasi procession through the streets of Guwahati to demand Scheduled Tribe status. 
    
	He had told Singh the same thing, that the procession was organised by unknown elements.
    
	There is the possibility of militant groups like the Adivasi National Liberation Army (ANLA) and the Birsa Commando Force being involved in bringing out the procession, Kujur said.
    
	The student leader was arrested recently on charges of taking money from the ANLA to organise the rally. 
    
	Kujur said he was unaware that the ANLA leader who had approached him to donate funds for a rally was the leader of a militant outfit.
    
	The ANLA member, Bijoy Munda alias Bikash Munda, allegedly gave the money to Kujur in a city hotel. 
    
	Kujur told the judge that Munda called him on November 20 and introduced himself as a bamboo trader from Karbi Anglong. He expressed his willingness to make a financial contribution for the rally we were planning. I did not know that he was an ANLA activist, Kujur said.
    
	He accused some Congress leaders of using the militant groups to incite violence and sabotage the unions campaign for Scheduled Tribe status. 
    
	Earlier, while recalling the sequel of events, Kujur told the commission that he reached Beltola late and saw the procession. 
    
	On seeing the procession, I went to the meeting venue to ask other leaders to ask who had brought out the procession as it was not on the associations agenda. Even they were not aware of it and did not know who had given the order, Kujur said. 
    
	He then indicated that militant groups brought out the procession. 
    
	The commission, however, did not record it as it was a mere presumption and he had no evidence to substantiate his claim.
    
	The commission asked the police to produce Kujur to depose before it after AASAA president Justin Lakhra on Wednesday in a petition requested the probe panel to record Kujurs statement as he was one of the prime witnesses to the Beltola incident.
    
	Kujur was arrested last Sunday from Khowang in Dibrugarh district. He was then handed over to city police.

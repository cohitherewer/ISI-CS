	Inflation in Zimbabwe has rocketed to 1 million per cent and could hit 5 million per cent by October.        
	The Economist says in its recent issue: Two-thirds of the worlds population will probably suffer double-digit rates of inflation this summer.               
	June 20: The Mugger is finally in town: after a blizzard of scary forecasts around the world this summer, the spook of inflation  whom Ronald Reagan also evocatively described as an armed robber and a hit man  strutted through Indias pot-holed streets.        
	The spectre carried a placard that bore a double digit for the first time in 13 years: 11.05 per cent.        
	Not since May 1995  coincidentally the fag end of a previous Congress governments reign  has India seen inflation in double digits.        
	The latest inflation number sent a frisson of fear through Raisina Hill and Dalal Street  each enveloped in its own concerns about survival and a very uncertain future.        
	Finance minister P. Chidambaram, who has been sitting on a tinderbox ever since world crude oil prices soared to around $140 a barrel in May, is heading to Jeddah on Sunday along with petroleum minister Murli Deora to persuade the worlds leading oil producers to ratchet up output and cool prices.         
	Both Chidambaram  who today conceded that these are difficult times  and the RBI have tried several measures to tame inflation but they havent worked because they cant seem to get a handle on rising fuel prices.        
	A double-digit inflation was always on the cards after the government raised petrol, diesel and LPG prices early this month to stem losses at state-owned oil refiners. But the sharp 2.3 percentage point jump over the previous weeks figure of 8.75 per cent was both unexpected and unsettling.        
	Stocks tumbled in a skittish market with the sensex plunging to its lowest level in 2008 at 14571.9, down 3.42 per cent or 516.70 points. Investor wealth of Rs 168,007 crore has been wiped out overnight.        
	The surge in inflation has almost neutralised all the gains of salary earners from an average pay increase of 15.2 per cent  the highest in the Asia Pacific region.        
	Chidambaram and his advisers have a job on their hands to bring inflation down to the stated objective of 5.5 per cent by the end of this financial year.         
	The governments best bets are a good monsoon which could help stabilise food prices and a possible global crude price fall, if oil-producing nations agree to raise production. Oil holds the key as food prices have stabilised somewhat now, other economists said.        
	The government has already taken most of the steps it should have to control inflation. But other than a good monsoon, nothing seems to be working, said D. Joshi, the chief economist with market rating agency Crisil.

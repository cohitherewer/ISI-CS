The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Delhi fumes at Beijing stand 
                                                                                                        Delhi fumes at Beijing stand 
          OUR BUREAU                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: India today reacted sharply to the informal objection from China against Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Arunachal Pradesh when the two countries are engaged in talks to resolve territorial disputes along the border.         
	The protest comes a week after Singhs maiden visit to Arunachal Pradesh where he said the state was our land of the rising sun.         
	In Mumbai, external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said: Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of our country. We are having regular representation in our Parliament, elected by people of Arunachal Pradesh. Therefore, it is quite obvious that the Prime Minister will visit any part of the country.        
	The protest was at a junior level and was registered with the Indian mission in Beijing. China has not followed it up with an official note yet, sources in the ministry of external affairs said here today.         
	What was conveyed informally was Chinas unhappiness over Singhs visit at a time when the two sides are still in the process of settling the border question, and the difference in perceptions exists, sources said.         
	Sources said this was the minimum possible that China could have done.         
	Singh was on a two-day visit to Arunachal Pradesh beginning January 31, about a fortnight after returning from China.         
	But government sources said the objection from China was the minimum that was expected of Beijing. During Singhs visit to China, Indian officials accompanying him to Beijing said border talks were in progress and the special representatives were trying to evolve a common framework to resolve disputes.         
	Manmohan Singhs was the first visit by a Prime Minister to Arunachal in 12 years. His decision to skip Tawang, which China contests, was interpreted by the BJP as weakening of Indias stance on border talks.         
	Despite the request of our chief minister who is from Tawang, the Prime Minister did not go there probably because of pressure from China. We will raise the issue in Parliament, the BJP MP from Arunachal (East), Tapir Gao, said this evening.        
	In 1962, Chinese troops came into the country through Tawang before withdrawing unilaterally.

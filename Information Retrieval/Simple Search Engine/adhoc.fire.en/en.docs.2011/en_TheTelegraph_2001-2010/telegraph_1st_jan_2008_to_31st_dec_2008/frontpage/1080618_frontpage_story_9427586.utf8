          M.R. VENKATESH                      A boy collecting waste                          
	Chennai, June 17: By-products of the American lifestyle are raising a stink at Tuticorin port, but dont blame Prakash Karat or his comrades for this one.        
	Some 880 tonnes of US civic waste has been shipped to India after being mistaken as raw material to make cardboard. They have been rotting for three years at the port, packed in 35 cargo containers.        
	Its now left to the Madurai bench of Madras High Court to decide what to do with the toxic mix of plastic waste and the remnants of bottles, rubber mats and leather bags.        
	The first problem is, the waste is still valuable: a lot of it can be recycled for industrial use after detoxification. The second is, some countries let in only plastic waste.        
	The consignment had been sent for ITCs Secundrabad-based paper boards division, which wanted mixed waste paper to make cardboard. After the company found out what the stuff actually was, the New Jersey-based exporter, Evergreen Specialties, admitted that it was the wrong cargo.        
	Evergreen today told the high court that the error occurred because of the high volume of exports that the handling company, Tide Water Fiber Corporation of the US, dealt with. Evergreen says the cargo cannot be re-exported to any other country without the plastic content being segregated.        
	The case was filed about a year ago by a fourth company  the owner of the containers  which got impatient with its property being stuck in India.        
	Sources from Madurai said over the phone that the cargo had some time ago been sent to Dubai but the Gulf nation turned it back. Luckily, as the waste is inside the containers, it has caused no visible environmental damage so far, a source said.        
	Evergreen claims it has identified a buyer in Bangladesh, but that countrys customs would allow entry only if it contained plastic waste alone, the sources said. More details on the Bangladesh customs requirements were not available.        
	Evergreen, however, has added that it has also identified a company in Tuticorin that imports mixed plastic waste, and processes and re-exports it. This company is said to be willing to lift the entire cargo, sanitise it and ship it out.        
	The court has fixed the next hearing for June 26 on a plea by ITCs lawyers. Earlier, a court-appointed committee had confirmed that the cargo was indeed municipal waste.

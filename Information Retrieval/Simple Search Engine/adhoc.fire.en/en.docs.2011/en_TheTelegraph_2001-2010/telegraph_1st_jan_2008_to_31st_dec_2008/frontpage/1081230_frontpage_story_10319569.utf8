The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Boardroom exodus at Satyam
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Boardroom exodus at Satyam
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA AND VIVEK NAIR                                       
	Hyderabad/Mumbai, Dec. 29: And then there were five.        
	Embattled Satyam Computer Services today lost almost half of its board of directors even as the managements efforts to slam the lid on a two-week-old corporate governance scandal and the resultant shareholders revolt appeared to spin out of control.         
	Three eminent directors  Harvard professor Krishna Palepu, Pentium chip founder Vinod Dham and Indian School of Business dean M. Rammohan Rao  submitted their resignations a day after the company agreed to broaden the agenda for a January 10 meeting.        
	It was not immediately clear why they quit after forcing Satyam chairman B. Ramalinga Raju to agree to a discussion on a range of corporate governance issues arising from the storm that erupted on December 16 when the software giant decided to buy two Raju-owned companies for $1.6 billion (about Rs 7,753.6 crore). The two companies are Maytas Infra and Maytas Properties.         
	The three directors now join Mangalam Srinivasan who quit last week.        
	Ramalinga Raju only informed us about the Maytas deal. We had no role to play in the Satyam acquisition, Rammohan Rao told a television channel in Hyderabad. If true, this puts a new spin on the entire controversy.        
	When the storm broke on December 16, the company had claimed that the proposal had been put to vote and had been unanimously approved.        
	Satyams reaction to the resignations was swift: it thanked the directors promptly for their services in the past and ripped their names off the companys website.        
	There are only two independent directors  former cabinet secretary T.R. Prasad and former IIT Delhi director V.S. Raju  left on the board that just two weeks ago had nine members. The latest development raises some doubts about how effective the debate will be when the board meets next month.        
	In a terse note to the stock exchanges, Ramalinga Raju said the company would focus on the reconstitution of the board at the forthcoming meeting.        
	IL amp;FS  one of the four lenders to whom the Rajus had pledged all their 58 million shares in the company as a collateral against loans presumably funnelled to the Maytas twins  sold another 2 million shares on Monday at Rs 139.80 a share to an unnamed buyer.        
	On December 24, IL amp;FS had sold over 6 million shares at Rs 120 a share. Reports indicate that DSP Merrill Lynch has also sold shares that it held as lenders try to recoup some of the money after the Rajus failed to meet margin calls.        
	Under the rules, lenders can provide loans only up to 75 per cent of the market value of the stock. It is not known when the loans were taken but the Satyam stock has fallen from around Rs 450 a share in mid-April to Rs 148.25 at the close of trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Monday  a plunge of around 67 per cent.        
	In times like this, lenders ask borrowers to stump up cash (called margin money) to compensate for the fall in the value of the shares they had pledged against the loan. Since the cash-strapped Rajus couldnt come up with the money, the lenders started selling the stock.        
	In a media release earlier in the day, the Rajus said they had pledged their entire 8.6 per cent stake  over 58 million shares  with institutional lenders. Some lenders can exercise or may have exercised their option to liquidate shares at their discretion to cover margin calls, the note added.        
	Reports swirled that the Rajus stake in the company may have fallen to about 4 per cent.

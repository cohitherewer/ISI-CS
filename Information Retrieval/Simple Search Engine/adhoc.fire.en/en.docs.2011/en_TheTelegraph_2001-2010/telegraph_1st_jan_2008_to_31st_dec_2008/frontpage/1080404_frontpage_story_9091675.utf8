          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 3: The Orissa government today geared up its machinery to address the drinking water scarcity problem.         
	The state so far is experiencing an especially hot summer with the mercury level nearly touching 40 degrees Celsius.         
	State rural development minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan who took stock of the situation at the secretariat today, said that Rs 6.28 crore has been released for the repair of defunct tubewells and for installation of new tubewells.         
	There would be no dearth of funds to facilitate water to all houses across the state, he said. We have given a free hand to district collectors to spend as much as required to address the scarcity problem, the minister added.         
	Presently, there are more than 2.56 lakh tubewells installed in 1.39 lakh-odd habitations including 51,000 revenue villages across Orissa. Of it, around 22,000 tubewells have turned defunct, official sources said.         
	Harichandan has directed officials to take urgent steps to repair the 22,000-odd defunct tubewells and install 9,280 new ones in 2008.         
	Sixty mobile tankers, under the disposal of the rural development department, will be pressed into service for drinking water to scarce areas. The district collectors can authorise more tanks if necessary, he added.         
	Besides, 1,544 primary schools devoid of any drinking water source will be provided with tubewells. Already 629 such primary schools have been covered and the rest 915 schools will be provided with tubewells by June 2008, said the minister.         
	Tubewells will be installed in 621 girls schools and hostels located in tribal areas across the state.         
	Last year, 1,010 rural pipe water projects had been commissioned at a cost of Rs 455 crore as against the target of 1,000. This year, as many as 7,153 rural pipe water supply projects will be taken up at an estimated cost of Rs 600 crore.         
	Work has started on some projects and 2,000 projects may be commissioned by March next year.        
	On average, temperature in Orissa, particularly in the south-western districts, touches 45 degrees Celsius during summer every year.

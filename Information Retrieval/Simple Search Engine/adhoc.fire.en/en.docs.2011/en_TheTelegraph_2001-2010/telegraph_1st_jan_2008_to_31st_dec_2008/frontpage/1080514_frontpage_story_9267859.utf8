                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Patil asks Rio govt to rein in rebels
  - Stop clashes or the centre will intervene          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Shillong, May 13: Union home minister Shivraj Patil today asked the Nagaland government to rein in the militant factions operating in the state to avoid the Centre from stepping in to control the situation.         
	The clashes between the NSCN (I-M) and NSCN (K), besides the newly formed NSCN (Unification), have left at least 24 people dead since April 14 in various parts of Dimapur.        
	The minister told reporters at Raj Bhavan here that the Nagaland government should act firmly against the militant groups engaged in clashes in Dimapur or else, the matter would be taken up directly by the Centre.        
	His observations came just hours after police found the body of a businessman on the outskirts of Dimapur. Identified only as Haque by the police, he was abducted yesterday from the towns Hong Kong market, where he ran a mobile store.         
	The police said armed rebels might have executed the businessman for not being able to meet their ransom demand.         
	This year alone, at least four non-Naga businessmen have been killed in Dimapur.         
	Though no faction claimed responsibility for the abductions and killings in Dimapur, investigations ended in a blame game between the NSCN factions.        
	To a question on whether the Centre was contemplating banning the newly formed NSCN (Unification), the home minister said: We will tell the state to act tough on the militant groups which create law and order problems. If the state government fails to do so, the government of India will do what is necessary.         
	While the NSCN (I-M) and NSCN (K) are engaged in peace talks with the Centre, the NSCN (Unification)s attacks have become a cause for concern for the Nagaland government.         
	If the Centre felt the need to intervene, its first move would be to rush additional central forces to Nagaland.         
	To a query whether the state government has failed to contain law and order in Nagaland, Patil said the state was doing its bit to maintain peace. Let us not jump to conclusions that the state government is doing nothing. Both the state and the Centre are ready to tackle the situation in Nagaland, he added.         
	On talks with Ulfa in Assam, he indicated that the Centre was not averse to holding talks with any militant group in the Northeast.         
	We do not have any negative stand and are ready to have dialogues with Ulfa, the home minister said.         
	He said the government needed a formal date from the rebels for the talks to begin, reports PTI.         
	We asked them to give a date for formal talks with the leaders. But as they did not give any date, the process could not move ahead, Patil told PTI.         
	On the release of the jailed Ulfa leaders, which was one of the conditions set by Ulfa for talks, Patil said the leaders could not be released without a reason.         
	Had Ulfa given a date for the talks, the government would have considered releasing five or six jailed leaders, he said.

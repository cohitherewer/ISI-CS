          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                              
	Bokaro, April 21: The steel city has turned into a virtual fortress on the eve of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit as more than 5,000 police personnel have been pressed into service to maintain strict vigil in the town from today.        
	Six IPS officers and over 112 magistrates have been posted in Bokaro to look after the security of the Prime Minister, who would fly to Jamshedpur from here after laying the foundation stone for the expansion project of the Bokaro steel plant.         
	Six IPS officers  Vijaya Laxmi, Pankaj Kamboj, Jatin Narwal, Kuldwip Dewedi, Durga Oraon and Asim Vikrant Minz  would be positioned at different spots from the Bokaro aerodrome to the Sector V ground, where Singh would do the honours.         
	The district administration has ordered closure of all schools in Bokaro to ensure students do not face any problem due to the Prime Ministers three-hour visit to the city, as buses wont ply in the city until he leaves. National highways and roads passing through Bokaro would also be sealed from midnight.        
	Bokaro superintendent of police Priya Dubey said the police were leaving no stone unturned to ensure foolproof security to the Prime Minister. We have strictly followed the rules as specified in the Blue Book after consultation with the SPG, said Dubey.

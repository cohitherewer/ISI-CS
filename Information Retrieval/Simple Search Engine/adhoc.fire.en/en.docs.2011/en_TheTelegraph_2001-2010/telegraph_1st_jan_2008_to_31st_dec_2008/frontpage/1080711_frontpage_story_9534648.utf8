          RAJ KUMAR                              
	Baruhatu (Ranchi), July 10: Dhananjay Patar Munda, a labourer, never used to be daunted by weight. But today he found himself too weak to carry the body of his 18-year-old son.        
	The father made three attempts to carry Ramdhan Patar Munda (picture below), the unidentified victim of yesterdays rebel attack on SS High School, and failed.         
	Authorities identified Ramdhan today as a student of Panch Pargana Kisan College, Bundu. Though he has been identified, little do people know that the bright, cricket loving college student was the first educated member of his family and its only ticket to a better life.         
	Yesterday it was Ramdhans sense of loyalty and duty that made him walk 4km through dense forests to take part in the programme being held in his old school where rebel crossfire claimed four lives  Tamar MLA Ramesh Singh Munda, his two bodyguards and Ramdhans.         
	The young mans last rites were performed this afternoon on the banks of Tiruladi river, next to his village.        
	While processions and heavy deployment of guards were witnessed in the funeral of Tamar MLA and JD(U) leader Ramesh Singh Munda, Ramdhans family shed silent tears with some close family members and friends.         
	A visibly tired Dhananjay is now constantly haunted by his experience of trying to get the body of his son released from Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences last night. I have lost everything. He was the only educated person in my family, the father said.         
	While Ramdhans father and brother, Ravi, spoke to The Telegraph, the youths mother, Sovinda Devi, and the three elder sisters of the deceased, Radha Muni, Somvari and Soharmani, were not in a state to talk.         
	I would have stopped him I had never suspected that a school would be attacked, said the dumbstruck elder brother of Ramdhan.

                                                                                                           At Rs 6cr, Dhoni is top of the pops     -  Symonds second costliest under the IPL hammer
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI AND PTI                            Shah Rukh Khan and wife Gauri arrive for the IPL players bidding in Mumbai. (PTI)                                         
	Mumbai, Feb. 20: Indias charismatic ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni today emerged as the hottest property in world cricket.         
	He was snapped up by Chennai for a record $1.5 million (Rs 6 crore) in the opening minutes of the glittery IPL auction event at the Hilton Towers.         
	 Joining him in the million list soon was Australian Andrew Symonds, for whom Hyderabad shelled out a princely $1.35 million (Rs 5.4 crore).         
	Both the swashbuckling players stand to earn more than the five icons  Sachin Tendulkar (Mumbai), Sourav Ganguly (Calcutta), Rahul Dravid (Bangalore), Yuvraj Singh (Mohali) and Virendra Sehwag (Delhi)  who will command a price that is 15 per cent more than the highest paid member of their respective squads.         
	Sourav, for example, will earn about $1.09 million, the figure being worked out after the bid for Ishant Sharma. Calcutta paid $950,000 for the lanky fast-bowler, the highest bid by Red Chillies of Shah Rukh Khan.         
	Dhoni, who was not a declared icon, stands to earn more than even Sachin, who will be paid around $1.12 million. The highest bid by Mukesh Ambanis Mumbai team was for Sanath Jayasuriya ($975,000).         
	Between now and April 29, Calcutta, however, will have to learn to cheer Shoaib Akhtar when the speedster from Pakistan hurls a toe-cruncher at Sachin.        
	The Rawalpindi Express was the first to be picked up by Calcuttas Indian Premier League team owner Shah Rukh and friends at the high-on-adrenaline player auction for $425,000 (around Rs 1.7 crore). Calcuttas second success came with Ricky Ponting, who went relatively cheap at $400,000 (Rs 1.6 crore).         
	Besides Shoaib, Ishant and Ponting, Calcutta successfully bid for Brendon McCullum, Chris Gayle, Ajit Agarkar, Murali Karthik, Umar Gul and David Hussey.         
	It also picked up former Zimbabwe skipper Tatenda Taibu from the reserve pool of players for whom there were no bids in the main auction.         
	Shoaib, though, will not be available for the Sourav-led teams first match on April 18 against Bangalore, the inaugural tie of this IPL season. The Pakistani speedster will be available to play in the 44-day league only after April 27.         
	If he does play in the match against Mumbai, scheduled at the Eden on April 29, Calcutta will perhaps be the only team in world cricket at present to have two bowlers who can work up a speed above 90 miles per hour.         
	Ishant, who bowled Indian crickets fastest delivery (94.8 miles per hour) in the match against Australia last Sunday, could partner Shoaib as they attack Sachin and his men.         
	The Eden crowd has not-too-fond memories of Shoaib, who famously yorked Sachin for a first-ball duck in the first innings of a 1999 Test and triggered a riot in the stands after the little master was run out in the second following a mid-pitch collision with the bowler.         
	Calcutta will get more time to get used to cheering Ponting, who will not don the team jersey this season.         
	Eden will have to wait until next year to see Sourav actually captain the Aussie skipper, who was possibly the first high-profile person to be involved in a night club brawl in Calcutta. During the 1998 tour, Ponting was thrown out of Equinox, a now-defunct hotspot, for allegedly misbehaving with women.         
	The surprise package for the Calcutta team was David Hussey, the younger brother of Australian star Michael. Ironically, while the more established brother, along with legend Glenn McGrath, found no takers in the main auction, David was snapped up for $625,000.         
	Calcuttas coach-designate John Buchanan, in an exclusive interview to The Telegraph, described the team as a nice blend of experience and potential. But with none of the foreign players with the exception of Hussey and Taibu available for the whole tournament, it may be left to Ishant, Agarkar and Sourav to pull in the crowds.         
	The foreign players, however, will be paid a percentage calculated on the basis of the days they put in. But even if a player like Ponting is totally absent, he will make 25 per cent of the total amount he has been bid for.

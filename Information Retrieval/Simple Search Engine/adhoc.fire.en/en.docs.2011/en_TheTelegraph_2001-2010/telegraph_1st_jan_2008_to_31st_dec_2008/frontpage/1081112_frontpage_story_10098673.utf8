          A STAFF REPORTER                                                      Protesters at the AASU rally in Guwahati on Tuesday. (AP)          
	Guwahati, Nov. 11: For four hours this morning, Guwahati had a glimpse of the Assam Agitation. Thousands snaked through the thoroughfares, passionately chanting demands for eviction of Bangladeshis and fundamentalist forces from the state.        
	The Assam government today finally named Ulfa and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland as the conspirators behind the October 30 serial blasts but the investigating officials still hint at a fundamentalist group based in Bangladesh as the mastermind.        
	The All Assam Students Union, which spearheaded anti-foreigners movement, popularly known as the Assam Agitation, in 1979, today took the lead again in the common mans war against terror.        
	After 20 years, Aahoi-aah, ulai aah (come one, come all..), the catch phrase of the agitation, filled the air as residents spontaneously joined the rally led by AASU adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya.        
	Today, the situation has come to such a pass that no one can be sure whether a person who has gone to office or a student who has gone to school will return home safely, Bhattacharyya said.        
	The fundamentalist forces had not posed a serious threat to Assam; they had jeopardised the nations security, he said.         
	Save Assam to save the country, he added.        
	AASU president Shankar Prasad Ray, addressing the gathering just before the start of the march, around 11.30am, cautioned the government against trying to protect fundamentalist forces.         
	It is because of their soft handling of fundamentalist forces that the serial blasts could be engineered. Bang-ladeshis have to be pushed back to rid the state of fundamentalist forces, he said.        
	AASU had championed the interests of the state in the past and, if need be, would start another mass movement to fight against terrorism, Ray said.        
	He, however, clarified that the AASUs fight was not against any community but against terrorists and divisive forces.         
	Buoyed by the overwhelming participation in the rally  over 20,000 people joined the march  AASU general secretary Tapan Kumar Gogoi said it should serve as an eye-opener for the government.        
	The people of Assam have once again demonstrated that, if necessary, they can come out onto the streets to protect their right to live with dignity, he said.        
	Ulfa, on the other hand, today claimed that the RSS was behind the serial blasts.        
	The outfit tried to buttress its claim with erroneous facts. It claimed that there had been no terror attacks in any BJP-ruled state, ignoring the blasts in Ahmedabad and Jaipur.         
	Vehemently denying Ulfas charge, the RSS said it was the outfits ploy to shield its Bangladesh-based mentors.        
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi has convened an all-party meeting tomorrow to discuss the situation arising out of the serial blasts and how best to prevent a repeat of such dastardly acts, sources in the CMO said.

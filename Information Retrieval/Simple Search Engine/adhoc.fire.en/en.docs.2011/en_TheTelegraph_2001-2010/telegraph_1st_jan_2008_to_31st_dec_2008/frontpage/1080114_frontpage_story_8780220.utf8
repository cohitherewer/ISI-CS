 Two days down, beast untamed

     A STAFF REPORTER
                          
	Calcutta, Jan. 13: The Burrabazar fire stubbornly flickered and flared through a second day, resisting 800 firefighters for 48 hours and spreading to the 13-storey Nandaram building.
    
	Army jawans, however, averted a potential explosion in the 12th-floor generator room, packed with 300 litres of fuel, by taking the stairs and spraying foam at the first signs of smoke from the room.
    
	Rajesh Mehta was on tenterhooks watching the flames spread from the gutted Kashiram building to Nandarams 12th floor in the afternoon, and then creep down towards his two fifth-floor shops. Till late tonight, floors 8 to 13 were on fire. Thick smoke billowed from the rear of the roof at 12.30am on Monday.
    
	For the past 48 hours they have been telling us the fire would be under control in a while, Mehtas voice almost cracked.
    
	Fire minister Pratim Chatterjees reply to reporters betrayed frustration. Im not an astrologer, I cant predict. I dont know how much combustible material is stacked inside. We are trying, he said.
    
	The flames were the strongest at Nandarams rear, facing narrow lanes and congested buildings that kept the fire tenders out till 11pm before a few squeezed through.
    
	Desperate traders conjectured that the losses would be at least Rs 500 crore as they waited behind makeshift barricades on Brabourne Road amid fears of a collapse.
    
	Building engineers said 550C is the critical temperature when steels tensile strength drops to half, concrete begins to crumble and a cave-in is possible. But no one knew how hot the building was.
    
	A collapse had looked imminent around 12.50pm, when thick black smoke billowed out of the generator room, signalling that the fire from burnt-down Kashiram had spread to Nandaram.
    
	We had to intervene  it could have led to an explosion. Our men averted the crisis, said Colonel Vikram Taneja, overseeing the army efforts. For a moment, the mood had lifted and some of the traders even clapped.
    
	A generator room on the 12th floor is like a bomb, said Ashok Gupta, head of engineering at the Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee.
    
	We are not sure about the buildings structural stability. The civic body will inspect and inform us, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said.
    
	A blast did cause a scare around 7.40pm, though, and sent flames shooting towards the rear of the rooftop.
    
	Hey Bhagwan, ab kya hoga (Oh God, what will happen now)? screamed a man standing near the police kiosk on Brabourne Road.
    
	A fire official said an LPG cylinder may have set off the blast, adding that Nandarams rooftop seems to have been damaged.
    
	Army officers, in the forefront of todays efforts, again complained that the state fire officials had not cooperated yesterday.
    
	Anil Kumar, director-general of police, fire services, denied this. Its been a massive operation and we cooperated with everyone. There may have been a communication gap, he said.
    
	Buddha fuel
    
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee appeared to obliquely criticise the civic authorities by questioning the legality of the market buildings construction. The citys buildings are notorious for cramped construction and failure to follow safety norms.
    
	I am feeling angry. You know how these buildings have come up, Bhattacharjee told reporters. 
    
	He added that the government had dropped plans to use helicopters to douse the flames after the army said the propellers might fan the fire. 
    
	We have to douse the flames. I dont know what caused it, he had earlier said at the Brigade Parade Grounds.
    
	Raje salve
    
	A healing touch came from Rajasthan, the home state of many of the 4,000 traders who have lost at least 2,500 shops to the blaze. Chief minister Vasundhara Raje said a seven-member team, including ministers and MLAs, would arrive in Calcutta to help.
    
	Most of the affected traders are from Rajasthan and thats why the chief minister is sending the team. The team will reach here tomorrow and meet the traders, said a spokesperson for Rajasthan Foundation, a Rajasthan government body.

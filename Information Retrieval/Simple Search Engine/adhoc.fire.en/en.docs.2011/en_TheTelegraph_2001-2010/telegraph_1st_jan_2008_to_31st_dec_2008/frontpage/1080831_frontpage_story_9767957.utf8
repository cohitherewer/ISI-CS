	Singur/Calcutta, Aug. 30: Six Japanese experts who were helping with the Nanos production today left the city amid the uncertainty around the project created by Mamata Banerjees dharna.        
	We are leaving for now because we dont want to sit idle. It is very unfortunate, whatevers happening. I really cant say whats going to happen but I hope it works out for the best, said Makoto Shimode, one of the six engineers who caught a Thai Airways flight to Tokyo.        
	We dont know when the blockade will be lifted and when we can return to work. We have been told it may be possible to come back in about a weeks time. So maybe then we will return.        
	Naotaka Ishikawa, another Japanese team member, said: We had to leave because of the political turmoil at the project site. We have never seen anything like this. Our bosses in Japan are very keen to see the project through. I hope we will be able to come back in a week or so after the fiasco is over.        
	No work took place at the Nano project for the second day running with all the workers staying away. The labour contractors and most labourers from other states or districts have gone home, though many can be back at a days notice.        
	A labourer from Bihar who was too scared to reveal his name said he would leave in a couple of days if work did not resume. Our contractor has gone home out of fear. They (the protesters) are assaulting workers.        
	A Tata spokesperson said: There has been no improvement in the ground situation so far. Hence the conditions are not conducive for resuming work today. We continue to assess the situation closely.        
	Tomorrow is a Sunday, and the earliest that work can resume is Monday, that too only if the ground situation improves.        
	Casual worker Rajendra Singh from Bihar said: We never saw this kind of protest in Bihar. They are having fun on the highway and inconveniencing common people.        
	All the factory gates were barricaded and manned by policemen. Hooghly police chief Rajeev Mishra promised security if Tata Motors employees came to work.        
	The vendors said they hadnt received any instructions from Tata Motors. But they said the Tatas could still meet the October deadline if they rolled the Nano out from their factories in Pune and Pantnagar, Uttarakhand.        
	But we expect production to remain low, a vendor said, adding he would be able to supply components from his other plants in India.        
	The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers joined the industry chorus to save the Singur project, issuing a release that quoted its former president Jagdish Khattar, who was once MD of Maruti.        
	Khattar said: The Nano project helps in the fulfilment of (the) common minimum programme. For every additional car that rolls out of the factory, five jobs would be created. (The project) would not only lead to development of the state but would also produce a new demand centre for local produce and agricultural products.        
	State Congress chief Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said his party didnt want the Tatas to quit Singur since that would send wrong signals to investors. He urged the state government to call an all-party meeting.        
	With reports by Sanjay Mandal, Meghdeep Bhattacharyya, Imran Ahmed Siddiqui and Sambit Saha

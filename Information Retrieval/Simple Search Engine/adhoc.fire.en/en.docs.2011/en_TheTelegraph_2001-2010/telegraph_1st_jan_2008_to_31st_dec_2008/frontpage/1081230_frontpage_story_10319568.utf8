The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | A battle won, Bangla braces for outcome 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   A battle won, Bangla braces for outcome

	Dhaka, Dec. 29: Her plucked-and-arched eyebrows flanking brown shades, pink chiffon chador over head with a wisp of grey showing, Begum Khaleda Zia has just cast her vote in the centre at Adamjee Cantonment School and College here.        
	Workers of her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), she alleges, have been harassed overnight in Rangpur and Satkhira, but she is hoping the elections will be peaceful.         
	The Awami Leagues 14-party combine is widely tipped to take an edge over the BNP-led four-party alliance. Zia may be positioning herself for an upset after claiming she was on the road to victory. (Late tonight, the League was leading in 14 seats. Clear trends in the 300 seats are expected to emerge by Tuesday forenoon.)        
	But overriding suspicions of election engineering  a phrase peculiar to Bangladesh that implies the results may be manipulated after the votes are cast  there is hope that this time at least, for the years gone by and for the lives lost, there will be an acceptance of the results.        
	Dhaka this afternoon is unusually serene, with a restrained tension, as if it does not want to fall back upon itself, when elections meant loud and violent street-fighting with sticks and stones and country-made bombs.        
	In Banani and Gulshan, Dhakas upscale areas, and in Uttara, in the upmarket township north of the city, there are complaints that identity card numbers for some voters do not match the figures on the electoral lists.        
	Such allegations are quite common in Bangladesh polls, but this time voters turned out in large numbers. The complaints havent snowballed into rioting. Indeed, there is a collective heave of relief as voting is just coming to a close that this has been one of the most peaceful elections in Dhaka ever.         
	Outside the capital, there is an air of festivity. An Indian election observer driving to Sylhet, about 100km east of Dhaka, messaged that the team drove through fog for almost the entire stretch, crawling with foglights and flashers.        
	But everywhere, we were greeted by a warm people, the SMS read. Despite the inclement weather, people had lined up in their best attire, adorned, inevitably, with monkey caps and gloves that in their colours made up a huge bouquet for democracy. In most booths, there were more women than men in long queues.        
	The Bengali is liable to burst into festivity and/or frustration almost at will. But in a nation of Bengalis, without  as in India  the sobering influence of the cosmopolitanism of other communities, they are more easily capable of lapsing into orgies of extreme emotionalism.        
	Hyperbole can overcome rhetoric. Rhetoric overtakes everyday speak. The other day, Khaleda Zia described in graphic word pictures how alleged Awami League supporters sprayed gunpowder in a bus full of passengers, set it alight, and then did a danse macabre on the corpses.        
	Such descriptions are almost the horrible equivalent of the ecstatic bright yellows and reds that paint Bangladesh in vibrant colours during Poila Boisakh and Saraswati Puja, and, indeed, in some parts, in these polls. A colleague puts it succinctly: this country is beautiful and beleaguered.         
	On the streets of Dhaka today, there is speculation over whether Khaleda Zias apology yesterday can prove to be a game-changer for her alliance. Sheikh Hasina Wajed, who voted along with her younger sister Sheikh Rehana, hoped that whatever the results, they would be acceptable to all.        
	As of this afternoon, Bangladesh is patting itself on the back for its cleanest election.

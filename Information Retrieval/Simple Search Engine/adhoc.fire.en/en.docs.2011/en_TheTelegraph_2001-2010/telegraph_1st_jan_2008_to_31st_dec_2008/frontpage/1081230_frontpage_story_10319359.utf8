          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, Dec. 29: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today made it clear in Delhi that it was no longer interested in secretary-level tripartite meetings and sought political dialogue and repeal of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council Act 1988.        
	The demand was made during the second round of tripartite meeting between the Morcha delegation and representatives of the Centre and the state government.        
	We have demanded that the next round of meeting on Gorkhaland must take place at the political level. We also believe that the DGHC Act must be repealed immediately and all council employees must be suitably absorbed by the state government in their departments, said Roshan Giri, the general secretary who headed the 17-member delegation of the Morcha, over the phone from Delhi.         
	 The DGHC was formed under a state act and the council currently employs about 7,000 employees who have not yet been regularised but are under contract.        
	We told them that the DGHC was a hindrance to achieving Gorkhaland and it had to be done away with as early as possible. We have categorically maintained that our party will neither accept the Sixth Schedule status nor the DGHC, said Giri.         
	The Morcha leader said the officials present at the meeting  Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta, state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and state home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti  did not make any announcement with regard to repealing of the DGHC Act.        
	 The officials admitted that the council had failed but restrained from making a commitment. Deb, however, said repealing the DGHC Act was not a major problem but added that there were other complications like how to execute development projects till statehood was granted, said Raju Pradhan, the assistant secretary of the Morcha.        
	The third round of tripartite meeting is expected to take place in March (before the general elections) even though the dates have not yet been fixed.         
	 It is learnt that both the Centre and state government officials stressed on the need to carry on with development work till the next meeting. They said various central schemes had not yet reached the economically poorer sections, but we argued that it was not a priority as the government had failed to carry out development work in the past, said Pradhan.         
	 The hill delegates told the officials that the decision on whether state government offices would be allowed to remain open after January 6 would be taken after a discussion within the party.         
	We also talked about state-sponsored terrorism and the Centre is likely to take it up with the state government soon. We discussed Bangaladeshi infiltration and the threat to national security. The Centre did not come up with any proposal like granting us the status of an Union Territory but we had made it clear that we would accept nothing less than statehood, said Giri.

  - Shutdown in memory of victims          BASANT RAWAT                            Prerak and Kinjal Shah                                        
	Ahmedabad, July 28: Asarwa, the neighbourhood of Ahmedabads Civil Hospital, shut down today in tribute to seven residents, two of them schoolboys, who died in the blast after rushing in to help.        
	A spontaneous bandh was also observed 107km away in Modasa, hometown of Dr Prerak Shah who was killed with wife Kinjal and their unborn son. The communally sensitive town, whose majority Muslim population had suffered in the 2002 riots, stayed peaceful.        
	No political party or organisation called the bandh  it was entirely spontaneous, said businessman Vinod Shah in Modasa, Sabarkantha district. Not only were schools, colleges, shops and offices closed, even tea vendors and paan sellers kept their business shut.        
	A large number of people gathered in a hall to mourn for Dr Shah, 32, and the five months pregnant Kinjal, 28, who had gone to Civil Hospital for a check-up when the twin blasts happened.        
	Dr Shahs younger brother Kaushal, who works with a multinational in the US, and brother-in-law Sankit Shah, a pharmacy student in Bangalore, have been informed about the deaths, said a cousin who also works at Civil Hospital.        
	Dr Pranay Shah had been lucky. He was inside the trauma centre when the bombs went off in the car park but did not suffer serious injuries. He said Kinjal died on the spot while Dr Prerak Shah succumbed to his injuries a few minutes later.        
	All seven schools in Asarwa stayed closed in memory of Ajay Chauhan, 14, and Sumit Gajera, 16  students of Class IX and XI  who had been among the first to reach the hospital, less than 1km from their home, on Saturday evening.        
	They and the areas other slain residents were all volunteers of the Asarwa Youth Club, whose members would rush to the hospital to help victims and donate blood after any accident or clash, as they had done during the 2002 riots. This is the reason we had formed the organisation, said the head of the club, Sanjay Patel.        
	One of the dead volunteers was Dushyant Bhajraja, 38, who was also a clerk in the hospitals cancer ward. His sons -- Yash, 7, and Rohan, 10  who were learning to ride a bicycle in the compound, have been admitted with serious injuries.        
	Asarwa fears its toll could rise. Electrician Manubhai Thakor, 25, and driver Bhupat Darwar, 25, are badly injured. Thakor was fixing lights outside the trauma centre as an aid to the volunteers who were wheeling in the injured from the earlier 15 blasts in the city.        
	Youth Club member Jayesh Dave, 36, was shifted to Rajasthan Hospital where he is fighting for his life. He suffered 95 per cent burns and the doctors are likely to remove the ventilator as soon as his brother arrives from Australia.

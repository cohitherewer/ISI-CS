          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA AMP; SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAV                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 18: Heads rolled in the state today, with chief minister Shibu Soren striking off the names of rural development minister Anosh Ekka and urban development minister Harinarayan Rai from the cabinet list.         
	Soren removed Ekka and Rai on the basis of FIRs lodged against them by the Vigilance Bureau for allegedly amassing assets disproportionate to their known sources of income.        
	A PIL demanding a CBI probe into the disproportionate assets of five other ministers, besides the two, is still pending before Jharkhand High Court.        
	Soren forwarded the sacking order to the Raj Bhavan today. A letter was also sent to Patna by a special messenger for the consideration of Bihar Governor R.L. Bhatia, currently in-charge of Jharkhand affairs in the absence of Governor Syed Sibtey Razi.         
	Soren conceded that he was yet to decide on the substitutes for Ekka and Rai, but experts pointed out that the chief minister would have to hurry with the process because the cabinets strength could not remain less than 12.        
	Though Soren insisted that his decision was influenced by the disproportionate assets case, insiders believe that Ekkas refusal to withdraw his Jharkhand Party nominee, Raja Peter, from the Tamar by-election cost him his berth.        
	Since it would have been politically incorrect to sack Ekka alone, the chief minister sacrificed Rai, too, a source claimed. Insiders also believe that by taking the step, Soren had sent out a clear message to his coalition partners that he should not be taken for granted.         
	He could have taken this decision after the by-election, but he chose to convey the message that he would not tolerate indiscipline in his ranks before the polls, said an aide.        
	Talking to The Telegraph, Ekka, however, claimed that Soren had been unnerved by the threat that his candidate Raja Peter poses in the imminent Tamar battle.        
	If corruption was the main issue, why has Soren spared other ministers who, too, are facing similar charges? he said.        
	Overtly sarcastic, Ekka expressed his gratitude to the chief minister for providing him the scope to devote time to his party and the people.         
	He sacked me from the council and not from the state. I can now devote more time to my party and I know that the people will give a fitting reply to such an unfair move, he said.        
	Rai complained that Soren had made him a scapegoat simply because he was irked by Ekkas decision. But, unlike his colleague, he was more philosophical. Such things keep happening in power politics, he said.        
	Both the politicians are yet to decide on their future course of action. While Ekka maintained that he would reconsider extending support to the Soren government after January 2, Rai said that he was yet to think about the issue.        
	However, there is no immediate threat to the Shibu Soren government, even if both members withdraw support.         
	What remains to be seen is whether is action catalyses the resentment that is already brewing among Independents. UPA steering committee chief Madhu Koda argued that the dismissals would have little impact on the government, as the chief minister had consulted all partners before taking the decision.         
	He, however, parried a question on whether he would join the Soren cabinet.         
	Congress legislature party leader Manoj Yadav described Sorens move as a fight against corruption, while Opposition BJP trashed the action as eyewash.         
	Soren is a patron to corrupt practices. He sacked Ekka because the latter dared him in Tamar, said BJP state president P.N. Singh.  
	BEHIND THE SCENES  
	Official reason  
	Vigilance Bureau FIR against them for amassing assets disproportionate to their known source of income  
	On the grapevine  
	Anosh Ekkas refusal to  withdraw his nominee from  the Tamar by-election. Shibu Soren is also contesting from the seat and has to win to  retain the chief ministers chair  
	Soren was under immense pressure from UPA allies  who wanted Ekkas ouster.
  His removal would not have been politically correct during the by-election  
	Rais removal may be personal vendetta under political garb  
	Political fallout  
	There is no imminent threat to the UPA government as it still  enjoys the majority in the House. Moreover, Soren enjoys support of at least two BJP MLAs  Vishnu Bhaiya and Manohar Tekriwal  who will come to his rescue in case other Independents come out in support of Ekka and Rai

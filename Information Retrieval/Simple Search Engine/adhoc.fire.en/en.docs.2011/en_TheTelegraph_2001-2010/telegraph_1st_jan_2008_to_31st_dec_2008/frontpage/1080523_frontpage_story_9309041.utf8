          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                     
	New Delhi, May 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met Naga rebel leader Thuingaleng Muivah on Tuesday after denying him an audience for months, possibly with an eye on the renewed violence in the Northeast.        
	The meeting, sources said, showed that the Centre was keen on using the NSCN (I-M)s influence over various rebel outfits to buy peace in the region.         
	The NSCN (I-M) is said to have been instrumental in getting at least some of the outfits in the region to the negotiating table.         
	The low-profile meeting was also attended by the national security adviser, M.K. Narayanan, sources said.         
	It was decided that the Naga talks would continue and both sides would try and find an honourable, mutually-acceptable peaceful solution, said a source. Muivah is understood to have been satisfied with the meeting.         
	For more than a month, the rebel leader has been camping in the national capital to meet the Prime Minister. The outfit has witnessed some of the worst factional wars in Nagaland in the past few weeks, with the home minister warning the state government that the Centre would be forced to intervene if it failed to check the violence.

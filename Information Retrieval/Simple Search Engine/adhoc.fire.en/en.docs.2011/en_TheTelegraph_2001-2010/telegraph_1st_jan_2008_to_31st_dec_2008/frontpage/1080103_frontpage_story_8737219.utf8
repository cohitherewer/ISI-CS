The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Apes laughed first
                                                                                                        Apes laughed first
                                Orangutans know better                            
	London, Jan. 2: Laughter was not developed first by humans but by our close biological cousins the apes, according to new research.        
	Scientists at the University of Portsmouth have found that orangutans have a sense of empathy and mimicry which is an essential part of laughter.        
	Marina Davila Ross, of the universitys psychology department, studied the way facial expressions were picked up and copied by 25 orangutans at four primate centres around the world. When one of the orangutans displayed an open, gaping mouth  the equivalent of laughter  the researchers examined the response of its playmate.        
	Davila Ross explained that often the playmate displayed the same expression less than half a second later, suggesting the mimicry was an involuntary display.         
	She said that the findings shed new light on empathy and its importance for animals which live in groups.        
	She added that it also revealed that empathy of positive emotions or contagious laughter evolved before humans. Davila Ross said: What is clear now is the building blocks of positive emotional contagion and empathy that refer to rapid involuntary facial mimicry in humans evolved prior to humankind.         
	The research was published in the journal Biology Letters.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Jayapradas brother had challenged the attachment in the high court. During proceedings in the case, the solvency factor popped up.

	The court had not specifically mentioned that the MP was bankrupt but declared insolvent Theatre Jayaprada, represented by its partners, and Theatre Raj, represented by its partners.        
	Consequent upon the order, all their assets, wherever situated, vest with the official assignee, S. Sitrarasu, a court-appointed official said.        
	According to the Constitution, anyone declared insolvent cannot be a member of Parliament or state legislatures.

	In the Lok Sabha Who is Who, the MP, who won on a Samajwadi Party ticket from Rampur in Uttar Pradesh, is referred to as P. Jaya Prada. But in the film industry, she is referred to as Jayaprada. The sources said lawyers were also examining whether the discrepancy in the names would help her case.        
	The corporation had seized film stock and pieces of furniture in the theatres, leading to their closure.

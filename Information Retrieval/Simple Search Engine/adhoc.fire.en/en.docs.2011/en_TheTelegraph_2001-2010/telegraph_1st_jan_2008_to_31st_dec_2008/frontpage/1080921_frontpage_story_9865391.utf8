The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 15 fuel thieves die in Assam                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      15 fuel thieves die in Assam             MINTU DEY FROM SAIDING AMP; OUR BUREAU                                    
	Sept. 20: Fifteen persons died and five were injured while pilfering fuel from an oil-carrying train at Saiding in Assams Karbi Anglong district bordering Nagaland late last night. Two NSCN (Isak-Muivah) cadres were among the dead.        
	The train was carrying oil from Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) to Mughalsarai in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Neither police nor experts could attribute any cause to the deaths though survivors said they encountered a foul-smelling gas which emanated from one of the oil rakes which was opened by the suspected oil thieves.        
	The faces of some of the dead were scalded or twisted, while some had traces of blood seeping out of their noses. Police said they even saw traces of blood in their vomit.         
	NRL authorities said none of the 48 oil rakes had any gaseous product. While 16 rakes had high speed diesel, 31 had petrol. One wagon was not loaded as it was found to have a technical fault. None of these rakes were carrying anything which could have caused such deaths, NRL senior manager (marketing) Bhaskar Jyoti Phukon said.        
	Eight bodies were found at the site of the incident. Two bodies were recovered from the banks of the river, indicating that the persons had fallen down and died while fleeing. Seven bodies were recovered from households in Dhansiripar village, which is just 2km from the incident site. The village is in Nagaland, just across the Dhansiri which demarcates the two states.        
	Dimapur superintendent of police L. Lotha said the bodies of seven persons were shifted from Dhansiripar by their family members before the police arrived.         
	Karbi Anglong superintendent of police K.K. Sarma said, People of the nearby areas told us about poisonous gas. Only the post-mortem report will tell us what happened. The post-mortems will be carried out in Diphu and Dimapur tomorrow.         
	Of the five injured, two were taken to the Diphu Civil Hospital and three to Dimapur hospital. Lotha said tonight that the police have taken one of the injured, Tiben Kumar, who was admitted to Dimapur hospital, into custody.         
	Quoting Kumar, Lotha said 100 persons had stopped the train and were filling plastic drums with oil pilfered from a wagon when some of them started having breathing problems.                                       
	Kumar panicked and tried to flee from the spot. But he vomited, fell down and lost consciousness.              
	Lotha said Kumars version was their only source of reconstructing the incident and they hoped to get more details from him once he recuperated. Since he has not recovered fully, we will interrogate him later, he added.        
	Diphu hospital superintendent Akhil Chandra Narzary said the two persons brought in had no physical injury. While one is still unconscious, the other is complaining of dizziness. It is difficult to say what is the cause of such a condition. More tests need to be carried out to come to a conclusion, he added.        
	One of those admitted to Diphu hospital is 18-year-old Sindhar of Bonkhailo, an Adivasi-dominated village, just 2.5 km from the spot. I was ploughing my field at 4.30am when I smelt something foul. Before I knew what was happening, I lost consciousness. When I came to, I found myself in hospital, he said from the hospital bed.        
	A petroleum expert at the Jorhat-based North East Institute of Science and Technology S.D. Baruah ruled out any possibility of poisoning from petroleum products. Petrol, diesel and even aviation turbine fuel are harmless. Even the gas which emanates from them cannot kill any one, he said over phone.        
	Besides petrol and diesel, NRL also despatches kerosene and aviation fuel from its refinery to different places.        
	A source said, Residue left behind in the wagons could also have triggered a chemical reaction leading to formation of poisonous gases.        
	The magnitude of the oil pilferage racket  which has been active in this area for some time now  can be gauged from the fact that nearly 1,000 plastic containers and flexible pipes, left behind by the thieves, were found at the spot.        
	The recovery of the bodies of two NSCN (Isak-Muivah) cadres points to the fact that rebel groups are also involved in the highly-profitable racket.        
	The Karbi Anglong police chief said, Last nights was the biggest attempt we have come across so far. Earlier too, we had chased away thieves trying to steal oil by stopping trains.        
	NF Railway chief public relation officer Samir Goswami said the trains guard reported the incident of oil theft to Dhansari station, just a few kilometres from the spot, after the thieves had left.        
	The train arrived at Dhansiri station at 1.20am and there were signs of pilferage in a few of the wagons. We are investigating the matter. But the train was allowed to proceed this morning, he said.         
	He said the Railways had nothing to do with the death of the suspected oil thieves. It is a law and order matter and police will handle it, he added.A police official in Karbi Anglong said the people involved in oil pilferage were mainly from Dimasa, Karbi and Naga tribes though other tribesmen were also involved.

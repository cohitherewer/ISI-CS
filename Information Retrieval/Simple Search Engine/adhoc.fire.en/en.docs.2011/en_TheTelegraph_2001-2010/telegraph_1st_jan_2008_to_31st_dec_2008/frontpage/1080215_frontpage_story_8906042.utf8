The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Navy wants to swim with Pakistan

	New Delhi, Feb. 14: Indias navy chief, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, wants to have joint exercises with the Pakistan Navy, an idea that stands conventional military thought in this country on its head.        
	I want it, we want it, Admiral Mehta told The Telegraph after setting the tone at the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), an India-launched initiative with the chiefs of navies from the countries of the Indian Ocean region.        
	Admiral Sureesh Mehta is venturing where neither his predecessors nor his peers have dared, though Indias navy did have elementary search and rescue exercises with the Chinese navy. India showed a willingness to break more barriers last year when its former army chief, General Joginder Jaswant Singh, crafted a joint exercise with China.        
	The only event that can possibly trump the significance of that handshake-across-the-Himalayas is a joint exercise with Pakistan. Indias navy chief has today brought such an event into the realm of the possible.         
	The ION symposium is designed to mark a shift, however slight, from competitive to collaborative security. India believes that this would not be possible in the region without Pakistan. Nearly 27 chiefs of navies and maritime forces from the countries in the region were present at this mornings inaugural.        
	The heads and their representatives go into a separate conclave of chiefs for two days from tomorrow in Delhi and Goa. Pakistan will not have its man there but it is welcome to join, said Admiral Mehta.        
	Before going into the conclave, the admiral had a very specific message for Pakistan - it is wanted.         
	Admiral Mehtas is a very clear message, unlikely to be delivered by the head of a military service, least of all one who is the chairman, chiefs of staff committee, and the seniormost serving military officer in the country, without the explicit backing of the political establishment. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who inaugurated the event, said it was time for all countries to come together against transnational crimes.        
	In a brief conversation with The Telegraph after the inaugural, Admiral Mehta said he was looking forward to greater interaction with countries in a break from the past.        
	Asked if he was willing to have joint exercises with Pakistans navy because he had stressed on interoperability - the capability of navies to jointly go into operations - the admiral said: It would have followed as a matter of course if they were here (in the conclave of chiefs). Now I suppose it may happen in a third country.        
	It was Indias navy that took the initiative of holding joint exercises at an elementary level with China in 2005.        
	Pakistans naval chief did not attend the IONS but Islamabad was represented through its high commissioner and the naval attache. Asked if he was upset by the absence of the Pakistan naval chief, Admiral Mehta at first exclaimed it is all politics, you know! but then went on to add: Please take special note of what I had to say (in my speech) to those who are not here.        
	The relevant passage from his speech reads: For the few against whom circumstances have so conspired as to preclude their presence in this inaugural event, I would like to send a message to say, rest assured that your places are reserved. I can say this with the confidence born out of certainty, because the IONS initiative is, at its most fundamental level, all about inclusiveness.        
	In 2006, Indias and Pakistans coastal security agencies established a telephone hotline connection to sort out disputes over fishermen. Bilateral naval interaction has so far been limited to that level.

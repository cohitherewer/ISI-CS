  - THOUSANDS BID ADIEU TO RAMESH MUNDA, CM MISSES FUNERAL          RAJ KUMAR AND SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                            Hundreds of people join the funeral procession of Ramesh Singh Munda on Main Road in Ranchi on Thursday. Picture by Manik Bose                                         
	Bundu/Ranchi, July 10: Thousands watched as Ramesh Singh Munda was cremated on the banks of the Kanchi river this evening, while 5km away at the blood splattered SS High School, where the former minister and JD(U) leader was gunned by rebels yesterday, was teaming with forensic experts and sniffer dogs.         
	Students and teachers, who had come in yesterday to be felicitated by the leader for their academic performance, were missing today. Instead, the school, spread over three acres on the outskirts of the town, looked like a war zone  bullet marks on blood-stained walls, abandoned shoes, books strewn about.        
	School headmaster Umesh Chandra Gyani, who had organised yesterdays programme on the directives of the district education officer and the school managing committee, has been detained by the police for questioning.         
	Over 10,000 villagers and politicians, including Arjun Munda and JD(U) MLAs, participated in the funeral procession that began from the slain Tamar legislators residence near the Bundu Referral Hospital.         
	Ironically, no minister from the state government attended the last rites in Bundu.         
	Earlier in Ranchi, as his body lay in state on the Assembly premises, VIPs, including Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, chief minister Madhu Koda, deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi, leader of the Opposition Arjun Munda, former Gujarat governor Kailashpati Mishra and state BJP chief P.N. Singh paid floral tributes to the departed leader.        
	Several leaders from Bihar, Speaker Uday Narayan Choudhary, minister Jeetan Ram Manjhi, JD(U) chief whip in the Bihar Assembly Shravan Kumar and former Union minister Nagmani, were also present.         
	Razi also took time off to meet Ramesh Singh Mundas relatives to express his condolences.        
	Later, JD(U) partymen took out a procession, before Ramesh Singh Mundas body was brought to Chirudih village in Bundu for the funeral that was conducted with state honours.        
	The most grim reminder of yesterdays mindless attack was a blood-stained desk riddled with bullet marks in the corner of the large room where the felicitation function was being held. Ramesh Singh Munda, said eyewitnesses, hid behind the desk while the attack was on.         
	The chairs of the room were still lying haphazardly. The table decorations were ruined, as bouquets lay strewn about. A mandar and dafli, brought for a musical interlude to yesterdays function, were lying in a corner, unused.         
	As for the shoes and slippers, the investigators had got them packed in a black bag.         
	A portion of the balcony behind the room had turned dark red with the blood of the two security guards  Khursheed Alam and Shivnath Minz. CID officers confirmed they were gunned down by the rebels first, before they entered the room to attack Ramesh Singh Munda.         
	Elsewhere, the school looked deserted. Inside room No. 6, there were two exercise books of Samir Nayak of Class VIII. In another classroom, a few samosas lay wasted, no doubt a part of yesterdays celebrations.         
	Inside another room, Jungle Ki Atmakatha was scribbled on the blackboard in Devnagari script, that days lesson acquiring a telling significance to what had transpired.         
	Headmaster Gyani, who joined the school a month ago after being transferred from Bahragora in East Singhbhum, was still terrified.         
	My eyes were shut as I lay on the floor as I couldnt flee like the guests who were sitting beside me. I opened my eyes only when the firing stopped and noticed only the blue trousers of my students.

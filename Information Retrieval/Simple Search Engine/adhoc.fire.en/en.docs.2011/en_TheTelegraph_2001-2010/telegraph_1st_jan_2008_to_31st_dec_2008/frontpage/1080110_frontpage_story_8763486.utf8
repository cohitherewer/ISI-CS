     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
               
	Ranchi, Jan. 9: Twenty-four hours after the Jharkhand State Electricity Board issued a public notice stressing that the prevailing power crisis would blow over, a technical snag at Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Ltd.(TVNL) plunged the entire state into darkness. 
    
	TVNL chief engineer P.N. Singh said the snag on the Biharshariff section led to a collapse of the thermal power plant early this morning. Generation fell from 200 MW to zero. TNVL was scheduled to be started late in the evening but power supply would be restored early tomorrow. 
    
	Figures released by the central load despatch centre indicated that generation barely touched 100MW against an average demand of 750 MW. Efforts to make up the shortfall by drawing 200 MW from the central grid, failed. And JSEB was forced to order blackouts throughout the state. 
    
	Meanwhile, the FJCCI, which is planning to ask Koda not to sign any more MoUs, is upset at JSEBs suggestion that industrial units should cut down consumption from 6-10pm for domestic consumers. 
    
	As it is the industry is suffering a power crisis. Now, they are asking us to close down at peak hours, said FJCCI president Manoj Naredi.

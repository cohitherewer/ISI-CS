          A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                            Lata Mangeshkar                                  
	Calcutta: Lata Mangeshkar will be a special invitee at the felicitation of the 1983 World Cup-winning squad by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) scheduled to be held in New Delhi on Sunday.        
	Yes, an invitation has gone to Lataji to attend the function. Invites have also been sent to all former Test captains, all Test cricketers based in Delhi, women international cricketers in Delhi, womens former and current India captains and past office bearers of the BCCI, sources said.        
	The president and secretaries of all state associations have also been invited to the function.        
	The invitation to the melody queen by the BCCI has been extended to thank her for helping raise funds to honour Kapils Devils through a special concert following their triumph in the quadrennial extravaganza for the first and only time.        
	The BCCI needed Rs 14.50 lakh (the additional Rs 50,000 for manager P.R. Man Singh), but the money just wasnt there. Eventually, Lata was requested to help by staging a fund-raising concert. She did it free of cost.        
	The concert, held at Indraprastha Stadium in New Delhi, helped raise Rs 20 lakh . The team members were paid Rs 1 lakh each from the proceeds of the function.        
	Two decades later, when Jagmohan Dalmiya was the president, the BCCI repaid its debt to Lata by making an exception when she requested a fund-raising match for her Pune hospital.        
	The fund-raiser was held soon after the 2003 World Cup, a tournament where Team India (led by Sourav Ganguly) made the final.        
	A BCCI media release stated that union minister of sports M S Gill and high commissioners of cricketing nations would also be among the dignitaries present on the occasion.         
	On the same morning, the working committee, headed by its president Sharad Pawar will meet, sources said.        
	The agenda includes tabling of reports of various sub-committees like the tours programmes and fixtures committee, the umpires committee, the pitch and grounds committee and the National Cricket Academy for ratification, they said.        
	The conduct of the highly successful IPL is not on the agenda, the sources said.

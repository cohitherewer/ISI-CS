 Ulfa 
 R-Day 
 plan

     A STAFF REPORTER
                        
	Guwahati, Jan. 11: Police today claimed to have busted an Ulfa plan to strike in Guwahati during Republic Day after unearthing five powerful bombs fitted with programmable timer devices made in France from a bookstall at Barama in Baksa district.
    
	The bombs were traced on the basis of information provided by an Ulfa militant arrested yesterday. The militant, Arjun Deka, had been entrusted the job of ferrying and planting the three bombs in Guwahati.
    
	Baksa superintendent of police P.K. Datta quoted Deka as saying that a senior member of Ulfas 709 Battalion, Plaban Hazarika, gave him five bombs, of which three were to be planted in Guwahati to disrupt the Republic Day function.
    
	A police team today raided the Barama bookstall, Bookland, and found the powerful explosives hidden there. The owner of the bookstall, Naba Sarma, was arrested. 
    
	Sarma had been arrested once before in an Ulfa-related case. The SP said that was four years ago.
    
	The chain of developments following Dekas arrest included a police raid on the residence of another Ulfa militant, Jayanta Deka. He escaped, but the police found some detonators, explosives and fuse wires in the house.
    
	A third Ulfa member, Kanak Sarma, was arrested elsewhere. Sarma was doubling as the secretary of the village development board of Nizjhuluki, under Barama police station. Ulfas jailed central publicity secretary, Mithinga Daimary, hails from that village.
    
	Datta said the secretary of the village development board confessed to his involvement in the militant groups activities. The police officer termed the three arrests since yesterday as a breakthrough because they were working overground and nobody had a clue about their activities. He also said the arrests would have jolted Ulfas 709 Battalion. Deka is close to the chief of the 709 Battalion, Hira Sarania. 
    
	In an unrelated incident, the 66 Field Regiment of the army gunned down two suspected Karbi rebels near Juriadalang, inside the Nambar reserve forest in Golaghat district, last night. An AK-56 rifle, a .38 pistol of Italian make and ammunition were found.

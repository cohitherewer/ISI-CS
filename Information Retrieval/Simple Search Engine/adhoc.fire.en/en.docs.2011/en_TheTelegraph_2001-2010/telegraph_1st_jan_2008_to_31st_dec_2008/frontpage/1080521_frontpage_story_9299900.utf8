The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Preity not aware of bias
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Preity not aware of bias
          POULOMI BANERJEE                    Preity Zinta                           
	Calcutta, May 20: Preity Zinta has said she was not aware of the alleged racial discrimination faced by two girls from London recruited as cheerleaders for the actresss Kings XI Punjab team.        
	A day after The Telegraph reported the incident that took place in Mohali a month ago, Preity called Jorge Aldana, the director of Fierce Performance Production that had brought the two girls over as part of a team of 12.        
	She called me and said that she had no knowledge of this incident. I believe her. If she had wanted other dancers, she would have told me so. But she would not have done something like this, Aldana said.        
	Preity could not be reached for comment.         
	Before the first match played by the Punjab team, the two girls were asked to leave the ground by the employees of Wizcraft International Entertainment.        
	One of the girls, Ellesha Newton, had said: We were surprised and asked them why and they told us it was because of the colour of our skin.        
	Wizcraft has denied the allegation.        
	Aldana said the star assured him today that she would sort out the payment problems with Wizcraft, which had not paid Aldana and the cheerleaders till this week. Discarded after the first two matches of the Punjab team, the 12-member team has been stuck in Mumbai as their travel costs have not been met either.         
	According to Aldana, he has not received full payment yet.         
	Preity told me that she had no idea we were yet to be cleared our dues and said shell take it up with Wizcraft, he said.        
	Aldana added that earlier too the actress had tried to intervene on their behalf, but without success. I had messaged Preity to say that Wizcraft was yet to pay us any money and she assured us shell talk to the company. After that someone from Wizcraft called us and asked us not to bother Preity and that the payments will be made. But they failed to do so till this week, he said.        
	Another agency  and not Wizcraft  is handling the new set of Punjab cheerleaders.         
	Aldana emphasised that his relations with Preity were more than perfect. He worked as a dancer with the actress in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, Jaan-E-Mann and Jhoom Barabar Jhoom.        
	While denying the allegation yesterday, Rajesh KV, the executive vice-president of Wizcraft, had said if such an incident did take place, I would have received a complaint. But I know nothing of it.        
	Asked why he did not make a written complaint, Aldana said he was hoping that it will be amicably sorted out and that theyll apologise. But, of course, I informed them of what had happened.         
	The girls said they were not in a state to decide what to do. We were shocked. And we didnt know who to complain to, so we told Aldana, said Ellesha.        
	India does not have an anti-discriminatory body but the cheerleaders can move the Maharashtra Human Rights Commission or the National Human Rights Commission, said constitutional expert T.R. Andhyarujina.         
	National and state human rights commissions are empowered to initiate action  either on their own or on a petition by a victim or any other person on a complaint of violation of human rights or abetment thereof.

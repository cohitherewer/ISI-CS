          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Dibrugarh, April 14: The CRPF allegedly shot dead a villager in Assams Sivasagar district last evening to vent its frustration over the escape of some Ulfa militants.        
	A team of Dibrugarh police and the 149 CRPF battalion had gone to Himpora village under Moranhat police station in search of six rebels.        
	The security forces could not net the militants, but a villager, Dulen Baruah, 55, was killed during the raid.         
	The police initially claimed that Baruah was an Ulfa member, but the villagers said the militants had left the place much before the arrival of the security forces. They alleged that the CRPF personnel killed Baruah to vent their frustration over their failure to get hold of the Ulfa cadres.         
	The CRPF claimed that the militants had taken shelter at Baruahs residence and he was killed in the crossfire.         
	When our men were approaching the house, the militants opened fire. We retaliated and one person died in the ensuing gunbattle, P.C. Sahu, the commandant of the 149 CRPF Battalion stationed in Sivasagar district, said over telephone.         
	The CRPF picked up three persons, including Baruahs eldest son Srimanta, a BA final year student of Moran College, for allegedly having links with Ulfa. The other two, Jibon Baruah and Dharma Baruah, are also residents of the village. The paramilitary force claimed to have recovered some ammunition and a hand grenade from the trio.         
	It is an unfortunate incident. We are looking into the matter, Sivasagar deputy commissioner N.M. Hussain said. He added that Dibrugarh police had not informed them before entering Sivasagar and they would take up the matter at a higher level.         
	Finding themselves mired in controversy, Dibrugarh police said their team did not accompany the CRPF personnel. Dibrugarh superintendent of police Anurag Agarwal said the police had gone to the village during the day while the CRPF team had gone there in the afternoon.         
	Refusing to buy the CRPF argument, the Peoples Committee for Peace Initiatives in Assam has threatened to launch an agitation if the government does not come clean on the issue.         
	Initially, the security forces were killing young people in the name of counter-insurgency operations. Now they are not sparing even the aged. There should be a proper inquiry into the incident and those involved should be punished, PCPIA convenor Birinchi Neog said.

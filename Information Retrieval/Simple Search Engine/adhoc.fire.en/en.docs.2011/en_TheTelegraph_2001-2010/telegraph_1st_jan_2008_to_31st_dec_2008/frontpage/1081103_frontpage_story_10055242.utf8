	After Maharaja Hanumans death, the car passed to the second brother, Maharaja Hemant Singh, who looked after it for years.        
	In 1961-62, when I had just graduated and was looking to buy a sports car I had spotted in Mumbai, my brother said he would gift me the Delahaye instead. Since then, it has been with me and is in perfect working condition, Duleep said.

	Ranchi, Feb. 27: The Opposition today hooted and shrieked to disrupt the Governors address to the Jharkhand Assembly on the opening day of the budget session.        
	Marking a new low in the states record of Assembly sessions, Governor Syed Sibtey Razis 50-minute-long address dwelling on the remarkable performance of the Madhu Koda government remained inaudible amid a parallel speech by Opposition leader Arjun Munda.        
	This was accompanied by raucous protests by four MLAs of the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) and CPI (ML) legislator Vinod Singh, who latter walked out. NDA members also played their part by thumping desks at every rhetoric of Munda, who spelt out a chargesheet against 12 ministers submitted by the BJP to Razi recently.         
	Several NDA MLAs derided Munda for his behaviour, but privately under the shield of anonymity. We could have raised the issues during the debate on the vote of thanks to the governors address. MPs still maintain decorum in Parliament during the Presidents address, pointed out a BJP MLA.         
	In his address, Razi said: The government was making serious efforts to live up to the peoples expectations despite facing the complexities of a coalition. Maintaining that the Koda government had ensured the participation of every section of society in the development process, Razi said Jharkhand had emerged to be an important centre of investment due to a meaningful industrial policy.         
	However, he mentioned that so far Rs 467.08 crore had been invested against agreements to the tune of Rs 3 lakh crore for 67 projects.         
	The governor also spelt out the steps taken by the government to maintain fiscal discipline and generate over 30,000 jobs. In education, Razi pointed out that there were moves to set up a technical university, nine engineering colleges, including six in the private sector, three medical colleges and three dental colleges in the state.         
	Asserting that restoration of land to tribals was the number one priority of the government, Razi gave credit to chief minister Madhu Koda for having ensured that the Centre kept Jharkhand out of the delimitation process.        
	Marshal suspended        
	Speaker Alamgir Alam suspended marshal Bateshwar Pandey for protocol violation ahead of the governors speech.        
	Under the rules, the marshal was supposed to inform the members of the arrival of the governor and Speaker. But the marshal forgot to do his job, prompting the Opposition members to point out the lapses to the Speaker.

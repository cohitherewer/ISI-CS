                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Killed: 7 with Bangla I-cards 
          OUR BUREAU                                      The arms and ammunition found on the militants. (Eastern Projections)                            
	Dhubri/Dhaka, Sept. 26: The army today ambushed and gunned down seven men allegedly carrying identity cards issued by a Bangladeshi political party and claimed they were militants intent on striking in Guwahati.        
	Hours after the shootout in western Assams Dhubri district, at a site 250km from Guwahati, a defence press release said wireless intercepts had revealed the plans of the group, suspected to be from the Bangladesh-based Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami.        
	The army said the group carried guns, RDX and detonators apart from Bangladesh Kallayan Party identity cards and documents of Sonali Bank of Bangladesh. They also carried visiting cards that belonged to many people in Bangladesh and India, officers added while declining to identify these people.        
	Intelligence sources claimed the I-cards suggested that the Harkat had infiltrated the Bangladeshi political party and was using its name as a cover. Army officers alleged the party provided logistical and moral support to India-based jihadi groups.        
	However, political observers in Bangladesh said the party, formed last October by former brigadier Mohammad Ibrahim, had tacit support from Dhakas military-backed government but no known links with Islamic groups. Being a new party, it does not have a large following.        
	Reacting to the I-card claim, Ibrahim said: Its highly imaginary. I think some forces somewhere are trying to tarnish our image.        
	Bangladesh home secretary Abdul Karim said: We will study the report before making any comment.        
	A senior police officer in Dhubri said: This operation was carried out entirely by the army. I cant comment on the identities of the militants.        
	The defence release said the alleged militants planned to join another Harkat team hiding in Guwahati. They are supposed to have sneaked through the India-Bangladesh border at a point 30km from Boroibari village, the site of the 25-minute encounter.        
	Colonel J.S. Sekhawat, commanding officer of 21 Jat Regiment, said: Yesterday, we received information about a group of armed persons and laid an ambush. As soon as our jawans moved into Boroibari village early this morning, the militants, who were hiding in the forests, hurled a grenade. The seven were killed on the spot in retaliatory firing.        
	The seizures, the army said, include four revolvers, two pistols, three grenades, a bomb, a pen pistol, two gelatin sticks, six detonators, 2kg of RDX, an IED circuit capable of remote-controlled blasts, acid bottles, 79 live and 14 spent cartridges, three cellphones, six Bangladeshi SIM cards, three radios and currencies of Bangladesh, the US, Japan, Saudi Arabia, China, Pakistan, New Zealand and Switzerland.

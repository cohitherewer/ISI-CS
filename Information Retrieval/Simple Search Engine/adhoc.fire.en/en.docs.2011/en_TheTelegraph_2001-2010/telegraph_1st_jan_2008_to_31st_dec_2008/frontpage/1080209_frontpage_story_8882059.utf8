	Durgapur, Feb. 8: A passer-by was today hit in the abdomen when police fired on furious protesters who refused to let them near the body of a schoolboy crushed by a truck and instead took them on.        
	The noon firing in Bankuras Mejia came days after the Cooch Behar tragedy in which Forward Bloc loyalists fell to cops bullets. It seemed to reinforce the pattern of police firing on protesters in defiance of basic crowd-control rules.        
	Reports said the police did not burst tear gas shells or use water cannons to scatter the crowd, which chased officers, pelted them with stones and burnt a jeep and a motorcycle. It is not known who gave the firing orders.        
	We fired only 5-6 rounds in the air but one bullet hit Nimai Das. We are probing who ordered the firing but the situation was going out of control with over 3,000 people attacking us, district SP Rajesh Kumar Singh said.        
	Das, the 40-year-old vegetable vendor who was hurt in the left side, is in a Bankura hospital. He will be operated on once his condition is stable, sources said.        
	According to Bengal police regulations, it is mandatory to warn protesters that they will be fired on if they do not disperse immediately. Smoke grenades and water cannons have to be used before firing, which has to be below the waist.        
	Its true that the police did not burst tear gas shells before opening fire. But it is not necessary that all rural police stations will have tear gas shells and water cannons, said Raj Kanojia, the inspector-general of police (law and order).        
	When policemen are attacked, the law permits them to open fire in self-defence. The protesters, many drunk, burnt a police jeep and hurled stones, injuring five officers.        
	The chain of events was sparked by the death of Babui Gorai, 12, who was cycling home after tuition around 8.40am. A speeding coal-laden truck hit him on the Ranigunj-Bankura road at Mejia, 230km from Calcutta, and killed him.        
	Youths at a wayside tea-stall beat up the driver who managed to flee. When a police jeep arrived soon after, the growing crowd attacked it.        
	The policemen then tried to retrieve the body but the protesters resisted and began throwing stones. They then set the jeep ablaze. They chased the Mejia OC, who came a while later, and burnt his bike before setting the truck on fire.        
	Around noon, a team of 50 policemen arrived and began a lathi-charge. When the protesters snatched their sticks and started beating them up, the police opened fire.

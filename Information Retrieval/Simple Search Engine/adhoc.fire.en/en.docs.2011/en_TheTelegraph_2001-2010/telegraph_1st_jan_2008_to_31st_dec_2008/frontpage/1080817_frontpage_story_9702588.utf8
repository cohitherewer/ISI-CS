          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                            Taslima Nasreen                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: Taslima Nasreen is expected to get a six-month visa extension but the government is not in favour of granting her request for a permanent resident permit.        
	The home ministry, in consultation with the ministry of external affairs, has decided to extend the Bangladeshi authors visa till February 17, sources said.         
	However, they are not willing to grant her a permanent resident permit yet since that would mean virtually bestowing citizenship rights on her.        
	The home ministry officials said it was not feasible to grant her a resident permit till it was clear whether she would be allowed to go to Calcutta or not. The Bengal government has not yet responded to the Centres letter asking if Taslima could stay in Calcutta. And Taslima herself has not made up her mind on an alternative residence, a senior government official said.        
	The government wants to play it safe and extend her visa, which expires tomorrow, by only six months. This would give it the option not to renew the visa at the end of the period in case trouble or controversy arises.        
	We have to wait and see how the situation develops. Only then a decision on a permanent resident permit can be taken. As of now, it is a big no, the official said.        
	Taslima, who holds a Swedish passport, returned to India on August 8 after spending over three months in Sweden. She has been putting up at the home of a friend, an ex-envoy to Sweden. She continues to have tight security because of threats she faces from Islamic fundamentalists over her controversial writings.        
	Her visa is likely to be extended on the condition that she will be sensitive to Indian ethos and traditions.        
	Even Taslima seems to have mellowed. All this time in the loneliness of the safe house and her break in Sweden must have given her time to contemplate and introspect. The fact that she has decided to come back to India means that she is ready to accept the conditions, the government official said.        
	Before leaving, she had been staying at a safe house outside Delhi in virtual house arrest. She also spent some days at AIIMS, where she was treated for hypertension, diabetes and an eye ailment.         
	Taslima was in touch with Indian authorities since July, telling them she wanted to return.

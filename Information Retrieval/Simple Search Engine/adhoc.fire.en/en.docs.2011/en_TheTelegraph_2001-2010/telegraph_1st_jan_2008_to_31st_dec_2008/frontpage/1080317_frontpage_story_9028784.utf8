                                Scarlett: Hedonistic life                            
	London, March 16 (PTI): Scarlett Keeling, the British schoolgirl allegedly raped and murdered in Goa, was living a hedonistic life of sex, drugs and alcohol in the days before her death, a leading tabloid reported today.        
	In her personal diary, found by police investigating the death of the 15-year-old and seen by The Mail, she revealed episodes of drug and alcohol abuse in Goa and also at school in England.        
	In her final entry before leaving England in November, she described a farewell party where she got drunk stoned and was trippin on mushies (hallucinogenic mushrooms).         
	The entry confirmed that Scarlett  legally a minor  was having sex with her boyfriend in England, The Mail said. She wrote: I went two days without sex the other day, I started getting stressy.        
	The entries  mostly undated  are written in a schoolbook. Some were rambling perhaps written under the influence of drink or drugs.        
	In her penultimate entry, Scarlett wrote: I want to go home.         
	Another entry said she felt she was facing a major decision in her life. I wish something big would happen to make my decision final.        
	She signed some of them with her nickname, Skaz. There are pages of childish drawings  a heart, two saxophones and unhappy cartoon faces, one of which has tears gushing from its eyes.        
	The final page showed a stick figure hanging from the gallows. Underneath was the name, address and telephone number of Julio Lobo. The diary was discovered in a cabin she was sharing with Lobo  a tour guide in Siolim village.         
	Scarletts mother Fiona Mackeown was allowed to read the diary before Goa authorities took it as evidence.        
	There was no mention in the diary of the two men accused of the killing  alleged drug-dealer Placido Carvalho, charged with supplying her with cocaine, Ecstasy and LSD and facilitating her murder, and Samson dSouza, charged with rape and murder.        
	The diary contained references to Scarletts family and her teenage boyfriend in England, Jardi, for whom she repeatedly declared her love.        
	Scarlett was allegedly raped and killed on Anjuna beach on February 18.         
	According to her diary, Scarlett met Julio at a full-moon party, which would have put their first meeting  and first sexual encounter  as early as November 24, just days after her arrival in India.        
	Scarlett wrote: I was pretty messed up, like I had taken a pill and drunk a lot of vodka. I dont remember a lot but apparently we had sex and I can remember that much but it took two weeks b4 me and Julio were hanging out regularly.        
	Cloud on boyfriend         
	Goa police today hinted at arresting Scarletts boyfriend Julio Lobo, 21, under the Goa childrens act in the next few days.        
	Investigations have revealed that Julio had no role in drugging and murdering the teenager. However, the diary could be used to prosecute him for statutory rape. The Goa act and the IPC consider consensual sex with a minor rape.

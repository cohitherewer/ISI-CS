          OUR BUREAU                            Jyotirmoy                                  
	Hyderabad/London, May 7: A postgraduate medical student from Andhra Pradesh was found murdered yesterday in her hostel room she shared with two other girls in a Birmingham suburb, home to a large number of Indians and Pakistanis.        
	Sources said Birmingham police informed Vijayawada police chief Rajendranath Reddy that assailants entered the room and stabbed S. Jyotirmoy.        
	The 23-year-old, from Vijayawadas One Town colony, had joined Wolverhampton University barely eight months ago.        
	Another person was also injured, a Vijayawada police officer said, but is recovering in hospital.        
	In England, a spokesperson for West Midlands police said officers attended after a call at 4.43pm and a woman was confirmed dead at the scene.        
	It was also revealed that a man remains in hospital with serious injuries and the police were carrying out forensic and house to house inquiries at the scene.        
	A post-mortem will take place later today, the spokesperson added.        
	Wolverhampton University, home to 2,847 Indian-origin students and where Lord (Swraj) Paul has been chancellor since 1998, refused to comment on reports that the victim was an Indian and instead referred all queries to the police.        
	In Vijayawada, Jyotirmoys father Saibabu, a film producer, said Birmingham police called around 3.30 this morning to inform him about his daughters death.        
	She was my elder daughter, he told The Telegraph over the phone and added that local MP Lagadapati Rajagopal was coordinating efforts to bring back Jyotirmoys body as early as possible.        
	We sent our daughter abroad thinking conditions would be safe there. But its worse than our own town.        
	Three months ago, Ayesha Meira, a pharmacy student, was gang-raped and killed in her hostel room in Vijayawada city. The police are yet to catch her killers.        
	Jyotirmoy is the fourth overseas student from the state to have been killed since December last year.        
	In March, Akkaladevi Srinivas, from Korutla in Karimnagar, was killed in Pennsylvania.        
	Before that, Kiran Kumar Allam and Chandrasekhar Reddy Komma, postdoctoral students from Kurnool and Karimnagar, were murdered in their apartment on the campus of Louisiana State University in December.        
	At Wolverhampton, university authorities tell foreign students when they arrive that there are many people here to give you the advice and support you need. Our International Student Support Officer is based on City Campus and can assist you with a variety of matters and should be your first point of contact.         
	Today, no one at the university was willing to comment.

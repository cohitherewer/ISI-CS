	Mumbai, March 17: Stock markets tumbled around the world after a desperate plan to rescue troubled Bear Stearns and Co  Wall Streets fifth biggest bank  over the weekend portended grave trouble for the global financial system.         
	On Dalal Street, the bellwether index swooned over 6 per cent  almost 1000 points  to close at 14809.49. It was the second highest single-day fall for the sensex and left scared investors with no idea about when the mayhem would stop.         
	The markets were spooked by a couple of gut-wrenching developments over the weekend: first, JP Morgan Chase announced that it would buy Bear Stearns for $2 a stock  90 per cent below its Friday close. Second, the US Federal Reserve made an emergency quarter percentage point cut in its discount rate that it charges on loans to banks. The discount rate was cut to 3.25 per cent.        
	The two developments sent a ripple of fear through global markets. Indian stock markets  already unsettled by a selloff wave triggered by foreign institutional investors over the past two weeks  floundered with the rest.        
	Shares of European banks  including UBS in Switzerland, HBOS in Britain and SocGen in France  fell more than 10 per cent as concern swept markets that the value of risky assets needs to be marked down even further.         
	The foreign institutional investors are selling across the emerging markets. The situation has turned very grim after the Bear Stearns fiasco, said Hitesh Agarwal, head of research at Angel Broking.        
	The bigger worry is that the Federal Reserves sudden action to trim its discount rate has sent out a signal that something could be terribly wrong with the US economy where pundits are seeing signs of a recession.         
	The global players are expecting another 75 basis point cut in rates tomorrow, Agarwal added.        
	The stock slump wiped out about Rs 3.18 lakh crore of investor wealth today.         
	JP Morgan Chases plan to pay about $ 270 million for stricken Bear Stearn sent stock indices deep into the red zone. Hong Kongs Hang Seng and Japans Nikkei tumbled by about 5 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively.        
	Local factors are also weighing on the markets: inflation has risen to a nine-month high at 5.11 per cent, industrial growth slowed to 5.3 per cent in January and banks have been asked to shoulder a part of the burden of the Rs 60,000-crore farm loan waiver.

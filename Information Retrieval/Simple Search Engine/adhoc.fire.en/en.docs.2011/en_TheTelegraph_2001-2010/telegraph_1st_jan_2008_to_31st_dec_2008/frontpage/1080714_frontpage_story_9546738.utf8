                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   UK rallies for Kerala granny
          AMIT ROY                                              
	London, July 13: Readers in India have for decades been fed tales of racist British behaviour towards Indian immigrants but the story of the battle currently being waged to keep a 66-year-old grandmother from Kerala, Mary Joseph, in Portsmouth gives the other side of the picture and shows the British at their best.        
	It also has to be said that the local newspaper in Portsmouth, The News, has risen to the occasion and started a determined campaign to ensure that Mary is allowed to stay in the UK so that she can help bring up her young grandchildren whose mother, 39-year-old Shini Jose, was run over and killed by a lorry as she was crossing a road on June 1 last year.        
	The children, Joel Jose and Jiya, who were only eight and four then, have been cared for by Mary, who came over with the family after Shinis funeral in Kerala last year.        
	Mary, who speaks only Malayalam, says that since her son, Jose, goes out to work, she is the only one now who can look after the children. The people of Portsmouth, who are rallying round the family, agree. They say the home office is being unreasonable in insisting that after every six months stay in the UK, Mary should return to India for six months. Her multi-entry visa would also have to be renewed in August 2009.         
	All I am requesting is to let me stay here to look after my two small grandchildren. They are only five and nine years old. How can their father leave them alone and go to work? Mary told The Telegraph through a person who knows her language.        
	The News, which has been running a Let Her Stay campaign, signed online by, at least, 800 readers, has covered developments since Shinis death in great detail and with remarkable sympathy.        
	Police have chosen not to prosecute the lorry driver who ran over Shini, suggesting her death was a tragic accident. She was out shopping for a birthday present with her children and was momentarily distracted, according to CCTV reconstruction.         
	Her son, Joel, started to cross but ran back, shouting to his mother to hold back. The lorry driver, unaware that Shini was in front, hit the accelerator as the light turned green and mowed her down. Joel, too, could have been killed, police said later.        
	What made her loss especially poignant was that Shini, the second of three daughters who grew up in Kerala, came to England two years ago and could only bring her family over after establishing her nursing qualifications.        
	She found work at Steep House, a care home in nearby Petersfield, where her manager Annette Jopson paid tribute to her dedication: As a nurse, her first priority was to the care and wellbeing of her patients, and to that end she was very protective of them. Shini was a very special person, with a huge heart and an even bigger smile. The staff and residents will miss her so much.         
	There has also been strong support from Rev Simon Thomson, the parish priest at Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church, where the family worshipped and where Shinis funeral service was held.         
	If ever there was a case for allowing someone to remain in the UK on compassionate grounds, you would have thought this would be one, the priest said.         
	He added: It seems incredibly cruel that (Mary) Joseph was refused permission to stay. She would not be a great cost to the state. They are very industrious, hardworking people and they contribute very much to society.         
	The News covered the funeral service, which was attended by 200 mourners, led by Shinis husband and son: Together they stared at her coffin, a picture of Shini carefully placed on top, a reminder of their cruel loss.        
	The paper said: In moments of quiet, all that could be heard inside the church was the sound of young children, oblivious to the sorrow of the day. Among them was Shinis four-year-old daughter Jiya. Following the service in English there was a short pause before a second mass was held in Malayalam, their native tongue. Shini was then left to lay in the church overnight.        
	Local people raised 6,000 so that Shinis family could take back her body to Kottayam in Kerala, from where the children returned to Portsmouth in September with their father and their grandmother. The News has also spoken to the parents of the childrens classmates at the Flying Bull Primary School.        
	Margaret Parke, a 60-year-old bar steward, saw a reflection of her own familys suffering in Marys plight. I think it is disgusting that Mrs Joseph should have to go back to India. I look after my grandchildren after their mother died. I know what it is like.

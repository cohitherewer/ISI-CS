	Araria (Bihar), Sept. 3: Zameel Akhtars village is now a river, but the young man is more worried about how to prove he is him.        
	Their only possession the 30-year-old and his wife managed to salvage when the swirling waters of the Kosi caught them in their sleep in the dead of night was a Quran.        
	We didnt even get time to take our voter identity cards, bank passbook, ATM card, chequebook and purse, Zameel said.        
	In a corner of the relief camp in a madarsa, where the couple had paddled to safety with their kids in a makeshift raft, his wife Bibi Badenoor sat reading the Quran.        
	Ramazan had already begun and she was on a fast.        
	Khuda ne qayamat laya hai (God has brought the catastrophe), the 25-year-old said. Wahi nizaat dilayega (Only He can provide us relief).        
	After the floodwaters swamped their village on August 18, the day the Kosi breached an embankment in upstream Nepal, Zameel and next-door neighbour Suleman Mohammad, 35, had emptied four drums where they kept wheat and joined them with ropes and bamboo poles.        
	Then, with their wives and kids, they paddled through the cold, surging waters on the makeshift raft to reach the Dar-ul Uloom Rahamania Madarsa relief camp.        
	Neither Zameel nor Suleman knows if the 58 other families in their village of 500 people  8km from the embankment  are alive.        
	Before the floodwaters smashed into their village, both Zameel and Suleman were reasonably well-off. Zameel had five acres of land, a good house, cattle and poultry and bank savings. Suleman had four acres, a house and, like Zameel, savings in the bank. His wife Yasmin Fatema, 25, taught in a panchayat school in their village, Shankarpur, in Araria, one of the districts deluged by the floods, Bihars worst in 50 years.        
	But their main worry is they have lost their identities. Unlike previous years when floods came and receded, this years floods have robbed us of everything. There is no trace of our village. It has become a river now, under 20ft of water. And we have been left with no proof whatsoever to prove that we are Zameel, Suleman, Badenoor and Yasmin. This is our main concern, said Zameel, his forehead furrowed with worry.        
	I have no records to show that I was a schoolteacher, said Yasmin.        
	Zameel, who has been at the relief camp since August 20, had gone to the SBI branch at Araria to find out how he could withdraw money. The bank manager said there was no way he could help me if I had no passbook, chequebook or an ATM card, Zameel said. He simply asked me to get out.        
	Another fear is also playing on their mind.        
	Infiltration from neighbouring Bangladesh is already a big issue in Muslim-dominated Araria. I fear the administration, already on the lookout for infiltrators, may suspect us and harass us, said Suleman. Is there any way we can prove our identity?        
	Suleman, who has two sons and a daughter, doesnt know where they will go from here. Principal Alimuddin has already said he wants them to vacate the madarsa before it re-opens after Ramazan.        
	Even the news that the waters have been slowly receding doesnt enthuse them. So what? Our village has become a river. Even if the water level recedes, the village will remain a river, said Zameel, as he prepared for namaaz at the mosque on the madarsa compound.

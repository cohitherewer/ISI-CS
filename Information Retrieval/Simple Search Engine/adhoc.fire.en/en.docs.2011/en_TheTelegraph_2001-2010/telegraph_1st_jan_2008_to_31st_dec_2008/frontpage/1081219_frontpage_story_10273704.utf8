The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Your pilot: Im not qualified to land
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Your pilot: Im not qualified to land
  - Faced with fog, honesty in cockpit and horror among passengers           AMIT ROY                            A Flybe plane. File picture                                        
	London, Dec. 18: Flight BE1431 was thousands of feet above the ground when the pilot remembered something.        
	He grabbed the intercom and announced: I am not qualified to land the plane.        
	Passengers looked at each other with what the British, with typical understatement, would call surprise.        
	Its unlikely anyone was reminded about the joke: This is your Captain speaking, you are at 35,000ft and I hope you are having a lovely time. I am also having a lovely time  in the airport bar.        
	Which was good because BE1431s British pilot was not joking.        
	It was all very technical but the pilot had decided, barely 20 minutes before landing in a foggy Paris, that although he was very experienced, he did not have the rating necessary to bring his turboprop aircraft down. Not in that fog, oh no.        
	Unlike the pilot in the joke, though, he was in the cockpit and if he couldnt land the machine he could jolly well fly it. So, BE1431 flew all the way back to Cardiff.        
	Passenger Cassandra Grant, flying for a job interview, was not pleased. She had booked with Flybe, a British airline based at Exeter International Airport that operates over 150 routes between 50-odd European airports. But BE1431 was jinxed by fog, just as many flights have been in Calcutta and elsewhere in India this week.        
	It should have left Cardiff at 8.45am yesterday but was almost three hours late taking off because of fog around the Welsh capital. Once the fog cleared in Cardiff, the plane took off but it then became too foggy to land in Paris. Pilots need extra training to land in poor weather.        
	Grant told her local newspaper, the South Wales Echo: The captain said, Unfortunately Im not qualified to land the plane in Paris. They are asking for a level two qualification and I only have a level five. Well have to fly back.        
	Grant said: The whole thing beggars belief. If I had not been on the plane, I would not have believed it.        
	British pilots believe the Flybe pilot behaved correctly and that passengers should be grateful to him. This show of loyalty, however, does not explain why the unnamed pilot was placed in command.        
	A Flybe spokeswoman also defended him, saying the company stands by 100 per cent with the pilots decision to return to Cardiff.        
	The Flybe pilot is an experienced aviator with more than 30 years commercial aviation experience flying a number of different passenger aircraft types, she said.        
	He has relatively recently transferred his type-rating from a Bombardier Q300 to a Bombardier Q400 and has not yet completed the requisite low-visibility training to complete a landing in conditions such as the dense fog experienced in Paris Charles de Gaulle.        
	But an Indian airline source disagreed, saying that instead of returning to Cardiff the pilot should have asked to go to an alternative designated airport, waited there and then flown to Paris when the fog cleared. The pilot did absolutely the wrong thing.

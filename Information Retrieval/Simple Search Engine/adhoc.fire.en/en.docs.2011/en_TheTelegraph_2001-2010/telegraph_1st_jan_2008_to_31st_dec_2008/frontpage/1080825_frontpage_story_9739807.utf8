          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Aug. 24: Torn between two sisters, Amar Singh suffered a momentary attack of amnesia this afternoon in Singur.         
	The Tatas are saying never mind the Rs 1,500 crore, we will go. If others are calling, please go. West Bengal will say goodbye, ta-ta, the Samajwadi leader said.        
	Amar missed a small detail. The same politician had written to the Tatas in April 2006  a month before Bengal formally won the Nano project  offering to accommodate the small-car plant in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Uttar Pradesh was then ruled by the Samajwadi Partys Mulayam Singh Yadav, and Amar Singh was chairman of the states industrial development council.        
	But the Tatas, apparently tired of waiting for approval to expand a bus-making unit in Lucknow, did not bite the bait. In the same year, the group scaled back its activities in Uttar Pradesh and shifted focus to Uttarakhand.        
	How does Amar reconcile courting the Nano plant for Uttar Pradesh  Amars political home ground  in 2006 and supporting its ouster from Bengal  his birthplace  in 2008? I have nothing against Ratan Tata. I admit that as chairman of the Uttar Pradesh development council, I had invited Tata Motors to set up the Nano factory there. But we never wanted them to set up the factory on land forcibly taken from farmers. I am against this project as I think the state government has forcibly taken away 400 acres, Amar told The Telegraph.        
	Amar today stood up to be counted among the protectors of farmers, although a government ruled by his party had opened fire on them.        
	On July 8, 2006, seven farmers suffered bullet injuries in police firing in Uttar Pradeshs Dadri while agitating for higher price for land acquired for a power plant to be set up by Amars close friend Anil Ambani. The Samajwadi Party had then termed the farmers protest a nautanki (drama).         
	Between the nautanki in Dadri and the reasonable demand by his younger sister Mamata in Singur, Amars party had lost power in Uttar Pradesh and dumped the CPM in Delhi.        
	Amar accused another sister and her husband  Brinda and Prakash Karat  of misleading him on the land protests in Bengal. What they told us was false.... They told me that anti-nationals and Naxalites were involved. But now I can see that the people in front of me are farmers, he said.

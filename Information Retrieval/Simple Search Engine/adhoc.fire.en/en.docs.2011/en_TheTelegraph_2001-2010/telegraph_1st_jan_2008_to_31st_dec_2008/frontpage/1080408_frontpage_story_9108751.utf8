  - JMM leader feels Cong heat, Koda govt shaky        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                            Soren, Oraon: Tribals champion?                                       
	Ranchi, April 7: Rameshwar Oraons induction into the Union cabinet is the Congresss first definite move to signal it was taking charge of its own future in Jharkhand.        
	No longer was it keen on riding on the crutches of UPA allies, namely the BJD and the JMM, whose leader Shibu Soren it has summarily snubbed by denying him a cabinet berth.         
	A miffed Soren may be huffing and puffing, but the writing on the wall is clear: the future of the Madhu Koda government is uncertain more than ever before. In a way, the Congress seems to be provoking Soren to pull the rug from under the state UPA coalition governments feet.        
	Also, perhaps for the first time now, partyman in charge of state affairs Ajay Maken can hope to walk the talk  he has already declared they would withdraw support to the Koda government even if the others, namely JMM and RJD, didnt agree.        
	With the Supreme Court having issued a notice to Soren in the Shashinath Jha murder case, the Congress was trying to distance itself from the JMM supremo. It did not want to give the BJP another handle to disrupt Parliament with and, therefore, wanted Soren to nominate an MP for a ministerial berth.         
	Soren, who left for Delhi today, believes it was a Congress ploy to divide his party and did not mince his words when he said yesterday: JMM will not sit as beggars anymore The Congress will have to pay a heavy price which might even see a very few days of Koda as chief minister.        
	The Congresss move comes at a time when the BJP, too, is riddled with dissension. At least a dozen MLAs, mostly from other backward castes, led by Raghubar Das have challenged the leadership of both Opposition leader Arjun Munda and state president P.N. Singh.         
	In fact, the BJP too wants to steer clear of Soren and isnt keen on getting him on the NDAs side. BJP leaders pointed out that Sorens popularity had taken a beating after the Rajya Sabha elections. Moreover, all question his motive behind backing the Koda government for so long.        
	Union minister of state for food processing Subodh Kant Sahay said the JMM chief had lost control of his own MLAs. Even the Independent ministers, who swore by him, seem to have deserted him.        
	For his part, Oraon chose not to comment on the politics behind his ministerial berth. As the new minister of state for tribal affairs, he said his priority was to ensure the national tribal policy was cleared by Parliament.        
	Oraon, a former additional director-general of police, said availability of roads, education and other facilities for tribals would help the government wean away those who had joined the ranks of the Naxalites.         
	Since they are a closed society, they believe whatever is told to them. Better communication will connect them with mainstream society, he maintained.

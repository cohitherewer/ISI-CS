                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Modi still on visa blacklist
          BASANT RAWAT                            Narendra Modi                                  
	Ahmedabad, Aug. 30: Washington could again deny Narendra Modi a visa if he applied for one, a senior US official has suggested.        
	The hint from Mathew Reynolds, assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs, comes at a time Modi has thought better of accepting an invite to attend the August 29-31 World Gujarati Conference in New Jersey.        
	Instead, he will be addressing the meeting tomorrow from his home in Gandhinagar through video-conferencing.        
	Three years ago, America had refused the Gujarat chief ministers visa application citing his alleged role in severe violations of religious freedom during the 2002 riots. Modi was then planning to attend that years World Gujarati Conference in the US.        
	Reynolds has written to an NGO, Coalition Against Genocide (CAG), that: The department of state is extremely sensitive to your concerns and we are cognisant of the human rights abuses Modi has committed.        
	He added: We have thoroughly searched department records and located no current non-immigrant visa applications for Modi. However, should we receive an application, we assure you it will be adjudicated in strict accordance with the immigration and naturalisation act.        
	CAG, a conglomeration of groups and individuals in the US and Canada that came together after the 2002 riots to demand justice, has issued a release carrying Reynoldss statement. CAGs lobbying among senators had been key to the US blocking Modis entry in 2005.        
	Reynoldss statement came in reply to a query sent by the NGO after media reports said Modi was planning to visit America to attend this years World Gujarati Conference. A Gujarat government spokesperson said an invite had indeed come from the conferences organisers but denied that Modi had applied for a visa.        
	A senior BJP official and Modi aide said: Right now the chief minister will not touch the visa issue which has become extremely sensitive. After he was refused entry into the US in 2005, the BJP had launched a scathing attack on the Bush administration. But non-resident Gujaratis told Modi to go slow on the issue, else they would be singled out in the US, their second home.        
	However, a pro-Modi Gujarati lobby is working to get Washington to invite him, said Krishnakant Vakariya, former president of the Vishwa Gujarati Samaj.

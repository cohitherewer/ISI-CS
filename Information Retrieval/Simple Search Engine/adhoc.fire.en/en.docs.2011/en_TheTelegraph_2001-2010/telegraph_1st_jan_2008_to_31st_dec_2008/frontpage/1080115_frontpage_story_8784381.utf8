	Calcutta, Jan. 14: The way the Nandaram blaze is being fought suggests prevention of a cave-in is not a priority, according to firefight veterans.
 
	A retired safety officer found it inexplicable that most of the effort since Saturday morning had been confined to spraying water into the building from outside, constantly drenching the walls.
 
	The cement in the walls could be softening up and the air pressure generated by the fire still raging inside could eventually make parts of the building crumble, said Sanat Kumar Chatterjee, former fire and safety supervisor with Durgapur Chemicals Ltd.
 
	The comments coincided with a CMC report that said eight of the floors of Nandaram were built without authorisation and demolition efforts were thwarted by stiff physical resistance at site from existing occupiers.
 
	The entire firefighting planning was at fault. From outside, they (the firefighters) should have drilled holes into the rooms that were on fire. After controlling the initial burst with a jet-and-spray-nozzle, they should have maintained a forceful and constant flow of water from a revolving nozzle, added Chatterjee, who has spent 33 years of his career fighting fires.
 
	While the jet-and-spray nozzle can push back the leaping tongues of flame, the revolving nozzle is capable of spraying water over a large area and is an accepted method of extinguishing high-rise fires, he said. If fire breaks out on the top floor, a hole is drilled through the roof. For other floors, the hole is usually punched through the walls.
 
	A former fire services leader mdash; a fire engine has six fighters: a driver, four personnel and a leader mdash; said the state wing did have the technology and apparatus to drill holes into a building and spray water inside. What the department does not have is the expertise and material to secure a building with thick iron ropes at gaps of 10 feet so that the structure does not collapse.
 
	This technology has been in vogue in the West for quite a while now and it is high time we secure it. After all, there are so many high-rises coming up in the city, Chatterjee said. 
 
	For the revolving nozzle to be effective, sustained water pressure is a pre-requisite. Otherwise, the nozzle ceases to revolve. 
 
	The former leader of the fire department said the Nandaram fire could be fought with water from the Hooghly. The firefighters have been reluctant to use the riverwater for fear of mud clogging the pumps.
 
	The retired official said mud would be sucked in only if the water was pumped from near the banks. If portable pumps were taken on a launch to collect water away from the banks, this problem could be tackled, he added.

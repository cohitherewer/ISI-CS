	New Delhi, May 31: Defence minister A.K. Antony slumped on the dais at the passing-out parade in the National Defence Academy near Pune this morning to the extreme concern of the government and of officers, soldiers, cadets and his Congress party.         
	The minister fainted twice, first while taking the salute and then, after making a gallant effort to recover and make himself presentable enough for the occasion, while decorating NDA cadets with medals and prizes in a ceremony to mark the graduation of the latest batch. NDA alumni man the officer cadre of Indias armed forces.         
	After fainting for the second time, the defence minister was bodily lifted by an officer on whose arms he lay supine as he was carried to a car that ferried him to hospital.         
	Arackaparambil Kurien Antony, 68, was at the end of his tether after a particularly hectic week and as of this morning was under-nourished.         
	But beyond the worries over his health, there is a looming question of what impression is conveyed by the defence minister falling sick publicly. That impression is not necessarily indicative of the health of the military he oversees.         
	The standard for defence ministers worldwide has been set by Antonys counterpart in Spain, a 37-year-old woman, who was seven months pregnant when she assumed office two months ago. Since so much of the military forces is about ceremony  as was the NDA parade this morning  symbolism is never out of context in the defence ministry.         
	Antony is acutely aware of this personally. He makes time to visit troops in tough border zones on weekends where he says little of substance but finds it worthwhile to be with the soldiers. He visits Siachen Glacier, for example, despite warnings that he does not take time to acclimatise.         
	But probably at no other time has symbolism in the military been as important as it is now, eight weeks after Spains Carme Chacon took over as defence minister of her country. The image of Chacon, who has since delivered a boy, reviewing Spanish troops in full regalia was a loud statement of gender equality from the government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.         
	Chacons appointment led to a row between Spain and Italy, whose Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, alleged to be gender-insensitive by his critics, even remarked that Zapatero has formed a government that is too pink.         
	The appointment of a woman as the President and the supreme commander of the armed forces puts India ahead in the contest of symbolisms. This week, Pratibha Patil even brandished an AK-47 during her visit to Kashmir, annoying Omar Abdullah.         
	Antony made a gallant effort to stand and take the salute at the parade after he fainted the first time, said eyewitnesses. But the sun was scorching (the maximum temperature in Pune was 37.6C) and the fatigue overcame him.         
	Despite his frailness and frugal habits, the defence minister is not known to skip office on account of health. An officer on his staff said the minister fainted because of over-exertion. Another officer went on to explain that politicians in India lead truly hectic lives.        
	A look at Antonys itinerary over the last three days confirms this. He returned by overnight flight from Berlin  where India was the guest-of-honour country at the European airshow  at seven on Thursday morning.         
	In three hours, he was in his office in South Block, poring over papers that had piled up in his absence. In between, he would have got a piece of bad news: that a colleague from Kerala, Union parliamentary affairs minister Vayalar Ravi, had publicly held him responsible for the Congresss debacle in the state in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.         
	Through Friday and Saturday, Antony swung between meetings in the defence ministry and the Congress party office. Last evening, he left for Pune, reaching there close to midnight. He was at the parade ground by 6.45 this morning after having had little more than a glass of fruit juice.         
	Till last reports, Antony was said to be doing better.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 12: India has been told that Ulfa chief Paresh Barua has fled Bangladesh, in the first official admission by the neighbouring country about the outfits operations there. Indian agencies say Barua may be in Thailand.         
	Paresh Barua is no longer in Bangladesh, but we are working and will definitely take action, director-general of Bangladesh Rifles, Maj. Gen. Shakil Ahmed, told reporters at the conclusion of the 27th India-Bangladesh border coordination talks on BSF-BDR coordination with BSF director-general, Maj. Gen. A.K. Mitra.         
	The BDR chief said Baruah is no longer in their country. Gen. Ahmeds admission was in answer to Indias demand that insurgent leaders like Barua, who have Interpol red corner notices in their names, be handed over.         
	Intelligence sources here said Barua is understood to have escaped to Bangkok on a Bangladeshi passport. They said Barua had tried to flee to Pakistan after the BSF-BDR meet last year but was prevented from doing so.        
	The Thai capital is a hiding ground for several militant leaders from the Northeast. Top leaders of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), Ulfa and the Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dima Halam Daogah (DHD) reside there  at times shuttling between Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand  and co-ordinate operations back home from there.         
	Gen. Ahmed also said Ulfa leader Anup Chetia, serving a sentence in a Bangladesh jail at present, was not being extradited because of legal hurdles. Indias request for Chetias deportation has been pending with Bangladesh since 2005, after he completed a seven-year sentence in jail. Earlier, human rights groups in Bangladesh had pressured the government to extend his jail term and give him asylum.         
	The Ulfa general secretary, however, remains out of reach for security agencies here.         
	Meanwhile, there was a sea change in the tone and tenor of Bangladesh on insurgency in India. Gen. Ahmed said insurgency in the Northeast was a threat to Bangladesh.         
	When there is smuggling of arms and criminal activities in the Northeast, some of it will spill over to Bangladesh. An insecure Northeast India is not good for us and Bangladesh will not condone such activities.               
	The number of camps on the list provided last year has come down from 141 to 117 camps. Most Indian insurgent groups operate from their camps in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

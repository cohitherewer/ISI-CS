          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Feb. 17: The Orissa government today claimed the death of 20 Maoists during combing operations amid signs that police morale was suffering under the continued rebel onslaught.        
	Two police organisations called an unprecedented news conference in Cuttack to complain how the authorities kept ignoring their demands for safety even as in Bhubaneswar, the government spoke of a fight to the finish against the rebels.        
	Senior officials said the security forces had surrounded some 100 Maoists on the Nayagarh-Ganjam border after killing 20 guerrillas, including a few young women, in Ganjams Gasama forest in an overnight encounter.        
	Three policemen, too, died in the gun battle that came a day after Friday nights rebel raid that saw 14 cops killed in Nayagarh and two armouries robbed of over 1,200 firearms and tens of thousands of bullets.        
	The Orissa Police Association (OPA) and Orissa Havildar, Constable and Sepoys Confederation blamed the state government for the mayhem.        
	We have been insisting for years that the Naxalites are mainly attacking police stations to loot arms. But the government has not taken any step to prevent it, OPA president S.M. Sharma said.        
	We demand adequate fortification of police stations and three-tier security of armouries, confederation chief Padmanav Behera said.        
	State home secretary T.K. Mishra said intense combing was on in Nayagarh, Ganjam, Kandhamal, Gajapati and Rayagada districts and would continue tonight till all the rebels are vanquished.        
	But senior officers said the police were finding the job difficult as they were neither familiar with the hilly terrain nor trained in guerrilla warfare. The rebels biggest advantage lay in the munitions looted in Nayagarh, they said.        
	The Maoists now have at least 130 SLRs, 300 Insas rifles, 30 AK-47s, 500 .303 rifles, 203 Escart rifles and 80 9mm pistols.        
	The forces are armed with night binoculars and GPS-fitted gadgets, Mishra said. The CRPF and Andhras elite Greyhound force have joined the operation. Two air force helicopters are transporting personnel.

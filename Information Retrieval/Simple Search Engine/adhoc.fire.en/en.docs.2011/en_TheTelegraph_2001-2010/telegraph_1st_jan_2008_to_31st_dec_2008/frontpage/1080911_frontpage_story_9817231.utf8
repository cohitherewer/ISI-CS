          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, Sept. 10: A part of Janata Bhawan, a heritage building and the old seat of power in Assam, was almost reduced to ashes in a fire this evening.        
	The building still housed some important offices after the inauguration of the new secretariat building on November 21, 2004, adjacent to it.        
	The offices of the right to information, handloom and textile minister Pranab Gogoi, parliamentary secretary Dildar Rezza and a section of the revenue department were gutted in the fire that was brought under control by around 20 fire tenders after almost three hours.        
	Preliminary investigations suggest that the fire could have been caused by a short circuit.         
	Since there is only one approach road to the building, we are not being able to get near the fire from all sides ... that is why it took us so long to bring the fire under control, a firefighter said.        
	Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner Prateek Hajela ordered a magistrate-level inquiry into the incident, the second one since 2005 that saw senior bureaucrats, ministers and police officials flock to the site.        
	Revenue minister Bhumidhar Barman, who visited the incident site, said it was an old building and the government was thinking of dismantling it and constructing a new one. The fire spread because the building was made mostly of pinewood, he said.                                      
	Going down memory lane, a nostalgic Barman added that he has sweet memoriesabout the building since he was attached to it since the day it was turnedinto Janata Bhawan. Former President late Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed was presentduring the inauguration, he said. The building was a tea warehouse beforeit was converted into the seat of power soon after the capital was shiftedfrom Shillong in 1973.        
	B.K. Gohain, state information commissioner, said that he arrived at theoffice at around 5.30 pm and noticed that a fire had just started in anadjacent room next to his office. By the time an alarm was raised itspread to my office, he said. Several computers and important files havebeen damaged, Gohain rued.        
	Dildar Rezza, parliamentary secretary, said that had not come to officetoday due to ill health but rushed when he heard about the fire. My office has been damaged, he said.        
	A Janata Bhawan employee said todays blaze reminded him of the fire thatbroke out on May 7, 2005 at the old secretariat building that spread to theadjacent Bhawan damaging the offices of five ministers and severalbureaucrats, including that of Barman, who was then the health minister.The then affected ministers were Anjan Dutta (transport), Hem PrakashNarayan ( secondary education), Dinesh Prasad Goala (public healthengineering) and Rocybul Hussain (MOS for Home). Fire-tenders struggledfor around two hours to contain the blaze that broke out at around 5.30pm, the employee recalled.He further recalled about the 2005 fire, The state fire serviceorganisation had warned the authorities way back in 2002 that steps need tobe taken as most of the fire extinguishers were unserviceable in theBhawan. Nothing was done then and what was subsequently done after the2005 fire is really not known. But then with most offices gradually shiftedto the new secretariat the bhawan was any way dying a slow death. The firethis has only expedited the process, he said.(eom)

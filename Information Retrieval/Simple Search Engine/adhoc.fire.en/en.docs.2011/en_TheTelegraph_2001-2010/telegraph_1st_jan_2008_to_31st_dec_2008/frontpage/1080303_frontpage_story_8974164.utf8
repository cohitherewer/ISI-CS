The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Colts bring back   crown
                                                                                                           Colts bring back   crown
          INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                            Indian Under-19 captain Kohli with the cup. (AP)                                        
	March 2: From Twenty20 in September, Indian cricket has turned 19 in March.        
	In a season when the countrys cricket stars got younger, the Indian colts won the Under-19 World Cup today edging South Africa by 12 runs in a tense, rain-shortened final in Kuala Lumpur.        
	That it came on a day Sachin Tendulkar scripted a memorable win in Australia will keep the senior-versus-junior debate alive.        
	What is beyond debate is that the Indian Premier League teams  each mandated to pick at least four Indian under-22s  will now be running with their fat chequebooks after the new champions, many of them not born when Sachin made his India debut.        
	The board has already announced Rs 15 lakh for each member of the squad, which includes Calcutta boy Sreevats Goswami who failed with the bat today but held three catches behind the stumps and pulled off a run-out.        
	I dont have words to express my feelings now. I cant say anything, said Indian skipper Virat Kohli, an all-rounder from Delhi, moments after the match. It is absolutely wonderful to win the Cup after a long while. Im lost for words. We played as a unit and that made the victory possible.        
	Indias second Under-19 World Cup comes eight years after Yuvraj Singh and his mates lifted the trophy.         
	The day didnt begin well, with the Indians bowled out for 159 in 45.4 overs, Tanmay Srivastava playing a lone hand with 46.         
	But the bowlers, led by Man-of-the-Match A.K. Argal (two for seven), hit back early reducing the Proteas to 17 for three in 8.4 overs before rain stopped play.        
	When the South Africans came out again, the Duckworth-Lewis system left them with 99 more to score off 98 balls, but a disciplined bowling and a wet outfield tied them to 103 for eight in the stipulated 25 overs.        
	Chasing in the final can be nervy: the Indians had failed to chase down 110 against Pakistan in the 2006 tournaments title game in Sri Lanka.        
	Coach Dav Whatmore declined to pick future stars from among his wards and, instead, sounded a word of caution. They are kids and have just started their careers. I wouldnt like to name anyone for special mention. Remember, one win doesnt make their careers.        
	Indian crickets newest stars, however, are 20 (Rohit Sharma) and 19 (Ishant Sharma). No one would bet against the latest entrant lowering the age bar.

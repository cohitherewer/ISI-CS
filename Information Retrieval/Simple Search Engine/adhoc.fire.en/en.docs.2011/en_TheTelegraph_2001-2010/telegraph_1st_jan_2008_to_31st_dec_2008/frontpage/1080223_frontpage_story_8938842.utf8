The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Drive to shed Haj subsidy
                                                                                                           Drive to shed Haj subsidy
  - Muslim MPs moot alternative plan        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                    
	New Delhi, Feb. 22: Muslim MPs have asked the Centre to abolish the Haj subsidy and suggested an alternative mechanism that allows pilgrims to make the journey by investing their own money.        
	The lawmakers feel that the state subsidy, besides bolstering the Sangh parivars appeasement charge, is un-Islamic. The benefit to the pilgrim is also often illusory.        
	Cutting across parties, the MPs have submitted a proposal that is now before the Union cabinet. Modelled on the Malaysian concept of Tabung Haji, the scheme involves investment in an Islamic, Shariat-compliant way.        
	Prospective pilgrims may put whatever amount they can afford in a kitty, tentatively named Haj Management Fund. They may invest the money according to a flexible schedule  monthly, yearly or one-time  and can withdraw all or some of it when they decide to go on the pilgrimage.        
	The surplus money will be ploughed back into activities sanctioned by Islam and part of the profits distributed among the investors. Islam prohibits interest, gambling, unqualified speculation and investment in companies involved in liquor, pornography, lottery or pork.        
	The cabinet has been considering changes in Haj financing, keeping in mind the need to empower Muslims and a case challenging the dole filed by a Shiv Sena activist in Allahabad High Court. Government sources said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was keen about bringing in the changes during his term.        
	However, there is opposition from the subsidy managers in the central and state Haj committees, who will become irrelevant if an alternative scheme takes shape. Since these officials are powerful clerics, their voice will be difficult to ignore.        
	Hasan Ahmed, vice-chairman of the national Haj committee, said: We are Indians, we pay our taxes dutifully and contribute to the national exchequer. It is our right to get a state subsidy.        
	P.V. Narasimha Rao had introduced the subsidy 15 years ago to try and redeem himself with the Muslims after the Babri demolition.        
	But the MPs backing the alternative plan, who are led by Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson K. Rahman Khan, have invoked a religious principle against state funding. Islam doesnt sanction the use of sarkari paisa for Haj pilgrims, said Samajwadi Party MP Shahid Siddiqui. No country, not even any Islamic nation, has ever offered to bankroll Haj, he added.        
	One MP made a second point against the subsidy: that more than helping the pilgrims, it cross-subsidises the state-owned airlines they have to compulsorily use.        
	The subsidy stops the pilgrims from flying private airlines, some of which offer more attractive packages, including hotel rooms and transport within Saudi Arabia at the same rates or less.        
	The MPs say the investment model will work well even though most Indian Muslims are not as well-off as those in Malaysia.        
	We have the numbers. Malaysia has 15 million Muslims; we have 150 million. Even if 10 per cent of them invest (in the Haj kitty), we will have Rs 8,000-10,000 crore every year, Khan said. Going by past estimates, the subsidy costs nearly Rs 300 crore.        
	To counter the charge of being money-minded, the MPs have proposed that whatever profits are left in the kitty after paying the investors should be spent on setting up schools, hospitals, orphanages and shelter homes.        
	Khan said the poorest Muslims  from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal  will benefit the most from the scheme. Some 1.47 lakh Muslims perform Haj every year, with Bengal sending the largest number after Uttar Pradesh.  
	The Number    Indian Haj pilgrims a year 1.47 lakh  Govt subsidy  Rs 280 crore*

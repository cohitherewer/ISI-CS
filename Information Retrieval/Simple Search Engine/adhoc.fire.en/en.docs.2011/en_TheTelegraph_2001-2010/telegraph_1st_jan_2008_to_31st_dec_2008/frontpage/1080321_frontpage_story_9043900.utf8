	Thar desert range, March 20: Shock and Awe.         
	No awe, really, just numbed with shock.         
	And this was supposed to be brazen!         
	Three Indian soldiers were killed in the Pokhran firing range yesterday afternoon, attempting to recreate Americas desert charge into Iraq exactly five years back, in an exercise called Brazen Chariots.         
	For foreign and invited guests, the army had rigged up loudspeakers that blared running commentary during the drill. The armys commentators were making little secret of their American lessons learnt from the coalition forces in the Arab desert. Some of these lessons went beyond armoured manoeuvres and into the realm of lexicon with phrases like shock and awe.         
	On March 19, 2003, America launched Operation Iraqi Freedom. This correspondent was that night on a sand berm on the Kuwait-Iraq border through which the US-led coalition forces broke into Iraq incinerating the town of Safwan.         
	Five years on, I was on a sand dune in the Thar, 65km east of Jaisalmer, covering a war game that demonstrates the lessons the Indian Army has learnt from Operation Iraqi Freedom. In the gallery called Point 214 there was a global audience, 103 military representatives from 59 countries.         
	None of them knew that the Indian Army had tragically discovered a flipside of Shock and Awe. In military parlance, the flipside is known as Blue on Blue. America called it blue on blue when it accidentally shot down a friendly British airplane.         
	The Indian Army recorded blue and blue, but the blood in the sand was the same red, when three of its blueland forces self-destructed attempting to fire a faulty mortar on an imaginary redland (enemy) target.         
	It was a tragedy compounded. First, the Indian Army assumed Americas Iraq experience was the right lesson to learn and illustrate. Second, it invited representatives from across the globe to watch this exercise that it called Brazen Chariots  the second time that it has done so since 2005.         
	We journalists, invited to cover the drill, had travelled in high-mobility vehicles, the big-wheeled Czech-origin Tatra trucks with open sides that drove through the desert for 20km to our destination.         
	The destination was a gallery that the Golden Katar (11 Infantry) division had erected on a sand dune that resembled a clenched fist. The gallery was on the knuckle, the fingers were the battlefield.         
	Four kilometres back, the artillery was firing. The 155mm Bofors guns that makes the earth quake. The newest arty acquisition, the Smerch rockets that backfire like Sivakasi fireworks to launch their rockets up to 90km into their targets. And just after them, on the inside of a ridge, a battery of 120mm mortars.         
	The mortars looked the simplest  metal tubes with a trigger. The shells were inserted into the tubes. The tubes were at angles from the ground in the approximate direction of the target. They were heavy tubes, each weighing up to 85kg. I saw soldiers carrying them on shoulders. Each 120mm mortar had a crew of five.         
	They were here in the desert for two months, rehearsing for the big day, wanting to ensure that everything was perfect for the television and for the firangs.         
	There was a funny conversation I overheard. It was between the major who was the liaison officer and a colleague from a television channel. Maaan, the colleague said, that guy carrying 85km should get a bottle of rum tonight. Major Ajay Suri, the liaison officer, shot back: You dont think he deserves a 10 per cent hike in his salary?         
	Army Headquarters in New Delhi is making a strong case before the sixth Pay Commission.         
	I wondered if it was the havildar fetching up that mortar barrel on his shoulder who was killed. The army has not given details of ranks. All that it said was that they were personnel below officer rank.         
	When the mortar barrel burst, killing the three soldiers, those of us on the ridge could not see it. Indian Air Force Sukhoi 30s and MiG 27s were pounding the sand dunes in front of us, the rumble of the explosions coming through a minute after the flashes of fire. T-90 Bhishma tanks just ahead of us were firing round upon round.         
	It was a beautiful war. Perfect and picturesque.         
	The tragedy was outside the frame.        
	Always is.

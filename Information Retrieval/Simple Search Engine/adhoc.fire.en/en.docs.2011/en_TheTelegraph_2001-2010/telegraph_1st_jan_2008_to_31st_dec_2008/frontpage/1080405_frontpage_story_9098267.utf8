The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Back-to-back meetings on security
                                                                                                           Back-to-back meetings on security
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, April 4: Concerned over the prevailing security situation in the state as well as the delay in completing two national projects in trouble-torn North Cachar Hills, the Centre has convened back-to-back meetings in Delhi on April 10 and 11 involving state government officials.         
	Sources in the chief ministers office said chief secretary P.C. Sharma, along with senior home department and police officials, would attend the twin meetings.         
	While Union home secretary Madhukar Gupta will discuss the security situation, principal secretary in the Prime Ministers Office, T.K.A. Nair, will hold deliberations on the time-bound completion of the twin national projects.         
	The meetings are intertwined as both involve security which has been dominating the headlines of late. Moreover, the two projects have been held to ransom by the Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dima Halam Daogah despite stepped-up security. Besides insurgents, we are also threatened by jihadi elements. The Ulfa issue could also figure in the discussions, an official said.         
	He said the team bound for Delhi is collecting data and materials for presentation to officials in the North Block, that houses the ministry of home affairs. We need to be fully prepared to answer any query on law and order or the mega projects, the official said. The team will seek more help, financial and personnel to cope with the situation till a breakthrough is made on the insurgency front.         
	The meeting in North Block assumes significance because the leader of the Opposition in the Assam Assembly, Chandra Mohan Patowary, plucked data from one of the home ministry reports and described the situation in the state till November last year as a matter of concern.         
	Till November 2007, 268 civilians, 112 militants and 25 security personnel were killed in Assam.         
	The report, quoted by Patowary, had stated, Out of the eight states of the Northeast, there is no violence in Sikkim. In Mizoram also, the situation is peaceful. There is low intensity violence in some parts of Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh. The overall number of incidents is quite similar to (that in) previous years but there has been an increase in the number of incidents in 2007 (upto 31.10.2007) as compared to 2006.         
	The number of civilians killed last year upto October 31 has increased by 79 per cent over those killed in the previous year, mostly because of targeted killing of Hindi-speaking people in Assam. Militant activities in Assam and Manipur continue to be a matter of concern, and are being dealt (with) accordingly.         
	The situation is particularly grim in NC Hills where the DHD (J) targets contractors and workers engaged in the twin national projects at will, thereby pushing back the deadline for completion of the same.         
	That the security scenario was a cause of concern was also evident from the budget speech of chief minister Tarun Gogoi, wherein he had spoken about the governments plans to set up a full-fledged counter-insurgency academy and a special task force to counter insurgents. The government also plans to set up 45 new police stations in the char areas.         
	The PMO meeting assumes significance because it also has to find the reasons for the delay in fencing the international border along Bangladesh, a commitment made in the 1985 Assam Accord. The twin projects could be one of the issues but the international border issue is equally important, the official said. What he left unsaid was the flak Dispur had faced for missing the March 31 deadline to fence the border.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Rain, rain, come again                                
	New Delhi, July 17: Rainfall is expected to decline further over the next week across swathes of central and southern India that have been reeling under a deficient monsoon, the India Meteorological Department said today.        
	At a time the country is receiving higher than average rain, the IMD has predicted a decline in central Maharashtra, Vidarbha, Marathwada, Gujarat and coastal Andhra Pradesh. In these areas, rainfall has been deficient with worst-hit Marathwada receiving only 36 per cent of its average.        
	Its worrying because the average for some of these areas is itself low, said a senior weather scientist. Marathwada and Vidarbha are part of a plateau that is drier than the west coast.        
	Rainfall on the plateau depends on the formation of a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal and its movement along a specific track across Orissa, Chhattisgarh and southern Madhya Pradesh.        
	We did have one low-pressure system that moved in from the Bay this year, but it travelled far too much to the north of its expected track  thats one reason for the poor rainfall in central India, the scientist said.        
	Weather scientists are now hoping for new low-pressure systems to form over the Bay in the next three or four weeks. The period from July 15 to August 15 is usually the rainiest, the scientist said.        
	The total all-India rainfall so far has been 6 per cent above normal. The deficiency in central India has been offset by the northwest, which has received 77 per cent excess rain. An IMD update issued last week said Gangetic Bengal received 534mm of rain  60 per cent more than its average.

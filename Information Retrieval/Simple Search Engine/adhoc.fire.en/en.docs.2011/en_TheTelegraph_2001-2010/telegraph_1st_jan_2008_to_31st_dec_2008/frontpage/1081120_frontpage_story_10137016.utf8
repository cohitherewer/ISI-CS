          OUR BUREAU                             The bodies of Kallol Sarkar and Rajkumar Mahato lie next to the barren transformer post near Belgharia station. Some accounts suggested the two crashed against the post because of overcrowding. Others said the holding rod in the bogie came off, hurling the two to death.

	Calcutta, Nov. 19: Two persons hanging out of an overcrowded local train apparently crashed into a defunct transformer pole at rush hour this morning and died instantly.        
	Kallol Sarkar and Rajkumar Mahato, who were travelling on the Down Naihati-Sealdah local, hit the pole between Belgharia and Dum Dum around 10am, but it is not clear how exactly the accident happened.        
	A witness on the train said an iron rod near the door that the duo  and several others  were holding on to suddenly came unstuck, flinging them out. Others blamed the deaths on the transformer pole that is reportedly closer to the rail tracks than it should ideally be.        
	The local people, who put up a blockade after the crash, said they had repeatedly requested the railways to uproot the pole as it was closer to the centre of the rail track than the minimum permissible 2.35 metres. But their pleas had fallen on deaf ears.        
	These posts have not been in use for several years and we have sent people on deputation several times, said Ranjit Sarkar, the leader of the local hawkers body.        
	The protesters refused to let police take away the bodies till the pole was removed, around 4pm.        
	One of the four others who had fallen out of the train at the same time as Mahato and Sarkar but survived recounted what he had seen as he lay on a trolley in NRS Medical College and Hospital.        
	Sumit Ranjan Chakraborty said eight to 10 persons had been jostling for space near the train door. Suddenly, the vertical rod we were holding on to came loose and I lost my grip.        
	I remember that two persons standing in front of me fell with a thud after they crashed into the pole. I am lucky I survived, he said, thankful he had got away with a fractured left thigh bone.        
	The railways have, however, trashed his claim. Our preliminary inquiry suggests that no rod had come loose, an official said.        
	The Eastern Railway has ordered a probe but declined comment on whether the train was adequately maintained. Exemplary punishment will be given if any one is found guilty of negligence, an official said.        
	Hitesh Kumar, who was Mahatos roommate in the Belgharia mess he stayed in, said they had gone to the station together. But I could not board the train as it was too crowded.        
	Mahato, who was from Jharkhand, was on his way to a Salt Lake training institute where he had enrolled for a course on stock markets six months ago. Sarkar was on his way to work.

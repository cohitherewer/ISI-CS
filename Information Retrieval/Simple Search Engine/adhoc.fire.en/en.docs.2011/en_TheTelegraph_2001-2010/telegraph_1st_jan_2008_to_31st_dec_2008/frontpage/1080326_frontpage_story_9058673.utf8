The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pranab leaves timeline open

  - In US, minister spares Left on deal        K.P. NAYAR                             President George W. Bush with Mukherjee at the Oval Office. They met for 35 minutes on Monday. (PTI)                                        
	Washington, March 25: External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee wound up his three-day visit to the US on a note of pessimism on the nuclear deal, telling the Americans that it is difficult to indicate a timeframe for operationalising the landmark agreement.        
	Addressing a news conference just before leaving Washington, Mukherjee said he was aware of the timetable in the US Congress for ratifying the so-called 123 Agreement in view of elections in America.        
	But unless problems in the domestic field are resolved, which may take some more time, it may be difficult to meet the imperatives of the US timetable.        
	In a bizarre twist of events, the chief UPA negotiator with the Left parties blamed the BJP for the governments inability to proceed with the deal.        
	That twist came when Mukherjees recent statement that a minority government could not operationalise the deal was vigorously challenged by reporters on the ground that constitutionally, there was no such entity called a minority government.        
	He conceded that point, but went on to say that a government that makes international commitments must be accountable to Parliament and have a majority on moral grounds.        
	He went on to say that the BJP, which was in power for six years, was opposed to the nuclear deal and cited a principle that the next government should not disown agreements made by its predecessor.        
	This statement sowed seeds of confusion with some in the audience interpreting the statement as a concession of defeat in advance of the 2009 general election and an implicit acknowledgement that the next government at the Centre would be led by the BJP.        
	At no point did Mukherjee name the Left parties, on whom he was soft during the entire news conference.        
	However, explaining the problems to an American reporter who wanted to know the sticking points in implementing the deal, the minister said opposition to the deal was ideological.        
	He said it was not an either/or situation where the option was one of either giving up the deal or sacrificing the government.        
	Not every partner in the ruling alliance, he pointed out, was opposed to the deal and held out hopes that there would eventually be a meeting ground between us and all our supporters.        
	Meanwhile, the government is interested in fructifying the agreement, he said, adding that a consensus will hasten the process of operationalising the deal.        
	The minister said he would like to visit Pakistan as soon as the newly elected government there had settled down and revive the composite dialogue with Islamabad.        
	Mukherjee denied that India was supplying arms to Myanmar and detailed the constructive role that New Delhi was playing in order to bring normalcy there.

	London, July 23: Christian Bale fought with his mother in Londons Dorchester Hotel after she insulted his wife, it was alleged today.         
	The Batman star flew off the handle and cussed his mother after she said outrageous things about former model Sandra Sibi Blazic, according to a source close to the actor quoted by the Daily Mail website.         
	Bale, 34, was arrested yesterday in connection with an alleged assault on his mother and sister, but was freed on bail after five hours of police questioning. He denies all wrongdoing. Bale, who was in London promoting his new film The Dark Knight, didnt lay a finger on anyone during the dispute on Sunday, according to the source.         
	Christians attitude is that this was his mothers fault because she became very provocative in an argument they were having, the paper quoted the source as saying.         
	Christian was stressed, but he didnt lay a finger on anyone. Instead, he flew off the handle and cussed his mother. He just got very loud because his mother was saying some very outrageous things about him, and his wife. It is understood that the actors relationship with Blazic has been strained in recent months.         
	Bale is expected to continue shooting the next Terminator film following the assault allegation. He will continue his promotional tour of The Dark Knight, with the next stop Barcelona as the film opens around the world         
	After that he is expected to return to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to continue shooting the next movie in the Terminator franchise. Bale cemented his status as a Hollywood A-lister when he helped re-boot the Batman franchise. He is now expected to do the same with Terminator, as he stars as John Connor in Terminator Salvation.

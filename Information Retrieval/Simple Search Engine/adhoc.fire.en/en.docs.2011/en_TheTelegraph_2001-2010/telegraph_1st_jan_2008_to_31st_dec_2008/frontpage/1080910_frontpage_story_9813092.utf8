The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | No talk of 300 acres: Adviser   Ex-judge sets the record straight

	Calcutta, Sept. 9: The legal adviser to the governor has told The Telegraph that there was no talk of 300 acres at the meeting between Mamata Banerjee and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Sunday.        
	I was present at Sundays meeting between the chief minister and Mamata Banerjee. There it was decided that a few acres of land from within the project area would be given to the farmers who have not yet collected the cheques, but there was no talk of 300 acres, former chief justice Chittatosh Mookerjee said tonight.        
	The revelation, which contradicts Mamatas claim that prompted the Tatas to seek a clarification from the government and keep work suspended at Singur, is certain to add to the mounting pressure on the Trinamul Congress leader to defuse the crisis.        
	Mamatas interaction with Jyoti Basu and the reluctance of her party to get involved with the hunt for alternative land outside the Singur complex have fuelled speculation that she might not be averse to scaling down her demands.        
	Even in the resolution, the word maximum has been mentioned as the maximum possible that could be handed over at the project site. If both sides take extreme positions, then the matter will never be resolved, Mookerjee, who provided legal assistance during the talks, added.        
	Mamata has been insisting that the Sunday statement  which mentions land to be provided to the maximum within the project area  meant most of the allotment would be from inside the complex.         
	A few hours before Mookerjees disclosure, a Raj Bhavan official said governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi was pained at the way the spirit of the agreement was being misinterpreted.        
	The Opposition claim that most of the land in the rehabilitation package would come from within the project area goes against the spirit of the agreement and the governor is pained by its misinterpretation, the official said.        
	Gandhi today met Mookerjee and state advocate-general Balai Ray separately, apparently to seek views on how to clear the air. Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti apprised the governor of the outcome of the first meeting of a four-member committee on Singur land.        
	 The governor was told that two members of the committee (Trinamul representatives Rabindranath Bhattacharya and Becharam Manna ) were insisting on the return of 300 acres of land from within the project site, an official said.        
	Sources said the relevant sentence in the first draft was to the maximum extent possible but the word possible, which would have precluded any ambiguity, was dropped on the Oppositions insistence.        
	Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee, one of the signatories of the statement, refused either to confirm or deny the version. There were so many drafts and so many changes. I dont know whether there was any such word or not. What matters now is that the government agreed to the final draft, Chatterjee said.        
	Sensing a minefield ahead, Trinamul today sought to cry off the land hunt. The agreement requires the party to co-operate with the government in finding land inside and outside the Singur complex for rehabilitation of landlosers.        
	But Bhattacharya, the Trinamul MLA from Singur, and Manna, the leader of the Save Farmland Committee, said neither the party nor the resistance outfit would assume the responsibility. Acquiring or securing land cannot be our job, said Bhattacharya. Its the governments job. Manna echoed the sentiments.        
	The two know well that seeking to find land in Singur will be akin to playing with fire, especially with prices going through the roof and potential sellers biding their time to make a bigger killing.        
	The duo also made it clear to the rest of the panel members that their brief was to go through the papers and not to sign anything, lending credence to a perception that Mamata had deliberately put lightweights on the committee. In the event of unfavourable findings, she can always say the party nominees could not present their case properly, a Trinamul leader said.

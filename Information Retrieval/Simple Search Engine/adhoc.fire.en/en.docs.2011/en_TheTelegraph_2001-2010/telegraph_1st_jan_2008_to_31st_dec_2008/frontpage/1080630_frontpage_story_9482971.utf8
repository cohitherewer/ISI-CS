The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Karat unsheathes withdrawal sword
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Karat unsheathes withdrawal sword
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, June 29: The W-word is out. Prakash Karat today uttered the phrase withdraw support for the first time, dumping euphemisms like serious consequences that he had been using.        
	Reading out a politburo statement, the CPM general secretary said his party would dump the Centre if it went ahead with the nuclear deal.        
	And if the government still persisted and scouted for new allies, the CPM could vote against it in a floor test alongside the BJP and United National Progressive Alliance partners like the Telugu Desam Party, CPM sources said.        
	In case the government decides to go ahead with such a harmful agreement, which has no majority support in Parliament, the CPM will withdraw support in concert with the (other) Left parties, Karat said.        
	The politburo statement targeted the Congress leadership along with the Prime Minister, two days after Karat had principally blamed Manmohan Singh for the crisis over the deal.        
	The statement comes a day after Sonia Gandhi told her party to get poll-ready by end-August and the Congress declared there was no difference between Singh and the party.        
	It is unfortunate that at a time the government should be gearing up to take comprehensive steps to tackle inflation and price rise, the Prime Minister and the Congress leadership are more concerned about fulfilling their commitment made to President Bush, the politburo said.        
	Within hours of the statement being issued, the BJP asked the government to seek a floor test in Parliament on the Indo-US deal.        
	We will ask the government to face a confidence vote in the Lok Sabha on the nuclear issue following the present political situation, shadow Prime Minister L.K. Advani told a rally in Rourkela, Orissa.        
	We cannot sacrifice our atomic energy and future tests in Pokhran by signing the agreement with the USA.        
	The Congress played down the CPMs withdrawal threat and dismissed its opposition to the deal as political.        
	Its nothing new. This has been the Left stand since long, party spokesman Shakeel Ahmed said.        
	The politburo, however, insisted that its opposition to the deal was not just ideological  as the Congress has often argued  but also rational and claimed that the 123 Agreement didnt ensure full civilian nuclear co-operation or meet the needs of energy security.        
	Sources said the Left would publicise the nine notes exchanged during the past nine meetings of the UPA-Left committee. This, they claimed, would prove that the Centre had not addressed Left concerns on the 123 Agreement, (the) Hyde Acts implications on the deal, and the safeguards text, which the government said was classified.        
	The politburo again stressed that going ahead with the deal would help the communal forces, especially with inflation in double digits in an election year.        
	Congress spokesman Ahmed denied both charges  that pushing the deal would help the BJP, and that the Centre had not done much to check inflation.        
	The government has taken a series of steps to bring down the prices of essentials, which are rising because of a hike in international crude prices, Ahmed said. This, he added, had kept inflation lower in India compared with several other Asian countries.        
	Ahmed argued that nuclear fuel was cleaner than coal and more reliable than wind, and that the developed countries were increasingly turning to nuclear energy as a cleaner fuel option.        
	The CPM said: The politburo reiterates its firm opposition to the 123 Agreement which does not provide for full civilian nuclear co-operation; does not meet the needs of energy security and which will severely undermine the countrys independent foreign policy and strategic autonomy by cementing a strategic alliance with the United States.

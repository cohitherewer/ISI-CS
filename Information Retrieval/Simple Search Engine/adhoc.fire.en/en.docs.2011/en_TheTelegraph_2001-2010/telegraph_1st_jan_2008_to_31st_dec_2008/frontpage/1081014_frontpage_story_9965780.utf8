          SANJAY K. JHA                            Hema Malini, Vijaya Raje Scindia: Reel and real                                
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: Twenty-five years ago, Indias Dream Girl had portrayed the empress Razia Sultan on screen. Now used to playing mom, Hema Malini will be doing a Rajmata.        
	If the box office isnt excited, never mind, her party definitely is.        
	Hema, a BJP MP, will be stepping on a Mumbai studio floor tomorrow to start shooting for a biopic on late party leader Vijaya Raje Scindia, popularly known as Rajmata.         
	Sushma Swaraj will do the clapping at the muhurat while the likes of Gopinath Munde, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and the Rajmatas politician daughters, Vasundhara Raje and Yashodhara Raje, will turn out to watch.        
	Is it being planned as a movie to be screened at political rallies as a rural crowd waits for the VIPs to turn up? Perish the thought, says the BJP. It will be a full-length feature film that will hit the theatres in December.        
	Hema isnt the only Bollywood star in the film: fellow MP Vinod Khanna will play the Rajmatas husband Jivajirao Scindia, the former Maharaja of Gwalior.        
	The film, based on the Rajmatas autobiography Rajpath Se Lokpath Par, will be called Ek Thi Rani Aisi Bhi.        
	We want to show the country there was a queen who didnt fit into the stereotype; she relinquished the royal comforts to serve the people, BJP leader Mridula Sinha, who ghosted the Rajmatas autobiography, said.        
	The Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia Smriti Nyas, headed by Sinha, will finance the film, to be directed by Gulbahar Singh of Dattak fame.        
	Vijaya Raje Scindia had initially joined the Congress, inspired by the freedom struggle, but later moved to the Jan Sangh because of her religious feelings. Her son Madhavrao Scindia remained in the Congress till his death. His son Jyotiraditya, a Congress MP, is not part of the project.        
	The Rajmata was born Lekha Divyeshwari in 1919 to a branch of the Nepal royal family living in exile in Sagar, India. She was renamed Vijaya Raje after her marriage into the Scindia clan.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 17: If everybody and his uncle are opening malls, so will the Bengal government.        
	The state budget unveiled today has mooted food malls under a new marketing corporation but some allies are smelling in the decision a move to cut the Forward Bloc to size and tackle the procurement problems dogging private investors.        
	The proposed corporation, along with members of self-help groups (SHGs), will procure farm produce directly from farmers and anchor a retail outlet chain across the state, according to finance minister Asim Dasgupta. The chain will initially sell foodgrain and later vegetables.        
	He made a budgetary allocation of Rs 100 crore as share capital contribution of the state government, hoping to mop up Rs 300 crore more from the market.        
	Dasgupta said the procurement-to-retail chain would compete with domestic corporate groups which are increasingly entering agri-marketing and retail.         
	The set-up will run parallel to the Bloc-controlled State Marketing Board that has been planning a retail chain of its own named Bengal Fresh.        
	The Bloc opposes the entry of big private players like Reliance but the CPM and the government favour regulated presence of domestic investors.        
	The board, which procures through marketing co-operatives, has no direct access to the growers. But 7.34 lakh SHGs with 70 lakh members, 90 per cent of whom are women, will buy directly from the farmers, with panchayats and municipalities helping them, Dasgupta said.         
	The government had laid the ground for such a move by passing a bill that enables zilla parishads and municipalities to build and run shopping complexes.        
	The announcement of the new corporation was greeted with suspicion by the Opposition and the Bloc that excess stocks would be sold to companies like Reliance, which has not yet been given a procurement licence by the Bloc-run board. Whether private investors need such a licence is a grey area.        
	A Bloc leader said the partys suspicion was based on the perception that the new chain would not have sufficient infrastructure facilities like cold storage. Such lacunae will force the corporation to sell to whoever is willing to buy, he added.        
	But Dasgupta said the new corporation would not procure for or sell bulk agro-products to big companies.        
	The governments proposed expenditure  Rs 400 crore  is not an insignificant amount, though it pales before the Rs 2,000-2,500 crore Reliance originally wanted to invest in Bengal retail. The finance minister said the project was aimed more at controlling prices. Food prices have been inching up steadily.         
	He said the corporation would curb the role of city-based intermediaries and hoarders. It would be a professionally managed system.

	President George W. Bush phoned Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday to discuss joint efforts to push the nuclear deal forward as expeditiously as possible.        
	AFP quoted US national security council spokesperson Gordon Johndroe as saying Bush told Singh that he looks forward to continuing to work with his government to strengthen the United States-India strategic relationship.

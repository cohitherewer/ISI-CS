The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Files fly off DGHC offices 
                                                                                                           Files fly off DGHC offices 
  - DM orders probe as retired officers come under scanner          VIVEK CHHETRI                                    
	Darjeeling, March 10: More than 100 official files were seized from residences of retired DGHC officers today, prompting Darjeeling district magistrate Rajesh Pandey, in his capacity as the principal secretary of the hill council, to order an inquiry. The probe order comes a day after Subash Ghisingh resigned as caretaker administrator of the DGHC.        
	The raids started after Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leaders complained to Darjeeling police that the former officers were removing files from Lal Kothi, the administrative headquarters of the council, and other DGHC offices.        
	The police confirmed seizing 117 files from Sonam Tshering, who had stepped down as the officer in charge of power (rural electrification) on February 25. A photocopy of a note, where Ghisingh had asked officials to expedite the process of transferring Rs 30 lakh to a current account held by him on February 27 1992, was recovered from T. Wangchuk, a former finance secretary of the council. According to the note, the sum was to be transferred from the rural development fund.        
	Although government officials could not immediately confirm if a chairman is entitled to have a current account, Morcha leaders have questioned the legality of the funds transfer. How can retired officers keep official documents with them? We are also trying to find out whether money meant for rural development can be transferred to the chairmans current account, said Amar Lama, a central committee leader of the Morcha.         
	The police have also acted against other council officers and are preparing an inventory of the seized files, the number of which is expected to cross the 150 mark. Tshering said he had brought the files home as no officer had been appointed to the post of central technical adviser from which he was transferred in 2007.        
	Pandey said officers have been told not to move any files without permission from the secretaries.

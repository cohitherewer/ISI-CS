          CHANDRAJIT MUKHERJEE                              
	Ranchi, Nov. 10: The state government today conceded before Jharkhand High Court that its public distribution system had failed to serve the poor as ration shops ended up benefiting those above the poverty line.        
	In an affidavit filed in the court in connection with a contempt petition relating to a PIL on a hunger death in Hazaribagh, chief secretary A.K. Basu also said that a survey of over 20,000 PDS outlets had been conducted and necessary action taken against those found to be wanting in their operations. He said owners of 3,293 PDS outlets had been showcaused for not supplying foodgrains to the poor. Around 900 licences for PDS shops had been suspended, while FIRs had been registered against 197 shop owners for misappropriation of foodgrains.         
	By reviewing the public distribution system and taking strict action against unscrupulous operators, Basu assured the court the government was geared up to meet its responsibilities to ensure there were no more starvation deaths in the state.         
	He also informed the court about various welfare schemes being run by the government. In 2007-08, about 9,637 tonne of foodgrains had been distributed among 5.15 lakh BPL families. According to the 2001 census, the state has 29.06 lakh BPL families while the relief sanctioned by the Centre was only for 23.95 lakh BPL families, he said.         
	 Basu told the court that BPL families had been divided into three categories for relief distribution. The Antyoday Anna scheme launched in September 2007 provided 35 kg cereal to the poor. While wheat was available at Rs 4.62, rice was pegged at Rs 6.15 under the scheme. In another category, wheat and rice were made available at Rs 2 and Rs 3 respectively. All senior citizens above 65 years were also provided 10 kg of foodgrains at subsidised rates. The bench was hearing a contempt application filed by Arun Kumar in 2007 citing the starvation death of Antu Munda in Hazaribagh to highlight the plight of the people.         
	And the governments apathy towards the poor who couldnt afford a single square meal a day.        
	 The high court had expressed its anguish on the working of the state government and the failure of the public distribution system. It had directed the chief secretary to take prompt action and inform the court about the measures taken to prevent future starvation deaths.

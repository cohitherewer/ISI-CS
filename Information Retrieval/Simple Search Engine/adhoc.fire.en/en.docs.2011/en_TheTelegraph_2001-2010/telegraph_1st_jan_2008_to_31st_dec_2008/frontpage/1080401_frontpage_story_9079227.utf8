	Bhubaneswar, March 31: Heads rolled today after a week of turmoil over the sexual slur on Orissa Speaker.        
	While Speaker Maheswar Mohanty resigned this afternoon following the sexual harassment charges against him, information and public relations minister Debasis Nayak was sacked, for his alleged role in fuelling charges made by the assistant lady marshal, Gayatri Panda, against the Speaker.         
	Last week, Panda had dropped a bombshell when she had lashed out at Mohanty for assigning her duty beyond working hours and out of her jurisdiction. He would make inappropriate gestures and send his driver and staff to persuade me to indulge in a physical relation with him, she had charged, adding that Mohanty had sent his official car to her house around midnight on two occasions.         
	On Monday afternoon, Speaker Maheswar Mohanty sent in his resignation letter (in Oriya) to deputy Speaker Prahlad Dora where he stated that he was stepping down to uphold the dignity of the Assembly and the office of the Speaker. He requested Dora to institute an impartial probe and take appropriate action against those guilty.         
	However, the man refused to answer media questions. Whatever I want to say, I have written in my resignation letter, he told reporters.         
	Panda was not available for comment. Later, it was revealed that the woman was at her maternal aunts place in Kumuda village and faced police interrogated.         
	Important facts will come out after the interrogations complete, said police commissioner Binay Behera. NGO activist Rituparna Mohanty, who filed an FIR on Pandas behalf, reacting to Speakers move, said: This proves that no one is above the law.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik was kinder to his fellow BJD member and said: I understand Mohanty felt uncomfortable with the way a section of the House was behaving.         
	In his letter, Mohanty has refuted the false and baseless allegations levelled against him by an indisciplined employee who had denigrated the Houses dignity, as well as the high office of the Speaker. I am pained to see that some people tried to create an unsavory situation.        
	Naveen today recommended the dismissal of Nayak from the council of ministers to Governor M.C. Bhandare, as the former had lost his confidence.         
	I have recommended his removal since he no longer enjoys my confidence, the chief minister said.        
	Later, the governor accepted the recommendation. The portfolios (information and public relations, sports and youth service) held by him will be looked after by the chief minister himself.         
	Mohantys supporters have alleged that Nayak had a hand in Pandas move.         
	Nayak, however, denied allegations in a news statement issued last night. Today, he remained incommunicado for the entire day.

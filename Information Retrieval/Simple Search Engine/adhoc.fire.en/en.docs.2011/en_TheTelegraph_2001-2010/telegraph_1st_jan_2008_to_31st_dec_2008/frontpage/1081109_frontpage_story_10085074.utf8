                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bangladesh biggest threat: Gogoi
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, Nov. 8: Chief minister Tarun Gogoi today said the biggest threat to the state was from Bangladesh as several terrorist outfits, who are in touch with the local outfits, operate from there.        
	Stopping short of accusing the neighbouring country of exporting terror, Gogoi said he would take up the matter with the Centre to ensure that the groups operating from there are flushed out.        
	The chief minister said he would visit the border areas and take all possible steps to block the groups entry points into the state.        
	Assam is the most vulnerable state in regard to terror attacks from Bangladeshi soil. It is the main problem as a large number of terrorist groups there help our local outfits. There are militant outfits in Myanmar and Nepal as well but Bangladesh remains our biggest threat, he said.        
	Gogois concern was understandable as his government is under pressure from the Centre to tackle terrorism. The serial blasts on October 30 have claimed 85 lives so far in four districts of the state.        
	He said the issue of terror outfits operating from Bangladeshi and Myanmarese soil would be taken up with the Prime Ministers Office and external affairs ministry to flush out militants from those countries.         
	I will ask for all possible help to put an end to terror. I will visit the Bangladesh border and seek help from states like Tripura and Meghalaya, he said.        
	Sources in Dispur said the Centre had identified 46 points along Bangladesh that were vulnerable to both influx and export of terrorists by Huji from that country. These points are not only confined to the three northeastern states but also West Bengal.         
	Gogoi did not name any group or force behind the blasts like Ulfa, the ISI of Pakistan or jihadi forces, but did not give them a clean chit either.         
	He appealed to all the religious leaders to sit together and discuss what needs to be done to tackle religious terrorism, as it was more dangerous than any other form of terror.         
	He hailed the resilience of the common man to come out in the open to condemn the blasts. The terrorists have not been successful in creating a fear psychosis in the minds of the public, which is a good sign, Gogoi said.         
	At a meeting of sitting and former Congress MLAs convened by the chief minister this evening to discuss the political situation in the state, Gogoi said his governments track record vis--vis civilian deaths was better than the erstwhile AGP-led regime.         
	Compared to 1,536 civilian casualties during the AGPs five-year tenure, there were only 1,517 casualties in eight years of our rule. We have recovered 1,000 bombs and grenades compared to around 121 seized during the AGP regime, a participant said, quoting Gogoi.

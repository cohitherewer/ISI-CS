	Ranchi, March 10: On a day the House ethics committee tabled a model code of conduct for MLAs, the Assembly had to be adjourned thrice for ruckus over last weeks immolation-bid by a Grade IV government employee at the secretariat.        
	The budget session began on Monday with the Opposition moving an adjournment motion for a debate on the issue, which Speaker Alamgir Alam rejected.        
	An adjournment motion is supposed to stop all listed business for the day to debate an issue of extreme public importance.        
	Alam tried to pacify members by allowing 10 minutes on the issue, but the Opposition rejected his offer and trooped into the Well several times raising slogans like hatyari sarkar hosh mein aao....hai hai...        
	Leader of Opposition Arjun Munda said no issue could be as important as the self-immolation attempt by government employees.        
	Finance minister Stephen Marandi accused the Opposition of raking up the issue for cheap popularity. Pandemonium prevailed throughout the day, with barely an hour-and-a-half of work post-lunch.

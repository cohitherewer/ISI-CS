          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Sept. 29: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has decided to relax its ban on the payment of electricity bills  part of its non-cooperation movement for statehood  for the next three months starting October.        
	The Morcha has, however, made it clear that the outstanding dues will not be cleared.         
	Following a request from the chief minister, the Morcha decided to relax its non-cooperation movement with regard to non-payment of electricity bills. We will pay the bills for October, November and December. But no one will pay the outstanding dues which have accumulated so far, said Roshan Giri, the Morcha general secretary.         
	The Morcha had begun its movement against collection of government revenues from April 1 this year. Since then, the hill people have stopped paying all state and central taxes including land revenue, motor vehicle tax and telephone bills.         
	In a meeting held at Writers Buildings in Calcutta on September 10, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had requested the Morcha central committee members to review their movement with regard to electricity bills. He had said the total outstanding electricity bill dues had accumulated to Rs 9.36 crore and it had hit the state exchequer hard. Given the Morcha stand, the state government is unlikely to press for clearing up of the dues.        
	Keeping in mind the second round of tripartite talks in November this year, our party president, Bimal Gurung, decided to lift the ban on payment of power bills. We want to create a congenial atmosphere for the talks for our final objective is to achieve a separate state. We are ready to do anything to achieve our goal, said Giri.         
	He said Gurung had communicated the decision to the chief minister today. In Calcutta, home secretary, Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said: The Morcha has agreed to pay the power bills. They have reacted positively to the chief ministers request. He added that there had been no discussion on the dues.        
	When the chief minister requested them (the Morcha delegation), they had said they would confer with senior leaders and let us know. They did so today, the home secretary said.

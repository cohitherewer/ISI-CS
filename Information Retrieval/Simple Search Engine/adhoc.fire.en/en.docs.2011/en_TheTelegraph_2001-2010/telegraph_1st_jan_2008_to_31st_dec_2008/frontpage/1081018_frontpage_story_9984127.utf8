          SANTOSH K. KIRO                              
	McCluskieganj, Oct. 17: The Railway Mens Union today threatened to stall train movement on the Ranchi-Garhwa-Delhi route if the four officials abducted from McCluskieganj station on Wednesday night were not rescued within 24 hours.         
	The four railway employees of McCluskieganj station, including assistant station manager Kamal Kishore, deputy station managers S.D. Ekka and S.K. Kujur and guard Munshi Prasad, had been abducted by suspected Maoists on gunpoint on Wednesday night. Kamal Kishore of Aurangabad in Bihar was supposed to get married on November 24.         
	Worried over the security of the railway employees carrying out duty at McCluskieganj following the shocking incident, the union members from various parts of Dhanbad railway division would be reaching the station tomorrow.         
	The incident has shaken us. We cannot work in such an insecure atmosphere. If the authorities fail to rescue our colleagues, we will enforce a Chakka Jam at the station from tomorrow evening, said Mohammed Jahruddin, the secretary of Railway Mens Union of Dhanbad division.        
	He said all the top members of the union today met to discuss the issue of abduction and decided to stop movement of trains passing through the station from tomorrow.         
	He also did not rule out the possibility of blockade of trains in other routes of the railway division.         
	The Dhanbad railway authorities confirmed that the Railway Mens Union was demanding the rescue of the abducted men.         
	The pressure has been enormous for the rescue. But we are yet to be informed about the decision of the union to go for indefinite Ckakka Jam in case of failure in rescuing them, said Sameer Kumar, the senior divisional commercial manager, also the spokesperson of Dhanbad railway division.         
	The state police and the railway authorities have pressed into service six CRPF companies for combing operation of the entire area. Several railway officials, including divisional operational manager Niraj Ambastha and DIG (railway) Niraj Sinha, visited the place today to take stock of the situation.         
	Combing operations are on. Though we have not been able to rescue the victims, we have got some definite clues in the case, said S.N. Pradhan, the state police spokesperson. He, however, declined to reveal the clues saying that it would affect the rescue operation.         
	Meanwhile, murmurs were heard that the abductors had asked for a ransom of Rs 1.5 lakh. The railway authorities, however, refuted. We have not received any such call, said the spokesperson of Dhanbad railway division.

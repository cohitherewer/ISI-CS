Officer claims Pak tip-off on militants
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                              
	Srinagar, June 19: A defence spokesman in Jammu today claimed the army had foiled an infiltration bid from across the Line of Control after receiving a tip-off from Pakistani troops, the first time such information has been shared by forces of the two countries.         
	The field commander of the Pakistani unit shared information with our commander that a group of militants was infiltrating to this side in the Krishna Gati sector. An operation was subsequently launched, said Lt Colonel S.D. Goswami, the defence spokesman in Jammu.        
	Lt Col Goswami said a group of three to four militants was engaged in an encounter from 12.15pm today in Poonch district of Jammu. The intermittent firing continued till 5.30pm and resumed in the evening.        
	A military source said the encounter dragged on as the heavily armed militants had taken positions in the alleys, making it difficult for the army to locate them. Unconfirmed reports said four militants had been killed.        
	Lt Col Goswami, however, refused to say how and through what channel the tip-off was passed on.         
	But another officer said the information was shared on hotline between officials of the two countries based in Delhi and Islamabad. Only the directors-general of military operations of the two countries are connected by hotline.         
	A source in the army headquarters in Delhi, where the DGMO has his office, said there was no advance information.         
	Our troops fired on them (the militants). They took cover and retreated, possibly back into PoK. There was also intermittent small arms fire on our troops from across the LoC. We cannot say it is a ceasefire violation because we cannot ascertain that it was from a Pakistani Army post. However, we will say that there was no advance information, no tip-off, no joint operation to foil an infiltration bid, the source said.        
	Political sources said the advance information, which comes months after the Peoples Party government took over the reins in Islamabad, could be part of Pakistans attempt to ease tensions along the frontline after being accused by India in the last few weeks of violating the 2003 ceasefire.         
	On May 19, the Indian Army blamed Pakistani troops for violating the ceasefire by killing a soldier. It was the first casualty as a result of direct Pakistani attack in at least a year.

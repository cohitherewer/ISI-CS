	New York, April 9 (AP): Daniel Radcliffe, the star of the Harry Potter movies, will make his Broadway debut in September, playing the disturbed stable boy in a revival of Peter Shaffers play, Equus, it was announced yesterday.        
	Radcliffe, 18, earned rave reviews for his performance in the London production of the Tony Award-winning play. He also received loads of media attention for appearing naked onstage  a departure from his wholesome image as the bespectacled boy wizard in the big-screen adaptations of J.K. Rowlings bestselling fantasy novels.        
	Equus begins previews on September 5 for a limited 22-week run at the Broadhurst Theatre. The play opens on September 25-February 8, 2009. Thea Sharrock directs.        
	Richard Griffiths, who portrays Harrys mean Uncle Vernon in the Potter movies, reprises his London role as the psychiatrist who treats the stable boy, who has blinded six horses.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Punishment msg from SRK
  - Ignore all this bit about Dada, me and John having issues           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Shah Rukh                                        
	New Delhi, May 21: The Kolkata Knight Riders owner, Shah Rukh Khan, may not attend the teams next (and last) match at home, against Kings XI Punjab on Sunday, too. He was not present at the Eden last night either.        
	Shah Rukh has, among other things, conveyed that to the team via an emotional, highly motivational and lengthy SMS this afternoon. He also dismissed talk of differences between him and captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Buchanan.        
	The team is in the capital for tomorrows Indian Premier League (IPL) clash against the Delhi DareDevils.         
	The following is the SMS, forwarded to The Telegraph by a member of the Knight Riders squad:        
	Story time boys... I told you if you keep losing you have to bear with my long, boring msgs.... This is your punishment.... Many times I have made movies which dont do well.... When Im doing them, of course, I dont know they wont do well.... The story is written by somebody else and I just do my bit as an actor. But I have a way of dealing with flop stories..., I try my best to keep my character in the film at a level that it makes a failed story also special for me....        
	I enjoy the work.... I make jokes about the failure.... And, of course, feel awful about it too.... So, right now, all of us have become part of a failed script... A bad IPL script.... Lets try and keep our characters worthy of still looking back at this story and remembering it as a special story becos we all worked very hard at this....         
	So, chin up and dont spoil yr character in the next two games.... Lets go out with a bang and not a whimper.... In films, we say u r only as good as yr last film.... So lets make the whole world know how good we r in the last (maybe not) two games...         
	Also, do ignore all this bit about Dada, me and John having issues.... Its a normal thing in the world.... People like to hit you when u r down.... So, we will be hit.... No stress.... It will make us stronger.... The only way to avoid this is to win.... Thats one of the reasons why everybody likes to be a winner....         
	On the other hand, the beauty of failure is that it brings people together.... So, lets stick this out together.... You know me well enuff to know I am not the kind of owner who has issues with the team cos of losses... I am too much of a sport myself to get beaten by defeats.... Like you guys are.... Like Dada and John....        
	I am still trying to understand the code of conduct expected of me at the matches of the IPL.... ICC... Etc.... After I understand it, I will decide whether to accept it or not.... Till such time, I will be with you guys at the hotel... in the meetings etc., but wont come for the matches.... So, please dont ever feel it is anything to do with us as a team....        
	I am as dedicated to my Knights as I am to my kids.... Only, I wont be coming to the class room till the headmasters rules are understood by me.... I am a bit anti-Establishment kind of a guy, so I apologise for this quirk to u all.... So, heads up.... Have a good match and lets make 200 runs tomorrow.... This 150 seems to not work any more....         
	We have nothing to lose now, except our character.... Lets not lose that.... Lov... SRK.

 Lifestyle changes bypass mindset

     G.S. MUDUR AND CHARU SUDAN KASTURI 
                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 3: Spaghetti straps dont mix with male minds which remain warped by cultural illusions that have survived the ages. 
    
	The stares, the lewd remarks and the overt molestation that women across the country face day after day reflect minds that have not kept pace with the waves of transformation that India is riding, psychologists and sociologists have said. 
    
	A group of youths had molested two women outside a Mumbai hotel on January 1 while a mob looked on, some joining the melee and others jeering till police arrived. 
    
	Experts said the incident reflects a trait among men in India that has refused to fade away despite the nations progress over the decades. 
    
	It is sad  the one area where India has not yet evolved is in our perception of women, said Urvashi Butalia, the founder of Kali for Women, Indias first feminist publishing house. Its not only men  police officers, the entire system laughs at women, she said. 
    
	Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau show that the incidence of rape has grown at a far higher rate than any other category of crime in India in the past 53 years. (See chart) 
    
	The apparent liberation of women in their ability to participate in public life is largely an illusion, said Harbans Singh, professor of sociology at the University of Delhi. Society at large  and men in particular  continue to view women merely as objects.
    
	Activists said that while more women are working in offices today than at any time in Indian history, they are also more vulnerable than ever before. 
    
	There is a backlash from men who are unable to accept the pace at which women are emerging as their equals, Butalia said. 
    
	Psychologist Shelja Sen said culture influences the way men perceive women. Indian men are wired the same as men anywhere else, said Sen, a clinical psychologist at the Sitaram Bhartia Institute of Science and Research, New Delhi. The difference lies in culture. 
    
	According to the NCRB figures, more than 63,128 women across India were subject to some form of cruelty by husbands and relatives in 2006. 
    
	Boys grow up watching their fathers or grandfathers treat women with disrespect, they see male teachers pass comments about female teachers, Sen said. 
    
	Young boys imbibe these values and when theyre grown up, they find nothing wrong in engaging in similar behaviour.
    
	The presence of a mob, according to psychologists, increases the chance of individuals shedding inhibitions to engage in objectionable behaviour towards women. In a mob, there is less sense of individual guilt, Sen said. 
    
	Shocked by the Mumbai incident, the National Commission for Women has said it would ask the government to enforce far stricter punishment for harassment. 
    
	This is shocking. Weve been preparing a proposal for the government to increase the punishment for teasing, Nirmala Venkatesh, a member of the NCW, said.
    
	The NCW will propose an amendment to the Indian Penal Code to make the punishment more comparable to that for rape, Venkatesh said.

          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                              
	Bokaro, Oct. 27: The police are looking into a ransom demand of Rs 3 crore, confirming fears that Gomia-based contractor Mahavir Jain, reported missing along with an associate since Saturday, had both been kidnapped.        
	According to the complaint lodged by Sanjay Jain, the son of contractor Mahavir Jain, his father left Gomia around 7am for Petarwar around 30km away. He was on a motorcycle with Nandkishore, and both were scheduled to meet JMM leader R.N. Soren.         
	But, the duo did not go there. After about four hours, Jain is understood to have spoken to a friend, Kiran Toppo of Karmadih, from his cell. That was the last point of contact after which his mobile was switched off. There is still no word on Nandkishore too.         
	This morning, the police led by ASP Vikrant Minz interrogated Kiran for more than 45 minutes. Later, with Gomia officer in-charge R.N. Sharma, they raided hideouts of local criminals for leads.         
	DIG Anurag Gupta and SP Priya Dubey were tight-lipped about the case that has left the coal belt shocked. They are understood to have contacted Ranchi police, too. According to police sources, Mahavir had maintained cordial relations with Maoists. But of late, there was a falling out over demand for levy. Also, during his conversation with Kiran, he apparently said he was at Ranchi and would meet her at her place in Petarwar.        
	He did not reach there. And all along, his family members now said, were convinced he would be back in a day at the most. When that did not happen, his son Sanjay filed the complaint on Sunday. He received the ransom call today.         
	Police sources said Mahavir was a well-connected, successful contractor.         
	Most of the local work on roads went to him, but his business rivals ascribed this success to his contacts among politicians of all parties.        
	Talking to The Telegraph, the IG of North Chotanagpur zone, B.B Pradhan, admitted a ransom call had been made and police teams under the leadership of the DIG and SP were trying their best to ensure Mahavirs safe return.

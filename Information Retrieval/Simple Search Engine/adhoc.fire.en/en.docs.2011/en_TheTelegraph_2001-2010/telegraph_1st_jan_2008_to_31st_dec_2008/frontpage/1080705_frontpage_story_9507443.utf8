	Guwahati/Morigaon, July 4: CPI leader Manoj Deka, who was allegedly assaulted by police on Tuesday, died of brain haemorrhage at GNRC Hospitals at 8.43am.         
	He was the general secretary of the CPIs Morigaon district unit.         
	Dekas death triggered widespread protests across the state, particularly in Morigaon town. He reportedly suffered a stroke after constable Rafiqul Islam allegedly assaulted him in the name of checking his bag while he was returning from a fish market. The incident took place in front of the officer in-charge of Morigaon police station, Kamal Bora. Bora has been put under suspension.                     
	Rafiqul has been sent to judicial custody.

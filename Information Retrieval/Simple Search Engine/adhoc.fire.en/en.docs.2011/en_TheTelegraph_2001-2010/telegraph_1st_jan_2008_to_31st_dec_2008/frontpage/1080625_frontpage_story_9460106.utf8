	Imphal, June 24: Unidentified men killed four Hindi-speaking labourers and injured two others in near-simultaneous attacks in Manipurs Imphal East and Imphal West districts, in a chilling reminder of the March massacre of migrant workers.         
	Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh met director-general of police Yumnam Joykumar Singh tonight to discuss measures to prevent more killings.        
	An official source said all the police stations have been put on maximum alert and patrolling and frisking operations have been intensified.         
	The gunmen first struck at Pourabi Huidrom in Imphal East, shooting two Hindi-speaking persons in the head around 2 in the afternoon.         
	The police were yet to identify the victims.         
	The second attack came around 4pm at Heinoubok under Lamphel police station of Imphal West.         
	The police said two gunmen brought four labourers in a truck loaded with cement at Heinoubok and fired at them with small weapons from a close range.         
	Two died on the spot while two others escaped with bullet injuries.         
	The injured were admitted to the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences in a critical condition.        
	One of the injured, Ram Dari, 45, told the police that two unknown gunmen hijacked the truck they were travelling in from Malom near Imphal airport and took them to a deserted village road at Heinoubok.        
	Dari said one of those killed was Bali Ram. The other victim remained unidentified. The four labourers were travelling in the truck to unload cement at a place near the airport.         
	The gunmen got off from the truck with the four labourers a little before Heinoubok and let the truck driver go.         
	The other injured person was identified as Suraj Saha.         
	The police have launched a hunt to track down the attackers. No arrests have been made so far.        
	In another incident, unknown persons fired at a house at Haoreibi Makha Leikai in Thoubal district around 3am today.         
	No injuries were reported.

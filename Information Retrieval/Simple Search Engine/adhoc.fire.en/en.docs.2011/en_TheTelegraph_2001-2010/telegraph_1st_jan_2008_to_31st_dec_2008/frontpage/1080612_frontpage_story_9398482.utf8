          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            David Mulford leaves the Prime Ministers residence on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 11: The Prime Minister today made a strong pitch for the nuclear deal and pointed a finger at the Left and the BJP for blocking an agreement that is very important to end the nuclear apartheid that the world has sought to impose on India.        
	Domestic politics has prevented us from going ahead, Manmohan Singh told IFS probationers at 7 Race Course Road, a week before the UPA-Left panel meets to discuss the deal. I will still continue to hope that we will make progress in the months that lie ahead.        
	In the morning, US ambassador David C. Mulford had called on the Prime Minister at his residence. While the PMO refused to comment on the unpublicised meeting, sources in the US embassy confirmed it. It probably had to do with the deal, a source said.        
	 For the first time, we got the US to appreciate that India is a nuclear weapons state, that India has the right to develop nuclear power to protect its strategic interests, and that it is a decision that must be made by the people of India not subject to any international supervision or any international interference, Singh said.         
	The Left parties have been arguing that the deal hurts Indian interests.        
	The Prime Minister also had an answer for the Left criticism that the deal brings India into the US strategic orbit.         
	If it sees the light of day, it will open up new possibilities of co-operation not only with the US but all nuclear powers, like Russia, France, who are very keen that once we have this deal through, that India should become eligible for civil nuclear cooperation, Singh said.         
	Pranab Mukherjee, the foreign minister and convener of the nuclear panel, backed him. On the sidelines of a book release, he said nuclear energy was an option India would have to go for sooner than later. Asked about the meeting with the Left, he said: Let us see what happens.         
	CPIs D. Raja did not hold out much hope. Is he (Singh) not part of domestic politics? he asked. The Prime Minister is convinced about the deal but we are not. We dont think that the deal is in our national interest, Raja told PTI.        
	The US has been pushing India to go ahead and complete the two stages  secure the IAEAs approval for India-specific safeguards and get the Nuclear Suppliers Group to grant an exemption  needed to operationalise the deal.         
	Yesterday, US under-secretary of state Christopher Padilla said it would be a tragedy if India passed up this opportunity.        
	But the Prime Ministers own party continued to hem and haw. We dont know what the party president thinks. We are going by the last public statement Sonia Gandhi and the Prime Minister made in September.         
	She said the Congress was against any confrontation with the Left and the dharma of coalition is to work together, try and understand and accommodate each others views, a leader said.

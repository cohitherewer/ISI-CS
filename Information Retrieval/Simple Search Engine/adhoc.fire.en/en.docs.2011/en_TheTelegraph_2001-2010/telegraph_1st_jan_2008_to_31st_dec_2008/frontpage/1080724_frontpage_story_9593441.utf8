  - Speech that tore into Advani and Karat shows Manmohan is no pushover           SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             Arms thrown around each other, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi watch Manmohan Singh interact with Congress leaders at a celebration at 10 Janpath on Wednesday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                        
	New Delhi, July 23: The late-term reinvention of Manmohan Singh from reluctant politician to crafty and combative power-player may have guillotined all uncertainty over who the Congress will project as Prime Minister in the next election.        
	Having pushed the party into a perilous showdown over the nuclear deal, and won it, Manmohan has swung into leadership mode like few expected him to. This battle (with the Left over the nuclear deal) was very often seen even within the party as Manmohan Singhs personal agenda, said a senior partyman. In getting the party to back it and then winning parliamentary sanction, Manmohan Singh has revealed new aspects of himself. He can be assertive and he has the guts for a fight, this man is no pushover.        
	He was careful to point out, though, that in the run-up to the confrontation with the Left and the parliamentary showdown, the Prime Minister hadnt acted as a lone adventurist. While talks with the Samajwadi Party had been on for a while  the presence of Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh at the May 22 UPA dinner was a clear signal  the Prime Minister laboured over building opinion within his own party, too.        
	Over the past three weeks, he is believed to have had several meetings with senior, and more experienced, partymen to weigh the pros and cons of pushing ahead with the deal at the expense of a divorce with the Left. Among them were Arjun Singh, Makhanlal Fotedar and, of course, Pranab Mukherjee, external affairs minister and the partys chief political trouble-shooter.        
	He has brought about a radical image change over this deal, said a party leader, but he ensured he had support behind him.        
	Nothing has flagged the arrival of the new-combative Manmohan than the manner in which he lit into BJP leader L.K. Advani in his undelivered Lok Sabha speech yesterday.         
	Sources close to the Prime Minister have revealed that the opening paragraphs of the speech were a visceral response to Advanis speech on the first day of the trust motion and written entirely by Manmohan himself.         
	There was a long draft he had been given with inputs from various quarters, but after Advanis speech, he rewrote it radically, a source said. He was upset by Advanis renewed personal attack on him and it was clear he wanted to deliver a blunt riposte.        
	Monday wasnt the first time Advani had mocked the Prime Minister for being an inefficient rubber-stamp who had devalued his high office. Hes done so on more than a dozen occasions in remarks made in and outside Parliament.         
	Advanis sustained personal attack really got to him, the word nikamma (inefficient) in particular. And Mondays speech was like the last straw, a senior Congress leader said. It left Manmohan Singh livid.         
	It isnt often Prime Ministers respond to big parliamentary debates on a personal note. But it isnt often that the leader of Opposition has been so relentless in personal assault on the Prime Minister. Manmohan met exception with exception.         
	Equally his own handiwork was the stinging attack on CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, who the Prime Minister chose not even to name. The Prime Ministers growing sense over the months was that Karat had made a personal issue of opposing the nuclear deal and forced the Left to a bitter showdown.         
	It may well be true, though, that the rupture with the Left has relieved rather than vexed the Prime Minister. Although he spoke of two visions of Indias future in his speech  the UPAs secular one and the BJPs divisive one  Manmohan probably believes there are three  the Right, the Left and centrist visions.         
	Arguing that Manmohan was firmly centrist in the traditional Congress sense, a party leader said: The Left was trying to create two polarities in the country by trying to dictate all terms to the Congress, Leftwing and Rightwing. This break has ensured that the Congress returns to its centrist moorings.        
	This could well indicate that at least a section in the Congress will press for harsher attack on the Left as the election campaign gathers steam.         
	Asked whether the break with the Left was an unshackling that made the government breathe easier, the leader said: Of course, to a degree. Why do you think the Prime Minister spoke of feeling like a bonded slave? There are many pending decisions the government can now pursue with greater ease and speed, especially economic ones.        
	He was quick to add, though, that the break with the Left didnt mean the government would steer away from aam aadmi concerns.         
	The Prime Ministers decision to end on a personal note related to his growing years in a backward, unlit village was probably aimed at allaying the impression that Manmohan was driven purely by pro-big business interests.         
	Thats been the campaign against him and its an unfair campaign if you look at the public welfare programmes undertaken by his government, a source close to him said. It was probably important for him to remind the nation that he, too, comes from an underdeveloped and deprived rural community.

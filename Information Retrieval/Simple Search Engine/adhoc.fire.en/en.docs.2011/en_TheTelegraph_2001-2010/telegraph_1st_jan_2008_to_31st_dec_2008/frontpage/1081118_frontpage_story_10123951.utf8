          RAJ KUMAR                                        Governor  Syed  Sibtey  Razi		        
	Ranchi, Nov. 17: The University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked the governor to intervene in the Jharkhand Public Service Commissions (JPSC) appointments of civil servants and lecturers, at least 36 of whom were said to be relatives or friends of senior JPSC members and politicians.        
	The Jharkhand BET-NET Association questioned this years appointments of 239 civil servants and 1,044 lecturers and petitioned Union human resources development minister Arjun Singh seeking a vigilance or CBI probe into what it alleged were clear cases of favouritism.        
	In his letter of October 29, Kanta Batra, the under secretary to the UGC chairman, informed the governors office about the BET-NET association secretary Sunil Kumar Kamals complaint and attached annexures to list the names of appointees allegedly favoured for appointments as civil servants and lecturers.         
	The Telegraph is in possession of the UGCs letter that requests the Jharkhand governor to take necessary action on the allegation.         
	Among the names mentioned by the BET-NET association and forwarded by the UGC, are relatives and friends of the JPSC chairman, Dilip Prasad, and JPSC members Gopal Singh, Shanti Devi and Radha Govind Nagesh (now retired).         
	Gopal Singhs family said he was unwell and therefore, wasnt available for comment.         
	Politicians who figure in the appointments controversy are state human resources development minister Bandhu Tirkey, former home minister Sudesh Mahto and JDU MLA Radha Krishna Kishore, as their friends and relatives were also in the list prepared by BET-NET association and referred to the Governor.        
	According to legal experts, the Governor was empowered to refer the case to the state vigilance commissioner.         
	He may also refer it to the Supreme Court for an enquiry by a sitting judge if the case involved omission and commission on the part of JPSC members. Both the government and the JPSC were evasive. JPSC chairman Dilip Kumar Prasad pleaded ignorance about the letter.         
	The letter might have come from UGC, but I do not have any idea about it. Right now, I am busy dispatching papers for tomorrows examination, he said.        
	Principal secretary to the governor Sudhir Tripathy said, he was yet to go through the letter. Director-general of police (vigilance) Neyaz Ahmed said: So far, the state has not given any direction to us in the matter. We will take it up after receiving (necessary) directives.         
	Significantly, the issue is also pending with Jharkhand High Court.

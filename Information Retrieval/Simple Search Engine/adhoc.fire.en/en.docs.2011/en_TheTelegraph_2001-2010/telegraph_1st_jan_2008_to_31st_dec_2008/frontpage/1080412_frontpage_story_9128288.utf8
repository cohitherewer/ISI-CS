	New Delhi, April 11: Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss today said celebrities should stop endorsing junk food, cautioning that young people needed to be protected from chronic illnesses associated with diet.         
	India is already the diabetes capital of the world. But were now seeing chips, burgers and pizzas, Ramadoss said at a national convention of health writers. Im appealing to celebrities to stop endorsing junk food, he said.         
	A number of products which doctors label as junk food  chips, aerated cold drinks, chocolates  are endorsed by some of Indias top celebrities.         
	Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Hrithik Roshan, Akshay Kumar, Saif Ali Khan, Aishwarya Rai, Rani Mukerji, Juhi Chawla (in picture in a junk food ad), Deepika Padukone, Ranbir Kapoor, John Abraham  almost all of Bollywoods top stars are, or have been, brand ambassadors for junk food.         
	Most top cricketers, including Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, too have been the face of colas.        
	Ramadoss said theres an urgent need to protect the 600 million people in India whore below 30 years of age from not just tobacco, but also from junk food and alcohol.         
	The alcohol issue also needs to be addressed, he said. But only four states  Jammu and Kashmir, Mizoram, Manipur and Gujarat  have prohibited alcohol, Ramadoss said.         
	Outlining a list of pending initiatives of the health ministry, Ramadoss said the government would make nutritional labelling of all packaged food products mandatory within two months.         
	Under these rules  which have been under formulation for nearly two years  all food packets sold in India would have to display their content, listing levels of fat, proteins and other nutrients, and the calories available.         
	A leading paediatrician at the convention said promotion of junk food by celebrities has a strong influence on young, impressionable minds.         
	If such appeals fail to work, the government may even need to think of legislation to curb this, said Harsh Pal Singh Sachdeva, a consultant paediatrician at the Sitaram Bhartiya Institute of Science and Research.         
	School surveys in Indian cities have shown that about 30 per cent of adolescents from higher socio-economic groups are overweight.         
	One survey of children in schools in Delhi has shown a sharp increase in just three years  from about 18 per cent in 2004 to about 30 per cent in 2007.         
	Experts have also pointed out in the past that the consumption of pulses, fruits, and vegetables in India has stagnated. Nutritional surveys have indicated that the on average, an Indian consumes just 150 grams to 200 grams of fruits and vegetables a day, in contrast to the recommended 400 grams.        
	Public health experts have warned that changing food habits and sedentary lifestyles are contributing to obesity and diabetes, which are risk factors for heart disease in adulthood.

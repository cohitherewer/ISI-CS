          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: Air India, JetLite and SpiceJet have cut fares following a fall in fuel prices and a slump in passenger traffic.        
	Air India has reduced up to 82 per cent in at least 20 sectors that mostly fall on metro routes. JetLite slashed fares in all sectors by up to 40 per cent with immediate effect.        
	SpiceJet announced fares starting from Rs 99 across its network. The scheme is applicable for tickets booked at least 21 days before the date of travel and is valid till June 30, 2009.        
	A JetLite statement said the Mumbai-Delhi economy class basic fare would be Rs 750, while that for Mumbai-Chennai will be Rs 595 and Delhi-Hyderabad Rs 999.         
	The new fare cut comes into effect today (Tuesday). We have cut fares in 20 sectors by up to 82 per cent. This will largely benefit passengers on metro routes, an Air India spokesperson said.         
	The relief will be confined to the basic fare, which means taxes and surcharges of Rs 3,075 will have to be paid.        
	The announcement came two days after Kingfisher and Jet announced reductions.        
	Air Indias maximum slash of 82 per cent will be on the Chennai-Bangalore route, while on the Mumbai-Calcutta route, the cut will be 35 per cent.         
	Passengers flying from Calcutta to Delhi will have to wait for relief. We have not cut the prices on the popular Delhi-Calcutta route as yet. But we could take a call on it later, an AI official said.        
	There is another catch: the cut will be applicable to a limited number of seats on each flight. Early birds catch cheaper seats, while those who book late get the costliest or full-fare seats. The bottom basket of cheapest fares is always small, said Robin Pathak, an aviation consultant.        
	Jet Airways had reduced fares on its domestic routes by up to 40 per cent. Kingfisher will cut fares from January 1 but has not yet announced the quantum.        
	The fare cuts come in the wake of slackening demand in the post-peak season and a steady fall in fuel prices. Oil marketing companies have reduced jet fuel prices seven times since September.        
	Right now, it makes sense to cut fares and try to attract more passengers. Load factors had sunk from an economical 60 per cent to below 50 per cent on most routes, said U.K. Bose, the former chief executive of Air Sahara.         
	I feel airlines should have cut fares long back, he added.

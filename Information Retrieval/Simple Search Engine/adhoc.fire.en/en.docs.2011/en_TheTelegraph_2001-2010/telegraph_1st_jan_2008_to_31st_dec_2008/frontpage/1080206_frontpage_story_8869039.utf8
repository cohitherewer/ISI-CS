          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 5: Do-it-now has finally worked in Bengal  in calling a bandh.        
	The Trinamul Congress and the Forward Bloc  supposedly belonging to two irreconcilable political formations  took less than two-and-a-half hours to decide to shut Bengal down on Wednesday in response to Tuesdays tragedy in Cooch Behar.        
	The violence was at its peak around 1.30pm, and the Bloc called the 24-hour bandh by 3pm. Quick thinking, in hindsight: any delay could have meant Mamata Banerjee offering support before the shutdown itself was announced.        
	By 4pm  within an hour of the Bloc calling the bandh  Mamata had offered support, displaying unparalleled agility and unity of purpose for causing disruption.        
	The Congress, the SUCI and some Naxalite groups soon jumped on the bandwagon, the rainbow coalition coming together not to construct but to cripple. None of these parties has shown the same initiative to make things happen in Bengal  the objective behind the now-forgotten do-it-now slogan.        
	Some parties within the Left Front, too, offered moral support to the bandh. Roles reversed, the CPM  the master of the bandh game now under attack from allies  could only watch a godsend to hone its shutdown skills pass by. The CPM hasnt opposed the bandh directly but urged people to maintain normality.        
	But the bandh without notice has caused so much confusion that maintaining normality will be a tough task.         
	None of the bandh enforcers would say how the shutdown could help those affected by the loss of lives. Nor could the Bloc explain why it thought fit to torment ordinary people while continuing to remain in power and enjoy the attendant benefits.        
	Mamata asserted today that a political party had to call a bandh when other options dried up. Theres nothing called Left or Right when it comes to upholding peoples interests. Thats why we support the Blocs bandh as it is necessary at this juncture to expose the CPM, she said.        
	Echoing Mamata, Bloc leader and former minister Hafiz Alam Sairani said: Its not a question of Right or Left. Its a matter of shame that supporters of the second largest ally of the Left Front were killed by its government. That has to be condemned. For that, any party has the right to join the protest.

                                                                                                           Name is Bond, Bond villain
          LAURA CLOUT                            (Top) Sean Connery in Dr No and in recent times                                 
	London, March 28: Twenty five years after he last starred as the ultimate superspy James Bond, Sir Sean Connery is considering a comeback.        
	But this time the 77-year-old actor, who played 007 in seven of the classic spy films, would like to be reincarnated as a Bond villain. Sir Sean, who retired in 2006, hinted that it would take an exceptional pay-cheque to tempt him out of retirement.        
	I wouldnt mind coming back as a Bond villain, he said. But I dont think they would pay me enough money. The actor first played Ian Flemings agent in 1962s Dr No, then appearing in Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds Are Forever and Never Say Never Again in 1983.        
	He signalled his approval of the latest actor to reprise the role, Daniel Craig, who has signed a 30 million deal to make the next four films in the franchise.        
	I think Daniel Craig is a terrific choice, said Sir Sean. I think theyre going back to a more realistic type of Bond movie as I dont think they could have gone much further with the special effects. He added: They dont pay the money for the other parts, only for the Bond character, although that wasnt the case when I was doing it.

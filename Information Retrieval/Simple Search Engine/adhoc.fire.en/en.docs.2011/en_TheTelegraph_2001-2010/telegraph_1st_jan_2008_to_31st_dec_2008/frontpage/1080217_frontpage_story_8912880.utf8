          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Fibre of future?                                   
	New Delhi, Feb. 16: Scientists have taken the first steps to fashion shirts and skirts that might be able to produce electricity from a wearers body movements.         
	Physicist Zhong Lin Wang, a Chinese-American scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, and his colleagues have shown that textile fibres covered with tiny zinc oxide wires can generate electricity from the vibration of fibres.         
	Their research, published on Thursday in the journal Nature, could be a step towards clothes that could scavenge energy to run portable electronic devices that demand low levels of power.         
	The fibre-based nanogenerator would be a simple way to harvest energy from physical movement, said Wang, a professor of material sciences at the institute. But theres still at least five years left to get to any applications.         
	The technique uses tiny wires of zinc oxide  with dimensions of the order of billionths of a metre  and the well-known pieozoelectric effect, a process that converts mechanical motion into electrical energy.         
	The experiments show that movement induced in a pair of textile fibres  one covered with gold and the other with the nanowires  can generate tiny amounts of electricity, just four billionths of an ampere.         
	But our calculations show that a square metre of fabric made from such special fibres could, under ideal conditions, produce about 80 milliwatts of power, Wang said. This would be close enough to power some hand-held devices, he told The Telegraph over telephone.         
	The fabric does not have to be flat  a foldable and flexible fabric would work, too.         
	The big challenge will be to integrate billions of tiny nanogenerators to increase the electric output, Wang said.         
	The researchers believe the first applications of this technology are likely to be in defence electronics or in aerospace engineering where such fibres could be selectively used to power equipment.         
	Clothes to power personal electronics is a long-term goal, Wang said. Zinc oxide poses a major challenge in wearable apparel  water can damage the material. So, clothes from such fabrics cant be washed.         
	We need to find a way to protect such fibres from water, Wang said.

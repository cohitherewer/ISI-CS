	New Delhi, Oct. 18: Mayavati today agreed to return the Rae Bareli land where a railway coach factory is to come up, avoiding a face-off with Sonia Gandhi. In a trade-off, she has asked the Centre for a Rs 5,000-crore grant to develop the Rae Bareli region.        
	The Congress said the Centre would consider her request if she specified the projects for which she needed the money.         
	The Uttar Pradesh chief minister had cancelled the land allotment a day before Sonia was to flag off construction of the factory in her constituency last week.        
	Explaining her turnaround, Mayavati said: I dont want to get in the way of development.

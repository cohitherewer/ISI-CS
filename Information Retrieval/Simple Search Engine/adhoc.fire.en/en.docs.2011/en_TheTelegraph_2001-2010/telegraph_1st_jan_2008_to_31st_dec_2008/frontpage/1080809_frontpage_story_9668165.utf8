                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mosquitoes send policemen   on trial 
  - Eight officers face fine or jail          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: Policemen have been dragged to court for various offences, but the eight booked in Delhi on Monday have made history.        
	They face trial for failing to check not crime but mosquitoes. If found guilty, these eight station house officers (SHOs)  who allowed mosquitoes to breed at their police stations  could be fined from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 and even face a short jail term.        
	The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), whose health department launched an anti-dengue drive last month, says these officers ignored repeated notices to keep their stations clean and free of stagnant water.        
	We have booked the SHOs for negligence. Its a rule and anyone who violates it shall be prosecuted. These officers are now facing trial, said N.K. Yadav, chief municipal health officer of Delhi.        
	On an average, one court complaint is lodged for every 10 police personnel in the capital per year  mostly relating to torture and harassment  according to National Crime Records Bureau figures. This is the first time policemen have been put in the dock for failing to check the mosquito menace at their workplace.        
	The MCDs health department claims to have found mosquito breeding grounds in police stations, hospitals, government offices  even at several of its own branch offices across the city. Apart from the policemen, 12 MCD engineers too face prosecution on the same charge.        
	Errant hospitals, civic body offices, the public works department (PWD) and the Delhi Jal Board are set to be fined too. Many others, including Delhi University offices, have been sent court notices asking them to keep their premises clean.        
	Health officials, who have raided the homes and offices of many senior officials, have found nearly 30,000 defaulters in the city and sent out 1,766 court notices.        
	Yadav, the chief municipal health officer, said the MCD had good reason to be so strict. He said the monsoon season, with its wet and humid weather, is ideal for the breeding of mosquitoes and, therefore, the spread of dengue.        
	Civic officials say their fight against the disease has borne fruit over the years. In 1996, Delhi recorded more than 10,000 cases of dengue but the figure came down to 3,366 (with 65 deaths) in 2006 and then to 548 with just a single death in 2007. Only eight cases have been reported this year.        
	The authorities have earmarked 34 hospitals in the city for the diagnosis and treatment of dengue and another mosquito-borne disease, chikungunya.

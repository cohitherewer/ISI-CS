                                Nicole Kidman                            
	United Nations, April 23 (AP): Actress Nicole Kidman, seven months pregnant and passionately committed to her other job as a UN goodwill ambassador, urged world leaders and ordinary people to join the global fight to end violence against women.        
	One in three women will encounter violence in some way, shape or form... in her lifetime, Kidman told a news conference yesterday at the UN headquarters. Thats an extraordinary statistic. Yet do we ever hear it?        
	The 40-year-old Australian star became a goodwill ambassador in January 2006 for the UN Development Fund for Women, known as UNIFEM. Its acting executive director, Joanne Sandler, said Kidman wanted to focus on an issue where she could make a difference.        
	Together, they chose violence against women which, Kidman said, is probably the most widespread human rights violation of our time.        
	She came to the UN headquarters to join Sandler, UN deputy secretary-general Asha-Rose Migiro, and foundation president Timothy Wirth to promote UNIFEMs Say NO to Violence Against Women campaign.        
	Since the yearlong campaign was launched on November 26, Sandler said some 210,000 people have signed an Internet virtual book to call on world leaders to end impunity for perpetrators, provide services for survivors and, most importantly, invest in prevention.         
	Governments are responding, Sandler said. We are beginning to see decision-makers sign on.... The whole cabinet of Senegal, led by President (Abdoulaye) Wade, signed on to the campaign in March.        
	Kidman urged people of all nations to add their names and demand that ending violence against women be made a top priority for governments everywhere.        
	She also encouraged the private sector to contribute to the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women, which provides grants for programmes in the developing world to help fight the scourge.

	Singur, Oct. 4: Last night was the first time Sudip Dey, 29, couldnt sleep before pay day.        
	The contract labourer was one of 200 local youths who today collected their last salary from what used to be the Nano project site till 24 hours earlier.        
	Our future is ruined. How shall we survive now? I never thought Tata Motors would move out, said a tearful Dey, who has to look after his ailing parents in Beraberi.        
	When I was coming out of home, my mother asked me not to spend from the last salary.        
	Many others in Singur were not ready to shed tears yet  anger burnt inside them side by side with the desperate hope of still persuading Tata to return.        
	CPM workers, voluntary landlosers and local material suppliers blocked railway tracks in the morning, and cut off Durgapur Expressway with logs and burning tyres till 2.30pm, demanding work resume at the Tata project site.        
	We wont let Tata go. Its a matter of survival for us. We wont let Mamata Banerjee destroy our future, said Mohivrit Chakraborty, who was to join ancillary unit Tata Johnson before the pujas as a trainee accountant at a salary of Rs 8,500.        
	He and others plan to write to Ratan Tata to reverse his decision. Well assure him the people of Singur are with him and nobody will be allowed to create any problem.        
	But problem there was. Three CPM supporters  Uma Ghosh, 50, Ashtu Kolay, 48, and Tinkari Dhara, 42  were beaten up at Berabari market. The CPM blamed Trinamul, which alleged Ghosh was hit while inciting people to dig up roads.        
	A group of villagers sent an open letter to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee requesting him to ask Tata Motors to reconsider their decision. If work doesnt resume many who earned their living from the project will be compelled to commit suicide, the letter said.        
	Dey, clutching his last salary of Rs 3,100, also spoke of suicide. We have lost our land and our jobs. We have no choice but to kill ourselves.        
	He and the other youths received their pay for August, the month Mamata began her Singur siege and forced work to a stop at the site.         
	Dey had been part of the factorys housekeeping staff for the past two years. My parents are old and sick and they need me here. But I shall have to move to Calcutta to find a job, he said.        
	These boys were extremely sincere, they wouldnt miss a single days work, said one of the four officials of BVG Pvt Ld  the hiring contractor  who handed out the salaries. I remember how excited they were after getting their first salary. But see the despair on their faces today.        
	Equally shattered were the 25 women who had been running a canteen inside the complex for two-and-a-half years after receiving a months training at a catering institute in Taratolla.        
	Some 200 employees would lunch at the canteen every day. The number plunged after Mamata began her agitation. The canteen was open till yesterday and six policemen had their meal. But its closed today, said Jharna Bar, a Singerberi resident.        
	The women dont know how they would repay the Rs 50,000 loan they had taken to buy a refrigerator, microwave oven and utensils.        
	Each of us earned Rs 1,500-2,200 a month. Life was changing fast and we were so happy, Jharna said, showing off the small refrigerator and colour TV set she had bought for her family six months ago.        
	She and her team-mates too had given up their land. Our husbands worked as night guards at the factory. Mamata has killed our dream.        
	The debts of the sub- contractors who supplied material to the factory run into lakhs. We bought machines against bank loans and now cant pay the EMI, said Anup Ghosh.        
	The pent-up anger had erupted last night with villagers blocking Durgapur Expressway since 9. The tracks at Kamarkundu, Madhusudanpur and Diara stations were blockaded from 7am today for one to two hours.        
	The expressway blockade was lifted following two hours of persuasion by police and local CPM leaders, who had earlier stopped the protesters from digging up the road.        
	A 10-hour bandh shut down Singur and Kamarkundu but not Beraberi market. Buses did not run on the Tarakeswar-Baidyabati highway and the Ratanpur potato trading centre was closed.        
	The mood in the villages, divided down the middle, was bitter and police did not rule out violence.

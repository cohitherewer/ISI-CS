	The Bengal government on Thursday spoke of a possible compensation hike for Singur land-losers a day after Tata Motors hinted that its patience was being tested by the continuing violence against its small-car project.        
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen said the government was ready to discuss the matter and would consider raising the compensation if such a demand was made.        
	Mamata Banerjee ruled out any talks till the land acquired without consent was returned.

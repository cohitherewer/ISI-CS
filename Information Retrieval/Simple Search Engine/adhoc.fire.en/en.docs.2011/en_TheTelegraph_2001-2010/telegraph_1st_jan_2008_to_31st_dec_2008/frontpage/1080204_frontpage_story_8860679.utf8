     AMIT ROY 
           Charlotte Fischer
             
	London, Feb. 3: The case of Krishna Omkar vs Charlotte Fischer that is keeping Oxford University entertained is as interesting as the Harbhajan Singh vs Andrew Symonds saga that unfolded in Australia. 
    
	At least one cricketer did not send an SMS to the other, Fancy a f***?, which Fischer is alleged to have received. 
    
	Once friends, 23-year-old Delhi boy Omkar, a PhD sociology student at Merton College, and 21-year-old Fischer, a nice English girl reading modern history and politics at Balliol, fell out when they clashed for the presidency of the Oxford Union. 
    
	Omkar might have reckoned this was a shortcut to becoming Prime Minister of India, just as Benazir Bhutto, a former president of the Union, became prime minister of Pakistan. Fischer might have hoped the presidency would help her land a job as a feature writer on a national newspaper or possibly a seat in the House of Lords one day. 
    
	In the fight to decide who would be president for the 2008 summer term, Omkar beat Fischer hands down by 959 votes to 658. 
    
	But Omkars victory was snatched away from him after Fischer complained he had broken the rules by campaigning. 
    
	In a ruling from a union tribunal which condemned Omkar as arrogant and a brash newcomer to the university, he was stripped of the right to the presidency and, uniquely, banned from ever running again. 
    
	But Fischer did not walk into the post by default. A new election has now been ordered for which Omkar cannot run and which Fischer has announced she will not contest. 
    
	As with much seriousness as Judge John Hansens ruling on Harbhajan and Symonds, the current union president, Emily Partington, of Jesus College, has issued a final statement on the dispute between Mr Omkar and Ms Fischer. 
    
	The statement , containing lots of capital letters, points out: Following the ruling of an Election Tribunal held at the end of Michaelmas term, Krishna Omkar, Candidate for President-Elect, was found guilty of breaching Rule 33, regarding Electoral Malpractice. Mr Omkar was sentenced by the Election Tribunal, which disqualified him from that (and subsequent) elections.
    
	She says: A full report has been issued on the proceedings; Mr Omkar had 48 hours after the issuing of the report to bring an appeal and indeed did so. The appeal was heard by an Appellate Board, a new but similarly-constituted panel. The Appellate Board upheld the rulings and sentencing of the original Election Tribunal. Factual inaccuracies in the press have led to the belief that the appeal is ongoing; please note that as stated above, the appeal process is over. 
    
	And her conclusion: Ms. Fischer has since resigned from the Standing Committee of the Oxford Union and has stated that she does not intend to stand in any further elections. She wrote a lengthy resignation letter, which was made openly available to committee members. In this letter, she refers to offensive text messages being sent to her, but has not brought any formal complaint of sexual harassment. It is to be expressly noted that Ms Fischer has not alleged that Mr Omkar or his supporters were responsible for the offensive messages. 
    
	The job will have to be filled, of course, as Partington makes clear: There will be a re-poll for the Office of President-Elect at the end of 4th week of Hilary Term. We hope to see a fairly contested election and look forward to welcoming a new President-Elect to the committee. 
    
	How did relations between Omkar and Fischer deteriorate so dramatically? Last summer he invited her to sleep in his rooms while she was moving accommodation. She called him my love and he called her my gorgeous surfer girl in exchanges on Facebook. 
    
	They had serious differences about who should be invited to speak at the union. He was for inviting Nick Griffin, leader of the far right British National party, a far right politician, in the interests of free speech. Fischer, who is Jewish, was against.
    
	In her 3,000-word resignation letter, Fischer said: I have continued to receive text and Facebook messages from several members of the union asking if I fancy a f***? When I called the member whose phone the messages were sent from, I received no answer, only further messages asking me if that was an offer of phone sex, gorgeous? It was insensitive at best and outrageously obnoxious at worst. 
    
	Omkar, who is described as a dandy who has addressed the union wearing embroidered Nagra chappals, said: I have been punished for doing something most other presidents have done. I held a meeting of 30 people. It was not a party. There was no alcohol present. I had no idea Charlotte had been getting these text messages until I read her resignation letter.

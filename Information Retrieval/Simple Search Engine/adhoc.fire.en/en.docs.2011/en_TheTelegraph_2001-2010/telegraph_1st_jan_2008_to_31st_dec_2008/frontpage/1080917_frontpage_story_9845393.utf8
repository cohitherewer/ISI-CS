  Plea for exclusive Northeast cell          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Guwahati, Sept. 16: The Centre today sought the help of Thailand to take the region through the 21st century by sharing its development expertise and setting up an exclusive Northeast cell in its Board of Investment (BOI) to promote trade and investment between the two countries.        
	The proposal was mooted by DoNER minister Mani Shankar Aiyar on the concluding day of the enormously successful 4th North East Business Summit that attracted 247 expressions of interest from 64 companies in sectors such as tourism, infrastructure, manufacturing, food processing and information technology. Assam led the pack of investment destinations in the region.        
	Participating in the special session on Thailand-India Business Opportunities: Strengthening Partnership, Aiyar said the BOI has an India Desk but the time has arrived for it to create an exclusive Northeast cell to help the region become a true partner of Southeast Asia.        
	Since both sides have displayed a willingness to do business with each other, it has become imperative to open not only a Northeast cell in the BOI but also hold four no-frills meetings  two in Delhi, two in Bangkok  on the four sectors broadly identified by Thailand for co-operation. I would also request Thailand to hold at least three roadshows covering the region to take the gains of this summit forward, Aiyar said.        
	Pradyut Bordoloi, chairman of the session organised by the Royal Thai Embassy in association with DoNER and Indian Chamber of Commerce to showcase Thailand to the participants, called for the walls to be dismantled for wider bilateral cooperation between the Northeast and Thailand. He invited Thailand to be part of the knowledge city coming up near Guwahati by setting up a human skill development centre.         
	As the DoNER minister said earlier, we need your expertise and goodwill more than your funding. So, I invite you to set up skill development centres in our knowledge city. There has been a perceptible change vis--vis Thailand. There is a lot of enthusiasm between the two regions and we should exploit it.         
	Bordoloi, the power and industry minister of Assam, thanked the Thai government for sending a business delegation for the special session on that country and also the Thai embassy for hosting the Thai nite. I am sure we can take forward this bilateral interaction to its logical end. A positive, perceptible change from both sides is there for all to see. The year 2008-09 being the Thailand Investment Year, I hope there will be something positive for the Northeast as well, he said.         
	The Assam minister also suggested a review of the trans-Asian highway and trans-Asian railway projects so that it connects all of Southeast Asia.         
	Aiyar said the Northeast cell would serve as an interface between traders and entrepreneurs of the two countries and the policymakers, among others. Thai tourism is beach tourism. Northeast can go for mountain tourism. Thailand can help promote tourism in the Northeast by linking its beach tourism with mountain tourism, given its proximity to the region. I request Thai Airways to set up a dedicated service for the region. Once connectivity is established other things will start moving. Thailand can play the role of the catalyst in the development of the region by providing its technical experience, machinery, managerial expertise and skilled manpower. It is worth more than your money, Aiyar said.         
	The Thai delegation said it was very impressed by what it has seen and would convey their views to investors back home. It also made a PowerPoint presentation as to why one should invest in India and tried to clarify the doubts of those wanting to do business with that country.         
	Norachit Sinhaseni, deputy permanent secretary, ministry of foreign affairs, Anuson Muttaraid, chairman, committee of Indian Affairs Board of Trade, and Sakachai Luangsathikul, investment promotion officer, BOI, represented Thailand.        
	The growing interest of Thailand was evident from the cultural nite it staged this evening along with a dinner to showcase its culture and food for the participants.

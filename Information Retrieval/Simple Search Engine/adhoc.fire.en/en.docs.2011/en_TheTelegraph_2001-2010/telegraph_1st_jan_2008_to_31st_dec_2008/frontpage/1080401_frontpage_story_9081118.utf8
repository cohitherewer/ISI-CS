          TOBY HARNDEN                            Big boy victim                                  
	Washington, March 31: Faced with a growing chorus to abandon the uphill battle against Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton is falling back on what she sees as her trump card  her gender.         
	At other perilous junctures like the eve of the New Hampshire primary and the eve of Super Tuesday, the former First Lady highlighted her femininity during televised tearful moments. Now she is portraying the calls for her to quit as male chauvinism.        
	In comments leaked to the New York Times, Clinton is said to have told aides that she would not be bullied out of the White House race and in a conversation with two allies compared her plight to big boys trying to bully a woman.        
	During a weekend interview with the Washington Post  arranged at her request  she was asked whether Obama could beat John McCain, the Republican nominee.        
	She responded: Im saying I have a better chance. You cannot as a Democrat win the White House without a very big womens vote. What I believe is that women will turn out for me.        
	In the past 10 days, Senators Chris Dodd and Pat Leahy and Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico  all key Obama allies  have urged Clinton to abandon her presidential bid so her party can unite around the young Illinois senator.

	Ranchi, April 19: When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh launches Bokaro Steel Plants ambitious expansion plans on Tuesday, chances are he wont get to know of a hitch that could prove to be a stumbling block on the PSUs road ahead  ownership of the land on which it stands.         
	The state government has now challenged a Jharkhand High Court ruling of December 6 that vested the deeds, and therefore ownership, of 36,000 acres of land to the Bokaro Steel Plant.         
	The erstwhile Bihar government had acquired the land in 1960-61 to set up the plant in Bokaro but did not transfer it in the name of the company. Years later, this went to the courts and after a 16-year protracted legal battle over compensation, the high court ruled in the PSUs favour since the state government refused to budge.        
	The high courts ruling came after the PSU deposited Rs 70 crore as enhanced compensation to land owners and said it was ready to pay an additional Rs 30 crore to get ownership of the land.        
	The state government, however, challenged the high courts order in the Supreme Court last month. The apex court will hear the case on April 24.         
	Senior plant officials are worried. A deputy general manager rank officer pointed out the company needed 1,000 acres for its new unit that would enhance capacity from 4.5 million tonnes to 7.5 million tonnes. Besides, a joint venture with Damodar Valley Corporation to generate 500MW power to supply to the new unit has had to be put on hold.        
	We immediately need 1,000 acres for the new unit. But we are not able to lay the boundary wall as portions have been encroached upon by people at the behest of politicians, he said.         
	Bokaro Steel also needed land to set up a factory as per a joint venture with JK Cement for disposal of slag, he added.         
	But revenue minister Dulal Bhuiyan told The Telegraph the state government was firm in its resolve to fight this.         
	The state government provided a huge chunk of land to Bokaro Steel to set up a 10-million-tonne plant, but it remained confined to 4 million tonnes only, he said.         
	It has woken up after 50 years now that the state government detected a gaffe.        
	Bhuiyan maintained the government was ready to part with the land on a lease agreement like it executed with Tata Steel. The company has to take approval of the state government as and when it wants to expand. Besides, it cant sublease the land.

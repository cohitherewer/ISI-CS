          OUR BUREAU                            Adam Gilchrist exults after hitting the fastest IPL century, off 42 balls, in Navi Mumbai. (PTI)                                   
	April 27: Kings XI Punjab cricketer S. Sreesanth has said Harbhajan Singhs Mohali blow was more a scuffle than a slap, ahead of the disciplinary hearing in New Delhi tomorrow.        
	I had gone to shake hands but it was really like hitting me. It was really a scuffle, he told Asianet News, a Malayalam television channel, modifying his earlier statement that the slap from the Mumbai Indians off-spinner was a handshake on the wrong side.        
	The Malayalam word the fast bowler used to describe the incident was malppidutham, which means wrestling, grappling or scuffle, depending on the context.        
	IPL commissioner Lalit Modi also confirmed that the cameras had picked up something. We have this thing of cameras rolling for 10 minutes after the match. Yes, it did pick up something.        
	Sreesanth iterated that he had walked up to Harbhajan after the match only to shake hands with him. It is unbelievable the response would have been like that, he said, adding he had no clue what triggered it.        
	I dont know the reason. Maybe because of the three (IPL) defeats in a row, Harbhajan was very angry.        
	Sreesanth, known to be temperamental himself, said what saddened him was that the blow came from someone he considered his elder brother. Whatever has happened, has happened. What hurt me was the unacceptable behaviour. Anyway, I have forgiven, he told the channel.        
	It should not have happened. But I have forgiven because I am the only Malayali in the team. I have my playing days ahead of me. I dont keep these things in my mind. I just dont carry all these things.        
	The Indian cricket board today asked the Punjab and Mumbai IPL team managements not to comment on the row.        
	The BCCI has not issued any formal gag. But this is a disciplinary issue concerning the players and the players are contracted to BCCI. There is no need for anyone else to talk in this matter, cricket board secretary Niranjan Shah said.

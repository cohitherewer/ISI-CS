          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 7: Congress president Sonia Gandhi has shown the green light to Shibu Soren to contest for the Tamar by-election to be held on December 29.        
	State Congress spokesperson Alok Dubey said that the UPA chairpersons nod came after Soren held talks with alliance leaders in New Delhi over the telephone, agreeing to contest the Tamar by-election.         
	Soren (in picture) will be the UPA nominee, Dubey added. Soren was so far reluctant to contest the by-elections opposite the widow of slain JD(U) MLA, Ramesh Singh Munda.         
	The chief minister also knows that his party, JMM, has no support base in the Tamar constituency.        
	The seat fell vacant on July 9 after the murder of JD(U) leader and legislature member Ramesh Singh Munda. The NDA has decided to field Vasundhara Munda  Rameshs widow  for the seat.         
	Safiq Ansari, the news advisor to the chief minister, confirmed that Soren will be contesting the elections from Tamar. However, the UPA will be officially declaring its candidate after a meeting with deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi, to be held at his residence on December 10.         
	The last date for filing nomination papers is December 12.        
	The Congress was said to be putting pressure on Soren to fight the Tamar elections for two reasons. Firstly, it had no strong candidate for the Tamar seat.         
	Secondly, the Congress MP from Godda, Furkan Ansari, did not want Soren to contest from the Jamtara seat, which the sitting MLA, Vishnu Bhaiya, vacated for the chief minister. Furkans son, Irfan Ansari, had unsuccessfully contested from Jamtara in the last Assembly elections.         
	Sorens entry in Jamtara would have proved detrimental for his son in the next Assembly elections, Congress sources told The Telegraph.        
	However, the chief minister, too, was running out of time and had three months time cement his position in the Jharkhand Assembly, where he is not a member. Congress leader Pradeep Balmuchu was said to have drummed the gravity of the situation to the chief minister in a meeting recently.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, Feb. 22: An engineer who has worked with Tata Infotech and General Electric has been arrested on terror charges following lie tests on three other educated suspects, including a medical student.        
	Yahya Khan, 33, from Kozhikode in Kerala, is a member of a Students Islamic Movement of India sleeper cell, police said. The cell allegedly recruited educated young men and took them on strenuous treks and river-rafting trips to see if they were fit for militant training across the border.        
	Police now recall that Yahya had been under watch after the December 2005 attack on the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The repeated police visits to his office had led GE to sack him in March 2007, officers said.        
	Yahya and his associates used to meet in north Karnataka locations, such as Hubli, the police said. In January, three of his mates were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the IISc attack.        
	One of them mentioned Yahyas name during narco-analysis. Yahya used to operate the Simi office in Bangalore till the organisation was banned, a senior officer said.        
	After Yahya lost his job, he moved house and we lost track of him. We arrested him from a house on Bannerghatta Road last night. He has been taken to Hubli. We are looking for four more educated people whose names came up during the narco-analysis.        
	Yahya, an electrical engineering graduate from a Kozhikode college, came to Bangalore in 1996 and joined Tata Infotech as a trainee engineer in the information security and telephony division.        
	In 1997, he moved to GE, which promoted him and later shifted him to GE Healthcare, where he worked as a senior engineer.         
	One version has it that the company caught him trying to steal data and he chose to leave instead of being handed over to the police. GE officials declined comment.        
	The police said they had seized Yahyas laptop, the hard disk of his home PC, some documents and jihadi literature.

	Adelaide, Jan. 24: Sunil Gavaskar and Wasim Akram, among the tallest of sporting icons from the subcontinent, were at a dinner two nights ago when the conversation veered towards what could happen in the fourth and final Test.
    
	The must-win match for Team India got under way today and the former captains are doing television work.
    
	As we talked, Sunny said there was determination in Chhotus (Sachins) eyes and he expected a big hundred from him. With Chhotu unbeaten on 124, Sunnys been proved right, Akram told The Telegraph as he left the Adelaide Oval after watching Sachins flawless 39th hundred.
    
	A while later, one contacted soothsayer Gavaskar. What encouraged him to make such a prediction?
    
	Laughing, Gavaskar replied: Purely because of the positive way Sachins been batting. He got a hundred at the SCG, but missed out at the MCG and at the Waca. I saw a parallel between my last tour to Australia (1985-86) and this one, probably Sachins last....
    
	I think I even went on air to say I expect at least 170 from Sachin. How did I reach that figure? Well, I got two hundreds  166 and 172  on my last tour and Sachins already got an unbeaten 154 (at the SCG). Lets see what tomorrow holds.
    
	Sachin, who finally got a hundred in Sir Donald Bradmans hometown, is focused on continuing with the excellent work.
    
	Thanks to Sachin and his 122-run partnership with V.V.S. Laxman, Team India could end the day on 309 for five. A grand recovery after poor decisions hurt Virender Sehwag (given out on a no ball) and Sourav Ganguly (unlucky to be adjudged leg-before).
    
	Sachin, understandably, was the centre of attraction. His profile and acceptance in these parts has jumped dramatically after Sir Don likened his game to his own. Coming from a reticent legend, that shook the world of cricket.
    
	Sir Don had said: He plays much the same as I played. I cant explain what it is in detail. It is just his compactness, his stroke production and his technique.
    
	Less than a year-and-half later, Sir Don invited Sachin to his 90th birthday celebrations. That brief visit remains the No. 1 off-the-field high point of his career. 
    
	No wonder, then, that Sachin has been getting a standing ovation throughout this series, almost surely his last in Australia. That, in the 21st century Dons own words, has made the tour very, very special. 
    
	Moreover, after this hundred (an innings with everything for the purists as well as those addicted to instant cricket), theres no blank in Sachins awesome CV.
    
	Yes, I was conscious that I didnt have a Test hundred here. A big one was needed and Ive reason to feel very happy, Sachin said as he headed to his room at the Hyatt and a recovery session, which was to include alternating between an ice-bath and one with warm water.
    
	After that, Ill need a rub down from the masseur (Ramesh Mane). I had a long day (281 minutes) and the work isnt complete, Sachin said.
    
	Footnote: Brad Hogg, making a comeback, was left cursing his luck. Watching Sachin bat is a joy. Its a privilege, but youd want him to score against other teams. How do I feel? He hit one of my best balls for a six! Need we say more?

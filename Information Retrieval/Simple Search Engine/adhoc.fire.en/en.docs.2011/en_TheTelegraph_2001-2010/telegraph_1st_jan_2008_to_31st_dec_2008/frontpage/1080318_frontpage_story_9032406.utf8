The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | HEC strikes record deal
                                                                                                           HEC strikes record deal
          RUDRA BISWAS                            IN THE KITTY: Rs 770-crore contract from Rourkela Steel Plant                                  
	Ranchi, March 17: In what will be the highest ever single contract in the 50-year-old PSUs chequered history, the once-ailing Heavy Engineering Corporation (HEC) has signed a Rs 770-crore deal with the Rourkela Steel Plant today.        
	HEC pipped engineering giants like Larsen amp; Toubro and McNally Bharat Engineering Co to grab the order for building a raw materials handling plant for the Orissa plant.         
	It is a big day for HEC. These are positive signs for the PSU which is rapidly making a turnaround, HEC chairman and managing director G.K.Pillai told The Telegraph. HEC had never thought of entering the big league. Now it is pipping big private sector giants to clinch major deals in the open market.        
	The Rourkela order is time-bound and is to be completed within 30 months from the date of awarding the contract. Officials said the turnkey project comprised design, engineering, erection, testing and commissioning of the complete raw materials handling plant.        
	In addition, HEC would be required to manufacture and supply several industrial equipments. The job is virtually a repeat order for HEC as it had successfully executed a similar raw materials handling plant at Rourkela that has been performing satisfactorily since 1996, said a senior HEC official.        
	A separate project division, with a dedicated team of engineers capable of handling large projects, has now been set up to ensure prompt execution of the Rourkela order.        
	With this Rourkela order, HEC has bagged orders worth Rs 1,470 crore over the past one month from various SAIL plants. On February 1, HEC bagged Rs 200-crore work order from the Bhilai Steel Plant for augmentation of an ore-handling plant, while on February 29, it bagged another Rs 500-crore order for a coal-handling plant.        
	HEC has been executing orders for 18 cranes for Neelachal Ispat worth Rs 185 crore and a Rs 20-crore mobile launch pad for Indian Space Research Organisation.        
	The mobile launch pad is being despatched to Sriharikota two months ahead of its original schedule.         
	Officials said by clinching orders worth Rs 1,470 crore over the past one month, a review of the plants performance up to February 29 revealed that HEC had surpassed the Centres sales target of Rs 360 crore for the 2007-08 fiscal.

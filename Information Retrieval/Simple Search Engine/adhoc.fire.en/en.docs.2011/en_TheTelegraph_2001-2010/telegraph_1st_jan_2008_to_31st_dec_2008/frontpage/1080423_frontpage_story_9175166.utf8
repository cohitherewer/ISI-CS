  - Author asks for revival of peace process          A STAFF REPORTER                                                       
	Guwahati, April 22: Writer and peacemaker Mamoni Raisom Goswami today sought Governor Lt Gen. (retd) Ajai Singhs intervention to revive the stalled peace process between Delhi and Ulfa.         
	Emerging from a 30-minute meeting with the governor, Goswami said she had urged Singh to use his capacity to break the deadlock in the peace process.         
	The impasse follows the extreme stands taken by Ulfa and Delhi on the issue of including the outfits demand for a sovereign Assam as a core issue in the proposed talks.         
	I have asked the governor to do everything possible to expedite the peace process, Goswami, who has been trying to broker peace between the government and the proscribed outfit, said.        
	She said the governor appeared very positive and had assured her that he would convey her feelings to the Centre.         
	The meeting assumes significance as it comes close on the heels of Goswamis lengthy conversation with Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua over phone.         
	During my telephonic conversation, he (Barua) asked me to do something to revive the peace process. But he insisted that the outfit would not sit for talks until it gets an assurance from the government that the sovereignty issue would be discussed, she said.         
	Goswami said she had conveyed Baruas stand to the governor and had suggested that if need be, the Constitution should be amended to include the sovereignty issue in the peace talks. I told the governor that the Constitution has been amended so many times in the past. So, if need be, it can be amended once more to facilitate the talks to bring permanent peace to the state.         
	The governor, who had invited Goswami for the meeting, described it as a personal interaction and refused to divulge anything.         
	Goswami described the meeting as very positive and said she would soon call on chief minister Tarun Gogoi to make a similar appeal to him.

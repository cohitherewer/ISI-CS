	Bhubaneswar, March 12: For a change, civic authorities have got thumbs up. Artists have become fans of Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation for giving them a chance of a lifetime to showcase their skills by launching the city beautification drive.         
	In 2007, work began on 13 walls along Bhubaneswar thoroughfares to paint them with striking shades of Orissa art. There was a little bit of everything from the Orissa school of art in the paintings.         
	BMCs beautification drive, with help from corporate houses, has received a positive response and applause from every quarter. And, it has brought little-known artists to the limelight, besides bringing in financial rewards.         
	Simanchal Mallick, hailing from a village near Puri, was happy painting circus tents with his team till he took up the BMC project. Life changed for Mallick and his team of 50 and odd artists hailing from Koraput, Keonjhar and Ganjam.        
	Before we found it tough to earn Rs 50 a day. Now, we earn around Rs 150. BMC has provided us with an opportunity to channelise our love for art and earn, Mallick said.         
	And it has also exposed their talent to a wider audience. As a result many are receiving offers from organisations and individuals to take up individual projects.         
	We have received offers from Maharashtra. Corporate houses also want us to paint their premises, said Sheshadev Tripathy, an artist.         
	It was the governments idea which BMC merely executed, said Aparajita Sarangi, the commissioner.         
	For the second phase, 13 more walls have been identified, she added.        
	Selected sites include places adjoining the city airport, railway station and bus terminus. Walls that have been covered with bills round the year would be given extra focus. As far as the selection is concerned we have prioritised areas which receive maximum public attention, Sarangi explained.

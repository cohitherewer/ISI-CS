The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Day of nap and ruse
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Day of nap and ruse

	Revelation 1: The Maharashtra government sat on actionable intelligence inputs received on the very day of the Mumbai attacks.        
	Revelation 2: It waited for two hours after the attacks began before authorising action by marine commandos.        
	Revelation 3: The terrorists used the oldest trick: they fed Indian agencies wrong information so that warships rushed to protect a decoy shoreline.        
	Day-after-wisdom and I-told-you-so smugness are sweeping the security establishment with sources representing each wing giving a spin intended at self-preservation.        
	The Maharashtra governments slumber is being chronicled by defence and intelligence sources. According to these sources, the naval commandos, known by their acronym Marcos, were waiting at their base, about an hours drive from Mumbai.         
	By the time the commandos reached the sites, the siege was already on. It is the governments job to ask the defence forces to act. Without their orders, nothing can move. In this case, no information was supplied to us, said a defence source based in Mumbai.        
	The source did not say whose responsibility it was to give the go-ahead in such cases. The authorisation asking for Marcos action was ultimately signed by Maharashtra chief secretary Johnny Joseph. But the states top bureaucrat refused to respond to queries from The Telegraph.         
	I am busy at a meeting, I cant talk now, Joseph said.        
	Top intelligence officials involved with the investigations said the government ignored their actionable alert on November 26.        
	RAW (Research and Analysis Wing, the countrys external agency) had sent an alert to the Intelligence Bureau (IB) about an impending sea attack on November 26 and had even given information about the time bracket when the strike would happen. The bureau had passed on the information to the Maharashtra government through the proper channel, an IB official said.        
	But coast guard sources told PTI that they and the navy were misled by intelligence agencies that had been supplied false information. Both the coast guard and the navy have been under fire for failing to spot the trawler carrying the attackers.        
	The coast guard sources said the terrorists deliberately leaked false inputs about the time and place of arrival. As a consequence, the coast guard sources said, warships that were carrying out a war game off the Gujarat coast had to be diverted for surveillance and patrol at the wrong location in the Sir Creek area, whereas the terrorists entered Indian waters off south Gujarat.        
	They did not explain what the ships not playing the war game were doing.

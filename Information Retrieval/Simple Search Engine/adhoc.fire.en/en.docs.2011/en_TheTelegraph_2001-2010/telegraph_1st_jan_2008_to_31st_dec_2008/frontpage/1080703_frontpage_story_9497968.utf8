  Amar asks and govt applies Iran balm           SANKARSHAN THAKUR                            Amar, Manmohan                                       
	New Delhi, July 2: In a command performance engineered to sew up the Samajwadi Partys support, the Prime Ministers Office tonight issued a detailed assurance on preserving national and nuclear sovereignty, flagging for special mention a guarantee that no outside influence or pressure could force India to deviate from its time-honoured and civilisational ties with Iran.        
	Addressing what is a key concern, particularly for the Samajwadis Muslim constituency, the statement said: India and Iran have recently taken several initiatives, including one relating to the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline.        
	The pipeline epitomises the nature and importance of the relationship, something that was strongly reinforced during the visit of President Ahmadinejad to Delhi in April. There have been other meetings between our ministers and officials and their Iranian counterparts. The national security adviser has just returned after a very productive meeting with the Iranian leadership, and also had a meeting with President Ahmadinejad        
	India is not under any pressure, not can it be pressurised to follow a course of action that is not dictated by our enlightened self-interest.        
	The elaborate, six-point statement came at the end of a hectic day of to-and-fro political negotiations whose centrepiece was an hour-long meeting between Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh and national security adviser M.K. Narayanan.        
	Emerging from the meeting, Amar said his party had misgivings about the nuclear deal and demanded that the Prime Minister publicly clarify those before the Samajwadis could decide their approach.        
	The alacrity with which the response came might suggest an element of backroom concert between the party and the PMO.        
	Since the crisis over the nuclear deal escalated following the Prime Ministers dare to the Left last August, Manmohan Singh has directly engaged at the political level only twice  with CPM general secretary Prakash Karat a couple of days after his interview to The Telegraph, and then in November with a core UPA-Left group comprising Sonia Gandhi, Pranab Mukherjee, Karat and CPI boss A.B. Bardhan.        
	This evening, however, the PMO was uncharacteristically forthcoming.        
	Even as he demanded a public clarification from the Prime Minister, Amar dropped enough hints that his party had already sealed a deal with the Congress.         
	The truth is that communalism is the biggest threat to the nation at the moment, he told journalists, even taking a swipe at the Left. If the BJP, the BSP and the Left parties are going to vote against this government together, what is one to say?         
	Even so, the Amar Singh show this afternoon was geared to address two main concerns of the Samajwadis  it did not want to be seen as having sold out to the Congress cheaply and, more important, it was keen to signal to Muslims that it was not clinching a deal at their expense.        
	It is widely believed that Muslim opinion in the country is against the deal because the US, and President George W. Bush in particular, are red rags to the community in the global context.        
	Which is why the Samajwadis postured sharp with the Prime Minister. The party wanted to be seen as being a tough customer that had driven a hard bargain.

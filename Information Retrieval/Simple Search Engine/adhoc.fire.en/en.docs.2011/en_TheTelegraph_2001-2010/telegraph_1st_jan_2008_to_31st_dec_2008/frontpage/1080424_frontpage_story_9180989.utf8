The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Amar at RGF, over to SRK
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Amar at RGF, over to SRK
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Sonia, Amar                                 
	New Delhi, April 23: The think-thank has done its bit. Now it is up to Shah Rukh Khan to take it forward.        
	Amar Singh today chaired a panel discussion at the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), four years after the Samajwadi Party leader went to Sonia Gandhis dinner all dressed up but feeling unwanted.        
	Amars presence at the foundation, headed by Sonia, coincides with a perceived thaw in the relations between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party.        
	Sonia was in Parliament and did not attend the RGF discussion. Sources from both parties were reluctant to say if the wheel had turned full circle but Amar was instrumental in blocking a rapprochement with the Congress before the Uttar Pradesh elections.        
	Amars proximity to the Bachchan family was another irritant for the Congress  the misgivings bursting through the veneer when Amar was given the cold shoulder at a dinner hosted by Sonia for friends of the UPA after the last general elections.         
	All that is slowly receding from our consciousness because we are down and out at the moment and have to look at other political options, a Samajwadi source said today.        
	Amar played down his appearance at the RGF, saying: I dont think anything political should be read into it.        
	The Samajwadi leader said he was invited by an RGF official, P.D. Kaushik, to chair a panel discussion on the role of private-public partnership in health in his capacity as the chairman of a parliamentary committee on the subject. It was a very good discussion and even Yashodhara Raje Scindia (of the BJP) was there as a standing committee member, Amar said.        
	Congress sources said it was not a party matter but added that the invitation would not have gone without Sonias knowledge.        
	The Samajwadi sources said efforts  if any  for a reconciliation would intensify closer to the Lok Sabha polls.        
	In the intervening months, if Shah Rukh  a close friend of the Nehru-Gandhi family who had a couple of run-ins with Amar  is willing, he can fulfil a fond wish of the younger brother of Bachchan.        
	Amar is keen to see Shah Rukhs Kolkata Knight Riders play. I have not been invited. I briefly saw the Delhi team play because Dimple and Akshay Kumar invited me. After seeing Akshays stunts, I left.

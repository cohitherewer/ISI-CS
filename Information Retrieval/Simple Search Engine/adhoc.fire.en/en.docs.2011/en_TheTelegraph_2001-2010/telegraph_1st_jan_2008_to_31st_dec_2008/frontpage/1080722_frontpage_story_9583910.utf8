	New Delhi, July 22: Ashok Agral, BJP MP from Morena, waved wads of notes in Parliament today, claiming that it was advance payment by Samajwadi Party's Amar Singh for abstaining from the trust vote. The debate in Parliament reached its all time low when Agral and two other MPs entered the House, waving bundles of notes claiming that they amounted to Rs 1 crore and represented the advance of the total money they were about to get for staying absent from the House when the votes would take place.        The House proceedings became chaotic as MPs from both sides traded charges of horse trading. All business came to a halt while money was flashed around. BJP MPs wanted the vote postponed and asked the Prime Minister to step down. They also demanded an enquiry into the alleged bribery.  Because of the disruptions, Prime Minister's speech which was to start from 5 pm was postponed. The voting too will be delayed. Now voting is expected to start around 7 pm.

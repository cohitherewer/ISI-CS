          K.P. NAYAR                            Joseph Pallipurath                                  
	Washington, Nov. 24: An Indian shot to death his estranged wife and another person in a church at the fag end of Sunday service after apparently driving 4,700 kilometres from California to New Jersey in pursuit of a troubled relationship that straddled continents.        
	The womans aunt was critically injured in the shooting that has triggered an intense manhunt involving helicopters and road closures in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.        
	Joseph Sanish Pallipurath, a 27-year-old native of Kerala, fled in his 1994 model green Jeep Wrangler with a California number plate after unloading his gun.         
	New Jersey police warned the public to be on their guard against the dangerous gunman. Last seen, Pallipurath, 5-foot-8 and 73 kg, was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and light-coloured slacks.        
	About 200 people, almost all from Kerala, were attending Sunday service in the St Thomas Syrian Orthodox Knanaya Church in Clifton, New Jersey, at the time of the shooting.        
	Parishioners said Pallipurath confronted Reshma James, 24, in the vestibule of the church as the service was concluding. A few months after their marriage in India, Reshma moved to California in January to live with him.        
	But the relationship was rocky. The couple went to India at the advice of relatives and friends and returned to California as part of a patch-up. Then things got worse and Reshma, citing abuse, secured a restraining order against him.        
	She arrived in New Jersey recently to look for work as a nurse.        
	The third person shot and critically wounded yesterday is Silvy Perincheril, 47, Reshmas aunt with whom she was staying in New Jersey. Silvy, herself a nurse, was helping Reshma find work.        
	Parishioners said Reshma was going to the basement of the church to get help because her husband tried to force her to go with him to their one-time home in California.        
	Pallipurath asked Reshma not to go anywhere but she refused. At that point, he drew his gun and shot her.         
	Dennis John Malloosseril, 23, who may have tried to intervene, was also shot. He died later at a hospital. Malloosseril, who worked in information technology for a pharmaceutical company, was popular in the local Indian community as a church volunteer.        
	Clifton city police detective captain Robert Rowan said Pallipurath, who lived in Sacramento, California, had driven across the US to New Jersey to confront his wife.        
	Parishioners were in shock after the shooting in the place of worship, which was gearing up for the Thanksgiving and Christmas season.

	Jamshedpur, May 27: Gas leaking from chlorine cylinders kept at a water treatment plant in the Telco colony spread fear and panic among residents of Truck Park today forcing at least 150 people, including several children, to be rushed to hospital with complaints of suffocation and a burning sensation in the eyes.        
	While there were no casualties, at least five persons have been admitted to the ICU of the Tata Motors Hospital.         
	According to Tata Motors plant head S.B. Borwankar, about 650 litres of chlorine had been stored in a drum. About 10 per cent of the gas was still in the drum when the leak took place. The drum was kept inside the plant. Later, it was put in a nearby pond. However, gas continued to leak from it, he said.        
	This was the first time that chlorine gas had leaked from the water treatment plant that was maintained by Jamshedpur Utilities and Services Company (Jusco), a subsidiary of Tata Steel.        
	Senior officials of Tata Motors, who rushed to the hospital and the water treatment plant, could not confirm whether the entire stock of gas in the cylinder had been exhausted.        
	But, according to residents, a fair amount of chlorine had found its way into the atmosphere. It seemed chlorine gas was leaking from the cylinder from morning  as early as 10 am  but residents of Truck Park realised something was seriously amiss only after many began falling ill, with a feeling of being suffocated accompanied by a burning sensation in the eyes and chest.        
	We got to know it was a gas leak after some youths, who were taking a bath inside the plant, rushed out to warn us, said Riazuddin Khan, a resident of Truck Park.        
	Then, there was panic all over. Within minutes residents of Truck Park and nearby areas, including Ring Road and Kharangajhar market, rushed out of their homes in search of a safe place.        
	A section of the harried residents, who lived in the 350 quarters of Tata Motors at Truck Park, even managed to send out their families to other localities of the Steel City as a precautionary measure.         
	We were very confused and did not know how to react and what to do. The burning sensation in the eyes and chest was unbearable. Several residents may have unknowingly inhaled a fair amount of gas, said an elderly man.                                
	Rameshray Prasad, a former district Congress president and resident of Truck Park for over four decades, said they began to feel suffocated between 4pm and 4.30pm. Residents ran out of their homes and began shouting in a state of frenzy, he said.         
	Till late tonight, there was no word from officials, either from Jusco or the district administration or police, on the reasons for the leak.        
	The Tata Motors Hospital was jammed packed with over 150 reporting ill. Manitosh Ray, the hospitals general manager (medical services), said chlorine could prove fatal if inhaled in a large quantities.        
	At present the situation is under control. More than 100 people had come to the hospital. We have released about 70 per cent of them after preliminary check-up. But still more patients are coming in, he added.        
	Dr Ray said they would be admitting some of the patients. We have also alerted the Tata Main Hospital for extra beds for our hospital, he added.        
	Suresh Rangarajan, spokesperson for Tata Motors, said the leak was being plugged. Tata Motors has informed the local administration and is receiving all help from them, he added.         
	Borwankar said water used to be cleaned with chlorine gas for the past 10 years or so. But presently it is being cleaned by sodium chloride, which is less harmful, he said.         
	East Singhbhum deputy commissioner R.K. Agarwal said the situation was under control and there was no cause for panic.        
	Several politicians, including Jamshedpur MP Suman Mahto and former chief minister Arjun Munda, reached the hospital as soon as they heard of the gas leak.

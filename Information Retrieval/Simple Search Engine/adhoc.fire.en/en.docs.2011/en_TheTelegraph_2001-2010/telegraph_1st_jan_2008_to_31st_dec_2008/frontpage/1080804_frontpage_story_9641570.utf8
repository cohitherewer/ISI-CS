          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Chak De! India: Inspiring B-school students                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 3: How about management lessons sauced with some Bollywood blockbusters?        
	This is exactly what future managers at the top B-school have been doing lately. Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar, in the latest addition to its syllabus, has included case studies on mainstream Bollywood films like Swades, Chak De! India and Manthan. Its a fairly new concept and we have included it from the current academic year, said Niraj Kumar, a faculty conducting the course.        
	The films have been included as case studies as a part of the community mobilisation and institution building course offered by XIMB in its second-year rural management programme. The course apparently attempts to relate a films characters to the theory. The students are asked to watch the movie before coming to class. During the class itself, intermediate clippings of important moments in the film are shown.        
	The practice leads to greater class participation and boosts students understanding of the subject, for films have a long-lasting effect due to the effective use of visual medium, Kumar added.        
	Due to the introduction of such edutainment measures, there has been a marked improvement in the efficiency of the teaching methodology. I now have the attention of the class for full 90 minutes, as opposed to the average attention span of 20-30 minutes, prior to the introduction of these measures, Kumar said.        
	The course has also been well received by the students and there has been a positive feedback from the students about this course since its introduction. Similar use of movies has been done in a few courses of business management as well.         
	XIMB is considering introducing this form of case studies in its other courses conducted as part of the rural management programme and its flagship business management programme.         
	The fact that the films are popular Bollywood movies doesnt hurt because they also provide good entertainment value. Such measures should be introduced across the board, said Shirshendu Chatterjee, a second-year rural management student at XIMB.

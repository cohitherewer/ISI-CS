                                                                                                           Promoter shoots at Siliguri flat-owners
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, March 14: The promoter of an apartment house in Deshbandhupara today opened fire at the residents from his revolver and injured one of them following an altercation over the repair of a pump.        
	Jhuma Majumdar was hit by splinters from the wall where one of the bullets had hit and suffered a cut on her chest, while two other residents were injured in the scuffle that preceded the firing.         
	The promoter, Shyamal Sarkar, is absconding.         
	Chinu Tower, the four-storeyed apartment house where the incident took place, was built around seven years ago, but Sarkar still holds possession of two of the 18 flats. The remaining apartments have been sold for prices ranging above Rs 7 lakh.        
	This morning, trouble started when the residents brought a mechanic to repair the pump that draws water from the underground reservoir and deposits it in the overhead tank. The pump is fitted on one side of the car parking space on the ground floor.        
	Prabodh Chakraborty, a resident, was inspecting the work when Sarkar arrived and started shouting. Sarkar said we should have taken his permission before repairing the pump, said Mridula, Prabodhs wife. He also tried to beat up my husband, who being an ex-serviceman, fought back. The other residents, too, joined the scuffle and forced Sarkar to flee.        
	But soon Sarkar returned with a revolver.         
	It was around 11.30am. I heard a commotion downstairs and asked my wife Jhuma to go and take a look, said Subrata Majumdar, who has a flat on the first floor. Then I heard a few loud bangs. When I came out, I saw my wife was hurt and two other residents were injured. We chased Sarkar, but he escaped.        
	Eyewitnesses said the firing took place just inside the gates of Chinu Tower. Sarkar had first fired in the air, before aiming at the residents and firing again.        
	A police force soon arrived at the spot.        
	The promoter, who fired three rounds, including two in the air, is absconding, said Pradip Dutta, the Siliguri deputy superintendent of police.         
	Jhuma was admitted to Siliguri District Hospital. She needed a stitch and was later discharged.        
	Dutta confirmed that Sarkar had a licence for the revolver. The police are trying to find out how he got it.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Voter ID cards near the paper godown. (Ananda Das)                                  
	Pandua, Dec. 8: Police today seized nearly 8,000 voter identity cards, some lying behind a paper godown and others flying about in paddy fields, with Serampore addresses on them.         
	A preliminary probe has shown that the cards found near the Pandua paper godown, about 100km from Calcutta, are genuine but could be defective and hence, rejected.        
	The police in Pandua, Hooghly, said the electoral photo identity cards were sold during an auction at the office of the SDO of Serampore along with 10 tonnes of waste paper in September.        
	But selling voter ID cards, whether rejected or surrendered, is illegal. Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said: Once a voter ID card is rejected, it will have to be cut into pieces and burnt in front of a responsible officer.         
	Sen has sent joint chief electoral officer N.K. Sahana to probe the matter and submit a report to him. I have also asked the district magistrate to fix responsibility, he said.        
	Last night, Susanta Sarkar, a villager, noticed some of the cards lying behind a roadside eatery, about 200m from the paper godown. Sarkar told the police who found some 300 cards from the spot. This morning, other villagers found cards scattered in paddy fields close to the godown.         
	We searched the area and found a heap of cards lying behind the godown. We have seized nearly 8,000 cards and all are genuine, said Priyabrata Bakshi, the officer in charge of Pandua police station.        
	The police detained Narayan Roy, the godown owner, who told them he had bought 10 tonnes of waste paper from Samir Kumar Ghosh, a dealer in scrap paper, earlier this month. I found the I-cards inside the bags. These are useless to me, so I threw them out, said Roy, who has been released.        
	The police then went to Ghoshs house in Bainchi, about 10km from Pandua. Ghosh told us that he bought 10 tonnes of waste paper, packed in gunny bags, in an auction at the SDOs office in Serampore on September 23, said Bakshi.        
	Serampore SDO Sashim Barui said: I have sent an officer to Pandua to take custody of the cards. I will find out why the cards were not destroyed.

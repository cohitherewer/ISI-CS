  - Court flays state on Bokaro land losers plight        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                                    
	Ranchi, April 21: When Manmohan Singh arrives in Bokaro tomorrow to launch the PSU steel-makers expansion plans, over 10,000 people and their families will have one question in their minds: will the Prime Minister ensure the state government pays compensation thats been due for years?        
	For, the Jharkhand government is sitting on at least Rs 70 crore deposited with it by the Bokaro Steel Plant, having decided to contest in the Supreme Court the recent Jharkhand High Court order asking it to pay the enhanced compensation.        
	The high court vested the steel plant with the ownership of 36,000 acres of land in lieu of the compensation amount it deposited with the Bokaro district judge. It also asked the government to pay up with interest.        
	Significantly, the apex court, while hearing the case on April 4, had also asked the government to go ahead and begin paying compensation. And senior lawyer Gopal Subramanyam, representing the state, agreed.        
	In fact, the government had already been pulled up by the judiciary. It was unfortunate land losers were still not paid their rightful and legitimate compensation enhanced by the land acquisition judge because of the fact that the state government challenged those awards by filing appeals in the high court which are pending for the last 16 years, Justice M.Y Eqbal said.        
	It was unfortunate that the Bokaro Steel Plant was ready to pay compensation, but the government was adamant to drag the poor land losers into litigation and thereby deprive the land losers to get their due compensation, the judge said.        
	It was not only violation of their legal right, but human rights also, the court commented.        
	The erstwhile Bihar government acquired the land to set up the plant in 1960. Ever since, there has been a protracted legal battle over enhanced compensation.         
	Bokaro land acquisition officer Uday Pratap Singh, however, claimed the process to award compensation had been initiated.         
	We have asked the land losers to come out with their descendants list to claim compensation, he said. He attributed the tardy progress of disbursal to shortage of staff and inadequate paper work.         
	The land losers, who are now into their third generation, are also facing problems in establishing their identity, he added.

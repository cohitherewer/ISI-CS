          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, June 21: Five arrested militants of the Manipur-based Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (Prepak) had rented houses here in the guise of software professionals to set up a financial base for the group.        
	Their plan was, however, busted by the crime branch of the city police and army intelligence officials.         
	The police said two of the militants, Meghan Chader alias Thungo, 27, and Bikash Pradhan, 24, were taken into custody a few days ago. Pradhan is said to be from Sikkim.        
	On the basis of information provided by them, the other three, who had assembled in a house near Hebbal flyover, were caught in the wee hours yesterday after a chase.        
	The three, Laikhuram Jiten Singh, 30, self-styled lieutenant Thungo Singh alias Nanao, 29, and self-styled major Johnny Singh, 26, were alerted after they spotted more than two dozen men in plainclothes in the locality around 3am. They quickly left the house on foot and ran in different directions when the city crime branch and army intelligence personnel asked them to stop. They were caught after a dramatic chase through narrow alleys.        
	The locality came alive in the wee hours as dogs started barking and several well-built men moved around. This must have alerted the youths, a neighbour, Jhansi Rani, said. She added that the youths were staying on the second floor of the neighbouring house for over three months.         
	The owner of the house in which the rebels were staying told the police that Thungo Singh had taken the house on rent, claiming that they were all bachelors who worked for an IT firm on MG Road.        
	The five were paraded before the media at the police commissioners office today.         
	Joint commissioner of police (crime) Gopal Hosur said army intelligence officials had contacted Bangalore police after receiving a tip-off that the Prepak was trying to set up cells in the city, Guwahati and Calcutta.         
	Sources said the five arrested militants were core members of the outfit and arranged its finances.        
	They would not stay in one place for more than three months. Their armed colleagues in Manipur staged abductions and the militants here called up the relatives of the abducted persons from mobile phones and issued instructions on how to pay the ransom, the sources added.        
	This group was mainly responsible for gathering funds and channelizing it to the groups senior leaders in Manipur, Thailand and Bangladesh, the sources said.        
	All the arrested militants have been handed over to a Manipur special police team and they are being jointly interrogated along with an army intelligence team.

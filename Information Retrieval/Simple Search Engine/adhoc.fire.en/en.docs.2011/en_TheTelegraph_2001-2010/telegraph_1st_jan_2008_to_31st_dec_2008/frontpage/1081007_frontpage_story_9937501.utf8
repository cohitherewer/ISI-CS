	Stockholm, Oct. 6 (Reuters): Two French scientists who discovered the AIDS virus and a German who bucked conventional wisdom to find a virus that causes cervical cancer were awarded the 2008 Nobel prize for medicine today.        
	Luc Montagnier, director of the World Foundation for AIDS Research and Prevention, and Francoise Barre-Sinoussi of the Institut Pasteur won half the prize of 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.4 million) for discovering the virus that has killed 25 million people since it was identified in the 1980s.        
	Harald zur Hausen of the University of Duesseldorf and a former director of the German Cancer Research Centre shared the other half of the prize for work that went against the established opinion about the cause of cervical cancer.        
	The three laureates have discovered two new viruses of great importance and the result of that has led to an improved global health, said Jan Andersson, a member of the Nobel Assembly at Swedens Karolinska Institute.        
	The discoveries made it possible to diagnose both infections, and led to the development of two vaccines that prevent cervical cancer, and more than 20 drugs that can keep HIV patients healthy.        
	But Montagnier said those who most need the diagnosis and treatments for AIDS are not getting either.        
	Its Africa which is carrying the weight of the epidemic at this moment. Out of millions of people infected, a large number are not being treated, either because they dont have access to treatment or because they dont know they are infected, Montagnier told Reuters in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where he was giving a lecture.        
	Zur Hausen was recognized for finding that the human papilloma virus, or HPV, caused cervical cancer.        
	More than 5 per cent of all cancers worldwide are caused by persistent infection with this virus, the Nobel committee said.         
	The virus, which infects at least half of all sexually active adults, can also cause genital warts, cancer of the penis and other genitalia.        
	The German scientist searched for different HPV types, detecting them in 70 per cent of cervical tumour samples from around the world.

                                fleeting image                            
	Philadelphia, July 21 (AP): A federal appeals court today threw out a $550,000 indecency fine against CBS Corp. for the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show that ended with Janet Jacksons breast-baring wardrobe malfunction.        
	The three-judge panel of a US appeals court ruled that the Federal Communications Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in issuing the fine for the fleeting image of nudity.        
	The 90 million people watching the Super Bowl, many of them children, heard Justin Timberlake sing, Gonna have you naked by the end of this song, as he reached for Jacksons bustier.        
	The court found that the FCC deviated from its nearly 30-year practice of fining indecent broadcast programming only when it was so pervasive as to amount to shock treatment for the audience.

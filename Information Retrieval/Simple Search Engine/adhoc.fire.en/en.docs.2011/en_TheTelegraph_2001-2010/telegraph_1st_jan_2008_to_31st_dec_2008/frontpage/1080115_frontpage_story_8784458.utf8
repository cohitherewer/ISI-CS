 - Team drops charge against Hogg, ball in Aussie court

	Perth, Jan. 14: Captain Anil Kumble and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have, by withdrawing the charge against Brad Hogg, taken the high moral ground.
    
	However, its to be seen whether Ricky Ponting and Cricket Australia (CA) play ball by reciprocating in the best manner possible  either withdrawing or diluting the allegation of racism against Harbhajan Singh.
    
	Harbhajan has been banned for three Tests and his appeal is before Appeals Commissioner Justice John Hansen. The New Zealander will hold court in Adelaide on January 29-30, immediately after the four-Test series. 
    
	According to The Telegraphs sources in Dubai, where BCCI and CA officials met this afternoon on the sidelines of an International Cricket Council meeting, the Australians have appreciated this gesture and indicated that they could review their stand on Harbhajan. 
    
	Even informally, CA hasnt given any assurance.... At the same time, it realises that the high moral ground India has taken is going to put it under a lot of pressure.... The CA chairman (Creagh Connor) is expected to discuss the issue with colleagues on the board and captain Ponting on returning home, said one of the sources.
    
	Clearly, the lines of communication will remain open.
    
	For all that, if the Australians dont respond and Justice Hansen upholds the punishment handed out by Match Referee Mike Procter, then the tour will be abandoned.
    
	The Australians were least expecting the charge  Hogg admitted calling Kumble and vice-captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni a b****** in the SCG Test  to be withdrawn when Procter convened the hearing a little after 6pm.
    
	When that did happen (via a letter from Team India manager Chetan Chauhan and Kumble), Ponting, Hogg and manager Stephen Bernard were quick to say thank-you.
    
	In the lead-up, of course, both Kumble and Ponting agreed to continue with the rest of the series in the correct spirit and with mutual respect. Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle, a former Sri Lanka captain, played peacemaker.
    
	Ponting, who turned up two minutes late for the joint session with Madugalle, came away saying he was relieved and relaxed now that the focus will wholly be on the third Test here, from Wednesday, and beyond. 
    
	Speaking exclusively after the allegation got dropped, Kumble said: This is the way I play.... Within minutes of assuring Madugalle that I would do my best to ensure cricket was played in the proper spirit, I couldnt have pressed charges against Hogg.... That wouldnt have gone well with the stand Id taken....
    
	While Kumble added that the BCCI had supported him, Chauhan more than suggested the nudge came from the mandarins back home. I followed exactly what was conveyed to me from India....
    
	Strangely, except perhaps a couple of players, others werent taken into confidence before the letter of withdrawal was handed to Procter.
    
	And, so, the general reaction was either a stunned What? or Kya kaha? A senior member of the support staff too was in the dark.
    
	What now? and What will the Australians do? was also a sentiment shared by many down the ranks. What, indeed, is CA going to do?

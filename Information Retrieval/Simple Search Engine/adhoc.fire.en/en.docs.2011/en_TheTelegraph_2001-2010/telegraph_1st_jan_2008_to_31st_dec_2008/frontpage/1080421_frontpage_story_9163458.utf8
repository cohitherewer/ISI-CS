	Bhubaneswar, April 20: The state attracted industrial investments to the tune of Rs 153,000 crore in the past fiscal with some 25 projects lined up for the next three to five years.         
	While the multi-crore investments spell good news for the state, on the flip side, most projects are not expected to take off due to problems related to land acquisition.        
	At a conference of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, the emphasis was on the need for a transparent and flexible land acquisition policy to enable Orissa to execute its projects waiting in the pipeline.        
	Also a report  Orissa Towards Industrialisation regarding the problem and suggestions was submitted before the government and chief minister Naveen Patnaik by association president Venugopal N. Dhoot.         
	Copies of the report were later released at a news meet here today.        
	Talking to the media, Dhoot said land acquisition has been bone of contention in most mineral resource-rich states such as Jharkhand, Bihar and Orissa. Four mega projects including Posco, ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel with an investment potential of more than Rs 1 lakh crore have not been able to take off due to problems.         
	Stating that inadequate compensation for oustees often invites public anger, Dhoot suggested a comprehensive compensation package for those whose sites and lands are acquired and permanent jobs to their dependents.         
	The oustees should also be assured of even equity stake so that they become shareholders in such developmental projects, he added.         
	The association also suggested that the state set up a special committee to study problems being faced by investors and recast its industrial policy on the lines of Maharashtra.

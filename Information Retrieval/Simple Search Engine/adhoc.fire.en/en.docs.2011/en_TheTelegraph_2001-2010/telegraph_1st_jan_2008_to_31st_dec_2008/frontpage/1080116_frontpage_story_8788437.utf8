	Hyderabad, Jan. 15: Kites are soaring in this old city of mosques and minarets, but birds are falling to their death.
    
	Bird lovers and animal rights groups say the craze for flying kites during Sankranti has killed over 350 pigeons and maimed another thousand since the festival season began in the Andhra capital last Saturday.
    
	The historic old city of Hyderabad with its palaces and tall monuments are home to over three lakh pigeons. Many of the birds have been domesticated by old timers who feed them grain every morning.
    
	But come January, the kite-flying contests  officially patronised by the state government as part of the Sankranti festival  bring nothing but death for the winged tenants who have made the city their permanent residence.
    
	The glass-cured threads used for flying the kites have had a deadly impact on the pigeons who were soft targets as they were slow to escape, says Mahesh Agrawal, secretary of Sahayog, an NGO, and a member of the Animal Welfare Board of India.
    
	Many of the kites  several of Chinese and Japanese make  are huge, and frighten the birds off their perch.
    
	While the birds received cut injuries from the threads, the shining kites frightened and blinded them, making them plunge below in shock, says actress and animal lover Amala of Blue Cross.
    
	Both Blue Cross and Sahayog have taken up the task of saving birds during the five-day festival.
    
	Mahesh has organised over 50 volunteers who rush to spots where a bird has been hit. The initial treatment is with glucose water and balm.
    
	Many of the birds bled to death before help could reach them, says Amala, who led a band of volunteers on Sunday.
    
	We have an officially recognised shelter in Kesara village, about 25km from the state capital, where we treat rescued animals and birds before handing them over to zoo authorities, says Mahesh.
    
	But he says his organisations efforts ran into opposition from kite-fliers who claimed the animal lovers were active only during Hindu festivals and not during Bakri Id. 
    
	I have been telling everyone that we had campaigned against cow slaughter during Bakri Id, he said.

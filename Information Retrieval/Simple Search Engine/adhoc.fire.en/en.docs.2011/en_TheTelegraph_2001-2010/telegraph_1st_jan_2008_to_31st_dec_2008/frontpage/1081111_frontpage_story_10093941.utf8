  - Let down, village adopted by Rahul switches flags           RASHEED KIDWAI                            Rahul: Ground reality                                        
	Nov. 10: If Rahul Gandhi revisits farmer Srinath Baghals home in Jamavada, he wont notice too many changes since his earlier trip. Except one.        
	The Congress flag before Baghals hut in the Chhattisgarh village has been replaced by a BJP flag.        
	A morose Baghal pulled down the one and put up the other today just as the Amethi MP was addressing voters 25km away in Jagdalpur. To register protest, the farmer explained.        
	Many in the village have switched loyalties since Rahul visited them on April 25, spent the night at Baghals home, adopted Jamavada and made many promises. Not one promise has been kept, said residents of the predominantly tribal village in Maoist-stronghold Bastar, which votes on Friday in the state polls first phase.        
	When Rahul Gandhiji came here, we had made certain demands. None of them has materialised. So, with a heavy heart, we are registering our protest in this way, said Baghal, 40.        
	Sarpanch Sonsai Kashyap too has turned BJP supporter. He said Rahul had come to Jamavada, home to about 3,000 people, during his Discover India tour. The villagers asked him for streetlights, tube-wells, bore-wells, a health centre and a boys hostel.        
	Rahul set up a committee under district Congress president Uma Shankar Shukla to look into the demands, Kashyap added.        
	Shukla at first dismissed the villagers claim of having switched loyalties when he spoke to The Telegraph today. Most of the villagers from Jamavada attended the Jagdalpur rally and later shook hands with Rahul Gandhiji, he claimed. Sarpanch Kashyap denied this.        
	Asked about Baghals complaint, however, Shukla appeared to be fumbling for an answer. He eventually said: Yes, the promises were made but then the rains came. I have got a bore-well sanctioned and will get work started soon after the elections. The drinking water problem has been attended to.        
	Jamavada, where literacy is below five per cent, is part of the Jagdalpur Assembly segment where the BJPs Santosh Bafna is taking on the Congresss Rek Chand Jain.        
	Unaware of Jamavadas sense of hurt, Rahul today addressed a crowd  of 40,000, Shukla said  accusing the Raman Singh government of failing to utilise central development funds because of corruption.        
	I feel very sad the way the BJP government has handled the three big (central) schemes providing a minimum 100 days job in a year to unemployed youths, education and caring for the tribal people, he said.        
	The UPA government is providing Rs 8,000 crore to Chhattisgarh for various schemes. But the money is not reaching the people because of rampant corruption in the state government.        
	Thirty-nine of the states 90 constituencies, including the 12 in Bastar, will vote on Friday. In the last polls, the BJP won nine and the Congress three of these seats.

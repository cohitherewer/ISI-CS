          SANJAY K. JHA                                  (From top) Advani, Uma, Rajnath                                 
	New Delhi, April 30: The rift at the BJP helm has surfaced again with L.K. Advani overruling party president Rajnath Singhs proposal to let Uma Bharti return.        
	Sources said Advani demurred at a core committee meeting last week when Rajnath advocated Umas return to consolidate the BJP ahead of the general election due next year.         
	Other younger generation leaders, who are all opposed to Uma, asked Advani, the partys candidate for Prime Minister, to take the final decision on Rajnaths proposal.         
	If you leave it to me, I will say no. Otherwise, she should completely forget Madhya Pradesh and agree to contest the next Lok Sabha election from Uttar Pradesh, Advani said.        
	No one mustered the courage to present a counter-view, and Rajnath closed the chapter.         
	Advani is upset that Uma, a former Madhya Pradesh chief minister who was sacked for indiscipline, has not mended her ways and continues to attack leaders like Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj.         
	Rajnath wanted to bring Uma to counter these leaders but he has not been able to marshal enough support in the core committee.         
	The Rajnath camp is worried that the core committee has almost become an Advani fortress. Sources say Rajnath was snubbed recently when he wanted to make some appointments to the BJP parliamentary party.         
	All the senior leaders, including Advani, Jaswant Singh, Swaraj, Jaitley and M. Venkaiah Naidu, got together to resist him. They told Rajnath the party president should concentrate on organisational matters.        
	But even in organisational matters, Rajnath does not have a free hand. The recent Gopinath Munde crisis was resolved primarily by Advani and Naidu.         
	In faction-ridden Bihar, Advani is not in favour of removing deputy chief minister Sushil Modi even though Rajnath sees merit in the rebels arguments against him.         
	A senior leader and a member of the core committee told The Telegraph: There is no other way to save the party from a vertical split in Bihar than removing Modi but Advaniji will listen to what Jaitley and Venkaiah will say.        
	Younger leaders feel that the crisis of leadership was keeping the party from fully exploiting the failures of the Centre, particularly on price rise.

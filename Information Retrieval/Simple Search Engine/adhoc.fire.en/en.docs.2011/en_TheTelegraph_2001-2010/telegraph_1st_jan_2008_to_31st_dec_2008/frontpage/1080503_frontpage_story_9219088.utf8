  - Six-man panel to evaluate iron ore reserves          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA AND AMIT GUPTA                                    
	Ranchi, May 2: Against the backdrop of SAIL reiterating its claims on Chiria mines, a six-member committee of experts has been formed to explore its iron ore reserves and sumbit a report within six months.        
	This was decided at a meeting today between steel ministry special secretary U.P. Singh, state mines and geology department secretary J.S. Tiwari among others. During his recent visit to the state, SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta claimed reserves at Chiria mines werent sufficient enough to meet the requirements of SAIL which is working on a future strategy plan, Vision 2020, to enhance production from the the existing 15 MTPA to 45 MTPA in the next 12 years.         
	He argued SAIL had the primary rights over Chiria mines and that he would leave no stone unturned to retain the reserves.        
	At todays meeting too, SAIL officials argued that the estimated iron ore reserves at Chiria mines were barely 2,000MT. And that the reserves werent sufficient to meet the companys long-term requirements. The state government, on the other hand, refuted SAILs claims on the extent of reserves and said the actual reserves would be much higher. Tiwari said the state was committed to opening up the reserves to the proposed new industries in the steel sector. It was, therefore, decided to hold a fresh evaluation of the reserves in the regions of West Singhbhum, including Chiria, Gua and Kiriburu.                                 
	It would be conducted by the committee comprising two members from the state mines and geology department_ additional director, geology, Jaiprakash Singh, senior geologist R K Suri_two members from SAIL_DGM P C Nayak, assistant GM (geology) M L Yede_and two experts from the Mineral Exploration Corporation of India Limited (MECL)_ zonal manager S K Thakur and manager (geology) S K Lagu.        
	 B B Singh, director (mines), conceded, A full-proof exploration and estimation was never done for the area. The committee, he added, would do that now.         
	Yesterday, chief minister Madhu Koda reiterated his governments stand of using at least 50 per cent of the iron ore reserves at Chiria mines, even if the survey revealed it to be around 2,000 million tonne. He said promoting new industries was his governments priority.         
	I have conveyed this in plain terms to the Union steel minister as well. I will meet him again and request him to pave way for setting up new industries in the state. SAIL can carry out its business with 1,000 million tonnes in hand, Koda said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Dispur seeks report on encounter
  - Killing fake, cry villagers and PCG      OUR BUREAU                                           
	Dibrugarh/Guwahati, June 16: Strains of an anti-army mutiny in Sivasagar following yesterdays encounter that claimed four Ulfa militants has prompted Dispur to ask for a report on the killing before rights violation cries grow louder.        
	The home department has asked the Sivasagar district administration to submit a detailed report about the circumstances that led to the killing of the Ulfa militants.         
	The move comes after chief minister Tarun Gogoi recently gave instructions that the government would not tolerate any human rights violation by the forces.         
	Sources in the chief ministers office said the encounter issue even figured in Gogois meeting with GOC 4 Corps Lt Gen. B.S. Jaswal in Guwahati today.         
	While Dispur grappled to figure out the truth behind the encounter, the Ulfa-constituted Peoples Consultative Group and villagers of Balijan grant are convinced that yesterdays killing was anything but a proper encounter.        
	Bullets flew only from the army guns, villagers said.         
	There was no encounter between the Ulfa rebels and the army and all the four were caught and killed, one of them said.         
	The four were questioned, then pinned to the ground, slapped and kicked before the shots rang out, he said.        
	A senior PCG member Hiranya Saikia even claimed that since January the security forces have adopted a shoot-first-ask-questions-later policy towards Ulfa.        
	In the past 10 days, 15 militants have been killed in encounters.         
	Saikia alleged that the army was out to ensure that the peace efforts between Ulfa and the government were not revived.         
	Both the villagers and PCG members carefully pieced together signs that suggest that it was a one-sided affair.        
	If there had been a fierce gun battle, as claimed by the army, the house in which the Ulfa rebels had allegedly taken shelter would have been damaged. But there was no sign of a single bullet piercing the bamboo and mud walls of the house. From this, it is evident that the entire story which the army is saying is nothing but cooked up, a villager said.         
	The army, however, stuck to its claim that the Ulfa rebels had died in a proper encounter which lasted for an hour.         
	But the villagers and the PCG are not the only ones crying foul.        
	The 268 Field Regiment, which raided the village in Sivasagar following information about the presence of five Ulfa rebels there, allegedly violated Unified Command strictures.        
	The forces moved into Sivasagar from Tiloi in Dibrugarh district without informing the local police station about the operation.        
	We did not have any information about the operation conducted by the army. We were officially informed about it only after the killing, said a senior police officer in the district, who did not wish to be named.         
	Both the police and the media were not allowed to visit the location of the encounter for some time.        
	In fact, Charaideo subdivisional police officer Jayanta Sarathi Bora and the officer-in-charge of Sonari police station Rajib Saikia were kept waiting by the army for around two hours before they were allowed to inspect the site of the encounter.

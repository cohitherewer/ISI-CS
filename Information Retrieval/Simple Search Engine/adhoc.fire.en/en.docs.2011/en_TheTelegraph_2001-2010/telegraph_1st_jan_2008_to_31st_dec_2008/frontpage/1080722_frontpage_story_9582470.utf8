	New Delhi, July 21: Mayavati has wasted no time in starting to build a national profile for herself, riding the endorsements for the countrys top job from her new friends.        
	She today made her first known statement on foreign policy and international politics, asking the Prime Minister not to make the nuclear deal a prestige issue and to leave it to the next government.        
	Apparently primed by Shahid Siddiqui, her latest acquisition from the Samajwadi Party, Mayavati explained her geopolitical take on the Indo-US agreement. The deal, she said, would mortgage India to the US and hobble the $7.4-billion Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline project because America was acting against Tehran in a dangerous manner.        
	The whole world will have to face the consequences of a nuclear war between the US and Iran, the blame for which will fall on the UPA government if it goes ahead with the deal, she said.        
	That wasnt all. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister demanded that India assert its right to permanent membership of the UN Security Council.        
	BSP sources said their leader was determined not to let go of the momentum of the past two weeks  generated by her pro-activism in national politics  regardless of the trust votes outcome. The Left, Telugu Desam Party and the Telengana Rashtra Samiti recently described Mayavati as a future Prime Minister.        
	For her, apparently, nows the time to grab the spotlight and stay there; the long-time strategies of winning new allies and venturing into new territories can slowly unfold.        
	The BSP sources said Mayavati would be working hard to keep the reborn third front alive by joining the programmes of the Left and the UNPA. She is prepared to face pressure and harassment from the Centre, if the government survives, they added.        
	The Congresss eager beavers are already dropping hints about an Operation Mayavati after the trust vote to curb her political expansion. But a BSP leader said: She has new and powerful friends to take up cudgels on her behalf. Besides, she has emerged stronger after every battle in the past.        
	Mayavati, who spends three to four hours a day on party work, is expected to offload some of the responsibility for Uttar Pradesh on her core team of B.S. Kushwaha, Naseemuddin Siddiqui, Lalji Verma and Swami Prasad Maurya.        
	She herself is likely to focus on a blueprint for expanding her base in other states with the help of political aide and Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Mishra, the chief architect of her successful strategy in the 2007 UP elections.        
	So far, the BSPs growth has been confined mainly to Uttar Pradesh. In other states, it has pursued opportunistic strategies and alliances at the cost of party-building. Party sources claim she has learnt from her mistakes.        
	The BJP fears that Mayavatis aura might undermine its efforts to hold up L.K. Advani as the only serious contender for prime ministership in 2009. The Congress is worried she would become a serious competitor in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, which have largely seen two-horse races.

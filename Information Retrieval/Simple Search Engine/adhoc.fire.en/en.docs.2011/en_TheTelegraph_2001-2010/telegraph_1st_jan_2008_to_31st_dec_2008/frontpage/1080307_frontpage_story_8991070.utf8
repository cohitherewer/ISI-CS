The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Eulogy to Team Dhoni, elegy to the elders
                                                                                                           Eulogy to Team Dhoni, elegy to the elders
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, March 6: Team India is Mahendra Singh Dhonis team, and Mahi has the complete support of Indias cricketing establishment in dumping tiring legs for fresh blood.        
	BCCI president Sharad Pawar chose the felicitation of the Australia-beaters to anoint Dhoni the undisputed boss of the cricket team and signal that age would be a factor in future selections.         
	I would like to congratulate Dhonis team, Pawar said, as the 25,000 spectators, waiting for hours at the Feroz Shah Kotla, took the cue and roared.        
	Their victory against Australia in Australia has shown that our decision to field youth was correct, Pawar said.         
	Seated next to each other, Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar looked on as the 67-year-old agriculture minister raved about the merits of youth, though his first passion  politics  was still largely a geriatric sport.        
	Pawars next statement must have dealt a blow to any dreams Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly may cherish of making a comeback to the ODI team. It is clear. Young players perform better for India, they are good for India. Bringing in youngsters also gives more people a chance to represent India, the BCCI boss said.        
	Pawar seemed to be articulating the mood of at least some in the crowd. A Delhi police constable guarding the area around the players said his vote was firmly with Dhoni and the youngsters.         
	Ganguly aur Dravid ne bahut seva ki hai par unka time khatam ho gaya hai (Ganguly and Dravid have served the country well, but their time is up), he muttered.        
	His stern face trying to mask the excitement at the prospect of seeing his idols in flesh and blood, the policeman added: Ye achchha assignment hai. Lucky hai (this is a good assignment. Im lucky).        
	Across the field from the shamiana hosting the cricketers, bank employee Gaurav Kapoor had no doubt that the victory in Australia had ushered in a team for the future. Given the way these boys played, and the steady flow of good youngsters coming in, I dont see any need for any of the older players to be brought back, said the 27-year-old Standard Chartered employee.        
	But the age argument clearly doesnt hold for Sachin Tendulkar. The focus may have been on Dhoni and youth, but the loudest cheers were reserved for Tendulkar.        
	Perhaps keen to avoid the controversy that dogged the Twenty20 reception in Mumbai when politicians hogged the limelight, officials persuaded the lanky  and now clean shaven  Ishant Sharma to move to the front row from the second. The Delhi pacer squeezed in with Virender Sehwag on a single chair.        
	The team looked battle weary after the gruelling tour Yuvraj Singh lost to the point that he forgot to collect a cheque for Rs 58 lakh from Pawar. A laughing Dhoni mockingly extended his hand out for a second one.        
	Irfan Pathan was conspicuous by his absence. Fellow fast bowler S. Sreesanth made his presence felt though, breaking into bhangra every time the deejay played a dance tune.

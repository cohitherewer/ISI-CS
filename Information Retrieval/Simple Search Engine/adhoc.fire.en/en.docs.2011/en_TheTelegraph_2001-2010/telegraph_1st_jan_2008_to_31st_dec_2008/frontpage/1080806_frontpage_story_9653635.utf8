The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamata: Tatas can stay if   Trinamul sets terms, CM rules out pullout

  Trinamul sets terms, CM rules out pullout          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	Calcutta, Aug. 5: Mamata Banerjee has declared she does not want the Tatas to leave Singur, tying her first-ever gesture of accommodation to familiar conditions the government said could not be fulfilled.         
	I am not opposed to industrialisation. That is why I dont want the Tatas to leave Singur. Instead, I am offering a solution. Let the Tatas negotiate with the state government to return 400 acres forcibly acquired from unwilling poor farmers, she told a news conference.        
	We have already identified a patch of land opposite the automobile plant where ancillary units can easily be shifted, she added.        
	The government ruled out returning the land but chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee sought to calm rising fears that the Tatas patience was wearing thin following violence and the threat of an indefinite siege from August 24.        
	Rest assured. Neither the Tatas nor the state government will withdraw from there. For the sake of the jobless youth of the state there will be not only one Singur but many Singurs to host more automobile and other manufacturing units, Bhattacharjee told a party event.        
	The statements from the two ends of the political spectrum need not mean that the storm clouds over the Singur project have lifted.        
	Mamatas seemingly placatory comment could be an attempt to appear reasonable in the face of criticism that she is against industrialisation and bent on sabotaging the small-car project on which the future of Bengals re-industrialisation has come to rest.        
	By making an unequivocal public commitment, the chief minister is also building a case that the government is doing everything possible to keep the project on track.        
	However, the fact that this is the first time Mamata has said she does not want the Tatas to leave Singur has prompted some officials to spy a thin window of reconciliation.        
	As of now, Mamata will not talk unless the 400 acres are returned  a condition that, the government insists, will kill the Singur project. The psuedo-champions of the farmers cause are now demanding the return of 400 acres. Its not possible. The small-car project would have to be abandoned if the portion of the land is to be given back, the chief minister said.                 
	Bhattacharjee said he was ready to hold discussions but not on unrealistic demands. We are ready to honour the Opposition. But dont close the path to dialogue by making illogical and unacceptable demands. We want discussion on realistic demands.        
	In response, Mamata said later: The Trinamul Congress always plays its role as a responsible Opposition and our demand for the return of 400 acres is quite justified.        
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen said he had not received any communication from the Tatas that they were thinking of pulling out.        
	Work is progressing in full swing and 75 per cent of it is over in Singur. The remaining work will be completed and the small car will roll out as per schedule. I havent got any communication or intimation from the Tatas that they will leave, Sen said.        
	The state government also despatched the home secretary to Singur  which is being interpreted as a gesture of reassurance to the Tatas and warning to potential trouble-makers.        
	Asked if her party workers would prevent employees from entering the site during the indefinite dharna, Mamata avoided a direct response. Our purpose is to lodge a silent protest. We are not bothered if employees are able to enter the factory site or not, she said.

          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                            A tiger at Corbett park                                  
	Lucknow, May 3: The fire raging at the Corbett Tiger Reserve has spread to the core area that is home to a variety of wild animals, but authorities maintained the blaze was under control.        
	Rajiv Bhartari, director of the Corbett National Park, said in the morning the flames had engulfed the southern part of the jungle, which forms the core area.        
	The odour of burnt trees hits you, he said, adding that the situation was tense. We are doing everything we can to control the blaze.        
	Bhartari said the fire in the southern area had started in pockets, but had not spread alarmingly.         
	The fire sweeping through Uttarakhands forests for about a week had so far destroyed 58 hectares of jungle within the Corbett Tiger Reserve.         
	The worst-affected areas are Bijrani, Delta, Binsar, Adnala and Sarpaduli ranges.        
	The tigers are so far safe, but there is no way of knowing how they are coping as the temperature is rising in the park. Forest officials are spraying water to keep the moisture intact, said an official.        
	Around 120 firefighters have been deployed on the Ramgangas banks between the northern part of the forest and the park.         
	The tiger reserve, in the Himalayan foothills, is spread across the districts of Nainital, Almora and Pauri Garhwal. The fire started on April 26 along the northern boundary, known as the Durgadevi gate, and spread across Mandal valley.        
	Forest officials are fighting a grim battle as the temperature is rising. Our attention is on dousing the flames, said Bhartari.        
	The officials said a resource crunch and lack of fire-fighting equipment were making it difficult to cope with the blaze, which is being fanned by winds.         
	Many tourists are cutting short their trip and have begun leaving the park.        
	The Uttarakhand forest department has launched a campaign asking farmers not to burn crop residue in harvested fields.        
	Accidental fires in isolated pockets pose a big threat as much as a carelessly thrown cigarette butt, said Ashish Tewari, project investigator, hazard-zone mapping.        
	We have mobilised non-government organisations to involve them in firefighting measures, Tewari added.

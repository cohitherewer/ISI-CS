The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Singh shifts gear with summons to ISI chief
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Singh shifts gear with summons to ISI chief
          SUJAN DUTTA                                                 ISI chief Pasha        
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: The terror attacks in Mumbai have switched on a new Pakistan policy for India, with New Delhi demanding that Islamabad despatch the chief of its military intelligence wing, the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), to share information on the killers.        
	The sharp demand made by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signals a shift of gear in a traditional rivalry with Pakistan from a defensive defence to an offensive defence. But much of this will be tempered in the weeks ahead by the US where a new administration is to take over in January. In July this year, India and the US agreed that there was an ISI hand in the attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul.         
	The two sides will work out modalities for the ISI chiefs visit which is expected to take place soon, Pakistan Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani told the media in Islamabad. Pakistans President Asif Ali Zardari also telephoned Prime Minister Singh and was reported to have extended co-operation.        
	New Delhi will now be readying to receive the chief of the ISI (Lieutenant General Ahmed Shuja Pasha), an organisation it has for decades accused of sponsoring terrorists. Even if this marks the foreign policy equivalent of setting a thief to catch a thief, in the short term, bilateral relations are headed for a sharp downward spiral that is likely to lead to a confrontation.        
	India is convinced  after the interrogation of an arrested terrorist, the probability that he is a Pakistani and from the investigations  that there is an involvement of fundamentalist outfits outside the pale of Islamabads civilian regime.        
	Pakistans visiting foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said in Ajmer: We are facing a common enemy and we should join hands to defeat the enemy.        
	This was shortly after Indias foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said: According to preliminary information, some elements in Pakistan are responsible for Mumbai terror attacks.         
	Indian officials are unwilling to share details of the investigation so far but they suggest that the co-ordinated sophistication that has marked the terrorists movements in Mumbai shows they were trained and had the resources at their disposal.        
	Indian government officials have also refrained from accusing the government in Pakistan of backing the terrorists.        
	The Indian conviction is closer to the idea expressed by US security affairs experts who believe that a global outfit like the al Qaida is using the territory and the political climate in Pakistan to launch attacks. Notably, Bruce Reidel, currently adviser on South Asia to President-elect Barack Obama, has specifically written in The Search for al Qaida about al Qaidas nexus with Pakistans ISI. French scholar-journalist Bernard Henri Levy in his book Who Killed Daniel Pearl? also delves into the relationship between al Qaida and fundamentalist outfits in Karachi.        
	This is a new, horrific milestone in the global jihad, Bruce Riedel, told The Washington Post. No indigenous Indian group has this level of capability. The goal is to damage the symbol of Indias economic renaissance, undermine investor confidence and provoke an India-Pakistani crisis, he said.        
	Indias aggressive stand in demanding the ISI chiefs presence is not prompted by the attacks in Mumbai alone but the latest wave of urban terror could be the tipping point. The policy has been taking shape specifically since the attack on the Indian embassy in Afghanistan in July that was followed by a string of attacks suspected initially to have been masterminded by a homegrown Indian Mujahideen.        
	For Pakistan, with its dual power centres in the civilian administration and the army, the implication of its readiness to comply with the Indian demand is more complex.        
	First, Islamabad has to decide whether to trust the ISI which primarily reports to the army chief but through the decades has turned into a state within a state.         
	Second, the Pakistan army and the ISI must believe that they will be able to disprove that Pakistan is complicit in the conspiracy behind the Mumbai attacks.         
	Third, the civilian administration in Islamabad is now under global pressure led by the US and the latest attack in India will strengthen its case against its military establishment.        
	A failure to demonstrate co-operation with India against terrorism, on the other hand, strengthens New Delhis case against Pakistan. It will be in a position to state that Islamabad is unable  or unwilling  to act against a global hub of terror that operates from within Pakistan.        
	At a time when Obama has said he is preparing for a drawdown of troops in Iraq and a surge on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, the downturn in relations between New Delhi and Islamabad threatens to catch Pakistan with conflicts gnawing at two and more fronts.

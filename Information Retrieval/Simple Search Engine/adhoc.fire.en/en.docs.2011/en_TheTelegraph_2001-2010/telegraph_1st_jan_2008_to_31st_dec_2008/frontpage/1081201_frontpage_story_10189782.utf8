	Mumbai, Dec 1; 01.25 PM(IST) (PTI): They came in a boat and rained the city with death while another flew in specially to donate blood for the victims of terror attacks in Mumbai. Both are from Pakistan.  
	 This is the tale of 10 suspected Lashker-e-Taiba militants and human rights activist Ansar Burney, who has been instrumental in the release of Kashmir Singh, an Indian national, besides some others from Pakistani jails.  
	 Pakistan's former Federal Minister for Human Rights and Expert Advisor in the UN Human Rights Council at Geneva, Burney, who arrived in terror struck Mumbai in the wee hours of Sunday, wasted no time in showing his solidarity with India in its war against terrorism.  
	 ldquo;They are beast of jungles and killers of humanity, rdquo; was Burney's instant reaction about the terror carnage in Mumbai that left 183 dead.  
	 Asked whether he found it ironic that he had come from the same country from where terror groups had rained death, Burney, who was leaving for Karachi, told PTI ldquo;I do not consider them from any country. They (militants) got what they had deserved and now I want their masters also to meet the same fate...for me India is as much my country as Pakistan is. rdquo;  
	 Burney went to Jaslok hospital and donated blood for the victims of the recent shoot out, an incident that changed the dimension of terrorism in India.

	Bhopal, Jan. 19: Another son has landed to join Rahul Gandhis babalog brigade, posing a challenge to Jyotiraditya Scindia, Arjun Singhs son Ajay and other satraps in Madhya Pradesh.
    
	Nakul Nath, the eldest son of Union commerce minister Kamal Nath, was introduced to local Congress leaders at a launch yesterday. The Boston University graduate mixed easily with everyone but over-enthusiastic partymen were seen vying with each other to catch his attention.
    
	Asked if he would contest the Betul parliamentary bypoll, Nakul said: It is for the party leadership and the workers to decide. I am here to serve the people and assist Rahul Gandhiji in my modest way.
    
	At an informal level, Rahul heads a group of young MPs comprising Milind Deora, Sachin Pilot, Sandeep Dikshit, Deependra Singh Hooda, Navin Jindal, Priya Dutt, Tejeshwani Seeramesh, L. Rajagopal and Madhu Goud Yaskhi.
    
	Although entry to this elite group is restricted, Congressmen feel Nakul would not have a problem given his profile and his fathers proximity to 10 Janpath.
    
	Madhya Pradesh Congressmen want Nakul to contest the April-May Betul bypoll necessitated by the death of BJP MP Vijay Kumar Khandelwal. Betul shares the border with Kamal Naths Chhindwara parliamentary seat.
    
	Kamal Nath, however, sounded cautious. I have left the decision to him. Moreover, Betul will get a reserve (tribal) seat as per delimitation commission recommendations. There is little point in representing a seat for 11 months, he said.
    
	He said if Nakul firmed up his mind, he could debut in the Madhya Pradesh polls due in November.
    
	Kamal Nath has a formidable grip in almost all seven Assembly segments of Chhindwara, so fielding Nakul would not be a problem, Congressmen said.
    
	Sources close to Kamal Nath said he was keen to induct his son into politics for various reasons. Nakul was helping him with his business in Calcutta and Manali, but he wanted him to share his political load too, they said.
    
	As commerce minister, Kamal Nath has to travel abroad almost every month. So, the work in his constituency that required deft personal handling could be deputed to Nakul in his absence.
    
	Also, Kamal Nath heads an influential group in the Madhya Pradesh Congress. But more often than not, his preoccupations in Delhi and abroad keep him away Bhopal, Jabalpur and the rest of the state. Here too, Nakul could lend a hand.
    
	The entry of Nakul in Madhya Pradesh politics is likely to intensify the power struggle in the state Congress. 
    
	Jyotiraditya, the son of Madhavrao Scindia, has been trying to expand his base and fancying himself as the next chief minister. But AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh and Union HRD minister Arjun Singh are opposed to his presence.
    
	State Congress chief Subhash Yadav recently fielded his son Arun for the Khandwa Lok Sabha bypolls. Partymen were stunned when Arun won the seat.

  - CPM brass skip birthday, but Subhas dials speaker          OUR BUREAU                            Sonia greets Chatterjee at the Speakers Delhi residence on his 79th birthday. Telegraph picture                                         
	July 25: Somnath Chatterjee celebrated his 79th birthday today, posing for a picture with Sonia Gandhi and receiving bouquets from the President and the Prime Minister.        
	UPA ministers and even a BJP spokesperson arrived at the Speakers Delhi residence to congratulate him but none turned up from among the CPM leadership, which had expelled him two days ago.        
	Several CPM leaders and members from Bengal, however, rang up to greet Chatterjee. Among them were transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, Hirendranath Ghosh from Chatterjees constituency Bolpur and RSP MLA Tapan Hore, sources said.        
	Even secretaries and ordinary members of several branch and local committees in Bolpur telephoned him, saying they wanted to stand by him. I wouldnt like to reveal their names and embarrass them, an aide said from the Speakers residence.        
	Chatterjee, however, was all business, telling Sonia and central ministers that efforts should be made to uphold the dignity of Parliament and parliamentary democracy.         
	The reference was to the ugly scenes in the House minutes before the July 22 trust vote, when three BJP members waved wads of notes saying they had been offered bribes to defy the party whip. Sources said the Speaker would soon act on their complaint, which the Lok Sabha secretariat officially received today.        
	Sonia, who spent about 15 minutes at Chatterjees Akbar Road bungalow, handed him a bouquet and posed for a snap with the Speaker and his family. President Pratibha Patil spoke to him over the phone and sent flowers, as did Manmohan Singh who had dropped in yesterday.        
	Many hotels, such as the Oberoi and Le Meridien, sent complimentary birthday cakes.        
	The Speaker appeared happier than he usually is, parliamentary affairs minister Vayalar Ravi said after meeting him. Among the other ministers who came today were Meira Kumar, Ram Vilas Paswan, Kapil Sibal, Raghuvansh Prasad and Pawan Kumar Bansal.        
	Other arrivals included deputy Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal, the BJPs Ravi Shankar Prasad, and Samajwadis Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh.        
	Ravi later told Malayalam TV channels that Indian communists were following the Russians, known for killing their politburo members (in Stalins purges). He was reacting to RSP general secretary T.J. Chandrachoodans statement that Chatterjee should have been expelled earlier.        
	Saifuddin Chowdhury of the Party for Democratic Socialism, who too had been expelled by the CPM, called Chatterjee before leaving for Calcutta this afternoon. I greeted Somnathda over the phone and wished him a long life. I congratulated him for his brilliant performance as Speaker.        
	The phone calls from Calcutta included several from Congress and Trinamul Congress leaders.        
	Chatterjee called up his Calcutta residence this afternoon to ask about elder sister Sabita Ganguly, admitted to hospital with various ailments.

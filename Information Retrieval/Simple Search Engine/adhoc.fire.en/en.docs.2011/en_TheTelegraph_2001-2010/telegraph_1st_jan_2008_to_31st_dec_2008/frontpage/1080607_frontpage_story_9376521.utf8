                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Indians jailed for 350m fraud
          AMIT ROY                                                    (From top) Virendra Rastogi, Gautam Majumdar and Anand Jain         
	London, June 6: The tale of a bent Bengali has unfolded at Southwark Crown Court in London where Gautam Majumdar, 55, of Archbishop Avenue, Chennai, was sent to prison yesterday for seven and a half years for his part in a Pound350million fraud.        
	Majumdar pretended to know nothing about the fraud though it was his responsibility to raise money from banks in the UK and the US.        
	But Judge James Wadsworth QC said it was clear that he was so good at your job you would not have dealt with this company unless you fully understood and knew the system within which you were working.        
	His partners in crime, Virendra Rastogi, 39, the ring leader of the plot to trick banks out of billions of dollars, and the latters right-hand man, Anand Jain, 42, of Nether Street, North Finchley, north London, received nine and a half years and eight and a half years respectively.        
	Rastogi, who was chief executive RBG Resources, essentially a bogus metal trading group, was frantically shredding incriminating documents when police raided his luxury apartment in Portman Square, Mayfair, in central London.        
	The court heard that the audacious scam, which involved persuading trusting banks to lend money to an empire of imaginary metal, stretched from Mayfair to the poorest areas of India.        
	The victim banks include: JP Morgan Chase amp; Co, Fleet National Bank, PNC Bank, KBC Bank, Hypo Vereins Bank, Dresdner Bank Lateinamerika, China Trust Bank, and General Bank.         
	It remains to be seen what damage this case will do to the reputation of corporate India, especially in the City of London where Indian businessmen are increasingly making their presence felt.         
	All three rogue traders were convicted at an earlier trial of one count of conspiracy to defraud between January 1, 1996 and June 1, 2002.         
	Rastogis US-based brother, Narendra, who testified against him at the trial, is already serving a seven-year sentence in America after admitting his involvement.        
	Judge James Wadsworth described the fraud as a crime of the utmost gravity.         
	Over the years, the banks were induced by your falsehoods to advance literally billions of dollars of trades that did not exist in any real sense, the judge commented.         
	The judge told Rastogi: You, like your brother in the USA, were the architect and the manager of the fraud. Your brains made it as large as it became.         
	He added: Throughout this trial all three of you denied any responsibility for the loss... and the defence of each of you was that, while you accepted the fraud was going on all around you for years, each of you were sublimely innocent of any involvement or knowledge. The jury rejected that.        
	He also said: It is very clear that, right up to the moment of the verdict, you showed no shred of regret or remorse or repentance for the crime committed or for the damage each of you did.        
	He continued: It is true there was no loss to individuals but the loss to the banking system and the damage done to it was enormous.        
	The judge told the men that while he accepted their families had suffered enormous damage and sorrow... this has arisen not out of a moment of madness or stupidity but out of years of calculated dishonesty.        
	The judge added that Rastogi would be disqualified from being a company director for 15 years, while Jain and Majumdar would each receive 10-year bans.        
	Richard Latham QC, prosecuting, said Rastogi came to Britain to start his companys London-based arm and support the pre-existing fraud he and his brother ran in America. In fact the UK operation ended up overseeing the whole of the Rastogi empire.        
	RBG did not turn into fraud  it was established as a fraud and indeed lasted as a fraud throughout its life, said Latham. It was run with a sophistication which meant many employees were blissfully unaware of the dishonest reality underpinning the business.        
	Britains Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecutions, will now focus its efforts on confiscating cash and other assets that Rastogi may have stashed in India and other locations, perhaps using a network of family trusts.        
	According to the Financial Times, the collapse of RBG Resources in 2002 stunned financial institutions who believed they were lending to a successful metal trading company. In reality, RBG was trading with a global web of sham companies that were paid to pose as legitimate customers, propped up by reams of fabricated documents.        
	The paper said: Investigators traced the address of one of RBGs purported counterparties to a cow shed in India, while another was actually a launderette in New Jersey.        
	During the eight month trial at Southwark Crown Court, it was stated that Rastogi hid behind a veneer of respectability, boasted an exclusive corporate address in Londons Piccadilly and pretended he was worth a vast amount.        
	But he and his co-defendants and largely unsuspecting staff created a very complicated edifice of deceit with an incestuous web of 324 client companies.        
	But the businesses, supposedly with multi-million pound turnovers, were simply sham operations in small flats and shops with few assets beyond a table and chair.        
	With the help of headed notepaper and company stamps for each shell trader, a complex paper trail of bogus orders, deliveries and accounts was created to use and abuse the trust the industry relied on.        
	As the financial world increasingly saw RBG as a highly successful international metal trader with an annual Dollar1billion turnover, bank cash was pocketed in ever larger amounts.        
	At one point Rastogis apparent wealth even put him on the Sunday Times Rich List, and his company was so respected that Jack Cunningham, a former Labour cabinet minister, and three peers, Lord Holme, Lord Woolmer and Lord Gray, were among his unsuspecting advisers.        
	The fraudsters managed to avert suspicion by systematically clearing loans with even bigger borrowings until thefts mushroomed into nine figures. But a simple mistake  one of RBGs flunkies pressing the wrong button on a Hong Kong fax machine  triggered the operations downfall.        
	A PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) auditor in Romania became suspicious when six documents, ostensibly from client companies in three countries, came down the same phone line.        
	Investigators found that, altogether banks, in America and the UK had been conned into lending several billion dollars, although the circular movement of monies meant Pound343.5 million had actually disappeared.         
	Much of it was laundered through Dubai and Switzerland, with at least Pound40 million believed to have been sent to India.         
	None of the money has been recovered.        
	After the case, Claire Shaw, case controller for the SFO, said: This was a truly audacious and ruthlessly efficient fraud that ranged from the poorest areas of India to the corporate tower blocks of Manhattan.        
	She added: The RBG Resources empire was a family business founded and driven by fraud. The successful prosecution of this case required a huge and technical analysis by the SFO team that unravelled the truth behind the facade and demonstrated to the jury the full extent of the defendants dishonesty.

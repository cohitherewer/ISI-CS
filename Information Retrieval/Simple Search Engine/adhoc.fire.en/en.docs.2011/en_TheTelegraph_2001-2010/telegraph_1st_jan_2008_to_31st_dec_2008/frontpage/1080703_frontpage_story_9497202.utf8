	London, July 2: It is unthinkable that she would make a fashion faux pas. So when Vogue editor Anna Wintour made her third appearance wearing the same dress in the space of a fortnight, observers could only conclude she was making a style statement.         
	The dress was especially modified for Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue, is so attached to this floral shift dress by US designer Carolina Herrera that she appears determined to give it a repeat airing.         
	She first wore it for Milan Fashion Week on June 22 as she perched in the front row of the Salvatore Ferragamo show. Five days later, Wintour was sporting the dress at Wimbledon, where she took up a seat in the Royal Box to watch her favourite player, Roger Federer, on Centre Court.         
	Finally, fashion watchers were startled to see the dress making yet another outing at Paris Fashion Week, this time accessorised with statement jewellery and sunglasses during the Karl Lagerfeld show for Chanel.         
	The dress, from Herreras resort collection, has been modified especially for her.         
	And if the most powerful woman in fashion is happy to recycle her wardrobe, then it must be all right for the rest of us. Wintour is known for her impeccable sense of style. According to fashion legend, she rises each day at 5.45am for an hour-long tennis lesson, followed by a blow-dry to ensure her signature bob doesnt have a hair out of place.

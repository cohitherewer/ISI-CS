          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Children search for coins offered by devotees during Kartik Purnima in the Bindu Sagar pond, Bhubaneswar, on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 13: The stampede tragedy two years ago on the occasion of Kartik Purnima still fresh in mind, the Puri district administration today made elaborate arrangements to ensure smooth passage of devotees thronging the Jagannath temple in thousands.        
	With devotees in lakhs visiting the temple early in the morning for Kartik Purnima, the administration had made three exit points to avoid rush in the sanctorum. Thirty platoons of police were deployed at the temple. As many as 140 sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspectors, 20 inspectors and an additional superintendent of police were pressed into service on the temple premises. Besides, four rapid action force teams and 300 homeguards had been kept on alert. Bomb squads and sniffer dogs were also pressed into service, said Puri superintendent of police Asit Panigrahi.         
	Manning the crowd at the temple on the Kartik Purnima day had never been an easy job for the district administration. The officials had task cut out to avoid any untoward incident like the November 4, 2006 stampede.         
	On the Kartik Purnima day two years ago, thousands were waiting near the Panda Dwar (the door to the sanctum sanctorum) to get in for darshan (glimpse) of Lord Jagannath. The stampede occurred when the closed Panda Dwar was suddenly opened and the waiting devotees rushed to get in. Four persons were trampled to death and several others were injured. The Justice P.K. Mohanty Commission set up by Orissa government is continuing with the probe into the stampede deaths and the verdict is expected soon.         
	This time round, the administration made adequate arrangements for hassle-free darshan of the deities. Barricades were erected and people were sent inside the temple in a queue.         
	Kartik Purnima bears a lot of religious significance for the people in Orissa. It marks the end of a month-long brata during which devotees eat vegetarian food. Widows and old women eat just once a day during the brata.         
	Besides, Kartik Purnima is also an occasion to commemorate the glorious maritime trade history of Kalinga (name of ancient Orissa). The traders of Kalinga used to start their sea voyage to Indonesia and other south-eastern countries on this day. To commemorate the history, miniature boats made of paper and banana tree trunks carrying earthen lamps were set afloat in water bodies at several temples across the state. The ritual called Boita Bandana (homage to boat) symbolises the prayer offered by wives of the merchants to the boats before they sailed off.

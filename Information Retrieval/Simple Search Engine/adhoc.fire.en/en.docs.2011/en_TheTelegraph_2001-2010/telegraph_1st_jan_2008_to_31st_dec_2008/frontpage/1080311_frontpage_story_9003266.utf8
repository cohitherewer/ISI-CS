	Ranchi, March 10: Work at the state secretariat continued to remain paralysed on Monday even as the state government was left grappling for a solution to the four-day-old stalemate over Grade IV staffers demanding higher payscales and a host of other benefits.         
	The Madhu Koda government is in a fix. For if it accepts the Grade IV employees demands, it realises it could open the floodgates to more protests  last weeks self-immolation bid at the secretariat by two employees was the beginning.         
	The Grade IV staff are demanding Rs 6,500-10,500 payscales and have gone on a wild-cat strike at the state secretariat ever since.         
	Incidentally, school teachers after being granted assured career growth plan are entitled to Rs 5,500-9,000 payscale, police jawans get Rs 4,000-6,000 payscale, even panchayat sevaks, block agriculture officers and head clerks after being granted second ACP benefits get Rs 5,000-8,000 payscale.         
	Only section officers are in the Rs 6,500-10,500 payscale that, too, after being allowed second ACP benefits.        
	Till three months back, the deputy collectors were in the Rs 6,500-10,500 pay scale. If we accept the demands of the Grade IV staff, we cannot afford to ignore the remaining two lakh employees of different categories. There is sure to be more protests, said a senior official at the chief ministers secretariat.         
	While deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi was holding negotiations on behalf of the government, Chief Minister Koda expressed his hope that an micable soulution could be arrived at.        
	But Koda has questions of his own. How they set themselves on fire needs to be examined. My government has always been committed to improving the working conditions of employees, but we will never succumb to such pressure tactics. Their justifiable demands will be accepted, said Koda.        
	As expected, the secretariat could not function today. Chief secretary A.K. Basu was confronted by a deserted Project Bhavan with all departments under lock and key. Nepal House, too, was hit.

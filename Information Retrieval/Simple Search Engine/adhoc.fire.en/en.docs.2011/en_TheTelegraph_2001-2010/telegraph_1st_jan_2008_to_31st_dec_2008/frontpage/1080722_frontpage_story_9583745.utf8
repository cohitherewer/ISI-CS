	New Delhi, July 22: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee was forced to adjourn proceedings in the Lower House on the second and final day of a special session called to discuss and vote on a confidence motion moved by the UPA Government, after the opposition stalled proceedings.  
	 Chatterjee took the decision to suspend proceedings till 2 pm after opposition Members repeatedly disrupted attempts by Congress MP from Amethi Rahul Gandhi''s speech in the House.  
	 Tuesday''s debate in the House began smoothly, but thereafter the proceedings descended to what the Speaker referred to as quot;shameful quot; acts of indiscipline.   
	 In a clear expression of his frustration over the developments, Chatterjee said in an anguished tone: quot;The time has come for the politicians to go to the electorate. Let the electorate, let the people see how their representatives are behaving in this house, let them decide who will represent them. quot;  
	 Ahead of the trust vote, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reiterated that his UPA Government would win. quot;I am confident that the government will win the trust vote, quot; he told media persons.  
	 Bharatiya Janata Party MP Somabhai Patel has said that he will vote for the UPA in the trust vote later this evening. Talking to reporters outside Parliament, he said he would work for the Congress party in future, as he is disillusioned with the BJP.   
	 The Samajwadi Party Member of Parliament Atiq Ahmed has also said that he would vote against the government.  
	 Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh arrived in Parliament House today showing ''V'' as a sign of victory. He exuded confidence to win confidence vote in the Lok Sabha.   
	 Latest figures suggest that the UPA alliance has 272 MPs, that''s one more than the halfway mark in the House as of now. The United Progressive Alliance is 222 and their partners are holding together as well.

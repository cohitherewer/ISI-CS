The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maya mutiny missile hits SP   Siddiqui switch sends shiver down UPA
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Maya mutiny missile hits SP     Siddiqui switch sends shiver down UPA
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             Shahid Siddiqui enters Mayavatis Delhi residence on Saturday. (Prem Singh)                                       
	New Delhi, July 19: The UPAs trust bid is turning into a tantalising obstacle run as the political churn throws up unexpected foes and formations to trip it in the final lap.        
	High-profile Samajwadi Party general secretary Shahid Siddiqui stunned the field today, walking across tense battlelines to shake hands with BSP boss Mayavati, who is now being feted by the Left and the UNPA alike as spearhead of a re-invigorated third front.        
	Siddiqui is a Rajya Sabha member and has no bearing on the trust vote. Neither did he make any overt claims of walking out of the Samajwadi Party at the head of a rebellious herd. But as a Muslim voice of conscience and editor of the countrys largest circulated Urdu weekly, Nai Duniya, his strong denunciation of the nuclear deal and of the Samajwadi Party could have a domino effect on heartland MPs nervous about being aboard a sinking ship with elections so close.        
	The Congress pulled a brave face over its rising anxieties about mustering enough numbers, and the Samajwadi Party feigned to dismiss Siddiquis move as inconsequential, claiming its Lok Sabha team would vote unitedly for the government.         
	Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadavs allegation, though, that Mayavati was indulging in horse-trading with crores of rupees betrayed the partys nervousness over keeping its flock together till the trust vote. Another of his MPs  old and personal loyalist S.P. Baghel from Jaleshwar in Uttar Pradesh  today declared he would vote against the UPA because the nuclear deal is against the interests and sentiments of Muslims who are my partys main base.                  
	Siddiqui struck a similar note to justify his desertion. I have been suffocating in the SP all this while, Siddiqui said standing by Mayavati at her residence this afternoon. The nuclear deal is against the national interest and against the interests of Muslims, it is an affront to the sentiments of my community and now I have come out openly to fight it.        
	Siddiqui wasnt the only bad news for the UPA on a day that its political managers struggled to secure parliamentary comfort. Potential allies that UPA number crunchers are banking on kept the ruling alliance in painful suspense. H.D. Deve Gowdas JD-S (3), Ajit Singhs RLD (3) and Omar Abdullahs National Conference (2) are all teasing commitment, despite entreaty, reward and the promise of more.         
	Shibu Sorens JMM, officially still a constituent of the UPA, is proving equally hard to get. Three of Sorens five MPs are learnt to have fallen behind the government but Soren himself has not said yes yet. Late evening he gathered all his MPs around him and announced he would go to the UPA dinner being hosted by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow. But Congress managers are still unsure whether he would bring his vote to the dinner table.         
	Soren has got no known assurance on his demand for one-and-a-half berths in the Manmohan Singh government, nor a guarantee that he will be anointed Jharkhand chief minister at the expense of Madhu Koda.         
	But even though the Congress core committee plainly stated yesterday that no cabinet expansion was planned before or after the trust vote, the window of hope was kept open for Jharkhands Guruji.         
	Highly placed government sources were less categorical about expansion prospects today, saying there were no plans as of now. In todays fluid, and desperate, political situation, that is a flexible rather than a rigid position.         
	Late evening, amid speculation that more MPs were likely to drift away from the UPA than join it, the alliances top crisis managers gathered at Pranab Mukherjees residence to take stock and effect measures to get the numbers right. Among them were the RJDs Lalu Prasad, the DMKs T.R. Baalu, Ram Vilas Paswan and Sharad Pawar. Could more sops be on the way to woo support?         
	Nobody was too sure, despite pious declarations from the government and the Congress that they were in no mood to stoop to wheeling-dealing in order to save the government.        
	The news filtering into the emergency meeting wasnt good. Sitaram Yadav, the RJD MP from Sitamarhi in Bihar, was reported to have met JD-U leaders and promised them support. More MPs of the Samajwadi Party appeared shaky. There was no accretion in numbers from the undecided MPs. As one harried Congress leader had put it earlier in the day: This is as frustrating as trying to weigh frogs in scales, you put one in and two jump away.         
	The edginess in the UPA was betrayed in the comments of even such cool and hardboiled customers as Lalu Prasad. Annoyed by their collective failure to ensure a majority as the trust vote neared, Lalu Prasad railed against friend and former comrade A.B. Bardhans allegation that MPs were being offered as much as Rs 25 crore by the UPA. He should either substantiate his statement or apologise for such defamation, Lalu Prasad said of his former mate. Bardhan has done great harm to the institution of Parliament and parliamentarians, history will never forgive him.         
	Parties ranged against the UPA, meanwhile, marshalled their forces in a resolute bid to bring the government down. The BJP prevailed upon a reluctant Akali Dal to issue a formal whip. The Shiv Sena finally decided to vote with the NDA despite its support to the nuclear deal.         
	And the BJP itself made arrangements to ferry even its ailing members to the Lok Sabha by Tuesday, the likely day of the vote. These include the frail Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Dharmendra, who is convalescing in a Los Angeles hospital, Harischandra Chavan from Malegaon in Maharashtra and Mahesh Kanoria from Patan in Gujarat.         
	At the other end of the political spectrum, the Left galvanised efforts to make CPM leader Prakash Karats rhetorical dare of making the nuclear deal impossible to achieve a reality. Bardhan and the Andhra duo of Chandrababu Naidu and Chandrashekhara Rao (TRS) undertook daylong roving missions to a string of political ports of call in their efforts to consolidate the anti-government vote --- Deve Gowda, Ajit Singh, unsure MPs in the Samajwadi ranks.         
	The most important of them, though, was Mayavati, who netted the prize of the day in Shahid Siddiqui and shivered the Samajwadi Party with the prospect of a split.

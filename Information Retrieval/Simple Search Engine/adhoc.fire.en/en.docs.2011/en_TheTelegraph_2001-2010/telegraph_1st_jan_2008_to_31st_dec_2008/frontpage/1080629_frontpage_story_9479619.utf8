                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Obama will have to beg for support, says Clinton
          TIM SHIPMAN AND PHILIP SHERWELL                            Bitter Bill                                  
	New York , June 28: Bill Clinton is so bitter about Barack Obamas victory over his wife Hillary that he has told friends the Democratic nominee will have to beg for his wholehearted support.         
	Obama is expected to speak to Clinton for the first time since he won the nomination in the next few days, but campaign insiders say that the former Presidents future campaign role is a sticking point in peace talks with Hillary Clintons aides.         
	The Daily Telegraph has learned that the former Presidents rage is still so great that even loyal allies are shocked by his patronising attitude to Obama, and believe that he risks damaging his own reputation by his intransigence.         
	A senior Democrat who worked for Clinton has revealed that he recently told friends Obama could kiss my ass in return for his support.         
	A second source said that the former President has kept his distance because he still does not believe Obama can win the election.         
	Clinton last week issued a tepid statement, through a spokesman, in which he said he is obviously committed to doing whatever he can and is asked to do to ensure Senator Obama is the next President of the United States .         
	Obama was more effusive at his unity event with Hillary Clinton yesterday, speaking fondly of the absent former President, who attended Nelson Mandelas birthday celebrations in London instead.         
	The candidate told the crowd: I know how much we need both Bill and Hillary Clinton as a party. They have done so much great work. We need them badly.         
	But his aides said he has so far concentrated on cementing relations with Hillary Clinton first. They say they are content to let relations with Clinton thaw gradually.         
	It has long been known that Clinton is angry at the way his own reputation was tarnished during the primary battle when several of his comments were interpreted as racist.         
	But his lingering fury has shocked his friends. The Democrat told the Telegraph: Hes been angry for a while. But everyone thought he would get over it. He hasnt. Ive spoken to a couple of people who hes been in contact with and he is mad as hell. Hes saying hes not going to reach out, that Obama has to come to him.

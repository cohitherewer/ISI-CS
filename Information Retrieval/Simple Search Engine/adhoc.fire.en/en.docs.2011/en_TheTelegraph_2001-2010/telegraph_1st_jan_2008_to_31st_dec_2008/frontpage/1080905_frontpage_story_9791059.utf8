          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 4: Expect the pujas to be free of power cuts.        
	Power minister Mrinal Banerjee today said there would be no power cuts in the festival season ahead, saying he had been assured of an improvement in coal supplies  in quality and volume  to power plants from September 8.         
	This has raised hopes of an increase in generation, which has fallen since June because of wet and slushy coal after heavy rain in Asansol and Ranigunj, home to most mines. The problem that started with poor quality coal deepened later when the overall amount supplied also dwindled.        
	We have told the coal authorities that something has to be done as three state-run units (in plants) have been shut down because of coal shortage, Banerjee said after a meeting with power, coal and rail officials here today.        
	One unit each at Sagardighi, Kolaghat and Bandel plants, generating 550MW, are closed because of the coal crunch.        
	Over the past three months, the CESC power plants in Calcutta have been running with coal stocks of only two days. Normally, the reserves should be enough to last over a week.        
	It was decided at todays meeting that the plants would get 50,600 tonnes of coal daily from September 8 against 27,000 tonnes now. From the third week of September, we have sought a daily supply of 53,000 tonnes. If we start getting 50,600 tonnes daily, we can step up generation to 2,435MW, said S. Mahapatra, the managing director of West Bengal Power Development Corporation, which controls the state-run plants.        
	Calcutta and the rest of Bengal have suffered long power cuts over the past three months, with shortfalls ranging from 300MW to 900MW. The peak demand now is 4,600MW. The state-run plants generate 1,900MW at present.        
	Banerjee asked the CESC to minimise local faults, which caused blackouts even when there were no shortfall.

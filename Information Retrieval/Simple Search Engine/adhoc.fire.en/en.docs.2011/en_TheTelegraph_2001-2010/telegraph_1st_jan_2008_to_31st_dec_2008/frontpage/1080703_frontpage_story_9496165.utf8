	Bhubaneswar, July 2: IT giants like Infosys, Genpact and MindTree want the state capital, an upcoming IT hub in the country, to plan its expansion at least 15 years ahead to prevent it from being saddled with a Bangalore-like situation.        
	Seventy per cent of the IT industry is based in six-seven cities, which have become overcrowded. They cant be the fulcrum of growth in future, said Pramod Bhasin, the president and CEO of Genpact.        
	Bhubaneswar has a tremendous potential to become a major IT hub in the country, said Bhasin, adding his company, a pioneer in the BPO industry, was going to set up a centre in the city next year and had already hired 300 personnel.        
	But tier-III cities like Bhubaneswar should plan at least 15 years ahead to escape the Bangalore situation, he said while addressing Orissa.IT2008, an information technology event here today.        
	The government should ensure development of infrastructure like air connectivity, world-class healthcare and education, he said.        
	Infosys CEO Kris Gopalakrishnan said India was growing faster than the US in terms of employment, adding 2 lakh IT professionals every year. But the growth in IT sector in future would not be possible in mega cities. It takes two to three hours for an average IT professional to commute which is a productivity loss, he said. The alternative for the IT companies is to move to tier-II and tier-III cities, he added.        
	Infosys was a pioneer in setting up an IT centre in Orissa 12 years ago, where more than 4,000 professionals have been employed. The IT major has exported software worth Rs 650 crore from the Bhubaneswar centre last year.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik urged all the IT companies to consider Orissa as their next destination for expansion and investment and assured them required facilitation and support.         
	My government has put in place a progressive ICT policy that has been instrumental in bringing bigger IT companies to the state besides nurturing the growth of local industry and our own entrepreneurs, he said.

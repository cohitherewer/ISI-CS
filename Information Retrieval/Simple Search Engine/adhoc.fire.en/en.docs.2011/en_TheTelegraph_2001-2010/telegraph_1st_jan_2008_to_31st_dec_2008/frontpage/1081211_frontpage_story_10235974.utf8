  - In Srinagar, no-poll campaign overwhelms campaign for it          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             A protester at an anti-election rally near Srinagar. File picture                                        
	Srinagar, Dec. 10: The battle for the heartland is done, but the crown, rumbled afresh by Mumbais unfolding aftermath in Muzaffarabad across an invisible line not too far away, remains to be taken.         
	The headlines have been grabbed by events elsewhere this past fortnight, but all that while Kashmir has been lumbering through an engrossing, even epochal, election.         
	Never have Kashmiris been beckoned to the polling booths in such depths of winter. Never have they turned out in such numbers. Past four rounds of voting, the turnout hovers close to an astounding 60 per cent; Kashmiris perhaps remain the most astounded by the manner in which theyve beaten both the boycott call and the bad weather.         
	But were the Kashmir elections a prize cake someone wished to claim, theyd most likely find a spoiler void gaping in the middle of it.         
	Srinagar, surely the centrepiece of this extended enactment  an unprecedented six weeks, no less, from start to finish  is all set to burn through the high icing of percentages the rural voter has put on it and leave the prize a little spoiled.         
	A fortnight ahead  Srinagar is slated to vote on Christmas eve  the field has already begun to thicken with would-be claimants of the ballot; those that would hand the mandate are, as ever, trenchant in rejection.         
	Election? snapped a young woman hurrying across the afternoon bustle of Gawakadal to beat the dusk and cold, You mean aafat (nuisance), what about it? Just how many times do you want to keep testing our patience? Account for the 80,000 the army killed, then well talk.         
	Not unusual in downtown Srinagar, a teeming labyrinth of rusted roofs and shuttered timber-work that sprawls away on both sides of the woefully choked Jhelum. This has always been the secessionists loyal turf  home to Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and Yasin Malik, and to the majestic Jamia Masjid, their clarion fortress whose high domes ring with the aspirational sighing of generations of Kashmiris.         
	Slapped roundly across the Valley, Srinagars downtown is where the Hurriyats boycott call is likely to receive a salve, a poultice of rejectionist protests it badly needs in order to remain alive and kicking.         
	There are enough of them erupting every day to ensure the Hurriyat a ledge of hope  a mob pelting stones at a passing poll caravan in Idgah, boys tearing down banners that had been strung up in Batmaloo by dark of night, a cannonball of naysayers exploding out of the Zainakadal mosque post prayers, a lusty fire on the Bohrikadal bridge that has consumed a rag-tag effigy simply labelled Indian Election a chortling gang of boys is slaking itself to warmth in its embers.         
	Thats the story of the campaign getting under way in Srinagar  its been baptised in riotous refusal. Truth to tell, the campaign against elections in downtown Srinagar has already overwhelmed the campaign for it. And on poll day, the capital may well go the way of the two other urban centres that largely shunned the vote  Sopore and Baramulla.         
	It does not matter what party or which candidate it is; each and any one is good  or bad  enough to be targeted. They are objects of scorn, even, on the odd occasion, of violence. These politicians have done nothing for the people other than getting them killed, says a shopowner in Amirakadal, How and why do they expect us to rejoice around them and vote? Murderers, money-makers, nothing else!         
	Its early days yet, but the portents of the Srinagar poll  or non-poll, if you will  are already in place. A senior government official tasked to oversee elections in the capital strikes a despondent note over odds that such fiery resistance will subside over the next four weeks.         
	Unlikely, he says, because it hasnt gone away in decades. They have a reputation to keep in downtown areas and with the rural voters turning out in higher numbers phase after phase, the pressure on them to prove their point will be greater. Theyll try to ensure even uptown areas are overshadowed by their temper, nobody wants to risk their lives for a vote.         
	Other than Mr Candidate and his closest kin, you arent likely to run into anyone in these parts whos willing. But where is Mr Candidate himself? Nowhere other than on the nomination papers as yet.         
	Its an impressive array of suitors that Srinagar has gathered for its eight Assembly seats, make no mistake about it  Farooq Abdullah, former and would-be chief minister from the Dal-side constituency of Hazratbal and the posh Sonwar seat, PDP veteran Tariq Ahmed Karra from trouble-ridden Batmaloo, former National Conference minister Ali Sagar from Khanyar in the belly of downtown, businessman and Omar Abdullah crony Nasir Sogami from Amirakadal. His opponent there isnt short on links and lineage either  its Muzaffar Shah, son of Gul Shah, former chief minister and estranged brother-in-law to Farooq Abdullah.         
	None of them, though, has bothered venturing out; theyd probably be able to put a fine explanation on their absence from the trail at the moment  too early, there are elections in other parts to be attended to. But it couldnt be they dont already have a measure of the hostility they face.         
	They are busy gathering around themselves not flocks of the faithful but additional layers of security. More bullet-proof cars and more armed guards in them, more helmets and bullet-proof vests.         
	One candidate who would not be named was disarming in his admissions: Frankly, I fear going out to woo people who I know would much rather spit on my face. They dont want this election but we want their votes. Even a few will do in a low poll, and they can be managed without too much campaigning out there.         
	Management, not canvassing, is the magic word in Srinagar  it is a one-day undertaking and it means ferrying your voters to the polling station and depositing them safely back; the one who ferries most will get past. That can be managed from the backrooms; the street, and all its perils, can be avoided. People are angry, admitted a National Conference worker, They are not in a mood, so why spend money campaigning, why take risks?         
	The angrier the people get, the more threatened the candidates feel. The more threatened they feel, the more securitymen they summon around them. The more the securitymen, the angrier the people. Electioneering in Srinagar is already lodged in a vicious whirl that has flung the people and their representatives further apart. Its consequences can only look like a hole in that prize cake.

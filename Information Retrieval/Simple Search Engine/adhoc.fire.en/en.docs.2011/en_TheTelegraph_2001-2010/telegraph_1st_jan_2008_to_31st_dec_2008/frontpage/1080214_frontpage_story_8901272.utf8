                                                                                                           4 killed in molasses morass
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Raiganj, Feb. 13: Four men working in a cattle feed factory here died today and another fell ill when they entered an underground tank half-filled with molasses and kept shut for over a month. The workers are suspected to have inhaled methane gas, produced when molasses ferment.         
	Jitendranath Dutta, the owner of Naaf Dana, has been arrested. He said the management was not responsible for the deaths.         
	It was an accident. We always ensure workers safety. The deaths have saddened me though the management is not responsible for it, said Datta, who is the president of the Raiganj Merchants Association.         
	The 20-year-old factory is located along NH34 in Goalpara. The molasses, which is mixed with corn meal and coarsely grounded wheat to produce cattle feed, was stored in the 22ft deep tank (See graphics).         
	If figures of the accumulated and sold stocks are to be believed, at least 10ft of the tank was filled with molasses.        
	One of the factory workers, Ratan Dey, who is also an eye-witness, said for the past one month, the manufacture of cattle feed had been suspended because of a shortage of molasses. Yesterday, around 11.30am, we were asked by the management to check the quantity of molasses remaining in the underground tank, Dey said.        
	Today, it took 10 workers to open one of the two hatches. Although there was a stench, Bhabesh Barman slid down a ladder into the tank.         
	When Bhabesh did not surface even after 10 minutes, Uttam Sarkar went in. When he, too, did not emerge, Montu Baske and Ashis Bala went down to investigate, Dey recalled.        
	When none of the four responded to frantic calls from those waiting on the edge of the hatch, Dey along with another worker, also called Uttam Sarkar, tried to peer into the tank with a torch, but it was too dark to see anything. We could smell the foul stench. As Uttam went down a rung or two, he seemed about to topple. But this time we were alert and caught him by the shirt. We pulled him up and he slumped to the floor, said Dey.        
	The fire brigade was called and men in gas masks entered the tank and dragged out the four men.         
	Sources at the district hospital said Bhabesh and Uttam had been pronounced dead on arrival while the other two expired 10 minutes after they were admitted.         
	Bidhan Sarkar, a high school chemistry teacher here, said molasses when they ferment produce methane gas, which is very toxic.         
	The gas must have accumulating in the tank for the past one month, Sarkar said.        
	North Dinajpur police chief Swapan Banerjee Purnapatra, who visited the spot, said the inside of the factory was poorly ventilated. If there was proper ventilation, the fatalities could have been avoided, he said.        
	The police said one of the dead was from Shilpinagar here in town while the others were from Sonapur in the Itahar police station area.         
	Civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee, who is the CPI MLA from Itahar, said he would see to it that the families of the dead workers got compensation.

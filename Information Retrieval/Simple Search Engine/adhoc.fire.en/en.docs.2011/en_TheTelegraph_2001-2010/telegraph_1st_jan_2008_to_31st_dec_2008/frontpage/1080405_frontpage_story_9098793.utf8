The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Price bandh on April 21
                                                                                                           Price bandh on April 21
                            
	April 4: Inflation has vaulted to a three-year high, prompting Mamata Banerjee to prescribe her usual medicine: Bengal bandh.        
	The Trinamul Congress and the SUCI have called a 12-hour state bandh on April 21, a Monday, against the price rise.         
	The spurt in inflation to 7 per cent has largely been fuelled by vegetable and cooking oil prices. Vegetable prices rose by nearly 5 per cent in a week. The Centre said it would ask states to crack down on hoarding of commodities.        
	Rules recently activated allow states to set limits on food supplies traders can stock.

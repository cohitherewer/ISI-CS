  - SRK lands super-exclusive suite set aside for Oprah at Dubai hotel party          OUR BUREAU                            Actress Priyanka Chopra at the Atlantis launch. (Reuters)                                        
	Nov. 21: This was one passed over object of desire Shah Rukh Khan is unlikely to have objected to: an almost Rs 20-lakh per night suite which was to have been Oprah Winfreys but became his.         
	The Bollywood superstar was among the 2,000 of the worlds rich and famous who were flown to Dubai on Thursday for the launch of the Atlantis Palm Jumeirah, a 1 billion (Rs 80 billion) mega-resort built on a man-made island shaped like a palm tree in the Persian Gulf.         
	At a time when recession, bailout and pink-slips are part of everyday lingo, there was little sign of parsimony as the organisers rolled out the red carpet  and presumably the cash as well  for the one-night party. The cost of the freebie of the century, according to Londons Daily Mail, was a mere 20 million, or Rs 160 crore.         
	No one paid for an air ticket and the travel bill itself was estimated to be 3 million (Rs 24 crore), the paper said. Guests ranged from filmstars Robert De Niro, Charlize Theron, Denzel Washington, to musicians Janet Jackson and Shirley Bassey and sports legends Michael Jordan and Boris Becker.         
	And if its Dubai, it has to be Bollywood: besides Shah Rukh, actresses Rani Mukerji and Priyanka Chopra and movie mogul Yash Chopra rubbed shoulders with local royalty.                     
	Atlantis Dubai, a pink maze of arches that looms large on the citys skyline, includes an aquarium boasting 65,000 sea creatures, including sharks, eels and rays, a water park and a priceless sculpture made of 3,000 hand blown pieces of glass.        
	The hotels signature Bridge Suite, which features floor-to-ceiling views of Dubai, costs over 25,000 (Rs 20 lakh) a night. With such a select crowd at Atlantis, some will stay on for four days, there were issues over who would put up where.        
	Oprah, a role model for women in West Asia whose talk shows have the highest ratings in the Gulf among English language programmes, was allotted the super-exclusive suite suspended between the resorts two towers.         
	But when she pulled out of the party, the honour of spending the first night went to King Khan, who owns a resort on the Palm Islands and is said to be keen on the property business in the Emirates.         
	The superstar pipped the likes of acting great Robert Di Niro  a partner in the Nobu restaurant chain which has a site in the resort  and Oscar winner Charlize Theron, who had to make do with lesser suites.                   An aerial view of the Atlantis resort. (PTI)      
	The highlight of the night was a gig by Australian singer Kylie Minogue and her 113-strong dance troupe on the beach. The Mail reported that the performer was paid 1.5 million (Rs 12 crore) for a 10-song 45-minute medley of her hits, which works out to some 33,333 (Rs 26.66 lakh) a minute. Besides, she got a free holiday as well.         
	As the clock struck midnight, the sky exploded with a fireworks show of 100 computer-guided rockets costing 7 million (Rs 56 crore), seven times bigger than the largest display to date: that for the Beijing Olympics. More than a million fireworks were launched in about 10 minutes from over 700 locations as the merry band of the bold and the beautiful cheered on.        
	Most were in happy spirit, aided undoubtedly by the approximately 1,000 bottles of Veuvre Cliquot champagne, which the Mail says was needed to wash down 1.7 metric tonnes of lobster, 4,000 oysters, 3,000 kg of smoked salmon and 5,000 portions of sushi.         
	But the devouring of wealth has raised a few eyebrows even in well-heeled Dubai, which too is feeling the pain of the global financial crisis. Prices of real estate on the much-vaunted Palm Jumeirah are plummeting.         
	Its not the perfect timing to open a 1-billion resort. On the other hand, we dont build something like this with the short-term in mind, said gaming and resort magnate Sol Kerzner, chairman and chief executive officer of Kerzner International, who made his name building South Africas Sun City.        
	I believe Dubai will come to be one of the top destinations in the world.        
	Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates, the worlds fifth largest oil exporter, kicked off a regional real estate boom when it opened the sector to private investment in 2002.

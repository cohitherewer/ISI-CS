          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 30: Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi last night sent a two-page letter to Mamata Banerjee requesting her to agree to talks. A copy was sent to the chief ministers home.        
	The governor expressed concern at Mamatas health and asked her to come to the negotiation table soon, a Trinamul source said.        
	Mamata, who had in the afternoon denied receiving the letter, said tonight it had reached her. I shall reveal the contents at noon tomorrow after discussions with my allies, she said.        
	We may join talks while continuing the dharna, said her aide Purnendu Bose. A CPM leader said: The government is ready to sit with the governor and Trinamul.

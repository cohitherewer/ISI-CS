                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Blast kills 4 in city on edge 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 3: Four lives were lost and limbs strewn around in an evening explosion in north Calcutta, putting back on edge a city grappling with hoax terror threats and false alarms for the past few days.        
	But police scrambled to calm fears, ruling out a terrorist link. They said an ordnance shell that had washed up in a rag-pickers net might have exploded while being prised open.         
	The blast in Jyotinagar  a row of shanties along the Hooghly  killed three-year-old Shaqib Sana, ragpicker Deedar Molla (18), his cousin Ramzan Molla (19) and Hasan Sardar (50) who had stepped out of his scrap shop and got caught in the explosion at 6.05pm. Six persons were injured.        
	It is purely an unfortunate accident. The deceased and injured are rag-pickers who were sifting through their days collection. They were trying to break open a shell to extract its metal part, he said.        
	A forensic team was yet to visit the spot but the police chief said explosives stashed inside a one-foot-long shell exploded under pressure.         
	The scenes that followed the blast were all too familiar in the aftermath of the Bangalore and Ahmedabad bombings. Hasina Bibi, who lives in Jyotinagar, recounted how body parts were strewn around. I had seen little Shaqib playing just five minutes before the blast, she said.        
	Asked how rag-pickers could find an explosives-packed shell in a city on high alert, the police commissioner said it could be from the Cossipore Gun and Shell Factory, 100 metres away. The shell may be a discarded one.        
	S. Ghosh, an ordnance official, said: We always discard the shells inside the factory premises. Shells stashed with explosives are not supposed to go outside.        
	The police have learnt that Deedar and Ramzan had taken a boat ride in the morning and the shell was part of the catch in their fishing net.

  - Camaraderie in Shillong, fight in Delhi        OUR BUREAU                                          
	Shillong/New Delhi, March 11: An emotional Purno A. Sangma today spoke of the joy of returning to the Meghalaya Assembly after two decades, but his mind may have often wandered to New Delhi where hotshot lawyer Soli J. Sorabjee moved the Supreme Court against the governors decision to invite the Congress to form the government.        
	This is like a homecoming. Some have said that I will go back to national politics after a few months but I want to dispel this notion and that is why I have resigned as Tura MP, the former Lok Sabha Speaker said.         
	The presence of sons Conrad and James, both making their debut in the Assembly, turned the swearing-in almost into a family event for the Sangmas.         
	There was camaraderie, too, belying the political rivalry that has intensified after the elections. Chief minister D.D. Lapang sat beside old ally Donkupar Roy of the United Democratic Party, now siding with Sangmas Nationalist Congress Party. Many would have been wondering what the duos animated conversation was all about.        
	The NCP-led Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA) had paraded 31 legislators before Governor S.S. Sidhu, but he followed convention and called Lapang instead  the Congress is the largest single-party with 25 legislators  to form the government.         
	Lapang has 10 days to prove his majority, though it is anybodys guess how he will do it with the Congresss regional partners in the previous government becoming part of the NCP-led alliance.        
	In New Delhi, Sorabjee filed a petition on Conrad Sangmas behalf, challenging Sidhus decision. A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan admitted the petition and said it would take up the case tomorrow.         
	The petition names the Union cabinet secretary, the Meghalaya chief secretary, the governor and Lapang as parties to the case. The governor, in spite of being convinced about the strength of the legislators of the MPA, and ignoring the fact that they have an absolute majority in the newly elected Assembly, decided to call the Indian National Congress to form the government, it states.         
	This decision, the petition contends, is a clear breach of the provisions of the Constitution of India and the convention of calling a group/alliance having the majority of legislators to form the government.         
	Sidhus decision was based on the fact that the MPA is a post-poll alliance and cannot be given precedence over the largest single party. But the petition argues that the invitation to the Congress to form the government was actually an invitation to the INC to indulge in horse-trading and other unconstitutional means to survive the floor test.         
	The petition describes post-poll alliances as a reality the world over and perfectly legitimate.        
	Sangma said the MPA had built a favourable case and hoped the courts verdict would be in its favour.         
	To counter the MPAs move, the Congress today formed Meghalaya United Alliance (MUA) at the meeting of the 25 party legislators and three Independents at Lapangs residence.         
	The chief whip of the Congress Legislature Party, Charles Pyngrope, said that after the formation of the MUA, Lapang was entrusted with the task of negotiating with the regional parties to get them to the MUA fold.                           
	The NCP leader announced almost immediately after the election results were declared that Roy would be the chief minister for the first two-and-a-half-years if the alliance formed the government.        
	The NCP party has 14 seats and the UDP 11. The Hill State Peoples Democratic Party has two and the Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement and the BJP one each. There are five Independents. The one seat that remains to be decided is Baghmara in the South Garo Hills. Polling was countermanded after the death of the sitting legislator and will be held on March 22.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, Oct. 11: Dispur today announced a CBI probe into the incidents of violence at Udalguri and Darrang and said a particular group of people had instigated the carnage.        
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi announced the probe after visiting the two districts where 55 people were killed, 111 injured and more than 2,500 houses were damaged, affecting over two lakh people.        
	Lt Gen. V.K Singh, GOC, Eastern Command, today made an aerial survey of the affected areas in the two districts. GOC, 4 corps, Lt Gen. B.S. Jaswal accompanied him.         
	Senior army officials at Hatigarh in Udalguri briefed Gen. Singh about the developments. He directed the army personnel to take an apolitical approach towards the issue and co-operate with the civil administration to restore peace and normality in the riot-hit areas.        
	Curfew was relaxed in Udalguri district for eight hours today, with the situation slowly returning to normal.        
	Gogoi said the government would not rest till the guilty persons were brought to book. The real culprits would be dealt with a firm hand, he said, irrespective of their language, religion and community.        
	We will ask the CBI to probe the incidents and find the guilty people, Gogoi said.        
	Government spokesman and health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the inspector general of police, B.J. Mahanta, had started another probe into the alleged hoisting of a Pakistani flag at Mohonpur in Udalguri district.        
	Prima facie evidence suggest that it was the handiwork of a particular group of people that was desperate to malign the image of the government, Sarma said.        
	While pointing the needle of suspicion towards a particular section backed by political rivals, Sarma said the so-called Pakistani flag was, in fact, tailored by a non-Muslim group.         
	The flag was hoisted in a Bodo-dominated area and that too, after two days of violence. It was nothing but a evil design to malign the image of the government, he said.        
	The chief minister said the violence spread because of criminals who wanted to exploit the situation to grab land.        
	He said though the situation was brought under control, there was a sense of insecurity among the inmates who are staying at various relief camps. There are over two lakh people in the relief camps at present.        
	Gogoi said he had assured the people of full security and had requested the Centre for more paramilitary forces.         
	We have asked for 21 companies of paramilitary forces, of which 14 have come. The seven other companies will arrive soon, he said.        
	The chief minister said village defence parties, along with police personnel, would keep round-the-clock vigil in the villages from now on.        
	There may be more trouble during the harvesting season, we are not taking any chances, he said.        
	The chief minister said the priority at present was to instil peace and harmony among various communities in the affected areas.         
	We have advised the people to form peace committees with leaders from all communities. We have also requested the Asam Sahitya Sabha and Bodo Sahitya Sabha to visit the areas to spread the message of peace and harmony, he said.        
	The chief minister said, We will not tolerate any organisation or individual making provocative statements liable to promote hatred between communities.         
	The AASU leadership today asked Gogoi to take immediate action against the people who had unfurled the Pakistani flag in Udalguri a few days ago.

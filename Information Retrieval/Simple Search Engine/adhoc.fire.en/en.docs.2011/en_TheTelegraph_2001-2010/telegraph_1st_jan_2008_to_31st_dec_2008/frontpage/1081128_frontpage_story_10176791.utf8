          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                                        Salaskar, Kamte                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 27: The three officers who fell to militants in Mumbai last night were each a police star but deeply unlike one another in temperament and methods.        
	The soft-spoken Hemant Karkare, 54, was an engineer by training and a sculptor by hobby, a stickler for rules and fair investigation under whom the states terror investigators unearthed one Hindu bombing plot after another.        
	Vijay Salaskar was an encounter specialist  a breed not known for sticking to copybook methods  who shot dead 70-odd gangsters but was transferred for a while when his team came under suspicion of having mafia links.        
	The tall Ashok Kamte was a bundle of opposites His fit, muscular build and trademark beret  rather than a senior police officers khaki cap  gave him the look of an army commando. And sure enough, he too had taken part in many encounters, earning a reputation for daring.        
	Yet, what he stood out for was his coolness of mind and this led him to be trained as a negotiator. And it was this skill, always in demand in a hostage situation, that explained his presence with Karkare and Salaskar before the Cama and Albless Hospital last night.        
	Three militants had sprayed bullets at commuters at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus before entering the hospital. When the gunfight began, all the three officers were wearing bullet-proof vests  of the kind that leaves the sides of the torso unprotected.        
	Karkare, shown on TV wearing a light blue shirt, dark trousers and a helmet, talking continuously on his cellphone, took three bullets in the neck. Salaskar too was hit in the neck. As the militants tried to escape, a further exchange of gunfire outside the nearby Metro Adlabs multiplex saw Kamte getting shot in the head. The entire 35,000-strong force mourned for three of its best officers today.        
	Karkare, former colleagues said, had followed an unusual career course, getting a BTech in mechanical engineering from Nagpur in 1975 and working as a marketing executive with Hindustan Lever before joining the IPS in 1982.        
	He battled Naxalites during his 1991 posting in Chandrapur, where he developed the hobby of making driftwood sculptures. He had some 150 such sculptures, some of them displayed in his office.        
	After tackling drug traffickers and white-collar criminals in Mumbai, he joined spy agency RAW where his work during the IC-814 hijack earned him a posting in Vienna where he spent nine years working on secret missions.        
	He returned a couple of years ago as joint commissioner (administration) but his skills in terror intelligence-gathering were too precious to be wasted. Last January, he was appointed anti-terrorist squad (ATS) chief.        
	Known as a copybook cop for conscientious adherence to every norm, Karkare was deeply pained by the accusations of torturing Malegaon suspects, officers said.        
	Karkare cracked the blasts in Panvel, Vashi and Thane theatres, arresting Hindutva activists of the Sanatan Sanstha. State police, earlier accused of targeting Muslims after every blast, soon had Malegaon to point to.        
	Kamte had followed his father Marutrao, an inspector-general of police, into the force. He did the family name proud as deputy commissioner of Solapur, when he became a hero among residents.        
	A cop that turned Solapur from a wrong city to the right one. The person who every responsible Solapurkar liked and loved, writes one of the 400-odd fans on his Orkut profile.        
	Salaskar made last nights team because of his reputation as a gung-ho encounter specialist. The college teachers son had broken the back of the Amar Naik gang by killing the don himself in 1997, then helped bust Arun Gawli by gunning down many of his henchmen.

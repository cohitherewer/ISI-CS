          AMIT ROY                                                                 (From top) The Victorian fort; a gun room turned into a luxury hotel room; the atrium that reportedly offers 360-degree views and Harmesh Pooni                                         
	London, March 8: An Englishmans home, they say, is his castle but in an unusual case, it is a 42-year-old Indian, Harmesh Pooni, who has barricaded himself inside a seaside Victorian fort following a dispute over ownership.         
	Pooni has been leading a solitary existence inside the No Mans Land Fort, which stands in the Solent between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, in an effort to stop the sites administrators, KPMG, from taking possession and selling off the property for an asking price of 4 million to recover alleged mortgage debts.         
	But now, as the dispute is set to go to the high court, Pooni claims the property is still legally his and he is staying put  though he admits he is lonely living away from his wife and four children on the mainland.         
	The fort is mine and no one else has the right to sell it, he declared defiantly.         
	He added: I have a young family and being away from them is heartbreaking, but its something I feel I have to do. How long can I stay here? As long as it takes.         
	He is holed up in the forts old lighthouse, surviving on rations topped up by occasional visits to the mainland.         
	The fort was certainly built to withstand invasion, but from Napoleon across the waters in France. Constructed between 1865 and 1880, it had living quarters for 80 soldiers. Later, it was used to string a submarine net across the Solent, while in the Second World War it housed anti-aircraft crew trying to bring down German flying bombs.         
	Pooni, a property developer from Birmingham, bought the fort, which had once been owned by the defence ministry, for 6 million in 2004. By then, it had already been converted into a hotel.         
	He promoted his fort as a unique wedding venue for anyone prepared to spend up to 20,000.         
	The promotional literature boasted: Offering seclusion and security combined with pure luxury and high quality standards, it is an ideal location for those wanting to keep away from the prying eyes of the media. A stunning location and total privacy aside, the fort can provide a complete wedding package tailor-made to suit the individual occasion. From the initial enquiry to the honeymoon, everything can be arranged to ensure a stress-free occasion.         
	Disaster struck when he contracted Legionnaires disease when the water in the forts natural well became contaminated. The business was shut down and his backers, Lexi Holdings, went bust apparently owing 100 million.         
	Lexis administrators, KPMG, claimed they owned the fort and have put it on the nk, the estate agent.         
	Pooni, who retains the only set of keys, has blocked the helipads by lashing down upturned tables to stop helicopters landing, while notices in the windows, which were once hatches for the forts 49 cannons, warn trespassers will be prosecuted.         
	KPMG has taken him to Portsmouth county court seeking an eviction order. A judge has so far refused to grant it and the case will now go to the high court.         
	Pooni said: I just sit up in the lighth ouse and look at all the lights on the shoreline and hope that the legal situation can be resolved in my favour. But KPMG wont even talk to me.        
	It is just as well Pooni is not scared of ghosts though he conceded: Its very spooky at night.

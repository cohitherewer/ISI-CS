          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             The Rajasthan Royals celebrate after receiving the trophy on Sunday. Picture by Gajanan Dudhalkar See Sport                                        
	Mumbai, June 1: Yusuf Pathan just cant stop celebrating his discovery of T20 cricket and the Indian selectors discovery of him.         
	A blustery 45 and three wickets in the semi-finals two nights ago. Tonight, an audacious 56 and another three wickets to lift the IPLs cheapest franchise to dearest prize and kitty  the inaugural trophy and Rs 4.8 crore in cash.         
	The leagues most expensive team  the Mumbai Indians  did the hosting at the DY Patil stadium; they gave away the dinner boxes and took a few front seats, not much more.         
	At last, after two rank capitulations at Wankhede, a contest of cricket in Navi Mumbai. At half time, Aamir Khan stood up in the glass-fronted presidents box to applaud Mahendra Singh Dhonis late-over surge that powered the Chennai Super Kings to 163  not an impossible ask of the Rajasthan Royals by any reckoning, but decidedly a demanding one.         
	By the end, the pulse had pushed him to the edge of the rails in an open box with Sachin Tendulkar for company. He may have been thinking this was latter day Lagaan  an underdog team triumphing over pre-tournament topdogs in a last-ball finish. Only, the prospects for the losers werent as dire; Dhonis men merely earned a slightly lighter purse.         
	But pulsating as it was, this was no clash of champions, more a menagerie match-up. A mean score of 163, scratchily notched and messily chased. The two teams were level-pegging through the evening, mediocrity keeping up with mediocrity over for over, run for run all the way to the final delivery. No run hurricane, no wicket cascades, no sterling turns bar the one by Yusuf Pathan, who launched four towering sixes. But then IPL audiences had got fairly used to that.         
	If the T20 format is framed for batting excess, the two semis and the final match of the IPL have mocked at that billing. All three have been games claimed by men whose business it is to challenge the bat. The first semi-final was a destruction job by Shane Watson and Munaf Patel. The second was set up as a dud by Makhaya Ntini and Manpreet Gony, whose rapier line cut the fancied Punjab batting to ribbons.         
	Tonight, the Super Kings batted as if haunted by bad collective memory of what the hurled ball could reduce them to  not a batsman was prepared to open arms and unleash flair, not even Dhoni, although he got 29 off 17.         
	Pathan struck a power 50, but run your eyes down the rest of the Royals scorecard. They lost seven men chasing a fairly modest total to fairly ordinary individual performances. Only five wickets fell in the Super Kings outing, but that didnt mean they had walloped the attack. Batsmen on both sides looked tentative and unsure, none came remotely close to dominating.         
	True enough, more than 300 runs were scored tonight but the story lay in how painfully they were got.         
	As the IPL has progressed, the bowlers have well and truly pushed their way into what was meant to be a batsmans realm and claimed their place. Team scores and economy rates have declined, wickets claimed have burgeoned. At such rate that midway through the league, the organisers were shamed into matching the Orange Cap for highest run-getter with a purple one for claimant of most wickets. Perhaps fittingly, the championships winning runs were struck by Sohail Tanvir, holder of the Purple Cap.         
	And fittingly, again, Yusuf Pathan opened his run to renown with the ball, not the bat, in hand. It was he who began the Super Kings slide.   
	Entertainment Quotient   
	 Not a patch on the inaugural at Bangalore, despite being home to Bollywood, despite Salman. No central stage, too many of them littered around the ground. Too little light. The starlets mdash; Dia Mirza, Shamita Shetty, Amrita Arora, Sameera Reddy mdash; did two-minute jigs. Salman didn rsquo;t stay   much longer. He seemed merely to have come to give his upcoming 10 Ka Dum show a puff. Even with a paraglider and lasers thrown in, this felt more like a   haphazard vaudeville than a   choreographed ensemble  
	On-ground Experience   
	 Too far out of town, but once you get there, the DY Patil stadium has its compensations. Neat three-tiered stands, separated by wide alleys. The main pavilion is a standalone, leaving enough room at   the sides to air the park. The DY Patil stadium is a toddler compared with the Eden but it offers the   Calcutta legend much to learn and benefit from  
	Star Quotient   
	 Low, considering this   was the final match. The   Bollywood fizz suddenly seems to have oozed   out with the star-backed teams gone. Even so, there were Sachin and   Anjali Tendulkar, Aamir Khan, Mukesh and Nita   Ambani, Farooq Abdullah   and Praful Patel

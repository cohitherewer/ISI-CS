	Who are the three idiots in Bollywood? Shah Rukh Khan, Salman and me, Aamir Khan told his fans in New Delhi on Sunday.        
	The actor turned a barber, giving the Ghajini cut to several fans, but it was all for good friend Shah Rukh. I am promoting Shah Rukhs film, Billo Barber, he said cheekily, before asking the ladies in the crowd: No one from the girls wants the Ghajini haircut? I want to cut the hair of a girl.         
	My character (in Ghajini) suffers from a short memory. So, he keeps forgetting my dialogues on the sets troubling my director. I was so engrossed in the character, you see, Aamir joked. My next film, Three Idiots, will have me playing an idiot with Sharman and Madhavan, but Shah Rukh Khan, Salman and me are the three idiots of the film industry.         
	Asked about Shah Rukhs alleged claim of being the No. 1 in the business, Aamir could not resist taking a dig. People who are No. 1 dont state the obvious. For me, Amitabh Bachchan is No. 1. Does he ever claim about it? Does Lata Mangeshkar claim about it?

                                Pitt and Jolie                            
	Nice, July 13 (Reuters): Actress Angelina Jolie has given birth to twins, a boy and a girl, her doctor at a hospital in southern France said today.        
	Oscar winner Jolie, 33, had the twins by caesarean section yesterday evening at the Lenval hospital on the glamorous Promenade des Anglais waterfront drive in Nice. Actor Brad Pitt, the twins father, was believed to be at her side.        
	The girl, named Vivienne Marcheline, weighed 2.27kg while her brother, Knox Leon, weighed 2.28kg. Marcheline was the name of Jolies mother, also an actress, who died of cancer last year.         
	Newspaper Nice Matin reported that the couple had sold exclusive rights to the first photographs of the twins to an unnamed US magazine for $11 million and would give the money to charity.

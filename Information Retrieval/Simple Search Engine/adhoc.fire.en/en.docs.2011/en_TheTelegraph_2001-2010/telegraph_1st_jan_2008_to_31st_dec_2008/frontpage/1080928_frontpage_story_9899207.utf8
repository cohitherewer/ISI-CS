  - Alert after Dhubri killings        OUR BUREAU                                     
	Dhubri/Guwahati, Sept. 27: A letter found on one of the seven suspected Huji militants killed by the army in Assams Dhubri district yesterday reveals that the group was sent as part of a bigger design to avenge the alleged oppression of Muslims in the country.        
	Dispur has set up a special police unit to foil any attempt by the outfit to carry out terror strikes in Guwahati, following army claims that the suspected militants were planning to strike in the city.         
	Army sources in Dhubri said the letter, written in Bengali, was addressed to Salam by the commandant of the Kurigram district unit of the Bangladesh-based Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami (Huji). The writers name was not legible.         
	The letter alleged that the condition of Muslims in India was worsening since the demolition of Babri Masjid and the condition of the community in Kashmir was going from bad to worse because of oppression by the Indian government.         
	We will have to teach Hindustan a lesson and for that you are requested to send more trained and motivated persons (read militants) to India, the undated letter added.        
	The sources said the person from whom the letter was recovered could be the commandant of the Hujis unit in Bangladeshs Kurigram district that borders Assams Dhubri district.         
	An army intelligence official, who is examining the documents recovered from the suspected militants, said most members of the group had been camping at the border villages for quite some time. A few of them had joined the group recently.        
	Bus tickets of Bangladesh travel agencies show their date of travelling as September 20, 21 and 22, clearly indicating that some of them had sneaked into Dhubri district two or three days ago to join the group, he added.         
	Dhubri superintendent of police Partha Sarathi Mahanta said no one had claimed the seven bodies kept at the Dhubri Civil Hospital. If they remain unclaimed for 72 hours, the police will perform the last rites.        
	We have preserved samples for DNA and other tests which might be required for investigations later, he added.        
	Dispur, meanwhile, is not taking any chances, especially with Durga Puja around the corner. The special police unit formed to tone up intelligence gathering, patrolling and search operations comprises officers who have served in the city recently, have a good police record and a proper knowledge of the areas in and around Guwahati.         
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi today admitted that Assam was under threat from fundamentalist forces given its proximity to inimical neighbouring countries, especially Bangladesh.

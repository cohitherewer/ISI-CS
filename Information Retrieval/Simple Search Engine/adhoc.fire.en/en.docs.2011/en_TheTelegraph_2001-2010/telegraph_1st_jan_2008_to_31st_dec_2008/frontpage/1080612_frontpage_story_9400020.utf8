  - Report to be submitted in six months           A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, June 11: Assam and Meghalaya today decided to constitute a co-ordination committee to resolve the dispute over Lampi (known as Langpih in Meghalaya), a hamlet located on the inter-state boundary.         
	The decision was taken at a meeting, attended by Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi and his Meghalaya counterpart Donkupar Roy, here this evening.         
	Emerging from the meeting, Gogoi said the talks were held in a very cordial atmosphere. The two states agreed to mutually hammer out solutions to their border disputes on the basis of the constitutional boundary drawn in 1976, which demarcates the jurisdiction of Kamrup district in Assam and the adjoining Khasi and Jaintia Hills district in Meghalaya, he added.         
	Gogoi appreciated Meghalayas willingness to resolve the dispute on the basis of constitutional boundary. He said the boundary dispute with Nagaland had become complicated because of Kohimas stand to resolve it on the basis of history.         
	It is good that Meghalaya agreed that the basis of the solution to the boundary problem between the two states should be constitutional boundary, the Assam chief minister said.         
	The Meghalaya chief minister was accompanied by a posse of officials. Chief secretary Ranjan Chatterjee, director-general of police Bijoy Dey Sawian and two of his cabinet colleagues, deputy chief minister S.H. Lyngdoh and health minister Adgiser Pariong, were among those who accompanied him.         
	Gogois delegation included border minister Gautam Roy, health and family welfare minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, chief secretary P.C. Sarma and home commissioner Rajib Bora.         
	The dispute over Lampi had snowballed recently after the Assam government undertook development work there. Gogoi said the issue had magnified because of a communication gap between the two states. The meeting decided that while maintaining status quo in the area, both the states should carry out development there after giving prior information to the other state.         
	We will not prevent Assam from carrying out any development activity there. We will also take up development programmes in the area, Roy said after the meeting. He added that he was satisfied by the outcome of the meeting.         
	The coordination committee has been asked to submit its report within six months. It comprises the chief secretaries of the two states, officials from the Survey of India and revenue departments of the two states and the deputy commissioners of Kamrup and West Khasi Hills districts, R.C. Jain and F. Kharlyngdoh respectively.        
	On the basis of the report, the two states will try to iron out their differences at the chief ministerial level.         
	Gogoi said after the Lampi dispute was settled, similar coordination committees would be constituted to find solutions to all other pending border issues with Meghalaya.         
	There are 12 disputed border areas between the two states, sources said.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 10: The Congress claimed today that the days of the UPA government in Jharkhand were numbered but chief minister Madhu Koda was unperturbed.         
	While the AICC member and in-charge of the partys affairs in the state, Ajay Maken, said the days of giving ultimatum to the Koda government was over and the Congress would soon unseat it, the chief minister was busy mobilising his supporters in Hatgamharia. He also addressed a conference of the Ho community there.         
	Even as Koda told The Telegraph at the state hangar in Ranchi that he was tired of giving replies to Makens allegations and wanted to concentrate on his work, the Congresss threat to topple the state government continued.         
	The days of giving ultimatum to the Koda government is over now. We shall now act against this non-performing government, said Maken, who was in the city today to take part in a social function organised by Punjabi-Hindu Biradri.         
	Congress, claimed Maken, had already started talks with two major UPA partners  JMM and RJD  about the imperative need to get rid of the Koda government in the state. It has made it clear to the RJD and JMM that it would not hold any dialogue with the Independent ministers in the states UPA government even as the latter were opposed to the Congresss scheme of things. The leaderships of both these parties feel that the Koda government was doing a descent job.        
	Maken exuded confidence that the Congress would be able to convince its two alliance partners about the necessity to pull down the Koda government. They will appreciate our stand and back it, said the AICC functionary.         
	Maken said the decision on toppling the government was getting delayed due to a few factors. First, an expansion would take place in the Union cabinet and JMM is keen to get a ministerial berth. Secondly, the budget session is on the cards and the UPA leadership wants to ensure that the session passes off smoothly.        
	These issues are inter-linked with the Jharkhand issue. So, the removal of the Koda government is taking little time, Maken said.

	Bhupendra Krishna Ghosh was inspired to organise the All Bengal Music Conference by the Allahabad Music Conference, which was in turn organised by his friend Dakshinaranjan Bhattacharjee, the then vice-chancellor of Allahabad University, in 1932-33. After he returned to Calcutta, Bhupenbabu strongly felt that a ticketed concert open to all on the lines of the Allahabad soiree should be started in Calcutta too.
    
	He expressed his wish to his neighbour at the other end of Pathuriaghat, Raja Prafullanath Tagore of 1 Darpanarayan Tagore Street. The two shared a brotherly relationship and the Raja urged Ghosh to give shape to his idea without hesitation.
    
	Bhupenbabu turned his wish into reality, and the All Bengal Music Conference, which was opened in 1934 by Rabindranath Tagore in the Senate Hall, became a big hit with the public. 
    
	Almost overnight it became an all-India phenomenon and classical musicians from all over the country considered themselves lucky to perform in these concerts. Although the Conference continued only till 1953, with a break in 1946 during the Great Calcutta Killings, it has in public memory gained the stature of a legend. It is thanks to soirees such as these in those times that Calcutta gained the reputation of being the cultural capital. The city had witnessed an efflorescence of the arts then. 
    
	Bhupenbabu died in 1941, and his eldest son, Manmatha Nath Ghosh, who stood behind his father to realise his dreams, continued to hold the Conference, although towards the end he was forced to cut corners. Manmathababus birth centenary was celebrated on December 13, 2007, in his residence at 46 Pathuriaghat Street with a concert with Amaan Ali Khan on the sarod and Sabir Khan on the tabla. This concert was the tribute of Smita Ghosh to her father-in-law, Manmatha Nath Ghosh.
    
	Both the musicians had been performing at this address for three generations. Amaan was preceded by his grandfather, Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan, who had lived there for a long time, and subsequently by his father, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. Sabir Khan was preceded by his grandfather, Masit Khan, and father, Keramatullah Khan.
    
	As in many stately homes of those times, 46 Pathuriaghat Street extended its patronage to musicians from all over India long before the Conference was even thought of. The magical music rooms hung with portraits of legendary musicians on the first floor of this almost 300-year-old building provide evidence of the familys love of music.
    
	Both Omkarnath Thakur and Faiyaz Khan enjoyed their hospitality. When Vishnu Digambar Paluskar sat down for riyaz early in the morning, Gyanendra Prasad Goswami would pick up the entire exercise simply by eavesdropping. In a room upstairs, Omkarnath would kick up a storm with his profound taans.
    
	Both Faiyaz Khan and Bade Ghulam Ali Khan were close to Manmatha Ghosh. Bade Ghulam Ali would drop by in a taxi just for a chat and keep the cab waiting. Jayanta Nath Ghosh, Bhupenbabus youngest son, writes in his reminiscences how even after the post-Partition riots, Bade Ghulam Ali had come from Pakistan for the Conference held at Sri cinema. 
    
	In 1953, when Bade Ghulam Ali began performing accompanied by his suramandal at Rangmahal theatre before the crack of dawn, the doors of the hall were thrown open, and his voice could be heard all over. The audience would not allow him to stop but he concluded it by standing on his feet and reciting the hymn Hari Om tatsat. People were sitting outside on the road on newspapers and the tram service had stopped although the sun was shining bright. 
    
	When Bhupenbabu was on his deathbed, the Ustad sat on a carpet and sang for him. During Tagores illness, arrangements were made by Bengal Telephones to relay the concert of Kesarbai Kerkar, the highest paid musician known for her haughtiness. The poet bestowed on the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana prima donna the title of Surashri.
    
	In 1947, Ali Akbar Khan and Ravi Shankar with Allauddin Khan sitting in between performed in unison, while Ravi Shankar also had a solo performance accompanied by Therakuwa on the tabla at Minerva.
    
	Smriti Mitter, now in her 80s, is a daughter of the neighbouring house of Khelat Ghosh at 47 Pathuriaghat Street. Both houses, however, had a common paterfamilias in Ramlochun Ghosh. Mitter, now a widow at her sprawling palace in Shyampukur, says although she was a child in 1934, she remembers the sensation the Conference had created. 
    
	Bhupenbabu listened to music on the radio, while Damodardas Khannah (Lalababu) would get in touch with the musicians Ghosh fancied. Omkarnath Thakur taught Bijan Ghosh Dastidar Ramdhun that Mahatma Gandhi loved. Vishnu Digambar Paluskar chanted Rams name one lakh times during his stay at Bhupenbabus home. 
    
	The women of the zamindar families would occupy the boxes or the ladies seats. The All Bengal Music Competition was meant for youngsters and Meera Bandopadhyay, Sandhya Mukherjee and Bani Tagore were some of the talents who were discovered.
    
	Rai Bahadur Keshab Banerjee, a zamindar of Dhaka who played cricket and was a competent tabla player, used to bring child competitors from Chittagong. 
    
	It is heard that ego clashes among all these musical greats were a regular feature and scholarly arguments would break out among the participants. Manmathababu was often called upon to pacify them.
    
	Damodardas Khannah had later begun the All India Music Conference.
    
	After the demise of the All Bengal Music Conference, Manmathababu wanted to start another organisation, says Kanai Lal Basu, a veteran journalist. It was named Suresh Sangeet Samsad after the musicologist Suresh Chakrabarty. It began in 1967-68 with Mukul Chandra Chakrabarty and Kanai Basu as its joint secretaries, and Manmathababu as its president. Manmatha Nath died on January 12, 1983.
    
	The money collected from ticket sales was donated towards hospital beds for ailing musicians. It was the first soiree with a Rabindrasangeet Day, and music was used as a medium of national integration. Special days were designated for each state in the various geographical zones of the country. It used to be held at Rabindra Sadan. In 1972, the Bangladesh freedom struggle was celebrated through an orchestra conducted by Timir Baran, which was sponsored by Asoke Kumar Sarkar, editor of Anandabazar Patrika.
    
	Once Birju Maharaj was billed as the star but when he announced that he was too ill to come, the audience became wild. But when Roushan Kumari was announced as a substitute there was a standing ovation. 
    
	There have been recent attempts to revive the All Bengal Music Conference at Khelat Ghoshs residence. However, the close relationship that earlier patrons enjoyed with the great musicians and the homely atmosphere of these Conferences would be difficult to bring back.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nagaon, Feb. 19: Four employees of a cement company were gunned down and two injured by suspected Dimasa militants at a mining site near Umrangsu town of Assams North Cachar Hills district today.         
	Police said seven persons, suspected to be militants of the Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dima Halam Daogah (DHD), reached the limestone mining site owned by Vinay Cements Ltd around 11.30am and opened fire at the companys workers there.         
	We initially thought they were army personnel as they were in fatigues. But after they reached us, they opened fire indiscriminately. Some of us somehow managed to escape by running towards the jungle, one of the survivors told the police. He said the militants shot the workers from a close range and left immediately.        
	Before leaving, the militants torched two Maruti Gypsies of the company parked at the site.        
	The personnel manager of the Umrangsu unit of Vinay Cements, S.K. Binda, said no senior official of the company was present at the site at the time of the attack.         
	The seniormost person present was foreman Arabind Chauhan.         
	He escaped unhurt, but was in a state of shock and had to be hospitalised.        
	Kumar Lama, 32, Anup Pradhan, 40, Toyab Ali, 40, and Ram Bardhan Sanar, 49, were shot dead.         
	Dilip Singh and Rajesh Rangfar were admitted to Nagaon Civil Hospital in a critical condition.        
	Rangfars condition is very critical. Singhs left leg has been badly hit by bullets, Binda said.        
	The outfit has served several extortion demands on the company and has repeatedly asked it to quit mining in the area.         
	The group abducted the companys senior mining manager, R.S. Thakur, in October 2006. He was released after four months, allegedly on payment of ransom.        
	Most of the senior officials of the company left after Thakurs abduction. Who will work at such risk to life? an employee asked.        
	Todays attack comes on the heels of Neepco resuming work in its powerhouse in the district last week on Dispurs assurance of security.

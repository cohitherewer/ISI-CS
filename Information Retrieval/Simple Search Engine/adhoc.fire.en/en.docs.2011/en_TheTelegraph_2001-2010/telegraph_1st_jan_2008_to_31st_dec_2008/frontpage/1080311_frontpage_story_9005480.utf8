The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Office email wastes time 
                                                                                                           Office email wastes time 
          OUR BUREAU                             Broken tool                                  
	New Delhi, March 10: Emails may have joined cigarettes and runs for coffee as the latest threat to workplace productivity. A new study has shown that emails take up huge amounts of work time.         
	The average employee now spends an estimated 90 minutes to two hours a day wading through hundreds of messages, much of which is basically span and junk mail, the study by The Radicati Group, a company tracking worldwide trends in email, Web services, wireless technologies and instant messaging. The study shows steady growth in email usage. Messaging traffic is expected to increase from 196 billion messages per day in 2007 to 374 billion messages per day in 2011.         
	Employees were now so deluged with messages that email had become a broken business tool in urgent need of fixing, Jason Preston of the Paranssus Group, a social media consultancy, has been quoted by The Daily Telegraph as saying. Theres been no innovation to separate junk letters from the real ones. An independent study by Telewest Business, a UK-based telecom company, has found that misuse of email and telephones at work is hindering workers from doing their jobs, increasing bad habits at work, and lengthening the working day.         
	Men are the biggest timewasters when it comes to non-work activities, the study based on a survery of 1468 people has found. It found that 39 per cent of men emailed friends compared to 36 per cent of women, 19 per cent of men followed sport online compared to 4 per cent of women and 21 per cent of the men went online shopping in contrast to only 14 per cent of women.

	New Delhi, Jan. 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is toying with a proposal to set up the Second States Reorganisation Commission that could redraw the internal map of India.
    
	As the government readies itself for the final lap before the 2009 polls, he is also considering a plan to notify the Delimitation Commissions recommendations in time for the next general elections.
    
	The move to establish a reorganisation commission, which will consider demands for new states, could open a Pandoras box as several UPA constituents, including a section of the Congress, are opposed to the idea of bifurcating Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Bengal.
    
	Sources said faced with stiff opposition, the Prime Minister reportedly raised the bogey of the womens reservation bill to make the allies fall in line. 
    
	The Prime Minister reportedly conveyed to them that the reorganisation commission, delimitation and the womens quota bill were all part of the common minimum programme. The allies then gave the go-ahead on the commission and delimitation.
    
	Until recently, the Congress was opposed to the idea of creating more states. The UPAs reluctance to consider the demand for the formation of a Telengana state prompted the Telengana Rashtra Samiti to walk out of the government and the alliance.
    
	The sources said the Congress reluctantly agreed to the formation of the commission in view of the compulsions in Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and other states. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has openly supported the creation of Telengana (now in Andhra) and Vidarbha (now in Maharashtra).
    
	On the political plane, the Congress is wary of the rise of a caste-based BSP and expansion of its base in these states.
    
	Similarly in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress is veering round to the view that the division of the countrys most populous state into three (eastern UP as Vindhyachal, central as Avadh and western as Hara (green) Pradesh) would provide the party some foothold in the Hindi heartland.
    
	The first States Reorganisation Commission of 1956 set the stage for revising boundaries, though many additional changes to state boundaries (including creation of new states like Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand) have been made since then.
    
	The commission was headed by Justice Fazal Ali. After the commission submitted its report, Andhra was renamed Andhra Pradesh and enlarged by the addition of the Telengana region of the erstwhile Hyderabad state.
    
	Similarly, the state of Bombay was expanded by the addition of Saurashtra and Kutch. In 1960, it was split into the present-day states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. 
    
	The report of the Delimitation Commission, headed by Kuldip Singh, has already been approved by the cabinet. The constituencies have been delimited on the basis of the census figures of 2001.
    
	The delimitation exercise was taken up after a gap of 34 years. While the commission has avoided fragmentation of districts, corporations, municipalities and panchayats, the new constituencies have been made more geographically compact units. The delimitation exercise may adversely affect some political parties and individuals but, so far, UPA as well as NDA constituents have chosen not to oppose it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Buddha effect on congress
                                                                                                           Buddha effect on congress
  - From industrialisation to translation, party humours CM          JAYANTH JACOB AND BISWAJIT ROY                            Bhattacharjee at the congress. (PTI)                                        
	Coimbatore, April 2: He came, he spoke and he will be translated.        
	In between, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee can also claim to have more or less conquered sceptics in the party on industrialisation, though some concerns remain on special economic zones.        
	During the day, other signals emerged to suggest the CPMs 19th party congress, which closes here tomorrow, was Bhattacharjees congress. The chief minister was fielded to address the media over his counterparts from the two other Left-ruled states. The party also tried to ensure that more people hear Bhattacharjee at a public rally in Coimbatore tomorrow by sparing no effort to find a suitable translator.        
	The party has approved our industrial policies, the Bengal chief minister announced today, before discussions on the draft political organisation report were complete.        
	Keralas finance minister, Thomas Isaac, had at a closed-door discussion a couple of hours earlier questioned the reports push for aggressive industrialisation in Bengal while asking the southern state to focus on food production and social development.         
	Sources said Isaac argued that the industrial policy should be same for all the three Left-ruled states.         
	But Bhattacharjee repeated what the draft political organisation report said  industrialisation in Bengal has a historical context to it.        
	We focus on industrialisation since traditionally Bengal has been an industrial state since the Raj. We want to revive our pre-Independence glory. But in Kerala, the situation is different historically. Thats why Kerala has been asked to develop its agriculture as well as social sector jobs, he told the media.        
	The political organisation report itself had made it clear the internal debate on industrialisation policies was settled in his favour.         
	But if any further proof was needed, it came when the CPM fielded Bhattacharjee to brief the media on the partys efforts to strike a balance between working class postures and implementing the new economic policies of the Centre with a difference.         
	Bhattacharjee was chosen over his Kerala counterpart, V.S. Achuthanandan, who has reservations about the thrust on industrialisation.        
	But it is not party policy alone that bears the Bengal chief ministers imprint. Even arrangements at the SNR Auditorium, the venue of the congress, have been tailored to suit him.        
	Four days before the meeting began, Bhattacharjees security team got the organisers to drop a plan to have two entrances to the venue. The original plan was to have a media lounge with a separate entrance at the back, but the officials cited security risk to the chief minister and confined the entry through one gate, sources in the organising committee said.        
	Today, Bhattacharjee had the organisers in a tizzy again as they went hunting for a quality translator to render his speech into Tamil. He will speak in English at the public rally tomorrow that marks the end of the congress.         
	The reason is that Buddhadeb is a rare speaker here in Tamil Nadu unlike the other speakers, party general secretary Prakash Karat, politburo member Sitaram Yechury and Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, said a party leader here. Karat can speak in Tamil.         
	Finally, the choice fell on A.K. Padmanabhan, a central committee member. As a key organiser of the event and media in-charge, Padmanabhan is busy but was drafted because he has a rare experience in translating speeches of leaders like Basava Punnayya and Harkishen Singh Surjeet. I have been translating the speeches of the leaders into Tamil for the past 30 years, said Padmanabhan, who is proficient in English, Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam. He is confident of handling Bhattacharjees speech.        
	Bhattacharjee told the news conference the party would seek amendments to the SEZ Act to bring in more checks and balances. Yesterday, the CPM had rejected a demand from a section of the party for a blanket ban. But the party units in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh that have been opposing SEZs on the ground pushed for the amendments.

                                                                                                           No evidence, Soren walks free
  - 7 held guilty for death of 11 in 75 clash in Chirudih, sentencing today          GAUTAM SARKAR                                    
	Jamtara, March 6: JMM chief Shibu Soren, who was forced to resign from the Manmohan Singh cabinet and spend nine months in jail in 2004 for the death of 11 people in a clash in Chirudih in 1975, has been acquitted for want of evidence.         
	Today, the court of additional district and session judge (first class) of Jamtara, Arun Kumar, acquitted Soren along with 19 other accused in the 33-year-old case. However, seven others were declared guilty. The court will announce the quantum of punishment tomorrow.         
	It was a different Soren in court today. Smiling and waving a court certificate that freed him of a bloody taint  a far cry from from his brooding self when he was forced to surrender before the court in August 2004.        
	After the ruling, the police took into custody Joy Dev Tuddu, Natiniyal Hembrom, Md. Khalil, Satyanarayan Poddar, Sikendar Miyan, Joy Kumar Sen and Jhagru Pandit.         
	Though the verdict has left me a free man, but we did not win the case at all, said Soren who was accompanied by former JMM MLAs Hazi Hussain Ansari and Shashank Sheker Vokta and two sons Hemanth and Basant.        
	My friends are still behind bars. Let us see what happens to them tomorrow, he said.         
	Soren along with 69 others were made co-accused in the case. The FIR with the Narayanpur PS (case No. 7/1975) blamed Joy Dev Tuddu, Satyanarayan Poddar, Madan Hansdak and Ramakant Datta responsible for the deaths of of 11 people including the landlord of Narayanpur, Raja Kati Singh, in a violent clash between tribals and non-tribals.        
	In 1986, an arrest warrant was issued against Soren and others by the Jamtara court. The judge ordered him to surrender before September 6, 1986. But Soren did not, leading the court to declare him an absconder.                                 
	During the trial, the prosecution alleged that Soren connived with court officials to split the case  only 63 accused were named when the case was sent for trial to the sessions court. The remaining seven, including Soren, were declared absconders.         
	The matter came to light in 2002 when Jharkhand High Court sought a list of pending cases from the Jamtara court. In July 2004, the court in Jamtara issued arrest warrants against Soren and the others.         
	Soren, who was Union coal minister then, had to tender his resignation on July 24, 2004. With his anticipatory bail plea rejected, he was asked to appear before the court here. Finally, he surrendered on August 2, 2004 and was sent to jail. He spent more than nine months in prison.        
	Residents of Jamtara waited with bated breath throughout the day for the judgement which was finally delivered around 4 pm.         
	It is an old episode. Time has healed our wounds. How we can say whether Soren should be punished or not? said a villager in Pabia on condition of anonymity.         
	The family members of the landlord of Narayanpur, Raja Kati Singh, who died during the incident, refused to comment.

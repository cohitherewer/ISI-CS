        The Telegraph Investigation      JAYANTA BASU                                               
	Calcutta, June 28: If autorickshaws are the king of Calcuttas roads, its because they pay a kings ransom.        
	Each of the roughly 55,000 legal and illegal autorickshaws in Calcutta and its suburbs pays the Citu union under which they are organised Rs 5 to 10 every day, depending on the route they operate on.        
	At the higher end, that works out to Rs 5.5 lakh a day, Rs 1.65 crore a month and Rs 19.80 crore a year. At Rs 5, the respective numbers are Rs 2.75 lakh, Rs 82.5 lakh and Rs 9.9 crore.        
	The truth possibly lies somewhere in between  around Rs 15 crore. Even at this mid-point this truth is far weightier than the Rs 1.5-2 crore other transport workers deliver to their unions.        
	That is the reason no Chakraborty  neither Subhas, the transport minister, nor Gautam Mohan, the police commissioner  dares touch them.        
	Which is why deadline after deadline comes and goes and yet the directive to convert the engine to LPG is neither followed nor enforced.        
	Its the protection money with which autorickshaw drivers have bought the right to make U-turns where U-turns are not allowed, to zoom off when the signal turns red and treat every other vehicle on the road as if they didnt exist.        
	The money power the autorickshaws wield as a collective has a comrade-in-arms in the clandestine economy that provides them with the fuel  popularly known as katatel, or adulterated oil. Petrol is mixed with kerosene and other lubricants.        
	Adulterated oil commands a business that is worth an amazing amount  Rs 150-160 crore a year.        
	The protection money, though the union denies it and disputes the amount, and the Rs 150-crore business, in which the stakeholders allegedly range from the lawmaker to the lawkeeper, together form the answer to the puzzling question why autorickshaws are so openly above the law.        
	Kishore Ghosh, secretary of the union, said: We do not give any protection to autos violating norms on roads and police are free to take action against the violators. He blamed a section of the traffic police for being corrupt and turning a blind eye to violations in the name of union.        
	Auto drivers snigger at the suggestion that the police collect protection money from them. Sergeant-ra to amader bhoy pai, oder taka debo ki (The sergeants fear us, why should we pay them)! said one.        
	Autorickshaws have successfully resisted conversion to LPG since 2004, and most recently when the transport department set a January-end deadline for pre-2000 vehicles. Hardly any sought conversion.        
	Mohammed Amin, who plies his auto on the Mahatma Gandhi Road-Kadapara route, said: I spent Rs 15,000 on the LPG gas kit but I do not use it because the mileage is low.        
	Experts agree that gas is 10 per cent less fuel-efficient than petrol but costs about 30 per cent less, which makes it more economical, apart from the enormous environment benefits.        
	Mohammed Zahir, who works the Anwar Shah Road stretch, explained why gas was losing out to katatel. While LPG is around Rs 36 a litre, katatel is sold between Rs 30 and 32 a litre.        
	Manoj Saha (name changed on request), an auto driver in Behala, estimates the number of places selling adulterated oil at 250 across the city.         
	In Behala, for example, the oil is sold in front of Ajanta cinema and at Chowrasta beside the police outpost.         
	Between Taratolla and chowrasta, there are six outlets; the same number between Ultadanga and Dum Dum Park.        
	You will find at least one katatel selling counter beside every major auto stand, said Saha.        
	Environmentalist S.M. Ghosh suggested that the state government abolish the 12.5 per cent value-added tax on the LPG used in autos. That would destroy the cost advantage adulterated oil enjoys over gas, but who would want to kill a Rs 150-crore goose?        
	Despite the cost disadvantage, Zahir runs his vehicle on LPG. Not only me, you will find most autos running on LPG are owner driven Katatel damages the engine.        
	Drivers who dont use LPG say ask the union when questioned why gas could not be adopted in Calcutta while other cities have successfully converted.        
	The word union keeps cropping up in conversations with auto drivers.         
	Whenever we try to push for conversion, the union sabotages it, said a senior transport official.        
	The autorickshaw economy is more complicated than running from one place to another and back with a pit stop for katatel.        
	First, the rate at which an auto pays the union daily depends not only on the route but also on whether the vehicle is legal or illegal. Autos without valid papers have to pay more. Rates tend to increase in the fringe areas like Behala and Garden Reach. On the route from the Sovabazar Metro station to Ultadanga, on the contrary, the rate is only Rs 5.        
	Union officials admitted that some of the auto lines, or routes, churned out large amounts of money but contested the conclusion that the Citu central union reaped the harvest.        
	Barun Ghatak, the president of the union, said: The union takes only Rs 26 from each auto in a year. The amounts they generate are mostly used to pay the starters managing the lines, holding pujas or taking holidays. Eighty per cent of these lines have separate bank accounts.        
	An auto driver, who has been in the business for some time, added: Most of the auto lines are affiliated to Citu and normally the accounts are created in the name of either the route secretary or starter.        
	Dipak Chakrabarty (name changed on request) of Behala said: We do not know which part of the payment is official or which is not, but we end up paying a lot more than Rs 26 in a year.

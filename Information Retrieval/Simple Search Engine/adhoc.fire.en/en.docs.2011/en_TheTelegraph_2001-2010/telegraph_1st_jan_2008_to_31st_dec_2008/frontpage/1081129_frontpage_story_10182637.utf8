	Islamabad, Nov 29 (PTI): Pakistan today backtracked on sending ISI chief Shuja Pasha to India in connection with the probe into the terrorist attacks in Mumbai and instead deputed a representative of the spy agency for the task.              
	The decision was taken within hours of Premier Yousuf Raza Gilani agreeing to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs demand to fly the ISI chief to Delhi.              
	At a meeting here early today, President Asif Ali Zardari, Gilani and Army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani decided against sending Pasha to India which suspected involvement of Pakistani elements in the Mumbai terror attacks that left over 160 dead.

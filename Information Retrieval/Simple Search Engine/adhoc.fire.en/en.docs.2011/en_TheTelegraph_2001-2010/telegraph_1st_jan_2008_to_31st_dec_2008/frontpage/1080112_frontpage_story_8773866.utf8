     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 11: Sharad Pawar has been given emergency powers to pull India out of the Australia tour if the three-match ban on Harbhajan Singh is not overturned. 
    
	That is true but I will only use the power in support of Harbhajan for the rest of the country, he said, confirming that the Board of Control for Cricket in India had voted to allow him to take the call.
    
	Normally, a decision of this magnitude would be voted on by the BCCI.
    
	The charge against our player is not acceptable. Its our responsibility to protect the interest of our players and do everything to restore the honour of our country. We will fight to get justice for Harbhajan and India, Pawar said here, keeping up the pressure on the International Cricket Council and Cricket Australia.
    
	The off-spinner was banned for three matches for allegedly calling Andrew Symonds a monkey. Harbhajan has denied using the word and appealed against the ban.
    
	India has always fought racism. We know about Mahatma Gandhis fight against it in South Africa, the BCCI chief said today. However, he added he expected the controversy to be resolved as early as possible.
    
	The Indian players want the ban lifted before the Perth Test, which begins on Wednesday, failing which they might make themselves unavailable for the match, sources said.
    
	But Pawar denied knowledge of this. My impression is the hearing should be after the Test series and before the start of the tri-series (including Lanka). 
    
	An Australian report said India would argue that Symonds had misinterpreted a Hindi abuse which sounds like monkey.
    
	The BCCI chief recalled his conversation with Sachin Tendulkar, who was on the field at the time of the row. Sachin told me there was some tension but Harbhajan never said anything. I believe Sachin, he said.
    
	Sourav Ganguly, who wasnt on the field, said he doubted Harbhajan had used the word. But there is a lot of pressure in the middle and things can come out, he said, adding he admired how desperate they (Australians) were to win the Sydney Test.
    
	Captain Anil Kumble had said only one team played in the spirit of the game, but Ganguly today said: I dont know what spirit of the game actually means.

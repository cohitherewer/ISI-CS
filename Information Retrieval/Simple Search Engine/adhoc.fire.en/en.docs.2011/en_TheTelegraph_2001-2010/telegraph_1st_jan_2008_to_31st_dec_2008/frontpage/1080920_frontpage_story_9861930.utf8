          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             A plainclothes policeman at the encounter site. Reuters                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 19: Narendra Modi appeared to live up to his billing as the BJPs anti-terror mascot, stealing the show at a gathering here today with attacks on the Centre.        
	These (secular) parties can accept innocent citizens killed in thousands. But they cannot accept a few innocent persons arrested. Thats why they oppose tough laws. Whats this tamasha? Isnt this a shameful spectacle of playing with the lives of common people? the Gujarat chief minister told an anti-terror rally to lusty cheering.        
	BJP leaders L.K. Advani, Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley also attended the rally, held a day after the Centre could not agree on tougher laws to fight terror, but it was Modi whose messages appeared to have struck a chord with the crowd. He (Modi) is right. People are being killed but some parties are worried about fair trials for terrorists, said a police officer at the venue.         
	The chief minister took a swipe at the Centres failure to frame tough laws, saying the fight against terror couldnt succeed without strong legal deterrents. The policemen carry AK-47s. We have given modern weapons. But we (the Centre) will not give them laws to fight this modern, hi-tech menace. How will they succeed?         
	Some of the applause had to do with the raw appeal of his rhetoric. Gujarat aatankwadi ke samne mujra nahin karega (Gujarat will not dance before the terrorists), he said to a roar of applause.        
	Modi argued that more energy was being spent worrying about possible rights violations  when the innocent are picked up  than saving the lives of citizens. He overshadowed Advani, Rajnath and Jaitley, another manifestation of the fact that he had become the BJPs star campaigner after the exit of A.B. Vajpayee.        
	Modi said the time had come for the nation to rise against vote-bank politics. The country should speak in one voice against terror. Everybody should contribute by opposing vote-bank politics, he said, recalling how Congress, Samajwadi Party and BSP leaders had visited the homes of Ahmedabad blast suspect Abu Basheer.

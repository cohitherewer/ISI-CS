The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Gates: We will not haggle
                                                                                                           Gates: We will not haggle
                                Fair offer                            
	Seattle, Feb. 19 (Agencies): Microsoft is not privately haggling with Yahoo over the software makers rejected $31-per-share buyout offer for the slumping Internet pioneer, Bill Gates said in an interview.        
	 We sent them a letter and said we think thats a fair offer. Theres nothing thats gone on other than us stating that we think its a fair offer, the Microsoft chairman said yesterday. They should take a hard look at it.        
	 Microsoft Corp made an unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo Inc just over two weeks ago. At the time, the deal was valued at $44.6billion. However, since then, Microsofts share price has tumbled 12.8 per cent, pushing the value of the cash-and-stock offer closer to $41billion.        
	Yahoo spurned the offer and said it substantially undervalues the companys assets. The Web portal business was said to be in talks late last week with News Corp about a complex deal to push its market value towards $50billion. Yahoo also was reportedly discussing an advertising partnership with Google.         
	Gates said Google is the only company with critical mass in Web search. Microsoft needs a bigger piece of the market to create a more competitive and profitable Web search business.         
	We can afford to make big investments in the engineering and marketing that needs to get done. We will do that with or without Yahoo, Gates said.

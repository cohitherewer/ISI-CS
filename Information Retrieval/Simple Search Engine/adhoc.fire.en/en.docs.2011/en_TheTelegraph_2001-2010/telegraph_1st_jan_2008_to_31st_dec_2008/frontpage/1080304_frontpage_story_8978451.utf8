     RASHEED KIDWAI
               
	March 3: The countrys most influential Islamic scholars and clerics battled on issues ranging from gender sensitivity to the length of the clergys siesta at the Calcutta meeting of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board.
    
	Reformers and those favouring status quo debated the need to comment on P. Chidambarams latest budget, and that for more women speakers (only one of the 25 women on the 201-member board got a chance to address the three-day meeting that ended yesterday).
    
	But passion ran high over the slur on the clergys obsession with their qailullah (afternoon nap). Maulana Sohail Nadvi ran threateningly towards speaker Kamal Farooqui who had questioned the need for the daily five-hour afternoon break during the conference.
    
	Yes, there were some agitated persons, but I was speaking with the permission of the chair, Farooqui told The Telegraph.
    
	Maulana Khalid Rasheed, who belongs to Lucknows Firangi Mahal school of theology, would have none of it.
    
	The meeting was divided into two daily sessions  from 9am to 1.30pm and then from 6.30pm onwards  to felicitate prayers and cope with the Calcutta traffic. I think it was rather uncharitable to accuse the older generation of trying to steal a nap, he said.
    
	Farooqui, chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, said he and many others wanted the law board to be more proactive.
    
	Since we are a representative body of Muslims in India, our pronouncements and responses should be more visible and quick, he said, wondering why the board should not have a look at the budget provisions for minorities.
    
	Rasheed said the law boards charter restricted it to protection of Muslim personal law. Why should we comment on the budget and other political issues of the day?
    
	Sources said board president Maulana Rabey Nadvi was keen to maintain the bodys apolitical profile. The scholar believes that any political posturing could rock the carefully worked out unity among the dozens of Islamic sects within the board.
    
	Veteran leader Syed Shahabuddin, however, regretted that the board was ignoring key issues affecting the Muslim community. 
    
	He said the absence of authoritative clarifications led to confusion and controversies, and cited the move to make marriage registration compulsory.
    
	The board is not against registration but feels the measure will be difficult to implement in rural areas. Besides, it could be used to harass and bully young or illiterate couples.
    
	Perhaps for the first time since the boards inception in 1973, its officials themselves favoured the induction of youth. The four general secretaries are well past 80. One of them, Maulana Rahmani, said the decks should be cleared for younger office-bearers.
    
	Some speakers said the general secretarys report should have a chapter highlighting womens issues. Some stressed the need for the board to be more media-savvy.

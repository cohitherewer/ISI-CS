	Washington, Dec. 18: A person named Amar Singh donated between $1million and $5million to the Clinton Foundation, according to a complete donor list published for the first time on Thursday.        
	Lifting a longstanding cloak, Bill Clinton disclosed the names of more than 200,000 donors to his foundation as part of an agreement negotiated with President-elect Barack Obama to douse concerns about potential conflicts of interest if Hillary Clinton is confirmed as secretary of state.        
	The precise amounts were not listed but broad dollar ranges were given. The non-profit foundation finances Bill Clintons library and charitable efforts to reduce poverty and treat AIDS.        
	(The news broke late tonight and it could not be verified with Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh whether he had made any donation.) In September, Amar Singh had visited Washington. He met and posed for photographs with Hillary Clinton, afterwards telling reporters that she had assured him that Democrats would not block the nuclear deal. The US Congress approved the deal a few days later.         
	Some other donors have connections to India  a potential foreign policy flashpoint because of tensions with Pakistan.        
	Among them was Lakshmi Mittal, who donated from $1 million to $5 million. In addition, Suzlon Energy of Amsterdam, which donated from $1 million to $5 million, is part of the Suzlon wind turbine empire run by Tulsi R. Tanti, an Indian businessman.        
	Associated Press named the CII and D. Katragadda, an Indian capital manager, in the $500,000-$1 million category.        
	US law does not require a former President to reveal his foundations financial benefactors. Bill Clintons advocates said the publication of the list showed that he had nothing to hide.

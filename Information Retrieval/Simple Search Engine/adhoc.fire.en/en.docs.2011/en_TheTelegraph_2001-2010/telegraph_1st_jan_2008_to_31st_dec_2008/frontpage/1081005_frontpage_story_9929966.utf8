	Calcutta, Oct. 4: A bus turned turtle on Deshapran Sashmal Road in south Calcutta tonight, setting off a violent mob attack on policemen who landed at the spot and another on the local police station nearby.        
	One wing of the mob set fire to a number of vehicles at Charu Market police station while the other pelted officers on the spot with bricks and stones, alleging they had wielded lathis on the crowd without provocation.        
	Around 9pm, a private bus on route No. 1B overturned because of some mechanical fault, injuring 15 persons. Residents of the area immediately began pulling out the passengers.        
	When the police arrived a while later, a mob turned on them, injuring Rajesh Subarno, the deputy commissioner of police (south), his security guard and another officer.                    Pedestrians walk with their hands up on RAF orders. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha      
	People from nearby lanes and bylanes joined the free-for-all, forcing the police to wield lathis and burst teargas shells. The Rapid Action Force and a huge posse of policemen had to be rushed in, with the mob outnumbering the police at one time.        
	In the interim, another wing of the mob headed for the nearby police station and torched a police jeep, police van, two motorcycles and a cycle-rickshaw. They also hurled bricks, damaging property.        
	The injured persons, including women and children, were taken to Bangur hospital and SSKM hospital. Four of the injured, including a child, are reported to be serious.        
	The police alleged the twin mob attacks were engineered by Swarup Biswas, the brother of Tollygunge Trinamul MLA Arup Biswas. The Trinamul Congress has denied the allegation.        
	Around 29 people have been arrested, a policeman said.        
	We are conducting raids and more arrests are likely to be made. We will also probe how the accident occurred and what provoked the huge mob to attack the police, another officer said.        
	Most of the people in the mob were from Jhalar Math, a slum close to the accident site, he said.               
	They even turned on some fire brigade officials, blocking them from going to the police station where the vehicles were burning.        
	Late at night, police commissioner Goutam Mohan Chakrabarti visited the spot.        
	The incident threw traffic out of gear for around two hours, holding up people heading home after Puja shopping.

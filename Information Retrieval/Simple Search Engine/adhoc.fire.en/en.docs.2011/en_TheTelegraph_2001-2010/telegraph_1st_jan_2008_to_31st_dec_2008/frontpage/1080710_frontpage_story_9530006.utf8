  - Letter soon to Delhi on Darjeeling discussions          OUR BUREAU                            Bimal Gurung                                         
	Calcutta/Darjeeling, June 9: The Bengal government is going to urge the Union home ministry in a day or two to convene a tripartite meeting on Darjeeling.        
	The decision follows the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas refusal to attend meetings at the bipartite level.        
	 It will happen in a day or two. However, there is no reason to believe that bipartite talks cannot be held after a tripartite discussion. Now, it would be for the Centre to decide on the date and venue. As for participation, it would be too premature to say whether the chief minister would attend or not, state home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said at Writers Buildings this evening.        
	In Darjeeling, Morcha chief Bimal Gurung said it is a good thing that the government had accepted the demand for tripartite talks. I will personally attend the meeting, he added.        
	Three days ago, Bhattacharjee sent a letter to Gurung, thanking him for extending the bandh breather while urging that he join bipartite talks. The Morcha shot down the offer, stressing instead on the tripartite meeting.         
	In the wake of the new development, Morcha insiders said the partys central committee may review the situation in the hills indicating that the strike in the government offices could be relaxed. Gurung refused to say anything other than we will look into it.         
	Sources in the party also said if the talks with the Centre turned out to favourable, they may even do away with the GL (Gorkhaland) number plates.         
	Earlier in the day, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya met the chief minister to discuss the dangerous move to use GL number plates on vehicles in Darjeeling. The home secretary said information on car owners using such number plates were being collected.

  - JMM to stake claim to form govt today        OUR BUREAU                            JMM chief Shibu Soren talks to Independent MLA Kamlesh Singh at the residence of Dulal Bhuiyan in Ranchi on Sunday. Picture by Prashant Mitra                                        
	Ranchi, Aug. 24: JMM chief Shibu Soren would be staking his claim to form government in Jharkhand tomorrow at 4pm.         
	According to a spokesperson, the Raj Bhavan fixed the time late in the evening today after Independent MLA Kamlesh Singh and Durga Soren, son of the JMM chief, met the Raj Bhavan officials seeking time for the same.         
	Four Independent MLAs  Joba Manjhi, Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai  today strengthened chances of Soren to form the government. While they agreed to lend conditional support to the JMM chief, two other Independent MLAs  Bandhu Tirkey and Kamlesh  have already joined hands with Soren. Forward Bloc and CPI, too, have agreed to support him.         
	Sahi even claimed that Stephen Marandi had agreed to join their fold and negotiations with Madhu Koda were proceeding in the positive direction.         
	While Stephen maintained that he would be taking his decision tomorrow, Koda admitted that the Independents had asked him to give second thought to the issue. Another Independent, Chandra Prakash Choudhary, claimed today that Soren had not spoken to him yet.        
	RJD chief Lalu Prasad would be coming here tomorrow to ensure smooth victory of Soren. Talking to a section of reporters, Lalu Prasad said that his party would extend outside support to the Soren-led government.        
	The Sunday morning did not show the day, though. For, Koda, Stephen, Ekka, Rai, Shahi, Choudhary and Manjhis close aide, Nazm Ansari, had a closed-door meeting at Stephens place, where they resolved that they would not support Soren.         
	Stephen admitted after the meeting that he was assigned by the central leadership of the Congress and RJD to persuade the Independents to help Soren form the new government in the state, but cited his helplessness to do so.        
	But things changed in the afternoon when Soren drove to Sahis place after a luncheon at JMM leader Dulal Bhuiyans place. Manjhis associate Ansari, Ekka and Rai, too, were summoned for talks.         
	Sorens exploits to woo the Independent MLAs had begun around midnight yesterday. He drove to Manjhis place, where Sahi also joined in. The meeting continued for nearly two-and-a-half hours, but with no result.         
	Children are unhappy for small reasons, but things will be set right soon. We are ready to give them berths in the council of ministers and will be taking care of their other interests, a Sorens close aide had said then.        
	In the late evening today, Soren and Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay visited theresidence of Ajsu legislator from Silli and former home minister Sudesh Mahto.         
	We have called a meeting of the party tomorrow at 11am. We will decide after the meeting whether to support Soren or not, said Mahto, accepting Soren visited his home.         
	Against this backdrop, the BJP might initiate moves tomorrow for the termination of the Assembly membership of Vishnu Bhaiya and Manohar Tekriwal after Opposition leader Arjun Munda reaches the state capital.

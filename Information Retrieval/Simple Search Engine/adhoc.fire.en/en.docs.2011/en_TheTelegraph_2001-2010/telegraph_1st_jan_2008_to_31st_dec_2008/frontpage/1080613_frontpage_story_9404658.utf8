	Ranchi, June 12: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has selected two Maoists-infested districts  one each in Jharkhand and Bihar  to sensitise government officials across ranks about human rights.        
	The rights body has chalked out special training programmes centred around the districts of Chatra and Jamui and has decided to involve the state governments too by asking them to take several larger initiatives to safeguard human rights.        
	For instance, NHRC wanted state prisons to be decongested with more care given to prisoners health and fitness. It would also ask universities of Bihar and Jharkhand to introduce courses on human rights and related issues.         
	Awareness and sensitivity about human rights, even among government officials, is very poor. NHRC is therefore planning a special programme to improve the condition, said Sunila Basant, a retired IAS officer who has been appointed special rapporteur by the NHRC for Jharkhand-Bihar.         
	The programmes in the districts include right to food, right to health, right to education, rights of scheduled tribes and scheduled castes and right to custodian justice.         
	The NHRC would also aim to ensure proper implementation of the PDS system, full attendance of children in schools and stress on public healthcare, among other issues.         
	Basant was in the state capital today after a four-day visit of Chatra where she met several activists advocating rights issues and government officials. I will submit my report to the NHRC following which a plan of action would be chalked out in the districts, said Basant, but refused to elaborate on her findings about alleged human rights violations in the district.         
	Basant also called on Ranchi University vice-chancellor A.A. Khan and apprised him of NHRCs plan of asking universities to introduce human rights courses. Khan has assured me that the RU would take it up from the next academic year, she said.         
	The UGC was said to have prepared various chapters on human rights and even directed universities to introduce them in class.         
	In Jharkhand, St Xaviers College and Jamshedpur Womens College have already been offering diploma and certificate courses on human rights, respectively.         
	The NHRC special rapporteur met various NGOs working for human rights here. They highlighted several instances of rights violations across the state. Basant asked them to send the details to the NHRC.

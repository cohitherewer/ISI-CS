          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 6: The Supreme Court has said a school must share part of the blame for poor results of its students and admit them to Plus-2 courses even if their Class X marks are below the cut-off.        
	In a separate ruling, a bench urged lower courts not to show misplaced sympathy to students caught copying if they wanted to ensure the countrys progress.        
	The verdict on admissions, which can now be cited as a precedent and bound to ease the stress on lakhs of anxious students and their harried parents, came in a case where a student of a Tamil Nadu school was refused a seat in Class XI.        
	The court said the Kendriya Vidyalaya in Tambaram, a Chennai suburb, could use Saurabh Chaudhurys Class X marks to deny him a seat for a particular stream but couldnt refuse him admission just because he failed to get the cut-off marks.        
	The bench said there could be no objection to schools laying down cut-off marks for a particular stream where there are more than one on offer. But it would be quite unreasonable and unjust to throw out a student from the school because he failed to get the cut-off marks in the Class X examination, it added.         
	After all, the school must share at least some responsibility for the poor performance of its student and should help him in trying to do better in the next higher class.        
	Admission in another Kendriya Vidyalaya in the same city wouldnt do, the court said, as that would mean a change from familiar environs.        
	Students in cities like Calcutta should smile because some schools have been known to fix high cut-off marks and Madhyamik results arent always sure passport to good institutions.        
	The other case involved Vaibhav Singh Chauhan, a final-year student of a Chandigarh hotel management institute, who confessed he was cheating after being caught in the exam hall with a chit of paper.        
	Chauhan had cleared all subjects in the first and second year. The institute disqualified him on July 7, 2005, for a year and told him to reappear for all the papers.        
	Chauhan moved Delhi High Court, which permitted him to sit only for the paper he had been caught cheating. The court said a lenient view should be taken about mere possession of answer slips not intended to be used for cheating.        
	The apex court said this was misplaced sympathy. If our country is to progress, we must maintain high educational standards, and this is only possible if malpractices in examinations in educational institutions are curbed with an iron hand.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2.5cr tag on 1936 Merc

	Bareilly, July 6: The Hitler car could now be worth Rs 2.5 crore after all the publicity, says vintage-car restorer and dealer Kamal A. Karim of Bareilly.        
	The Merc is with a collector in Bareilly, a vintage-car buff in Dehra Dun had told The Telegraph. I saw it just a few months ago. Earlier, the car had been in Punjab for sometime.        
	Two dozen old cars are parked at Karims garage at Bareillys Civil Lines. Theres a 1911 EMF 30, a 1947 Hudson, a 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air, a Baby Austin and a 1939 Mercedes-Benz. But no 1936 Merc.        
	Kamal, a former Ashok Leyland engineer, believes the Hitler car is in India, though.         
	The government banned the export of old cars in 1988. Even if someone smuggled it out to London for auction by, say, Sothebys, it would not be easy. There, too, the car owners are carefully notified and one can see it on the Internet.        
	But whoever has it now is likely to be extremely secretive because they could get into trouble with the law, Karim said. Its possible that when it was sold, the buyer was not aware of its history. If it was an exchange between heads of states, it could not be a personal property to sell off.        
	What about the business grapevine saying that Karim, who has 17 mechanics and 14 agents across India, had bought the car and restored it?        
	No vintage-car dealer will show you his stuff unless you have come to buy it and have the right contacts, he smiled.        
	So, are you interested in buying the car? he said and showed this correspondent out.

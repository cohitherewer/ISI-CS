	New Delhi, Feb. 5: Welcome to the kind of polling station many in India may dream of.         
	A bar counter arrayed with beer and wine bottles leading up to the polling booth  an online voting facility. This was Ploof, an upmarket seafood salon in central Delhi, offering expat Americans a stage to get high on democracy on Super Tuesday, a critical milestone in the race for US presidential nominations involving 24 states.         
	These were all Democrats from an outfit called the Democrats in India and the air was thick with the Hillary Clinton-Barack Obama duel. We, the overseas Americans, can be considered the 51st state, beamed Carolyn Sauvage-Mar, chairperson of the Democrats in India. The Democratic global primary has been a great step forward in advancing the voting rights of overseas Americans.         
	This is the first time Democrats living abroad have been able to exercise their choice, and they turned out in grand style  over 300 voters, some estimates went.         
	And opinion remained divided. Obama is the future, Hillary is the past, said one voter who works with a UN agency here and would not be identified. We want the future.         
	Thats biased, came the retort from another voter. Hillary is energetic and deserves the post.         
	Theres a fair way to go yet in the contest  Ploof will play host to more rounds of voting tomorrow and on February 9 and 12  but with drinks to be had on the side and two to raise toasts to, nobody seemed to be complaining about having to come back.

          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                            Rajkumar (top), Krishna                                 
	New Delhi, July 11: The CBI today said it had no evidence against dentist Rajesh Talwar in the murders of his daughter Aarushi and servant Hemraj, and pinned the crimes on his compounder Krishna and two accomplices.         
	Talwar will walk free on bail tomorrow after 50 days in jail.        
	The agency named the accomplices as Rajkumar, domestic help of the Durranis who are the Talwars friends, and Vijay Mandal, servant in a neighbours house. With Mandals arrest today, all three accused are in custody.        
	At todays news conference, CBI joint director Arun Kumar stopped short of a categorical clean chit to the Talwars, subjects of swirling speculation since the murders captured headlines in May.        
	He said the agency had nothing on Rajesh yet but could move against him if new evidence came up. Kumars version of the events:        
	Krishna, Rajkumar and Mandal, all of them Nepalese, had met on May 15 night in Hemrajs room at the Talwar home to drink. They began talking about Aarushi, 15, and went to her room late in the night, drunk.        
	She woke up and tried to scream. She was gagged and hit by a hard, blunt object on her head. They also tried to sexually abuse her, Kumar said. This led to an altercation between them and fearing Aarushis parents might wake up, they went to the terrace.        
	Hemraj was killed in a scuffle with Rajkumar and Krishna. The duo came back to Aarushis room and slit her throat, Kumar said. Aarushi was probably alive, but unconscious, for 10-15 minutes after being hit.        
	Rajesh and wife Nupur had surprised officers by saying they had slept through it all. But Kumar said a CBI experiment had borne them out. With the ACs on in the Talwars and Aarushis bedrooms and both doors closed, two forensic experts in the first room heard nothing when noise comparable to May 15 nights was made in the other.        
	Since the version of events is based on polygraph tests and narco-analysis, inadmissible in court on their own, the CBI needs corroborative evidence, Kumar said.        
	He failed to explain the agencys failure to find the murder weapon, believed to be a khukri, and the victims missing mobiles despite having all three accused in custody. Weve an idea and hope to get them soon, Kumar said.        
	He said the post-mortem on Aarushi found no sperms. Weve sent the slide (of her vaginal swab) for another test.

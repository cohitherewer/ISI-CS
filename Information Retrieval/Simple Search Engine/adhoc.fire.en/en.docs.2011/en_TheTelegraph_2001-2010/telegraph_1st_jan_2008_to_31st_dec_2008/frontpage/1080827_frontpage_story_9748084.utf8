          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Pavin Ponanna                                  
	Bangalore, Aug. 26: Pavin Ponanna is no great fan of horror movies, but doesnt like being dared to watch one all alone in a theatre.        
	So the 30-year-old took up Ram Gopal Varmas challenge to watch Phoonk alone at Inox, and sat through it on Sunday night, clutching half a bottle of mineral water and his two mobile phones.        
	But Pavin, who runs an ad agency, is not going to claim the Rs 5 lakh reward Varma offered because the contest ended on August 22. He does not know if anyone else took up the challenge.        
	I was not part of the contest but did it just to prove that I come from a land of valour. I am a Coorgi or Kodava, we are known to be a martial race, he said.        
	I respect Ram Gopal Varma, but I think he should not throw such challenges. If the movie was really scary, the censor board would have objected. I dont believe in black magic but to watch the film in a 227-seat theatre alone is quite an achievement.        
	Before watching the film, Pavin met Sudeep, who has a lead role in Phoonk. He was at a shoot and he asked me why I was doing it, why I had booked the entire show for Rs 47,500. I told him I am a Kodava and dont get scared easily.        
	When Pavin walked into the hall, his wife waited nervously outside. She and a few friends were relieved to see me when I came out. But I think nobody should try this stunt as its not only expensive but also foolish, he said.        
	Now, Pavin wants to meet the Phoonk director and tell him: Sir, dont dare anyone for anything, its like questioning someones integrity.        
	Pavin has also begun feeling like a celebrity because he has been getting hundreds of phone calls. I just got a call from Dubai from someone who wants me to be part of an event, he beamed.

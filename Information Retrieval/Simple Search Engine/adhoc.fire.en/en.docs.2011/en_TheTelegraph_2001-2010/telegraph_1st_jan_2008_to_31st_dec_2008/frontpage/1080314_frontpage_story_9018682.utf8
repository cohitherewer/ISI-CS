	Bangalore: Former Team India coach Greg Chappell has said early exposure to Twenty20 cricket may end up harming the youngsters by causing burnout if they do not deal with the high probability of failure in a proper manner.        
	Twenty20 cricket, by its very nature, is going to be a game of a lot of failure. If you cant deal with that and understand that its part of the game and learn from it, you are going to fall by the wayside quickly, Chappell said.        
	What we are going to see with this express form of cricket is that a lot of young cricketers are going to burn out very early, said the former Australia captain.        
	Chappell is busy hunting young talent for a programme run by Emerging Media, which owns the Indian Premier Leagues Jaipur franchise.        
	Chappell supported sledging, saying that every good player had to learn to deal with it but felt it had been blown out of proportion.        
	The verbal duel that goes on in the cricket field is generally about trying to distract someones attention.        
	Once you understand that, it should never harm you. Thats something all good players have to learn to cope with. If you cant focus on what you have to do, youve got a problem, he said.        
	The whole thing (sledging) has been blown up a great deal for years and not just recently. It sounds very sexy for the media to talk about it, but its not a huge issue from the players point of view, Chappell said.        
	The former Australia captain also felt cricket was going through a great change and the game would be far more demanding than in the past.        
	Cricket is going through a great change at the moment. The game of the future is going to be different from the game in the past, he said.                    (PTI)

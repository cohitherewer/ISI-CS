  - Caught shoplifting, holidaymakers break more laws to return home but get caught          A STAFF REPORTER                                                    
	Calcutta, April 30: The Sayeed family of Chennai took Robert Bruce of Scotland to heart and tried, tried and tried again but landed in a Calcutta lock-up.        
	The itchy fingers of Mumtaz Firoz, a 40-year-old homemaker on holiday, apparently could not resist bottles of perfume and she was charged with shoplifting at the duty-free shop in Bangkok airport, triggering an extraordinary chain of events spread over a week and two countries.        
	Freed on bail but told to stay back in Bangkok till the trial was over, Mumtaz and family  her husband and teenaged daughter  lurched from one folly to another in their desperation to get away.        
	By the time the Chennai-based family was arrested in Calcutta today, they had run up charges ranging from misleading the Indian embassy to sneaking back to the country on a forged passport. The offences have now grown so grave that they carry a punishment of seven to 10 years in an Indian jail  much worse than a fine, or in the worst case a two-year imprisonment, Mumtaz faced in Bangkok.         
	Firoz Iliyas Yusuf Sayeed, 49, a Chennai-based film distributor, Mumtaz and their 16-year-old daughter Mehnaz arrived in Calcutta from Bangkok at 1am on Wednesday by a Thai Airways flight. They were arrested after immigration officials at Calcutta airport found that the photograph on one of the passports was tampered with.        
	Interrogated, they told a tale of tenacity  albeit misplaced  that has something in common with the legendary spider that spun a web after repeated attempts and inspired a down-and-out Bruce, one of the great kings of Scotland, to defeat the English. Bruces refusal to give up had spawned the maxim: try, try, try again.        
	Sayeed and his family had gone to Hong Kong via Bangkok for a vacation, leaving Chennai on April 12. On the return journey, they reached Bangkok on April 20 and were cleared by immigration to leave for Chennai.        
	As the family had some time to kill before the flight took off, they went to the duty-free shop. But Mumtaz was apparently caught stealing a few bottles of perfume, following which she was arrested. A case was started and her passport seized, but she got bail.        
	Mumtaz then approached the Indian embassy in Bangkok on April 22, claiming that she lost her passport. The unsuspecting embassy issued an emergency certificate that could be used in lieu of passport. On April 23, Mumtaz and family tried to leave Bangkok by using the certificate but were stopped by immigration officials whose records showed that legal proceedings involving her were pending.        
	Firoz then approached a tout in Bangkok. The tout advised the family to return to India via Calcutta and pasted Mumtazs picture on a passport issued in the name of Asha Agarwal. This time, the Bangkok immigration did not suspect anything and let the family board the flight to Calcutta.        
	Mumtaz was arrested on the charge of travelling with a forged passport while Firoz and Mehnaz were charged with facilitating travel with fake documesnts, an official said. If convicted, Mumtaz can be imprisoned for 10 years while Firoz and Mehnaz can be jailed for seven years for criminal conspiracy.        
	Sources said it was unlikely Bangkok would push for Mumtazs extradition over an offence such as shoplifting.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 30: If you have applied for a new cooking gas connection, be prepared for a long wait.        
	Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) today confirmed that it had stopped giving fresh domestic LPG connections till it could afford new cylinders  the pent-up fallout of subsidies.         
	The move by the single-largest provider of cooking gas  over 50 per cent of the domestic demand is met by IOC  has resulted in a waiting list of over 2 lakh applicants over the past few months.        
	Ever since the fresh oil shock set in, complaints have been doing the rounds that suppliers had stopped issuing fresh connections. IOC has now become the first company to confirm it.        
	We have not bought new cylinders for almost a year now because of a cash crunch (and so) we do not have equipment to give new connections, IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said.        
	The company has also stopped opening retail outlets for selling petrol and diesel because of mounting losses despite the fuel price increase in June. The government had raised the price of petrol by Rs 5 a litre, diesel by Rs 3 a litre and a 14.2-kg LPG cylinder by Rs 50.        
	These are difficult times. We are faced with a huge working capital shortage. We do not have the working capital to service new consumers. So, temporarily, we have stopped issuing new connections. Consumers are welcome to enrol but we have not given new connections since April, Behuria said.        
	IOC loses Rs 338.53 on every 14.2kg LPG cylinder. The state-owned firm services 56 per cent of the over 9.8 crore LPG consumers in the country. The other key suppliers are the state-owned BPCL and HPCL.        
	We are also trying to restrict diversion (of domestic LPG) for commercial use, Behuria said.        
	Subsidised domestic LPG cylinders are often channelled to hotels, restaurants, automobiles and industrial units that are supposed to use market-priced gas. While the subsidised domestic LPG cylinder is sold at Rs 304.70 in Delhi and Rs 352.05 in Calcutta, the commercial 19kg cylinder fetches Rs 1,047.11 in Delhi and Rs 1,110.95 in Calcutta.        
	The prices of domestic LPG were revised after a long gap. However, commercial cylinders have been undergoing revision every month, depending on global crude oil prices.        
	The huge variation in the cost of domestic and commercial cylinders results in diversion of subsidised gas for commercial use, officials said.        
	We have stopped opening new retail outlets (selling auto fuel) as the losses from the current units are quite substantial amid high global oil prices, a senior IOC official said.        
	However, the company will complete outlets already under construction and those being planned at strategic locations.

          A STAFF REPORTER                            Jupiter                                  
	If you look up at the sky just after sunset, dont be surprised to see two shining objects in the western horizon. The bright spots are not UFOs carrying aliens but something equally thrilling  two planets coming close to offer skygazers a spectacular view.        
	Venus and Jupiter have been converging over the past few days and the grand finale is set for December 1, when the two planets will form a triangle with the Earths moon in the southwestern sky.        
	The unique phenomenon will be visible all over the world. In Calcutta, if one looks at the southwestern sky after sunset on Monday, one can see a shining Venus and an equally bright Jupiter together with a crescent-shaped moon, said Debiprosad Duari, the director of research and academics at the MP Birla Planetarium.        
	The moon-Venus-Jupiter conjuction will be visible till 7.40pm, after which it will set in the southwest horizon. Since the sun will set at 4.41pm on December 1, skygazers in the city will get over two hours to enjoy the spectacular sight.        
	The event can be seen with naked eyes,said Duari. The prominent moons and cloud belts of Jupiter will be visible along with a partially illuminated Venus and the craters of the Earths moon.         
	Venus and Jupiter come close in a sequence. The last occurence was on February 1, 2008, and the next will be two-and-a-half years later, on May 11, 2011. But in 2011, it will occur in the morning.

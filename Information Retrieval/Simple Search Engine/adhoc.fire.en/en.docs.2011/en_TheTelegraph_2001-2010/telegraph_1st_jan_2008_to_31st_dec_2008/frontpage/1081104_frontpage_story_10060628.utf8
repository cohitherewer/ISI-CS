	Washington, Nov. 3: Tuesday is election day in America, the culmination of nearly two years of campaigning in a presidential poll that will go into history books irrespective of its outcome.        
	But in several states across this country, it has been election week all of last week. In some states, they have had an entire election fortnight.        
	Unable to sort out the worlds most advanced countrys chronic problems with electronic voting machines that delayed the popular verdict on choosing a new President eight years ago, many US states this year made elaborate arrangements to allow voters to cast their ballots well before election day.        
	In the prized toss-up state of Florida, according to latest estimates, more than 2.6 million people -- 23 per cent of registered voters -- have already cast ballots at early voting centres.        
	In Floridas Miami-Dade and Broward counties, which became the butt of ridicule all over the world in 2000 for their farcical inability to handle balloting, resulting in a disputed presidential outcome, things were no better even after eight years.        
	In early voting centres in these counties, some people had to wait as long as 12 hours in queues despite arrangements which the state administration claimed were exemplary.        
	Sunday 4pm was the deadline for early voting in Broward county, but the last person in the queue at the Miramar city hall polling booth cast his vote only at 12:45 a.m. the following day, having waited out patiently for his turn for nearly nine hours.        
	In Miami-Dade, it was common to see early voters who had waited in line for six hours or more.Frontrunner Barack Obamas supporters in Florida were determined this year that they would not allow the election -- as they saw it -- to be stolen by the Republicans all over again.        
	As it turned out from the delays encountered during the early voting fortnight, many Floridians would not have been able to vote if the entire voting population had gone to polling stations tomorrow.        
	Judging from previous experience the losers would have the poor and the minorities, who lack the skills, information or the wherewithal to argue their case with local poll officials, who are Republicans in many cases, to press their right to vote in disputes over the accuracy of their addresses or false vote-depriving felony convictions.         
	The poor and the minorities are generally supporting Obama in this election.        
	Last week, Floridas governor Charlie Crist, alarmed by the problems plaguing the states election machine, ordered that early voting hours in Florida should be extended to enable those in the long queues to cast their ballots.But instead of praising the governors action, Republicans in Florida cried foul and complained that Crist had handed the state to Democrats by allowing everyone to vote.        
	Floridas governor is a Republican, but he is said to be unhappy that his partys presidential nominee John McCain overlooked him in the choice of a vice-presidential running mate.        
	North Carolina, a traditionally Republican state, which Obama is attempting to seize tomorrow, surprised everyone this year with 41 per cent of its voters already casting their ballots in early voting.        
	In Georgia, a state which McCain had taken for granted until the national tide turned in favour of Democrat Obama in the wake of the recent economic meltdown, more than 1.7 million of the states 5.6 million registered voters had cast their ballots by the time Georgias early voting schedule closed last weekend.         
	Similarly, in Colorado, another Republican stronghold, 46 per cent of registered voters have already voted. Nationwide, more than 23 million Americans have decided not to wait till Tuesday to vote, in case they are deprived of that right because of shortcomings in the US election system.        
	Only some 30 states in the US allow early voting. Tomorrow night when the votes are counted and if Obama wins, it may entirely be due to extraordinary arrangements made this year for spreading the polls over a week or two through early voting.

                                                                                                           Not on: Reliance power
										      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                        Anil Ambani, mother Kokilaben, wife Tina and son Anshul arrive for the listing ceremony in Mumbai. (PTI)				                                 
	Mumbai, Feb. 11: For the first time on Indias bourses, the Ambani magic didnt work today.        
	Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Power  a company that carried the Reliance moniker but not the weight of Dhirubhai Ambanis legacy  faltered on the first day of listing, sullying a 30-year reputation in the market that any stock that the Ambanis float would translate into a fistful of gains from the moment it listed.        
	The biggest shock for investors was to reconcile to the idea that an Ambani issue might no longer carry with it an aura of invincibility.         
	It had to happen some day, said a veteran investor in Reliance money-spinners. There is no such thing as a sure bet any more.        
	Reliance Power is Indias biggest flotation ever: it raised over Rs 11,500 crore ($3 billion) and arguably the biggest army of shareholders  46 lakh  anywhere in the world.        
	But it isnt a company that was spun off from Dhirubhais Reliance empire when his sons formally split it in January 2006. It was the first company that Anil took to the market amid controversy and allegations that did not stand up to regulatory scrutiny.        
	The issue had been timed right  just when the market had hit its highest level and investors were salivating at the prospect of buying into another Reliance goldmine.        
	Chilly start         
	The day had begun with a slight chill in the morning but there was a warmth of investor anticipation. Anil, wife Tina  who was celebrating her birthday  and mother Kokilaben breezed into the Bombay Stock Exchange at 9.30am.        
	Sporting a white shirt with a blue tint, a purple tie and a jet black suit, Anil looked dapper if a little nervous as he stood up to address investors and the media.        
	He trumpeted the impressive facts: the Reliance Power issue had raised a subscription of $190 billion which was more than the top five IPOs in India.        
	At an average issue price of Rs 455 per share (the retail investors had got a Rs 20 discount), the company was valued at a Rs 1,01,700 crore. He then stepped forward to sound the gong to mark the start of trading.        
	He wasnt to know then that by the end of the day, the companys valuation would plunge to Rs 84,185 crore  a fall of over 17 per cent  and his reputation would take some hard knocks.         
	The stock surged within 10 seconds of the gong, vaulting to a high of Rs 599.90. Power On, India on: the Reliance Power catchline seemed to have electrified the market.        
	The shock        
	But, within minutes, the market started losing ground, sending investors into near-panic as their visions of first-day profits started to disintegrate.        
	Institutional investors scrambled to dump the stock, sending the entire pack of power scrips into a deep dive and dragged the rest of the shares down.        
	When Anil left the bourse at 10.10am, the stock had started to recover. But by mid-afternoon, it was clear that the market would post one of its biggest falls. The sensex tumbled 833 points at close to 16,630.91, the third steepest fall in history.        
	We are naturally disappointed that the Reliance Power stock closed lower than the IPO price on the first day of listing, a spokesperson for the company said.        
	But he added that the Reliance Power stock had fallen 17 per cent since the issue closed on January 18. A very large number of frontline stocks, including Reliance Industries (which belongs to estranged brother Mukesh Ambani), ONGC, DLF and ICICI Bank, have declined in a range of 20 to 40 per cent during the same period, the spokesperson added.        
	Investors would, however, have none of that.         
	I bought shares of Reliance because the Ambanis have a goodwill in the market. But todays events have shattered my expectations. Now, I will have to hold the shares for at least three to four months before I can sell them at a profit, said Pankaj Somani, a retail investor.        
	Mansoor Umar Darvesh said he wouldnt touch Anils future issues.         
	I have learnt a lesson and will definitely not invest any money in the Reliance Infratel IPO (the telecom tower company for which the group has filed a prospectus with Sebi).        
	Some investors were, however, more stoic.         
	Mercifully, the Reliance Power issue was oversubscribed. We got just 17 shares after applying for a maximum of 225 retail shares. So my loss is about Rs 600 on an investment of a little over Rs 7,000. I am not crying my heart out. But I am a little worried about the impact this will have on the stocks of the other companies in Anils group, said one investor.        
	The stocks of two other group companies  Reliance Energy and Reliance Natural Resources  were down 19.4 per cent and 16.4 per cent, respectively.        
	Not every one felt this way. I am not in a hurry to sell Reliance Power shares. I believe that the fundamentals of the company are still strong and the stock will jump to Rs 1,000 within two to three months. I will buy more shares if the price drops to Rs 300, an investor said.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, May 26: The Assam cabinet today constituted a one-man inquiry commission to probe the alleged corruption and financial anomalies in the ASDC-BJP led North Cachar Hills Autonomous District Council.         
	Government spokesperson and health and family welfare minister Himanta Biswa Sarma recently said Raj Bhavan had brought to the notice of the state government how funds were diverted by the council to help DHD (J) rebels.         
	Justice (retd) R.K. Manisena Singh has been asked to probe the charge. Sources said the commission has been given two months to wrap up the probe. Singh was earlier entrusted with the job of probing the violence that broke out during an Adivasi rally at Beltola last year.         
	At a marathon meeting tonight, the cabinet also approved the modalities prepared by the cabinet sub-committee headed by Bhumidhar Barman to update the National Register of Citizens.         
	It also cleared the decks for giving cabinet status to Bhupen Hazarika and Vaishnavite scholar Sonaram Chutia.         
	In another development, Dispur tonight dissolved the elected council body of the Guwahati Municipal Corporation following advice from advocate general A.K. Phookan.         
	Sources said the decision was taken since the term of the sitting mayor, Dolly Bora, expired on May 22. Besides, 27 of the 54 councillors have already resigned.

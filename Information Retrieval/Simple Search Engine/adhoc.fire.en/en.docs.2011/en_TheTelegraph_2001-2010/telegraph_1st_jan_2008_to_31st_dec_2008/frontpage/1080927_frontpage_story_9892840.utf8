          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, Sept. 26: Their plea for a probe was overlooked in the just concluded monsoon session of the Assembly. Today, an NDA delegation met Governor Syed Sibtey Razi to urge him to recommend a CBI probe into businessman Sanjay Choudharys alleged links with politicians.        
	In the petition, the legislators have blamed the government for ignoring evidence in the matter and shielding culprits, of being indifferent to matters of common interest and of plundering the state exchequer openly.        
	Customs officers at Mumbai international airport recently detained Choudhary after he was found carrying Indian and foreign currency worth over Rs 6.14 lakh.        
	Preliminary investigations revealed he was issued a passport on the recommendations of former chief minister Madhu Koda.         
	A series of media reports appearing on the matter thereafter also alleged that Choudhary, in association with Kodas close aides Vinod Sinha and Sunil Sinha, had made large investments in foreign countries.        
	The Opposition alleged the money for the foreign investments was procured by awarding mining leases during the term of the former chief minister and also through illegal posting and transfer of officials.        
	The Opposition tirade continued for days, stalling the Assembly session for three consecutive days. Ultimately the Speaker adjourned the House sine die after the Opposition demand for a thorough CBI inquiry into the matter was turned down by the chief minister Shibu Soren.        
	Soren argued media reports could not form the basis of a CBI probe. Members of the treasury benches, including the chief minister, went to the extent of alleging that Choudhary was a JD(U) member and was closely associated with former Assembly speakers late Mrigendra Pratap Singh and Inder Singh Namdhari, leader of the Opposition Arjun Munda and senior BJP member Saryu Rai.        
	This prompted NDA members to demand that their alleged links with Choudhary, too, should be probed by the CBI.         
	In fact, Saryu Rai made out a written request in this regard to the Speaker. His application has been forwarded to the chief minister for further consideration.

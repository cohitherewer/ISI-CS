          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Imphal, April 27: A father of six was poked by sharp weapons and left to bleed to death by a mob in an Imphal East village last night for allegedly raping a mentally challenged 11-year-old a month ago.        
	By the time his family members found Aheibam Pishak, the 41-year-old was dead.         
	Without a murmur of protest against the street justice, villagers of Andro Makha Leikai cremated Pishak today  not even waiting for a police team to arrive.        
	Pishak had allegedly lured the victim from his neighbouring village into a temple with the promise of sweets and raped her while her family celebrated a festival.        
	The rapist took our daughter inside the temple while the villagers were celebrating Thabal Chongba (dancing in the moonlight) on March 27 night. He assaulted her twice and freed her after giving her Rs 10 and threatening her against revealing the incident to anyone, a relative of the victim said.        
	The girl did not disclose the assault to her parents, but narrated the ordeal to some of her friends who live in Pishaks village.         
	Few details of last nights mob attack are available with the police.         
	Yairipok police station did not register any case about the sexual assault, as the victims family members have not lodged any complaint.         
	Unofficial sources said angry villagers began looking for Pishak late last evening.        
	When they finally spotted him, it was around midnight.         
	Armed with sharp weapons and sticks, the villagers pinned down Pishak and beat him up.        
	It appeared that the mob left him after the assault and the man bled to death.         
	Villagers recovered the body from Andro Kangjeibung this morning.         
	Apparently no one from the village informed the local police station about the incident last night.         
	The police received the report of recovery of a dead body only around noon today.         
	When we reached the village, we found that the body had already been cremated. No one gave us any information about the mob attack or the rape. We received the information from other sources, a police source said.         
	Sources said Pishak had confessed to his crime before being killed. His family had allegedly tried to broker peace with the victims parents, who turned down the offer.         
	The police have registered a case in connection with the killing, but no arrests have been made so far.

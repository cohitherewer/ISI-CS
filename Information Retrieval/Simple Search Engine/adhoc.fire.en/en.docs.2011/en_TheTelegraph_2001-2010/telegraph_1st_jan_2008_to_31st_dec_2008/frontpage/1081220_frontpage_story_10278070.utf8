The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Koda name in berth race
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Koda name in berth race
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 19: With Bihar Governor R.L. Bhatia putting his seal on chief minister Shibu Sorens recommendation to drop Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai from the state cabinet, speculation is rife on who will bag the coveted posts.        
	The names doing the rounds are that of former chief minister Madhu Koda, former minister Chandra Prakash Chaudhary and CPI MLA Ram Chandra Ram. Congress legislators, too, are willing to join the berth race.        
	There is a queue of aspirants, said HRD minister and Soren confidante Bandhu Tirkey. Deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi agreed.         
	The opposition BJP wants Soren to take his time in deciding who would replace Ekka and Rai, as a cabinet with a strength less than 12 would be deemed unconstitutional.         
	BJP legislator Sarayu Roy raised the cabinet issue in the Assembly today and reminded all of the decision taken by former Governor Ved Marwah. Marwah had threatened to invalidate the Arjun Munda government on a similar ground.         
	A Raj Bhavan source, however, said that the chief minister is expected to fill up the berths within a reasonable time frame.         
	According to insiders, Sorens first choice would be his predecessor, Koda. The obvious reason is to wean Koda away from his group of Independents such as Ekka, Rai and water resources minister Kamlesh Singh. If the team leader (read Koda) joins the government it will be easier for Soren to contain dissension, said an aide.        
	Insiders say that state Congress MLAs are also eager to join the race, but believe that their high command may not approve of their wish. Since the Lok Sabha elections are four months away, the Congress will like to wait for the results. Earlier, central leaders did not allow small fries to grab posts in boards and corporations for this reason, said a party legislator.        
	However, the Congress is happy that Soren has walked into their game plan.         
	Tamar is traditionally a Congress stronghold. A defeat there would be demoralising for the party. So, it put pressure on Soren to join the fray. As a trapped chief minister, he had no choice but to try his luck on a new turf and as an Congress ally, the MLA said, requesting anonymity. Now, by making Soren sack the two ministers, both the Congress and the RJD would like to take a moral high ground in the Lok Sabha polls, he added.         
	A senior RJD legislator, who is believed to have played a crucial role in the removal of Ekka and Rai, claimed that a few more heads would roll in January.

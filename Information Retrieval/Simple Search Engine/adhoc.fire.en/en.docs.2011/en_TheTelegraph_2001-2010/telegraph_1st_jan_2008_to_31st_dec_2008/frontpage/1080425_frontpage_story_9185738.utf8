	Ranchi, April 24: Chief minister Madhu Koda today said that a task force of senior officials would be constituted for surprise inspection of the ongoing development schemes.        
	The purpose of the squad would be to make physical verification of the development schemes and recommend actions against errant officials. Koda also said that such officials who deposited development funds in bank, would face action.         
	Koda, who reviewed the development schemes with senior officials, said that various departments could utilise around 85 per cent of the last years budget. He pointed out that the state government utilised Rs 840 crore out of Rs 1,800 crore it got from the Centre. He also directed the officials to keep the accountant-general posted about the fund utilisations.         
	Chief secretary A.K. Basu and development commissioner A.K. Singh attended the meeting.

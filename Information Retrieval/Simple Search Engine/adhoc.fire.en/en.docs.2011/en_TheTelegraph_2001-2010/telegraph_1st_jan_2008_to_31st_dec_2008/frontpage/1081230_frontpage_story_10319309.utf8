                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Funds rush for water projects in Ranchi, Dhanbad
          AMIT GUPTA                                    
	Ranchi, Dec. 29: Water supply schemes for the state and coal capitals finally received the attention they deserved with the Centre agreeing to release part funds for JNNURM projects for Ranchi worth Rs 288 and Dhanbad worth Rs 360.        
	While the Centre has agreed to release 25 per cent of the 80 per cent it will ultimately contribute for Dhanbad water supply project, it has already sanctioned Rs 57 crore for Ranchi.         
	Besides, the Union ministry of urban development today sanctioned an additional Rs 40.9 crore under the integrated housing scheme for the poor  known as Basic Services for Urban Poor (BSUP)  for upgrading 10 more slums in Ranchi.         
	The state capital has already been sanctioned Rs 169 crore under BSUP for upgrading 42 slum areas.         
	 Rahul Kumar Purwar, CEO Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) CEO told The Telegraph that a national-level steering committee meeting held by the ministry for Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission projects decided to approve the additional Rs 40.9 crore under BSUP.         
	 Besides, the ministerial authorities told us they had agreed in principle to the water supply project in Dhanbad. Its a Rs 360 crore scheme and we are hopeful that the Centre would soon release 25 per cent of the 80 per cent central share under JNNURM, said Purwar.         
	 He added the RMC had already received Rs 57 crore from the Centre (25 per cent of the Centres 80 per cent share) and had invited tenders for the water supply revamp project that aims to factor in the growing needs of the capitals ever-increasing population.         
	As of now, the RMCs jurisdiction is over 175 sq km catering to 12.66 lakh residents. Only 30 per cent of the area has piped water supply. The rest manage on their own.         
	Water supply requirements stood at 231 MLD (million litres per day) and the availability of both untreated and treated water was 246 MLD. By 2024, the citys population was expected to go up to 19.98 lakh and the water demand to 360 MLD. Similarly, in 2039 the population was expected to touch 31.40 lakh with the water demand at 548 MLD.         
	The water supply projects envisaged by the state and accepted by the Centre involve the construction of more intake wells from neighbouring water reservoirs, water treatment plants, an improved distribution network et al.        
	The projects would also ensure a system of compulsory water audits covering not just domestic, but also commercial users aiming for cent per cent metering of water supply.         
	However, officials in the ministry added the state could reap full benefits of the central fund provided it seriously acts on the reform agendas that it must comply with to qualify for funds under JNNURM.        
	Jharkhand has already lost three years to make the most of the Centres Rs 50,000 crore kitty under JNNURM.        
	Now, only three more years are left  as the scheme ends in 2012.

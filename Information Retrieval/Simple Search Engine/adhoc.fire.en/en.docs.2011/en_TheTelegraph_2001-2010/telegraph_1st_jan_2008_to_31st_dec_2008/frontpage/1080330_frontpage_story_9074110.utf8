The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Raids reveal militant nexus in Meghalaya
                                                                                                           Raids reveal militant nexus in Meghalaya
          E.M. JOSE                              
	Shillong, March 29: The Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) and the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) have set up a well-coordinated extortion racket in Meghalaya.        
	Two days after the police busted a joint camp of the two outfits in the Jaintia Hills, sources today said the NLFT provides arms and ammunition to the HNLC. The latter, in turn, shares its extortion booty with the NLFT.        
	The arrest of six HNLC cadres on Wednesday and the busting of a joint camp at Umkiang in the Jaintia Hills on Thursday revealed how the outfits worked in tandem.         
	Two HNLC rebels, Leader alias Laitmon from Mawsynram and Vicky Majaw from Lawbah, were also killed during the attack on Thursday.         
	The police said the rebels were armed with high frequency Japanese wireless sets, provided by the NLFT. These sets facilitate communication in the remote areas of Jaintia Hills where the HNLC has set up camps. The police admitted that the militants had excellent communication facilities. The Japanese sets are not legally circulated in India.         
	Inspector general (Special Branch) S.B. Singh told this correspondent today that the HNLC and the NLFT had initiated the tie-up three years ago. The HNLC militants also receive protection from the NLFT, as their camps are adjacent to each other in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. The tie-up between HNLC and NLFT has existed since 2005, with the NLFT imparting training to the HNLC at camps in Bangladesh.        
	The HNLC conducts extortion drives in Meghalaya, especially in the coal rich areas of Jaintia Hills. The HNLC militants address the NLFT leaders as saathi (friend) and are learning each others languages for better communication, police added.        
	The total strength of HNLC rebels in the Bangladesh camps is estimated to be around 70, police said.        
	Based on the confessions of the arrested militants, police confirmed that the fire power of the HNLC has diminished over the past few years. The police had earlier controlled the extortion drive of the HNLC by busting several financial cells in Shillong and also arresting and killing many rebels of its finance wing.        
	Since 2003, at least 250 HNLC militants have surrendered. It appears that the top HNLC leaders in Bangladesh do not want to lose any of their cadres and hence sought the assistance of NLFT, a senior police officer said.        
	On December 16, Meghalaya police busted a joint camp of the HNLC and NLFT at Narpuh reserve forest in the Jaintia Hills.        
	Meanwhile, the publicity secretary of the HNLC, Sainkupar Nongtraw, said in a statement here today that the outfit would continue to fight.                                
	 The HNLC also expressed its condolences to the relatives of the two slain militants.

	Seoul, Aug. 5 (AP): Booger is back.        
	An American woman received five puppies today that were cloned from her beloved late pit bull, becoming the inaugural customer of a South Korean company that says it is the worlds first successful commercial canine cloning service.        
	Seoul-based RNL Bio said the clones of Bernann McKinneys dog Booger were born last week after being cloned in cooperation with a team of Seoul National University scientists who created in 2005 the worlds first cloned dog  a male Afghan hound named Snuppy.        
	Its a miracle! McKinney repeatedly shouted when she saw the cloned Boogers at a Seoul National University laboratory. Yes, I know you! You know me, too! she said, hugging the tiny black puppies, which were sleeping with one of their two surrogate mothers, both Korean mixed breed dogs.        
	Independent tests confirmed the 2005 dog cloning was genuine, and Lee Byeong-chuns team has since cloned some 30 dogs and five wolves. RNL Bio said that its cloning of Booger was the first successful commercial cloning of a canine, adding it will offer the service to customers worldwide.

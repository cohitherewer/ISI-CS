  - A voice from the past delivers the author from temptation                                        
	The writer continues her narrative of the suitors whose paths crossed hers during her stay at Vrindavan...              
	The tonga wended its way down the lane. In the silence of the moonlit evening, the clattering of the wheels and the thwacking of hoofs were distinctly audible. The rest was silence.         
	The ruins of the ancient temples, partly covered by the prickly shrubs, acquired an air of mystery under the pale moon. They stood as silent testimony to the transitoriness of life and things.         
	By the time we reached Munni Gautams home, the night was fairly advanced. She got down at the gate, but her brother remained seated in the tonga to escort me to my place. The carriage now advanced along the road to Aathkhamba and Gopinath Bazar.         
	The clattering of the wheels and thwacking of the hoofs became more pronounced in the silence of the night. It was a gravelled road and we had a jerky ride. Often, the young mans body touched mine. I had the feeling as if it was Madhu sitting by me, as if I was visiting in his company the temples on the bank of the Cauvery, as in the old days. As we reached the chariot house near Rangajis temple, the tonga stopped. I got down from the carriage, and waited under the kadamba tree in the temple premises for him to pay the tongawallahs fare. It was a strange experience for me to find drops of water dripping from the tree whenever I stood under it, for which I could find no explanation.                                 
	The young man and I then took a short cut along Brahmakunda, to the place where Imarati Bai sang her bhajans and from there to the ramshackle house. By then, it was quite clear to me that my friends brother was wholly drawn to me.         
	My room in the temple premises being close by, I could retire to it any moment. The possibility must have irked him, for in his heart of hearts, he never wanted that we part just then and there. I presumed that was what passed in his mind at that moment. I do not know why, but I suddenly felt an impulse to view the beauty of Brahmakunda in the moonlight, from the top to the crumbling building. I could not account for the impulse. Was it because an instinct, long dormant, suddenly wanted to find an outlet? Or was it for some other reason? It was almost midnight. I was slowly making my way to the roof along the mossy flight of stairs. I saw the young man also closely following me.         
	The moon reflected even on the turbid waters of the Brahmakunda. It resembled not so much the bright object in the sky that it was but a peacock trapped in a net and smarting for escape, as it were.         
	The young man, my lover, was standing by my side. That was the moment when I could have surrendered my whole being to him, a natural human desire  which was suppressed by fate and circumstances since Madhus death  but I could once more indulge myself in it. There stood the charming young man, enamoured by me, looking intently at my figure. At the slightest indication from me, he would have instantly taken me in his arms, and showered my whole body with hot kisses.         
	It was a tense moment. Time stood still.         
	Then it all happened. The sky over my head came crumbling down and fell in chunks into the Brahmakunda. Simultaneously, the bells in the ruined temples seemed to have suddenly started chiming and made the air resonant. It seemed Imarati Bai, the bhajan singer, who had long given up the ghost, was standing by me and adjusting my clothes, dishevelled in the catastrophe. She whispered into my ears.         
	I descended the stairs, took the same short cut and arrived near the main entrance of the temple. For long, my young lover also stood there. What he said to me then resounded in my ears long afterwards, I cant tell you in so many words, what is welling up in my heart. But before you go  must you go? Before you go, pray listen to me.         
	Thanks to a rare sense of self-confidence that I had suddenly acquired, I did not surrender myself to him at that midnight hour. Thereafter, I never met the young man alone again. Once again I fell into the arms of my dead husband.

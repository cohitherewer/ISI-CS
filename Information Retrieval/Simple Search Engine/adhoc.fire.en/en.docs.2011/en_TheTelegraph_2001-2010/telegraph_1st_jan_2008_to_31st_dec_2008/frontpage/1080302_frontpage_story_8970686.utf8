The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sonia calls for peace, progress 
                                                                                                           Sonia calls for peace, progress 
  - Shun violence, AICC chief tells youth        SAMIR K. PURKAYASTHA                                    
	Dimapur, March 1: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today wooed youths in insurgency-wracked Nagaland with promises of a better future.         
	Reminding them of the futility of violence during her whirlwind election rallies in Mokokchung and Dimapur for the March 5 Assembly elections, Sonia said those who believed in guns to settle differences would never succeed. Problems could be resolved peacefully taking into consideration the views of all, she added.         
	In a democracy we have to take into consideration the views of all concerned and the youth have to shun the path of violence, she told the gathering here. Many youths in the state are trying to fulfil their aspirations through violence. It is a false dream.         
	Sonia said the Constitution was flexible enough to meet the aspirations of various sections of society and reiterated her partys commitment to fulfil those dreams.         
	The AICC president said dreams could be fulfilled through development, for which there must be peace, stability and security and these precursors could be provided only by the Congress which had once given statehood to the Naga people.         
	Using Hindi and English to convey that the Congress would usher in an era of development, Sonia added: I know what we have done so far is not enough. The state needs to progress further and the Congress is committed to bring development to Nagaland.        
	She said her party was committed to giving thrust to the development of roads, communication network and agriculture in the state.         
	Claiming that the UPA government had initiated the development process in the Northeast, Sonia said the Centre had allocated Rs 50,000 crore in the Eleventh Plan only for the road sector in the region. This huge fund is being allotted with a condition that it must be utilised properly, she added.        
	She also said Delhi had released funds for the construction of the Dimapur-Kohima railway line and had given priority to development of cross-border trade between the region and the neighbouring countries. Three border trade points had been identified in Nagaland, she added.        
	She criticised the Nagaland Peoples Front-led Democratic Alliance of Nagaland (DAN), which was in power before the imposition of Presidents rule in the state, for its politics of corruption and violence.        
	The UPA government at the Centre allocated funds for the development of the state. You should ask the DAN government where the money has gone.... You know better how the money has been utilised, she said.        
	The Congress star campaigner, in Ao attire, did not disappoint the thousands of supporters who had converged at the twin rallies to see and hear her.         
	Etia bhi tai bisi sundar ase (Till today she is very beautiful), said a party worker who was sitting near the press enclosure in Dimapur. To him she is the smartest woman he has ever come across.         
	If the Congressman was captivated by his leaders charm when she entered the chock--block Dimapur District Sport Complex, she left him awestruck before leaving the ground. As she rushed towards the crowd after addressing it  much to the chagrin of the Special Protection Group (SPG) guards, the party worker extended his hand over the bamboo barricade and, to his delight, she shook it.        
	Before addressing the gathering here, Sonia spoke at the Imkongmeren Sports Ground at Mokokchung.                     (WITH AGENCY REPORTS)

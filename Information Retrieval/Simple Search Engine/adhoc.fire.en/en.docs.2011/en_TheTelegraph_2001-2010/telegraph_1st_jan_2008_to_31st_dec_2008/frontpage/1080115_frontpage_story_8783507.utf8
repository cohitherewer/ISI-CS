	San Francisco, Jan. 14: Apple Inc had an incredible 2007. It launched the iPhone, saw a huge rise in Macintosh computers sales and enjoyed the near doubling of its stock price.
    
	As people flock to the annual Macworld Conference amp; Expo here this week, one thing is less clear: How will Apple, which has become the It company of digital life, top last year?
    
	That question will be answered in part tomorrow when Apple chief executive Steve Jobs takes the stage at the Moscone Center for one of his highly anticipated Macworld keynote speeches. He is expected to explain his vision for the companys future and introduce new products and services, including online movie rentals through the iTunes Music Store. 
    
	Over the years, Apples health has been reflected by attendance at Macworld, which is produced by IDG World Expo Corporation. For this years show, the 24th, vital signs are good. More than 50,000 people are expected to attend, 10,000 more than last year. The number of exhibitors has jumped 20 per cent to 475, and for the second year in a row, organisers are tapping space in a second conference hall.
    
	Exhibitors showing off Macintosh-related accessories include such Apple competitors as Microsoft Corporation, Hewlett-Packard and IBM Corporation.
    
	Clearly these are the gravy days for the Cupertino, California, company. But industry analysts say its growth is expected to slow this year, in part because of concerns about the economys effect on consumer spending.
    
	After soaring to a record closing price of $199.83 on December 28, Apples stock has dropped 13.6 per cent, ending Friday at $172.69. Some wonder whether Apple has peaked.

  - Jharkhand Olympic panel upset with state govt, wants to stay out of contracts          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA ARUN KUMAR THAKUR                                    
	Ranchi, May 30: Convinced that a lackadaisical state government would not be able to pull off the 34th National Games in December, the Jharkhand Olympic Association (JOA) has virtually washed its hands off the event: It will not be a party to any agreement pertaining to the Games.         
	On May 25, when state sports minister Bandhu Tirkey announced the Games schedule from December 1 to 13, he said it had been finalised by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).        
	But significantly, the chairman of the National Games Organising Committee (NGOC), chief minister Madhu Koda, and the Jharkhand Olympic Association president, R.K. Anand  he is also NGOC working chairman  were among those who skipped the announcement ceremony.         
	I brought the Games to Jharkhand. Now, it all depends on the state government to stick to the schedule, said a disappointed Anand.        
	But they (government) are not taking responsibility. The rains are likely to start in a weeks time and the construction is sure to get hampered, he added, referring to the work on building various sports infrastructure that had been inordinately delayed.        
	So, the JOA will not be a party to any agreements related to the National Games, Anand, a Supreme Court lawyer, said.        
	The JOA chief felt various business firms who had taken up jobs like catering, house keeping, supplying sports goods among others would end up seeking damages if the Games werent held on schedule. So, the JOA will not be responsible for any financial liabilities, he added.        
	IOA president Suresh Kalmadi presided over the first NGOC meeting on April 12 after visiting the Hotwar games complex. At the time, he had said the IOA would schedule the Games either in the second half of November or early December.         
	Government sources maintained the IOA should have consulted the state government as well as the JOA before finalising the date. We merely made public the schedule fixed by the IOA, Tirkey said.        
	Kalmadi refused comment, saying he was travelling in Canada.        
	But sports secretary R.S. Verma rubbished Anands statement. The JOA, he told The Telegraph, has nothing to do with the agreements. It is concerned with the games part only. The sports secretary being the organising secretary will be signing agreements on behalf of the NGOC.        
	Verma clarified the government would add a clause in the agreement freezing the rates charged for the next one year. So, even if the Games are rescheduled, we will not have to face any financial liability. Then the firms cannot claim damages on account of the delay, he maintained.         
	Verma, however, added the government was working very hard to ensure the infrastructure was ready on time. We are trying our best. These days, I am working more as a junior engineer than a secretary, he quipped.         
	In fact, the real concern was that there were few takers for the contracts on offer which. There are only two parties each for catering and housekeeping. We have got three bidders for event management. And there was only one bidder in accreditation. So, we will have to cancel it and float fresh tenders, Verma said.        
	ITDC stayed away from the catering contract. The ITDC served food at the Guwahati National Games by sub-letting the job. But we had stipulated that it could not sub-let. So, ITDC did not apply, he said.

  - Morcha tactics anti-national: Buddha        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Siliguri, Aug. 17: The Bengal government will exercise patience while addressing the situation in the Darjeeling hills despite chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today describing the tactics adopted by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha as anti-national and undemocratic.        
	Bhattacharjee while addressing journalists at Phansidewa, 20km from here, this afternoon said his government was monitoring the development in the hills. When his attention was drawn to vehicles sporting GL number plates and the manner in which GNLF and CPM members were being driven out of the hills, the chief minister came down heavily on the not-yet-a-year old Darjeeling outfit.        
	What they are resorting to are anti-national activities. They are closing down government offices and hampering revenue collection. These are not democratically acceptable, the chief minister said. Asked how the government would tackle such lawlessness, Bhattacharjee softened his stance. We will be patient with them and not do anything that will turn into a law and order situation. There will be several rounds of talks both at the state and at the tripartite level in Delhi and matters will be resolved through them, Bhattacharjee said.        
	We will be patient as long as it is required, the chief minister said when asked how long his government was willing to carry on with the talks.        
	The chief minister also welcomed the Morcha assurance to travel operators and tourists that there would be no strikes or disruptions during Puja holidays. This is a very positive development and I appeal to all to keep Darjeeling tension-free during the winter vacations as well when there is a huge rush of tourists to destinations in the hills.         
	Earlier in the day, Bhattacharjee held a meeting at the circuit house here to assess the situation in the three districts of Darjeeling, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri.         
	While there was the Morcha movement in the hills, the chief minister is understood to have wanted to know the status of the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation in Jalpaiguri and the Greater Cooch Behar Democratic Party in Cooch Behar. All three outfits have been demanding separate states. Present at the meeting with him were the three district magistrates and the divisional commissioner of Japlaiguri range, K.L. Meena, who is also the caretaker-administrator of the DGHC.        
	We have reviewed the situation in these three districts and the recent disturbances that have taken place in the region. We have also decided on a plan of action, which we cannot reveal, Bhattacharjee said while leaving Phansidewa.

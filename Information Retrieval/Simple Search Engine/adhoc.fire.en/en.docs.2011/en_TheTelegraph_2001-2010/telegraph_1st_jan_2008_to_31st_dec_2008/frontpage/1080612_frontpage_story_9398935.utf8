	Siliguri, June 11: Nine tourists, including two elderly couples from Calcutta, were attacked this evening by alleged Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters when they were returning from the Chapramari forest in the Dooars.        
	The mob in a mini-truck, which claimed it was enforcing the hill bandh, rained stones on two cars carrying the tourists, injuring them.         
	Satish Sinha and his wife Indira and Amal Ghosh and his wife Sulekha and the driver of their Bolero, Uttam Roy, had to get off and flee into the forest, all of them bleeding, said Kamal Bhowmik, secretary of the Lataguri Resort Owners Association.        
	The couples in their sixties, who live in Behala, suffered deep cuts when the stones and glass shards from the shattered windscreen hit them, he said.         
	Divisional forest officer Tapas Das said Morcha supporters had warned staff at the Lataguri booking counter not to issue passes to tourists. Lataguri and Chapramari are in Jalpaiguri district, where there is no shutdown. We ignored them but they attacked the last tourists to come out.        
	The injured were taken to Mangalbari health centre, 5km away, in a forest jeep with an escort. They had bruises on the forehead, cheeks and arms, Bhowmik said, adding that the tourists were too shaken to speak.        
	Driver Uttam said: Dada, it was terrible we somehow managed to escape. Police sources said the Bolero was later set on fire.        
	Five tourists in a Tata Sumo escaped with minor injuries and did not need to be taken to the health centre.        
	Das said the forest would remain open tomorrow although entry is usually closed on Thursdays.        
	But the Eastern Himalayan Travel and Tour Operators Association has urged tourists to avoid the region till a confirmation in writing is received from the government that it is safe for visitors.         
	The Amra Bangali group has called a 24-hour Siliguri bandh tomorrow.        
	The Morcha, which denied a role in the attack and blamed the CPM, has announced a two-day relaxation in its indefinite shutdown from 6pm today to 6am on Saturday.

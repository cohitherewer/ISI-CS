The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Overbooking ejects 60 from flight to US
                                                                                                        Overbooking ejects 60 from flight to US
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Flight confirmed?                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 8: You may have booked your ticket on Indias national carrier six months ago, but thats clearly no guarantee that you would be on that plane to Chicago or London.        
	That is what Air India said to a group of passengers with valid tickets today, leaving them in the lurch at Mumbai airport.        
	Around 60 passengers, including students travelling to universities in the US, were stranded at the airport early this morning after Air India told them their valid tickets could not earn them a seat on the A-125 Mumbai-London-Chicago flight. The reason: the flight was overbooked.        
	I was told one hour before the flight time that my seat was no longer valid. They told us we would be accommodated tomorrow. There was no explanation given. Here I am, left with dummy tickets, said Vivek B., a student who had a valid ticket to Chicago.        
	Some agitated passengers had noisy fights with Air India officials when they were kept waiting in the queue while the boarding-pass counter was abruptly shut.        
	I could hear people shouting as the queue did not move ahead for nearly an hour. But there was no airline official to provide us any information. Some time later, an official informed us that we had been offloaded and simply left, said a woman passenger who did not wish to be named.        
	For four hours, we have been waiting here. My wife is sitting there completely exhausted. No one even provided us any water or snacks. I travel to India every year and I can understand flight delays on long-haul flights, but Air India should have the basic courtesy to take care of its passengers, said an upset Manish, who was travelling with his family to the US.         
	An Air India spokesperson said overbooking of flights was a global practice in the aviation industry to counter last-minute cancellations by passengers and dismissed it as a routine operational problem. Usually, all airlines overbook flights up to 10 to 15 per cent to ensure that in case of last-minute cancellations, the flights do not go empty.        
	He said the incident happened at 7.30am when the airline discovered that all confirmed passengers had arrived on time, causing a problem.         
	In case we have to offload passengers, we ensure they get to travel on the first flight available, provide them total hospitality. They can also call and inform their families. Some passengers were put on other flights travelling on the same sector. Others have been accommodated in hotels and will travel tomorrow morning, the official said.

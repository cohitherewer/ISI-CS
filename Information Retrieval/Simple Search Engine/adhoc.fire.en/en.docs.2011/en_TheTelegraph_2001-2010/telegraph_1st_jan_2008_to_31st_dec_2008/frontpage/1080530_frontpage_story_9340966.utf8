The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Child talent shows under rights glare
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Child talent shows under rights glare
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                             Child actor Darsheel Safary in Taare Zameen Par                                  
	New Delhi, May 29: Producers and directors of television child talent hunts and parents of kids who participate in such shows might soon be in trouble with the Centre for alleged exploitation of the children.         
	The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights is studying the legality of encouraging children to sing and dance under intense public scrutiny for a reward, top government officials said.         
	Talent hunts for children have mushroomed across both national and regional language channels over the past year. On the shows, children generally perform before a team of judges and a studio audience, competing for a prize  money in some cases, career opportunities in others.         
	Indias apex child rights guardian has received a slew of complaints targeting the talent shows on grounds of allegedly violating child labour laws and indulging in other forms of exploitation, the sources said.         
	The commission is very upset at the manner in which children are allegedly being pushed by parents and encouraged by television producers and directors to contest in these shows. We feel this may be a violation of child labour laws, a top official said.         
	Asked whether the commission was planning action against parents or producers and directors of such shows, Sandhya Bajaj, a member of the panel, confirmed that it was contemplating steps to curb any exploitation on the programmes.         
	We have received complaints and are concerned. We are studying the matter and will finalise our plan of action soon, Bajaj told The Telegraph.         
	Women and child development minister Renuka Chowdhury was also concerned about the working conditions of children participating in such shows, ministry sources said.         
	Commission sources said some of the complaints had alleged that television channels, producers and directors were exploiting children for profits.         
	Parents, the complainants alleged, are pressurising children to perform on the shows.         
	Child actors have been performing in popular films for decades. Taare Zameen Par, one of the biggest hits in recent times, has a child, Darsheel Safary, playing the lead role.         
	But the relative frequency and all-pervasive nature of the talent shows is the reason that officials  at both the child rights panel and the ministry  plan to target these programmes first.         
	Movies either have children playing small roles, or  as in the case of TZP  a single child in a major role. Films, too, will come under the scanner, a ministry source said.         
	Child labour laws in India identify a set of activities where a blanket ban on employment of children is in place. Participating in television shows or in movies is not included in the list of such activities.         
	But the laws also ban employers and parents from indulging in certain practices within employment-related activities legally allowed for children. These are aimed at ensuring better working conditions for children in jobs not banned legally for children.         
	Once the internal study is complete, the Centre plans to either write directly to producers and directors and through them to parents of contestants, or seek a reprimand for channels from the information and broadcasting ministry.

	Ranchi: Ending days of shadow boxing, Governor Syed Sibtey Razi today directed the state chief information commissioner, justice (retired) Hari Shankar Prasad, to withdraw his controversial order detailing his own post-retirement benefits.         
	He also told Prasad, who is to retire after two days, to contact the state government for his retirement benefits.        
	The Governors office had taken umbrage at the commissions decision to frame its own rules, apparently to bypass the state government. Today, Razi set the record straight and said in case of any conflict over regulations, the state would prevail. Razi also sought annual reports of all the commissions cases.

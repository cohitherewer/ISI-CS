          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, April 12: As was widely expected, Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi wasnt too pleased with the slow progress of work at the main stadium complex in Hotwar where the proposed 34th National Games are to be held.         
	But to the surprise of all, he had a change of heart after a meeting with chief minister Madhu Koda and sports minister Bandhu Tirkey and declared that he was convinced all pending construction work would be ready in time not only in Ranchi, but also in Jamshedpur and Dhanbad  the other two Games venues.         
	On reaching here, Kalmadi visited Hotwar where the main stadium is being built. There, IOA technical expert A.V.S. Prasad told him clearly that he did not notice any progress in the stadium work since January 31 when he had last visited the site.         
	In fact, while taking the rounds of the stadiums, Kalmadi, too, expressed his displeasure at the tardy progress of work. But, things turned around after he reached the Games secretariat to chair the first meeting of the National Games Organising Committee. Emerging from the meeting, Kalmadi said he was quite satisfied with the progress not only in Ranchi, but also in Jamshedpur and Dhanbad.         
	The infrastructure will be completed by September 30 and dates for Games will be fixed sometime towards the end of November or beginning of December, he added.        
	Kalmadi said Koda had assured him that work would be speeded up.         
	Organising panel vice-chairman and Jharkhand Olympic Association president R.K. Anand was conspicuous by his absence, along with over a dozen other members.        
	Also, the meeting which was scheduled to begin at 3pm started an hour late. Koda, who is chairman of the organising committee, came late, while Tirkey was delayed in Dumka where he attended the Sidho-Kanho Murmu Universitys first convocation.

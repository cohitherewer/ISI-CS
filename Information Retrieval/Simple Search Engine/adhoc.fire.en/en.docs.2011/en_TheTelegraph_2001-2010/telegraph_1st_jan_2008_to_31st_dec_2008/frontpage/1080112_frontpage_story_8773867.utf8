     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
              Basu
                 
	Calcutta, Jan. 11: If a CPM blunder denied Jyoti Basu the crown of India in 1996, it is up to the party to decide whether to opt for convenient slumber now and let the patriarch accept the jewel of Bharat.
    
	The Centre has not yet announced whether it would confer the Bharat Ratna on Basu  or on anyone at all  this year, but L.K. Advanis advocacy of Atal Bihari Vajpayees name has raised the tantalising possibility of the UPA government opting for a balancing act by choosing the CPM veteran also.
    
	The honours pot started boiling again today when CPM Bengal chief Biman Bose was asked about Basus likely nomination. I dont know about the parameters on the basis of which Bharat Ratna is conferred on an individual. But if Basu fulfils the parameters, they (the Union government) can think over it. 
    
	Bose chose his words carefully but there is an element of digression from the official CPM stand of opposition to its leaders accepting such awards.
    
	If the Centre does want to nominate Basu, Boses comments suggest that such a proposal could force the party to revisit 1996 in a different context.
    
	In 1996, the party rejected a proposal by the United Front to make Basu the Prime Minister. But Basu himself and the then CPM general secretary, Harkishen Singh Surjeet, were in favour of the proposal.
    
	The current party chief, Prakash Karat, was among the naysayers. Karat has so far not given any indication that he wants to revise the party policy against official awards.
    
	But if the party looks the other way and decides not to make an issue when Basu is in the autumn of his life, such a gesture might be the balm Karat can apply on Bengals pride wounded by the denial of the most important job.
    
	The subject came up today while Bose was speaking to reporters at the party office after a media conference. The CPM chief was reacting to Advanis appeal. The BJP is playing politics by urging the Centre that the countrys highest award be conferred on Vajpayee, he said.
    
	CPM central committee member Benoy Konar was more categorical than Bose. We shall not object in principle if Bharat Ratna, the countrys highest award, is conferred on Jyoti Basu. But the party will not recommend his name to the Centre as the BJP is shamelessly doing for Vajpayee, Konar said tonight.
    
	There will be no question of a change in the CPMs known position towards such awards if Basus name does not figure at all. The problem will crop up for the party if Basu himself decides to accept the honour in case the Centre chooses him.

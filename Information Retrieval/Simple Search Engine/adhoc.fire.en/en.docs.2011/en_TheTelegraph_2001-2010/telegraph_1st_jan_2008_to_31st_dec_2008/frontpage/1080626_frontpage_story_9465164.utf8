  - Dispur responds to Ulfa splinter groups truce offer with that of help          A STAFF REPORTER                                                         Security officers inspect arms surrendered by Ulfa militants at Tamulpur in Assam on Tuesday. (PTI)      
	Guwahati, June 25: The state government today offered safe passage and other help to all members of Ulfa who are willing to come overground, responding to the unilateral ceasefire declared by a splinter group of the outfit last night.        
	The Alpha and Charlie companies of Ulfas largest and most potent 28 battalion declared a truce and called upon the outfits central executive and the government to start the peace process.         
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi today hailed the ceasefire move as a step in the right direction and said it was in the interest of the country, its people and for the future generations.         
	Gogoi hoped the other battalions of the outfit, too, would follow suit.         
	The government will make all efforts and provide all facilities to bring them to the mainstream so that they can lead a normal life with honour and dignity and serve society in a meaningful manner, the chief minister said.         
	Assam director general of police R.N. Mathur said the government was making arrangements for accommodation of the Ulfa functionaries who announced the truce last night.         
	The groups would be provided vocational training at the camps where they will be put up, the chief minister said. We will try to accommodate them in two to three camps and provide them all security, Mathur added.         
	He said nearly 150 cadres of the two companies have come overground and several others are willing to do so. The leaders of 28 battalion who offered truce told us that the A and C companies would come overground too. Since they are scattered in various places, we will facilitate their joining the mainstream.         
	Operations against the 28 battalion had been stalled, he added. But operations would continue against those who were unwilling to give up violence.         
	Mathur said the pro-peace group has also accepted four conditions laid down by the government for any militant group wishing to enter a ceasefire. The conditions are: the group will have to deposit arms to the government, it will have to stay in designated camps, it will not be allowed to collect any donations or contributions and talks will be held within the framework of the Constitution.                           
	There were indications from the home department that the state government would ink a formal ceasefire agreement with the breakaway group within a day or two.         
	Gauhati High Court today quashed the detention of Peoples Consultative Group member Lachit Bordoloi under the National Security Act. He was arrested on February 12 for alleged links with Ulfa.         
	Setting aside an order passed by the district magistrate (Kamrup metro), P. Hajela, on March 29, a divisional bench of the high court comprising Justice A.H. Saikia and Justice Hareswar Baruah said Bordoloi should be released if not wanted in connection with any other case.

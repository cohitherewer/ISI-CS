	April 4: The labour laws ignored them and no trade union came to their aid. Yet, five workers who toiled four shifts every day of the year, in rain and shine, are trumpeting a famous victory at the Jim Corbett National Park.        
	The elephants on the parks popular safari service have won a days holiday every week, complete with a sort of office party so they can de-stress themselves.        
	Every Monday, the five elephants will be taken off their duty of ferrying tourists. The tourist flow is thinnest on Mondays, park deputy director Parag Madhukar said.         
	They will be taken to big lakes where they can splash about and chill out by spraying water on one another.        
	The unions can eat their heart out  the elephants will get regular body massages and health check-ups, too.        
	The popularity of the elephant safari  the parks biggest revenue grosser  meant that the animals worked without a break, carrying tourists through deep valleys, dense forests and craggy trails. During the October-April peak season, some 150-200 tourists take the safari every day, so five more elephants are requisitioned from other parks.        
	The animals were under tremendous strain. Sometimes they would just stop and refuse to budge, said Shahid Ahmad, a mahout and tourist escort.        
	Park authorities said some of the elephants longed for some fun and relaxation. A month ago, two males had disappeared with a female that had come near their enclosure from the jungles.        
	They were brought back after a long search from the northern side of the park, an official said.        
	Modelled on African elephant safaris, the one at the Jim Corbett National Park offers a view of beautiful landscapes and streams and a wide variety of animals such as big cats, hog deer, sloth bears, gharials and turtles.        
	The tourists behaviour often increased the elephants stress levels, a wildlife expert working at the park said. The animals are exposed to high decibels of noise; they are often subjected to undesirable attention from the holidaying crowd.        
	Park director Rajiv Bharkari consulted a team of elephant experts who studied the animals lifestyle and advised a days break every week.        
	We hope the stressed-out elephants will regain their physical and mental health now, said P.N. Joshi, park spokesperson. The park will stay open on Mondays but there will be no safaris.        
	R.K. Rao, a Dehra Dun-based elephant specialist, said: A days break is welcome. But the park authorities need to increase the number of elephants in the safari team. Then they can sometimes give the animals a proper vacation in the midst of nature.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rushdie ghost haunts Padma 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Rushdie ghost haunts Padma 
          AMIT ROY                            Padma Lakshmi: Identity crisis?                                        
	London, July 15: Padma Lakshmi must be wondering whether she did the right thing divorcing Salman Rushdie, who, it is known, was keener on her than any of his three previous wives.        
	While Rushdie has been to Buckingham Palace to collect a knighthood from the Queen and managed to get two sons by different wives to collect his Booker of Bookers last week, Padma attended a funky party in London by way of trying to make a new life for herself as an independent woman.        
	This isnt easy for her because she will acknowledge, if she is honest, that her main claim to fame is that she was once married to Rushdie.        
	That is almost certainly why she was invited to the annual Summer Arts Party hosted by Quintessentially, which describes itself as the global luxury lifestyle group.        
	Back in the US, where the India-born Padma has grown up, she likes to call herself an author, chef and actress but in London she is familiar only to those who study tabloid gossip columns and have seen her photographed alongside her former husband.        
	The Daily Express noted her presence in a recent gossip column, headlined Padmas back on the party scene.        
	Padma Lakshmi is more often spotted on the other side of the pond these days since finding fame with US cookery show Top Chef, it noted. But the 37-year-old, who filed for divorce from author Salman Rushdie last summer, was back on the London party circuit this week for the posh Quintessentially Summer Arts party.        
	We dont get to see much of Padma in London these days, reports our man with the champagne flute. She looked absolutely stunning as usual but some partygoers worried about red faces as she realised that Zafar Rushdie, her former stepson (Salmans son with his first wife, the late Clarissa Luard), was also at the bash. The pair managed to spend most of the evening in different parts of the room.        
	The Quintessentially Summer Arts Party was held in Victoria at the Phillips de Pury amp; Co gallery, a unique conversion from an 1880s post office that has created a stunning contemporary space.         
	Hosted by Quintessentiallys co-founders Aaron Simpson and Ben Elliot, the Summer Arts Party is one of the highlights of the London summer social season bringing together an eclectic mix of well-known faces from the worlds of art, fashion, society, film and music, the organisers claim.        
	Jacquetta Wheeler, Immodesty Blaize, Olympia Scarry and Margo Stiley were among the super stylish guests from the worlds of film, music, art and fashion who were enthralled by a series of five live art performances curated by Nick Hackworth, said a gushing report.        
	One of which  David Birkins 4 hours  was performed with the artist entirely naked. And with the night still young, it didnt stop there. DJ Robin Scott-Lawson took to the decks to perform a set while Champagne and vanilla cheesecake parfait and English strawberries came in the plenty.

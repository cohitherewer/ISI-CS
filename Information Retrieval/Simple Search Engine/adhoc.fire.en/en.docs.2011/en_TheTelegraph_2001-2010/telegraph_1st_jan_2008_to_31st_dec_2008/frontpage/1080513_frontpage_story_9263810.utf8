          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                            Alok Raj on his way to Jharkhand. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Nandigram, May 12: The Bengal administration had issued a letter on the eve of the panchayat poll in Nandigram to keep the CRPF away from trouble-prone areas, the officer at the centre of a storm has said.
  ldquo;I have documentary evidence to prove that the administration in its order dated May 9 had asked the paramilitary force to be deployed only in trouble-free villages like Tengua. I studied the area of responsibility given to the CRPF and realised that all these villages were far away from trouble torn areas, rdquo; CRPF deputy inspector-general Alok Raj told The Telegraph.  
	 On the day of polling yesterday, Raj had refused to stay put in the camps as directed by the CPM member of Parliament, Lakshman Seth. The CPM leader rsquo;s conversation with Raj was telecast nationwide after the office put his cellphone in speaker mode.  
	 Raj, who today left for Jharkhand where he is in charge of anti-Maoist operations, said A.K. Sarkar, IG (railways), in charge of the election deployment of security forces, gave the order that assigned the central force to peaceful areas.   
	 The order mentioned the areas where CRPF personnel will be deployed during the election on May 11. According to the rules, central forces can patrol all areas other than polling booths.  
	 ldquo;A copy of the order was given to me when I was having a meeting with SP (East Midnapore) at Nandigram police station around 5pm on May 10. I was shocked to see the names of the villages mentioned in the order where the CRPF were asked to patrol, rdquo; he said.   
	 After going through the order, Raj said, he protested and called up the district magistrate (DM), Anup Agarwal, and asked him to intervene.  
	 ldquo;I spoke to my seniors immediately. I raised my voice against the order and told the SP that the CRPF will work independently on polling day in sensitive areas. Even the DM told me that the order is inappropriate, rdquo; Raj said.  
	 ldquo;Following the DM rsquo;s intervention, the order was changed. The CRPF was allowed to patrol in the sensitive areas in Nandigram, rdquo; he added.   
	 Contacted, the district magistrate said that he could not say the earlier order was changed. ldquo;Look, the order was issued by A.K. Sarkar and he is the person who changed it later. Either he or the SP, who were in charge of police arrangements, can tell you as to why the order was changed, rdquo; Agarwal said.   
	 Told about Raj rsquo;s statement that the DM had found the order inappropriate, Agarwal said: ldquo;It rsquo;s better you speak to the police officer concerned. I am not connected with the police or the CRPF. rdquo;   
	 Sarkar could not be contacted and the SP refused to comment.  
	 Raj said the May 9 order contravened the standard operating procedure (SOP) and the area of domination (AOD) signed between the director-general of police, Bengal, and his CRPF counterpart in November last year when the paramilitary force had arrived in Nandigram.  
	 ldquo;According to the SOP and AOD, the CRPF personnel were asked to patrol the entire Nandigram (Block-I) and not enter polling premises during the panchayat polls, rdquo; Raj said.  
	 The Union home ministry has sought reports from both the state government and the CRPF on the telephone conversation between Raj and Seth.

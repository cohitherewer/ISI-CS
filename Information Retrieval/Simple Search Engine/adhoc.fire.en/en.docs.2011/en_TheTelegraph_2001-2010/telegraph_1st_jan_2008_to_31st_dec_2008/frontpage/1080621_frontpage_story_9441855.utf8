The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Drze for job scheme probe
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Drze for job scheme probe
  - Murderers trail: CBI track record dismal in state          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                                
	Ranchi, June 20: NREGS architect and economist Jean Drze feels the CBI should not restrict itself to investigating the murder of Lalit Mehta, but should also look at the context in which the crime was committed.        
	The CBI should also be entrusted to unravel the corruption in the implementation of the rural job scheme that was under scrutiny of Mehta, Drze told The Telegraph over phone from Allahabad.        
	On Wednesday, chief minister Madhu Koda recommended CBI probe into the mysterious death of Mehta, an NREGS activist and close aide of Drze, in Chhatarpur block in Palamau district on May 14.         
	Drze, also a member of the NREGA council, said that a special team of the CBI should be constituted to conduct the probe within a definite timeframe. Activists pointed out that Drzes insistence on a timeframe may have something to do with the CBIs poor track record in solving murder cases in Jharkhand.        
	The investigating agency is handling at least five murder cases  that of Sushanto Sengupta, husband of Forward Bloc MLA Aparna Sengupta, Dhanbad coal trader Pramod Singh, CPI(ML)-Liberation legislator Mahendra Singh, drowning of BIT, Mesra student Abhishek Mishra and JMM MP Sunil Mahto (see chart).        
	Soon after Mahendra Singhs murder, his wife had lodged an FIR accusing former Giridih police superintendent Deepak Verma and Dhanwar MLA Ravindra Rai as the masterminds behind the killing.        
	However, top Naxalite leader Pramod Mishra  after his arrest in May  is said to have told the police that the legislator had been killed by the lower rung local leaders of the rebel outfit.         
	Now the police claimed that Arjun Yadav, killed in an encounter in Hazaribagh, was the man who killed Mahendra Singh.         
	His son Vinod Singh, the legislator from Bagoder, alleged that the police intentionally eliminated Yadav to wipe out vital evidence.                           
	The CBI has simply failed to unravel the nexus between the assailants and his political rivals, he said.        
	The agency took over the Pramod Singh murder case on October 31, 2003, and arrested accused Ramdheer Singh on August 18, 2004. The trial is still on. Another accused, Rajiv Ranjan, son of BJP MLA Kunti Singh, was still missing.         
	In fact, the state government recently ordered a CBI probe into the missing case too. But the agency was yet to initiate a probe, said a relative of Kunti.         
	CBI officers, however, pointed out two reasons for the delay in resolving cases of political killings. First, such cases are referred to the agencys special crime branch, which has its offices in Delhi, Lucknow and Calcutta.        
	Investigating officers, stationed at these places, usually visit Jharkhand only for short stints. They cannot afford to camp here for a longer period. Moreover, they happen to be outsiders, as they are not perfectly acquainted with the ground realities. They fully depend on a few handpicked persons for investigation, who, in all probability might mislead him too, the officers pointed out.        
	Second, the senior officers also happen to be stationed at far away places. They are not in a position to supervise the case on a regular basis. So the quality of the supervision also suffers.         
	A senior CBI officer, however, justified the delay on the ground that it takes time to collect scientific data and identify the real culprits.

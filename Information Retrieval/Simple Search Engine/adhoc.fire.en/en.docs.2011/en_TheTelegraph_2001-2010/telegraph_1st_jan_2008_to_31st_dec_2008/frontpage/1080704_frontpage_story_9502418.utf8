                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AGP not to support N-deal 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, July 3: The Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) today hinted that it may not cross the fence with the Samajwadi Party on the nuclear deal.        
	AGP president Brindaban Goswami said the party may not be able to support the Congress on the deal despite being an ally of the United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA).         
	After a UNPA meeting today to analyse the pros and cons of the Indo-US civil nuclear cooperation deal, AGP members said the party had earlier made its stand clear that despite being a member of the alliance, it was a standalone party as well.         
	The AGPs rivalry with the Congress in Assam will not allow it to speak in favour of the UPA.         
	The elections are round the corner so it will not be possible for us to support the deal as the Samajwadi Party wants. The latter has apparently made up its mind, said a party leader who was present at the UNPA meeting at the residence of Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh.         
	The AGP has two MPs in the Lok Sabha.         
	A seven-member delegation led by Goswami attended the meeting.         
	The others were Lok Sabha MP Arun Sarma, AGP vice-president Hiranya Konwar, secretary Atul Bora, Hajo legislator Nurul Hussain, former MP Keshab Mahanta and Joseph Toppo. Our stand is categorical (that we cannot support the Congress or the deal), said Sarma.        
	While the UNPA is on the verge of collapse  although the UNPA leaders claimed today that they were united  the AGP is engaged in negotiations with the BJP for an alliance before the next general elections.         
	A six-member committee has been constituted to hammer out a deal with the BJP.         
	Sources said the BJP until recently was testing the waters before working out modalities for a final tie-up.         
	The party is also shaping up a merger with separated sister party AGP (Pragatisheel), led by former chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta.

          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            A poster of the film Om Shanti Om                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 7: For King Khan, OSO has not exactly turned out to be om shanti om.        
	First, yesteryear star Manoj Kumar went to court because he does not like a scene in the film, and now an upcoming scriptwriter has followed suit alleging Shah Rukh Khans Red Chillies Production plagiarised one of his scripts.        
	Ajay Monga, who has written films like Madhur Bhandarkars Corporate and Fashion, has alleged that SRKs Om Shanti Om  the title of the film is also a Vedic peace mantra  is a lift from a script he had submitted to the stars production house for consideration.         
	As proof, Monga is waving a registration certificate for the script, dated September 2005, from the Film Writers Association.         
	OSO, written and directed by Shah Rukhs close friend Farah Khan, released in November 2007 and became one of Bollywoods biggest money-spinners. But it immediately ran into a controversy when Manoj Kumar objected to a scene parodying him.        
	The actor moved court this week demanding that the scene be dropped or the films telecast on TV be stayed.         
	A stay on OSOs global television premiere on SET Max on August 10 is also what Monga demanded.         
	Judge V.M. Kanade yesterday rejected the plea, but directed all parties to file their replies to the suit within four weeks. The next hearing is on September 29. Shah Rukh, wife Gauri, Red Chillies, Farah and co-writer Mushtaq Sheikh are the respondents.        
	We will challenge the order before a division bench, said Virendra Tulzapurkar, Mongas lawyer.         
	When the film released, Monga was shocked to find it was a copy of the script he had given the producers in December 2006. He had wanted Shah Rukh to play the lead. But since the star was shooting in Malaysia, Monga was told the script would be emailed to him. That is the last he heard from them, he added.         
	The writers petition says his script titled Silent Movie had a storyline where a junior artiste, Raju, falls in love with a big actress who is already engaged to a superstar. Raju on one occasion saves the actresss life and, in return, the actress spends one day with Raju. Eventually, a rift develops between the actress and her fianc, after which she starts liking the junior artiste. The co-writer of the script is Hemant Hegdehad.         
	In the film, Shah Rukh plays a junior artiste, Om, who is besotted with a top actress, Shanti, (played by Deepika Padukone) and rescues her from a fire. The actress is later killed by her producer-husband. Om, too, is killed.         
	Monga filed a complaint with the Film Writers Association of India in December.        
	We carefully examined the case and agreed that the first half of OSO was similar to Mongas script, but it was not a straight lift. Since that does not imply a copyright infringement, we did not entertain the matter, said Sooni Taraporevala, association vice-president.        
	The lawyer says people are scared of the might of Shah Rukh Khan, who also has the backing of top producers Yash Chopra and Karan Johar.         
	My client is ready to take this matter up to the Supreme Court. Besides the first half, which is a complete lift from Mongas script, the latter half of the movie is plagiarised from the cult movie Madhumati, says Tulzapurkar.        
	Rinki Bhattacharya, daughter of Bimal Roy who made Madhumati, is also mulling action against Red Chillies. OSO is not a lift from my fathers film Madhumati. It is an exact copy of Madhumati.         
	Monga had approached SRKs office and Farah after OSOs release, demanding Rs 1.25 crore as compensation. Now, he has demanded a share of the profits.

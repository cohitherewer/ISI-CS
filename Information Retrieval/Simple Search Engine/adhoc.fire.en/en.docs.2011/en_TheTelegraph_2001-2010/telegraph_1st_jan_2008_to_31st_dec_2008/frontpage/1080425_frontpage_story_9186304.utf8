                                Tall and pretty                            
	Los Angeles, April 24 (AP): Naomi Campbell is getting Ugly.        
	 The supermodel will appear in the second season finale of ABCs Ugly Betty, according to actress Becki Newton. Shes going to be in our last episode, which is exciting, Newton told The Associated Press.         
	Ive personally requested that I dont stand next to her because Amanda would not like to be seen with such a tall, pretty person.        
	Newtown, who stars as sassy receptionist Amanda Sommers on Ugly Betty, isnt sure what character Campbell will play or if shell actually have scenes with the 37-year-old supermodel, who was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of assaulting an officer after police were called to a disturbance at Heathrow Airport in London.        
	Campbell was originally announced as a guest star last year but didnt appear in the first season or the beginning of the second season, which was cut short because of the writers strike.         
	Other Ugly Betty guest stars have included Victoria Beckham and Gene Simmons, who played himself and was revealed to be Amandas father.

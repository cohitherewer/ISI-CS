          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Basu                                  
	Calcutta, July 16: Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and Bengal transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, both opposed to voting along with the BJP, are believed to have spoken to each other today.         
	Sources said Chatterjee gave Chakraborty the impression that he would not resign before the trust vote.        
	Despite a censure threat, Chakraborty refused to budge from his stand that the CPM should not vote with the BJP. Asked whether he would withdraw his statement, he said: Why should I?        
	Jyoti Basu, Chakrabortys mentor, apparently told him today he should not have spoken out through the media.         
	But party sources said Basu was unlikely to have been unhappy at the statement.        
	Basu unwell        
	Basu, who turned 95 a few days ago, hurt himself when he fell off his bed. He has chest pain but doctors did not detect any fracture, his aide Joykrishna Ghosh said. Ignoring Basus reservations, the party has arranged a night attendant.

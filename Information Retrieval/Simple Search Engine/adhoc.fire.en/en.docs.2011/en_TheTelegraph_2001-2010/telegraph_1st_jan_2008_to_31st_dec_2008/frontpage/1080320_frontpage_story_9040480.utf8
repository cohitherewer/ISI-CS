          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                             Stephen Bennet with his daughter and (above) Amanda                                 
	Mumbai/Panaji, March 19: The family of British backpacker Stephen Bennett, who was found dead in December 2006 while on a trip to Goa, has cited similarities with Scarlett Keelings murder to ask for his case to be re-investigated.         
	Bennett, 40, was found hanging from a mango tree in a village near Roha off the Mumbai-Goa highway, about 156km from Mumbai.        
	A member of his family met inspector-general of police Kishan Kumar in Panaji today and sought a fresh probe.        
	The Bennett family said in the complaint they suspected the Goa drug mafia had murdered Stephen and dumped his body in Malsai.         
	Six villagers in Malsai, part of Maharashtras Raigad district, were arrested for the murder. Raigad police said they had killed Stephen because they thought he had molested a village woman.        
	But the trial court in September 2007 rejected the police claim as inconsistent and freed the villagers on bail.         
	The media spotlight on Scarletts rape and murder in Goa has given the Bennets hope of a fresh probe. We cant say for sure, but it is possible that the potential suspects in Scarletts case could be involved in Stephens murder, too, the family member said.         
	We are certain Stephen was originally drugged and abducted by local people in Goa. In calls to his mother Maureen, he had said he feared for his life. We want Goa police to investigate this.        
	An FIR will be filed next week after director-general B.S. Brar returns from Delhi.         
	Stephens sister Amanda, 45, said her brother arrived i Goa on December 3, 2006, and stayed at Baga beach where he befriended fellow Britons, John Cronin, Gabriel Hannon and Nathan Small. On December 6, he was out drinking with Cronin and Hannon till evening. When he returned to his hotel, he was drugged, abducted and dumped in a Panaji street.         
	After he regained consciousness, Stephens family said, he checked into another hotel and, the next morning, decided to leave for Mumbai by taxi. He made a 14-minute call to his family on December 7, saying he was suspicious of two men trying to take him to Mumbai for a fireworks display. He went missing for three days, and then his body was found.        
	Stephen, a father of two girls, made nine calls to his Cheltenham home on December 6 and 7. I am being intimidated here. I have done absolutely nothing wrong I am scared. Hopefully, I will be able to speak to you tomorrow. If not, I love you loads. Give my love to the kids, Maureen quoted him as saying.         
	The Bennetts have denied allegations, made by some policemen, that he was a drug addict, a homosexual and that he suffered from AIDS.        
	Amanda said over the phone: Stephen was well-educated with a masters degree. He enjoyed travel and had been to Egypt, China, Turkey, Indonesia. He was not the tattooed new-age traveller or wannabe drug dealer Goa seems to attract in abundance.         
	I have spent the year in grief, needed an answer to why the police have compounded our grief. Why have they told lies about him and the crime?

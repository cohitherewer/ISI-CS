 dissident as heir

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                     
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: Embattled Okram Ibobi Singhs choice of successor is the very man who triggered the revolt against him.
    
	The Manipur chief minister today recommended E. Kunjeshwar Singh to the Congress high command as the leader who could steer the party and the state out of the mess created by months of political instability.
    
	 The dissident legislators who have been camping in New Delhi for the last two months to press for Ibobi Singhs ouster rejected the proposal outright and backed Jiribam legislator Th. Debendra Singh for the post. 
    
	Ibobi Singh, who arrived in New Delhi last week for a meeting with the Planning Commission, was asked to stay back for a day, sources said. 
    
	He suggested Kunjeshwar Singhs name during a discussion with the AICC leader in charge of Manipur, Prithviraj Chauhan, in the Prime Ministers Office.
    
	Chauhan would not reveal anything except that the AICC was exploring all options. The party is trying to resolve the crisis. I am meeting others also, he said.
    
	Kunjeshwar Singh was with the BJP and later with the Manipur State Congress Party before joining the Congress. 
    
	He won the Yaiskul seat by defeating Dorendro Singh of the Manipur Peoples Party.
    
	The oust-Ibobi lobby has decided to go a notch higher in their struggle for justice. 
    
	Sources said that more than 15 MLAs of anti-Ibobi camp would skip the Assembly session beginning February 4.
    
	That is one of the probabilities, but there is no question of accepting Kunjeshwar Singh, said the spokesman for the dissidents, Y. Surchandra Singh.
    
	Besides meeting Chauhan, the oust-Ibobi brigade have over the weeks met party president Sonia Gandhi and even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to press for a change at the top. 
    
	Last week, they even threatened to resign from the Assembly if their demand was not met. They blamed Ibobi Singh for corruption and law and order glitches.

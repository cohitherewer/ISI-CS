          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                          Fresh trouble for governor		    
	Ranchi, Sept. 10: Decorum states that an advocate-general (AG), who is the principal law officer in the state, resigns when the government that appointed him falls or when its tenure is over.        
	But, Jharkhands AG S.B. Gadodia has refused to follow decorum after the Madhu Koda government toppled, to make way for Shibu Soren and his team.        
	There were murmurs regarding Gadodias reluctance to step down at the first cabinet meeting that Soren held after facing the trust vote. As the murmurs grew louder, Raj Bhavan, prompted by a complaint filed by a set of lawyers, is now examining the issue.        
	People have been surprised by Gadodias refusal. Though we are examining the issue, it is clear to us that the decision involves a violation of set convention, said a Raj Bhavan official, requesting anonymity.        
	Article 165 of the Constitution entails the governor to appoint an official, qualified to be a high court judge, as the advocate-general. His tenure is based on the governors pleasure.         
	Gadodia has stressed that he is not legally bound to resign, as the UPA government that appointed him continued even after a change of chief minister. However, constitutional experts are not convinced.         
	Noted expert Subhash Kashyap told The Telegraph over phone from New Delhi that though there is no constitutional requirement, convention entails that the advocate-general resign from his office after his government quits.         
	Kashyap, a former Lok Sabha secretary-general, says that the new government may re-appoint him. However, he must resign first before being re-appointed. Holding office during the pleasure of the governor also means during the pleasure of the ministry, he added.        
	Gadodia has created a history of sorts by not putting in his papers. No advocate-general in any state has broken this convention, Sinha maintained.

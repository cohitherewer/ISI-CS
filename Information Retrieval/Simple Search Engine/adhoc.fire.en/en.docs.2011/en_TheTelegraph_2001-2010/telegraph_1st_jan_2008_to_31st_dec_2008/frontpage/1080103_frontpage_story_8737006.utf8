          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Dhubri, Jan. 2: Curfew was clamped in Lakhipur town and the army asked to move in after a three-day bandh that began this morning left a trail of death and destruction in Goalpara district of Lower Assam.        
	Seven persons died when police fired on bandh supporters who had turned violent. Two police officers and a CRPF jawan were among the 20-odd people injured in the violence. Several vehicles were either set ablaze or damaged by protesters at different places.        
	The bandh was called hurriedly last night by the Non-Rabha Co-ordination Forum and the Non-Tribal Protection Forum to prevent officials from reaching polling stations and booths for the second phase of panchayat elections, slated for Friday.        
	The state Election Commission tonight postponed elections in the whole of Goalpara district, scheduled for January 4 and 9, indefinitely.         
	The two organisations behind the bandh were protesting the governments decision not to hold panchayat polls in parts of Kamrup and Goalpara that are administered by the Rabha Hasong Autonomous Council. Rabha groups had opposed the election in their areas, a demand that the government accepted, without polls to the council being held.        
	Lakhipur town bore the brunt of the mob violence, but the first incident of the day occurred at Bhalukdubi in Goalpara town around 11am. Protesters hurled stones at polling personnel who had assembled for their onward journey to different places. The police lathicharged the mob.        
	The scene of violence then shifted to the main market in nearby Lakhipur town, where thousands of people gathered since the morning to enforce the bandh. When a section of the crowd started throwing stones and damaging vehicles, a police team arrived to disperse the crowd. That was around noon.        
	When the protesters retaliated, the police team was quickly outnumbered. The officers-in-charge of Lakhipur police station and the Jaleswar outpost, Gobinda Saikia and Irfan Khan, were injured.        
	When caning failed to stop the mob, the police opened fire. Four persons struck by bullets died and 10 were injured.        
	As news of the deaths spread, thousands of people marched to Lakhipur police station and proceeded to attack the police personnel, which led to yet another round of firing in which three more persons died and another 10 were injured. That incident occurred around 3.15pm.        
	Goalpara superintendent of police Abhijit Bora said over phone that the police had no option but to open fire. We burst teargas shells and fired rubber bullets, but the protesters kept coming at us. So we had to open fire.         
	Bora said the mob next targeted four houses belonging to people of a linguistic minority community on the outskirts of Lakhipur town.        
	As many as 10 vehicles and 22 two-wheelers, including a truck of the District Rural Development Agency, were torched or damaged at different places. A bus was attacked near Durga Mandir in Goalpara town and set ablaze.        
	Protesters also blocked National Highway 37 and disrupted traffic. Goalpara deputy commissioner Utpalananda Sarma said the army was asked to move into sensitive areas of the district when the violence spread.                     
	The president of the Non-Rabha Co-ordination Forum, Shajahan Ali, said the police firing was unwarranted. He asked for the resignation of the Congress-led government, saying it had lost the moral right to remain in power.         
	We will not succumb to coercive measures, Ali said.        
	The organisation demanded Rs 5 lakh each in compensation to the families of those who died in the firing and Rs 1 lakh each for the injured.

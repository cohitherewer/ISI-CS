          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: The political drama over Jharkhands top seat continued in the capital today as JMM chief Shibu Soren called on UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and RJD chief Lalu Prasad leading to urgent summons being issued to Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda.        
	With the crucial trust vote scheduled for August 25, the UPA leadership seems to have realised that it had to step in and end the continuing uncertainty that has been prevailing in the state ever since JMM chief Shibu Soren withdrew support to the Madhu Koda government.        
	Two developments indicated that the situation may be changing in favour of Soren though some uncertainty continued to prevail. One, RJD chief Lalu Yadav veering around to backing Soren, and two, Koda being asked to come to Delhi tomorrow.        
	According to sources close to Sonia Gandhi, Koda is likely to be asked to make the sacrifice in the interest of the UPA.         
	Backroom politics throughout the day were behind the tide turning in favour of Soren. The JMM chief who makes the media run for their soundbites today said that he had met Lalu and things were looking up for him and his party.         
	Minutes later, however, Lalu Prasad impatiently dismissed reporters saying there was no meeting with the JMM leader.         
	In the afternoon, Lalu Prasad met Sonia Gandhi and is said to have softened his stand vis--vis Sorens wish to be chief minister. It was after this meeting that Soren visited 10 Janpath to discuss the situation. Then, Madhu Koda was summoned.         
	With the RJD boss agreeing to let Soren take the reins of power in Jharkhand the next task was to convince Koda. In view of the BJPs statement today that it will not play dirty, things would turn out easier for both Lalu Prasad and Soren as Koda and other Independents may not have another avenue open and hold on to power. But modalities are not worked out yet. Kal pata lagega (You will come to know tomorrow about the outcome), said JMM MP, Teklal Mahto.         
	The sequence of events since this morning only showed that Soren was prevailing upon the Congress and, therefore, on Lalu Prasad who was till today averse to removing Koda. He was anointed chief minister with Lalu Prasads blessings. Implications for the Congress in case Soren withdraws support from the UPA are immense. Therefore, the Congress may prevail upon Lalu Prasad and fulfil the promise the former made to Soren for getting vital numbers in the trust vote.

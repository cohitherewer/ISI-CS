The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | UK retail giant in wholesale entry 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   UK retail giant in wholesale entry 
          AMIT ROY                            A Tesco store                                  
	London, Aug. 12: Tesco, Britains biggest and most controversial supermarket chain, will set up in India a wholesale cash-and-carry business which it said would not undermine the small retailer.        
	We will be supplying them, a Tesco spokesperson said.        
	Wholesale business is virtually the only way large global retailers can gain a toehold in India, one of the fastest growing retail markets in the world. Indian rules do not allow foreign retailers, other than single-brand vendors, to enter retail.        
	Tesco, which has 2,115 stores across the UK, has also tied up with the Tatas to whom it will lend its expertise in retail.        
	An earlier deal with Sunil Mittals Bharti group collapsed two years ago when the latter opted for Wal-Mart of America. It is not about being the first, the spokesperson said. It is about finding the right partner.        
	Under the franchise agreement with Trent, the retail arm of the Tatas, Tesco will receive a fee for letting the Indian company draw on the UK chains extensive retail expertise and technical capability to support the development of its hypermarket business, Star Bazaar, a statement said.        
	Star Bazaar currently has four outlets, of which two are in Mumbai and the others in Ahmedabad and Bangalore.        
	Tesco will invest 60 million (Rs 480 crore) in setting up its wholesale cash-and-carry business in the first two years, developing three wholesale distribution hubs in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore, and then gradually roll it across India.        
	The German chain, Metro Cash and Carry, has set up a similar venture on the outskirts of Calcutta but is awaiting a key licence from the agri-marketing board.        
	Tesco, which already has a sourcing network in India for its UK stores, will buy staple food, fresh vegetables and other mainly vegetarian products from farmers, and then provide value for money to small retailers.        
	In the UK, Tesco does provide cheap food but it has also run into controversies. Critics have accused it of using its enormous financial muscle power to buy up land and available sites wherever it can and generally driving competition out of the area.        
	Tesco doesnt have to go through a long-drawn approval process that Metro and Wal-Mart had faced. The other two hubs will come up in the next two years. In 2006, the investment rules were changed to allow global retailers to establish fully owned cash-and-carry operations without having to seek prior government approval.        
	Asked whether the company wished to enter the retail sector, Philip A. Clarke, Tescos international and IT director, said: Thats a hypothetical question. But we would love to operate our hypermarkets here, if allowed.

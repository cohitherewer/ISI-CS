	Bhubaneswar, June 2: Agro-scientists at Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology today predicted strong rainfall in six coastal districts in their trend analysis for 2008.         
	The lucky six that are slated to receive adequate and more than adequate rainfall are Balasore, Bhadrak, Cuttack, Khurda, Puri and Nayagarh, with Mayurbhanj, Khandhamal and western districts of Kalahandi. However, low rainfall is expected in at least 21 districts.        
	This years analysis showed many changes in the basic weather of the state such as a late monsoon and more pre-monsoon rainfall. Orissa is also expected to experience reduced post-monsoon and winter rainfalls with less rain in February, June and October.         
	There is a possibility of more cloudy days and increased day and night temperatures in all months, except July. Also, there may be an increase in the maximum temperatures in the post-monsoon period after summer.         
	Weather scientists also expect an extended summer (up to June) with an increase in the number of hot, humid days in the coastal areas. And there are strong possibilities of a warmer and shorter winter with fewer cold nights in western Orissa and extreme weather events such as prolonged heat waves.         
	There will be an increase in the number of rainy days with more than 125mm rain, followed by prolonged dry spells and then heavy rains and a large number of low-intensity, low pressures areas forming over the Bay of Bengal.         
	More intense tropical cyclones with larger peak wind speeds and heavier rainfall are expected to hit the state in the following monsoon. Increased risk of drought and flood, intense storms resulting in loss of rainwater is expected to affect agriculture, livelihood, food security and water resources, said Surendranath Pasupalak, a senior scientist.

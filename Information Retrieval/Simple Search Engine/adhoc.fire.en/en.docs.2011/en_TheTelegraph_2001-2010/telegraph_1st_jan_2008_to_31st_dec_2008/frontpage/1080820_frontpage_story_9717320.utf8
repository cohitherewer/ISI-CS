          OUR BUREAU                             Jade Goody                                  
	London/ Mumbai, Aug. 19: Jade Goody, who was in India to appear on the reality TV show Bigg Boss, was flying back to Britain today after being diagnosed with cervical cancer, her publicists in London have confirmed.        
	For once, this was not a PR stunt.         
	Her publicist, Mark Thomas, said: She is flying back for treatment and more tests.         
	Thomas works for Max Clifford, who once represented Shilpa Shetty after the Bollywood actress had won Celebrity Big Brother last year.         
	Clifford confirmed that Goody, a 27-year-old mother of two young sons, had cancer.         
	Jade had some tests recently, then she went off to India, he said. Yesterday, we got a call from her consultant to say she had cancer.         
	Cervical cancer develops from cells lining the neck of the womb. It is the second most common cancer in women under the age of 35 in the UK, with around 2,700 new cases every year.         
	It was apparently at Shilpas behest that Goody was invited on to Bigg Boss, a show on the lines of Celebrity Big Brother where struggling and wannabe celebrities live as housemates for weeks in the glare of the camera.        
	Shilpa, who is presenting the show, probably wanted to pull a stunt to get higher ratings for the channel Colors and Goody a chance to rebuild her shattered career, which never recovered after she was accused of being a racist on Celebrity Big Brother. She had called Shilpa a dog.        
	Clifford was asked if the result was a positive smear test or a confirmed diagnosis of cancer. No, it is cancer, he said.        
	Earlier, a source in the production house that handles Bigg Boss had said: She has a positive Pap smear test. We are told she has some pre-cancerous cells, which are common and do not always lead to cancer. We expect her back. A lot of audience interest is expected.         
	Doctors say the test is routinely conducted to prevent cancer. A Pap smear test checks whether there is any change in the character of cells in the cervical area. If one fails a test, it means there might be changes. But there is a wide spectrum within which the change happens. The least dangerous is called ascus and the most dangerous is invasive cancer, Dr Surendra Shastri, head of preventive oncology at Tata Memorial Hospital, said.         
	The news was broken to Goody after she was called into a private room. She emerged crying from the room and told fellow housemates: I have cancer.         
	She was immediately withdrawn from the show.         
	Before the episode was aired, the channel issued a statement: Her stay at the Bigg Boss house has been cut short with an unfortunate development. Jades tests indicate the possibility of cancer.        
	It is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans. My prayers are with Jade (and) her family in this hour, when they face one of the biggest tests of their lives, in times ahead. I pray she comes out of this soon, and stronger, Shilpa said.        
	Dalit protest        
	Supporters of Dalit leader Ramdas Athavale attacked the Colors office because he was not taken on the show. They had promised me I would be a housemate. They (later) said they were not taking me as I was too high profile. All this is nonsense. They are pushing me out because I am a Dalit, Athavale said.

          OUR BUREAU                                    
	New Delhi/Guwahati, Aug. 6: Former education minister Ripun Bora tonight walked out of Tihar Jail after two over months in prison and immediately projected himself as a victim of a political conspiracy which has been his stance ever since his arrest on June 3.        
	Bora, who was greeted by friends, relatives and supporters at the jail gate around 9pm, also termed his arrest as total injustice.        
	Bora, along with Ramesh Maheswari and Mukul Pathak, was granted bail on a security bond of Rs 3 lakh by special CBI judge R.K. Yadav.        
	Pathak, a scribe, was, however, not released today as he could not furnish the security bond. His lawyer Ratneshwar Das said he would move the high court to reduce the amount of bond required for Pathaks bail.        
	About 50 people braved the rain and welcomed Bora with gamochas and bouquets.        
	After coming out of the jail, the former minister, dressed in a dark kurta, headed for a good nights sleep at his Basant Kunj residence in the national capital.        
	Bora was arrested on charges of bribing a CBI sleuth to hush up a murder case in which the former minister is a prime suspect.         
	Bora allegedly tried to bribe the CBI to influence the probe into the murder of a tea tribe leader and his political rival Daniel Topno.         
	Maheswari, the businessman-aide of Bora, who was also released today, said his arrest was almost like an abduction.        
	The release of Bora is expected to raise political temperatures soaring back home in Assam. The news that he might get bail created a flutter yesterday in the Pradesh Congress which had promptly suspended him from the party to nullify the Oppositions campaign that the government harbours and encourages corruption.        
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi dropped Bora from his cabinet the very day he was arrested.        
	Even before his release, Bora had said that he would spill the beans after he was freed.        
	Bora had told a few of his confidants that the conspiracy was hatched by some of his party colleagues who were jealous of his growing stature in the council of ministers. Bora held important portfolios in the Gogoi cabinet in the previous as well as the current terms.        
	Rivalry among some of the council of ministers in Gogois 19-member ministry has long been the subject of political gossip in the corridors of power.         
	The Congress fears that Bora could now blow the lid off its hard-kept secret, a development the party dreads in view of the ensuing and crucial parliamentary elections.

  - Biman fires C-word at CM, Delhi dismissive          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Bhattacharjee                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 29: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees colleagues in Bengal are seeing the CPM politburos statement in response to his opposition to bandhs as a public censure, though senior party sources in Delhi dismissed the interpretation.        
	The partys Bengal secretary, Biman Bose, said today: What the politburo said was tantamount to public censure according to section 19 of our party constitution.        
	Top CPM sources, however, said from Delhi: Had it been so (a censure), the PB statement would have mentioned it as it was done in the case of Subhas Chakraborty earlier.        
	We have neither publicly nor privately censured (both kinds are officially possible) Bhattacharjee, the sources added.        
	When the party issued a public censure of Chakraborty for his comments in support of Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, it used that expression in the sub-heading of its statement. The Central Committee publicly censured Comrade Subhas Chakraborty, member of the state secretariat of West Bengal, for making statements challenging the party line. He should conform to the norms of the party, the July 20 statement had said.        
	Delhis official description of yesterdays politburo statement is a distancing from Bhattacharjees comments.        
	Since the communist partys methods of operation in such cases are institutionalised, there is some consternation at Boses interpretation. Even more so at Bengal Citu president Shyamal Chakrabortys proclamation that Bhattacharjee had been punished.        
	Chakraborty said: He has been publicly censured. Its a punishment, according to our party constitution. Bhattacharjee has accepted it.        
	The partys state secretariat discussed the controversy today. The PB statement came in the wake of a report from Bose on the chief ministers anti-bandh comments. Buddhababu didnt oppose the party line in the meeting, a secretariat member said.         
	Bose said after the meeting: I had made the partys position (that it supports the right to strike) clear at the party function (on Wednesday) in the presence of the chief minister. He (Bhattacharjee) didnt oppose it.        
	Benoy Konar, an influential member of the state secretariat, declined to call the politburo statement a public censure. I dont think it was a public censure as the politburo has merely stated its difference from the chief minister on the issue, Konar said.        
	As for Bhattacharjee accepting the partys decision, Konar explained that whatever might be the chief ministers personal opinion, he had no choice but to fall in with the official stand. Otherwise, how can he continue to be in the party? He will have to leave.        
	Konar ruled out any debate in the party on Bhattacharjees stand on bandhs and strikes.         
	I dont think there is any need. As long as there are attacks on working people, no Left party can accept opposition to strikes and bandhs. We have to consider when and where these weapons are to be used, he said.

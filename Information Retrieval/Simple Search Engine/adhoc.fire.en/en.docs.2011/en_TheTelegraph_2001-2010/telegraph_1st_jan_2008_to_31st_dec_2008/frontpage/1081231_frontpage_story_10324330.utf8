          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Omar Abdullah hugs Ghulam Nabi Azad in Delhi. (Reuters)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: The Congress cleared the way for the anointment of Omar Abdullah as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir and the formation of a coalition government with the National Conference (NC).        
	Sonia Gandhi hastened the decision at a late-night meeting on Monday with state Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Saifuddin Soz, and Prithviraj Chavan, the general secretary in charge of Jammu and Kashmir.        
	A sense of urgency crept into the meeting after rumours, apparently inspired by the anti-Azad group, began floating around that the Congress would not jettison the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the interest of national integration.         
	PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti sent feelers she was ready to make Soz or Azad chief minister, prompting some influential persons to suggest that the Congress explore the option.        
	However, according to sources, Sonia rebuffed the view. She is believed to have said while the Congress would like to have friendly relations with the PDP, the mandate was for the NC and its spirit should, therefore, be respected. Sonia was also clear that the Congress must not indulge in haggling for power.        
	Sonias decision was formally ratified by the Congresss core group, that included the Prime Minister, this morning. Later, Omar called on the Congress president and announced he would head the alliance government. I look forward to working closely with the Congress for the welfare and development for the people of J amp;K, he told reporters.        
	The coalition is likely to have a deputy chief minister from the Congress from the Jammu region. Despite the Congress having 11 MLAs less than the NC, the number of ministers in the council will be the same. A common minimum programme will also be put in place.        
	Sources said that in the interest of stability and durability, the Congress was unlikely to have the time-sharing arrangement it did in the previous coalition with the PDP when they agreed to have a chief minister each for three years.        
	This means Omar will lead the government for its six-year tenure.

          OUR BUREAU                            Somnath Chatterjee                                  
	July 20: The CPM has conveyed afresh to Somnath Chatterjee to step down as Speaker before the trust vote, the message carrying the stamp of the central committee this time.        
	An emissary from the CPM passed on the request to Chatterjee soon after the central committee meeting drew to a close in Delhi today.        
	However, PTI quoted sources close to the Speaker as saying that they were not aware of any communication from the party.        
	Other sources told The Telegraph that the message was conveyed to Chatterjee through a senior Bengal leader who has chosen to stay back in Delhi tonight.        
	Chatterjee, who reached Delhi this morning from Calcutta, did not give any indication that he would resign before the trust vote. The Speaker has called a customary all-party meeting before the Lok Sabha special session convenes tomorrow.        
	The sources said the fresh request might have more to do with setting the stage for eventual action rather than forcing Chatterjee out of the Speakers chair immediately.        
	The party leadership had so far confined itself to undeclared  and unsuccessful  individual efforts, spearheaded by general secretary Prakash Karat, to persuade Chatterjee to step down. Publicly, the CPM had been saying it was up to Chatterjee to decide whether to continue as Speaker, which means he could not be accused of flouting any party directive.         
	But the new request, which came after the central committee meeting, carries the weight of the party organisation. If Chatterjee continues to stick to his position of not stepping down as Speaker and voting along with the BJP, he could be later charged with flouting party discipline and action taken, the sources said.        
	At the central committee, some members apparently raised questions about the way the Speaker episode had embarrassed the party at a time it was locked in a decisive battle with the Congress.         
	Asked about Chatterjee, Karat told reporters: The politburo of the party will take an appropriate decision.        
	A statement issued after the central committee meeting did not make any reference to the Speaker. But it disclosed that the central committee publicly censured Bengal transport minister and state secretariat member Subhas Chakraborty for challenging the party line.         
	Asked on what point the Bengal leader had challenged the party line, Karat said: Its the vote issue.        
	The transport minister had expressed reservations in public on the party voting along with the BJP to defeat the trust vote.        
	Reacting to the censure, Chakraborty said in Calcutta: The central committee is the supreme authority in our party in between two party congresses. So it is compulsory for all of us to accept its verdict. I have not challenged the party line but defended it as it was adopted in the last party congress, Chakraborty said. He seemed to be suggesting that his stand was in line with the partys fight against communalism.

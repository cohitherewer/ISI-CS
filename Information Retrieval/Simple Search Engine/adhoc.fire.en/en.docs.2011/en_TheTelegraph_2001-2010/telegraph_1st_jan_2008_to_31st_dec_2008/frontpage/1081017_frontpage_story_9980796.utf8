                                Bedi: Wedding blues                             
	Mumbai, Oct. 16 (PTI): Abu Salem has served a legal notice on estranged companion Monica Bedi saying he was anguished by her liaisons with another man on reality show Bigg Boss.        
	The gangster, lodged in Arthur Road jail, has addressed the letter to the office of Colors, the channel beaming the show, as Bedi is currently inside the Bigg Boss house.        
	Residents of the Bigg Boss house are cut off from the world outside, not even getting access to newspapers or telephone.        
	The actress, who was voted out of the show, was recently brought back on a wild card. She has been linked with Rahul Mahajan, a fellow inmate of the Bigg Boss house, who has declared on the show he wants to marry her.         
	Salem had earlier sent a notice to Bedi saying he was deeply hurt by her statements denying their marriage. He had said that if Bedi wanted a divorce, she would have to write to him and he would though heart-broken, soulfully pronounce a talaaq.        
	In the notice sent today, the gangster, who was deported from Portugal along with Bedi in November 2005, said the actresss comments on Bigg Boss that she would like to get married and settle down with the right man had distressed him. You are a married woman and if you want to marry some other man, you will first have to obtain divorce from Salem, the notice said.

  - Ulfa bid to pull down Tricolour foiled          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Kokrajhar/Guwahati, Aug. 16: Teachers, guardians and villagers of Bandarchara in Assams Kokrajhar district prevented Ulfa militants from bringing down the Tricolour and hoisting a black one at Bandarchara Lower Primary school yesterday.        
	Sources said the people who had gathered to celebrate Independence Day not only prevented the three Ulfa militants from bring down the Tricolour but also gave chase and apprehended one of them.         
	A Bulgaria-made 9mm pistol and two magazines were recovered from the militant, Hitesh Roy, who was handed over to police.        
	On being informed about the incident, army troops patrolling the area apprehended another of the fleeing militants, Rajnikanta Singha, from Khurshakati. The third militant, Jayanta Roy, managed to escape. The incident is being seen as a reflection of the peoples desire to end insurgency in the state.         
	In Guwahati, the Independence Day celebrations attracted a huge turnout. Chief minister Tarun Gogoi, in his address at Latasil ground, appealed to Ulfa to follow the example set by the Alpha and Charlie companies of its 28 battalion and to abjure violence for lasting peace and development.         
	Meanwhile, while Upper Assam remained by and large peaceful, the outfit targeted Lower Assam and exploded two bombs in Dhubri district and one in Chirang district.         
	Sources said militants exploded a bomb nearly 120m away from the parade ground at Kajalgaon in Chirang district at 8.25am.         
	A powerful crude bomb exploded after the flag hoisting at Dharmasala block office around 9am, while another bomb exploded near the flag-hoisting ground at Gouripur in Dhubri district yesterday.        
	Two grade IV staff of the Dharmasala block office, Rahima Bibi and Meskar Ali, were critically injured in the explosion. They were admitted to Dhubri civil hospital.         
	Two bombs went off in Bongaigaon town, one near the petrol pump at Paglastan and other at Borpara police checkpost, between 8.15am to 8.30am today. No one was injured.        
	 On the contentious issue of detection and deportation of illegal migrants, Gogoi said the government had constituted 21 additional tribunals for identification and deportation of foreign nationals.         
	Our government is committed to detect and deport illegal migrants but, at the same time, I want to make it clear that we will not allow harassment of genuine Indian citizens in the name of identification of foreign nationals, he added.

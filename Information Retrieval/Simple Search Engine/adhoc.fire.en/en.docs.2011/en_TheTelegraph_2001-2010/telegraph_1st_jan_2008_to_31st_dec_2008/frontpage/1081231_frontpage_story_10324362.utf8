          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Sania Mirza: Defaulter?                                   
	Hyderabad, Dec. 30: Sania Mirza is a defaulter in the eyes of Hyderabad police.        
	Told to pay Rs 2 lakh for the services of two armed police escorts guarding her since March, the tennis star gave up the security two months ago.        
	But she is yet to clear the bill, police commissioner B. Prasad Rao said. Notices have been sent to the tennis star and other defaulters, he added.        
	Police have certain guidelines to recover the charges for security provided, Rao said. If anybody fails to make payments for the service, we issue notices to them.        
	R.B. Nayak, the deputy commissioner, city security wing, said Sania had not responded to the notices either.        
	Her father, Imran Mirza, could not be reached for comment.        
	Sania was given the escorts from the city security wing on request following a break-in at her Jubilee Hills home, after the tennis star was seen with shoes on in Mecca Mosque where she was shooting for an ad. A fatwa was issued by the local moulvi and a case of trespassing into the mosque was filed against her by clerics.         
	Sources close to the player said her family was under the impression that the security was being paid for by the state government till they received the bill. Sania was asked to pay Rs 25,000 a month for the two armed escorts, who worked in shifts.         
	The city security wing provides protection to around 150 people based on threat perception. Around 40 of them are paying for the services, the commissioner said. Among them are actress Jeevita and her actor-husband Rajasekhar, who had asked for security after actor-politician Chiranjeevis fans attacked them a few months ago.         
	Security for elected representatives is paid for by the government.        
	Chiranjeevi, who has turned politician and launched his Praja Rajyam party, has been granted state security and will not need to pay, Rao said.        
	While Sanias family had volunteered to give up the security, a home ministry review committee also said in October that Sania no longer faced a threat and her security cover should stand withdrawn.

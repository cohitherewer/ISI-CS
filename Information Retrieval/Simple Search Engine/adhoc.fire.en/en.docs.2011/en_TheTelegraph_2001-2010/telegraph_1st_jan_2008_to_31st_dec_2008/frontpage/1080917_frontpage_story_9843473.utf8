          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            A prayer meet for Kandhamal in Rourkela. Picture by U.K. Pal                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 16: Fresh violence erupted in Kandhamal late last night, a few hours after the state home secretary claimed that the situation was under control in the district.        
	A 500-strong mob armed with country-made guns, crude bombs and lathis attacked and set fire to Gochapada police station, around 240km from the capital, last night and shot a constable dead. On their way back, the mob also set fire to a Balandapada police outpost, about 14km from Gochapada.        
	Talking to The Telegraph Gopal Chandra Nanda confirmed the incident and the death of a police constable. With this casualty, the official toll in the violence following the murders of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and four of his associates has risen to 27.         
	This was the first instance of an attack on a police station this time in Kandhamal. Previously, a number of police stations in the district had borne the brunt of mob attacks during the December 2007s Christmas violence.        
	Kandhamal superintendent of police (SP) S. Praveen Kumar said 500 men attacked the Gochapada police station around midnight, when they ransacked the station and fired at the staff. Trainee sepoy of Special Security Battalion Bibhudendra Biswal was killed on the spot. Police said Biswal sustained bullet injuries on his thigh and head. Other staff were chased away by the armed mob.         
	Though the skeleton staff of the police station and around 24 trainee sepoys of the Rourkela-based Special Security Battalion tried to fight back, they were soon overpowered by the armed and organised mob.        
	All documents, furniture and eight police vehicles were reduced to ashes. The mob also ransacked the residence of the officer in charge and staff.        
	Sources said the staff, who were asleep, were caught unawares by the sudden attack.         
	The unarmed and unprepared cops reportedly ran for cover to the nearby forest. However, SP Praveen Kumar, who later reached the spot, denied this and said they were all present and safe in the police station. Sources said the mob attack was a sequel to the arrest of a few persons earlier for rioting and arson. Others believe this was a retaliatory action of fundamentalist groups to the police firing in Kurtamgarh on Saturday in which four persons were killed.         
	Revenue divisional commissioner (southern division) Satyabrata Sahu and director-general of police (southern range) R.P. Koche, who visited the spot today, said adequate CRPF and Rapid Action Force personnel had been deployed in the area.        
	Kumar said a high alert had been issued in all stations across the district, while patrolling had been intensified and a special team had been constituted to probe the matter.

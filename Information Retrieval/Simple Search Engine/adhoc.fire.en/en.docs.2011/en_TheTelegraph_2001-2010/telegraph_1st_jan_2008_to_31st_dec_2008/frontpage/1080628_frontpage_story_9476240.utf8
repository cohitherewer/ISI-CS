The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ex-minister: Raise pension (never mind I too gain) 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Ex-minister: Raise pension (never mind I too gain) 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                             MM Joshi, Arjun Singh                                  
	New Delhi, June 27: Former education minister Murli Manohar Joshi has stunned the human resource development ministry by demanding an immediate hike in pension paid to him and to other former employees of Allahabad University.        
	Officials said they could not recall any instance during this governments tenure when a former minister has asked his erstwhile ministry to take decisions that could directly benefit him, too.        
	In Joshis case, the demand is even more striking as the incumbent Arjun Singh and Joshi had a bitter brawl over desaffronisation soon after the UPA government took over.        
	Joshi has, however, said his demand was aimed at helping all employees of the university.         
	The senior BJP leader taught physics at Allahabad University for over two decades, before retiring as the head of the department in 1994.         
	Joshi has demanded that former employees, such as himself, be paid the pension granted to central university employees, even though the varsity was taken over by the Centre only three years ago. Dearness allowance should also be paid according to central scales, he has said.         
	The varsity pays all employees hired before the central takeover on the basis of lower, state government scales. At the time of Joshis retirement, the university was run by the Uttar Pradesh government.         
	But the BJP leader said the Centre is duty bound, under the Allahabad University Act, to pay employees with retrospective effect. The act clearly states that all the liabilities of the earlier state government-run varsity stand transferred to the Centre, Joshi told The Telegraph.        
	Pensions are based on the individual salary drawn by an employee at the time of retirement. But ministry sources said the central pension is generally higher than the amount paid by state government varsities by up to 20 per cent.         
	States take more time to pay these allowances. Now with the Sixth Central Pay Commission to be implemented, these employees should receive these new entitlements. Why should they receive only what the state governments are offering? Joshi asked.         
	Towards the end of his term as minister in 2004, Joshi tried to introduce a bill converting the varsity into a central university.         
	Parliament records show that Arjun opposed the introduction of the bill at the end of the session, contending that the proposed law could have been introduced earlier. But Arjun converted Allahabad University into a centrally funded institution within a year of taking over.        
	Joshi first wrote to the vice-chancellor, Prof. R.G. Harshe, seeking the increase in pension and DA.         
	I met Dr Joshi recently, and he told me that he believes the pension and DA of those employed before the status of the university changed should be on a par with central varsity counterparts. I told him the decision can only be taken by the central ministry, Harshe said.        
	The vice-chancellor said he forwarded Joshis letter to the ministry. Joshi said he had to remind the higher education secretary, who was sitting pretty over the matter.         
	But ministry officials counter Joshis charges, claiming that the questions raised by the former minister have no easy answers.        
	The BJP leader has cited section 5(c) of the Allahabad University Act, 2005, which states that all rights and liabilities of the University of Allahabad shall be transferred to, and be the rights and liabilities of, the (new) University.         
	But ministry officials point to section 5(d) of the same act which they say may to repudiate Joshis claim.         
	 Those employed before the central takeover shall hold... the same remuneration... and privileges as to pension, gratuity, provident fund and other matters as he would have held the same if this Act had not been passed, the section says. Officials said they were still examining Joshis demand.

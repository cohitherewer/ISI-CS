	Dhanbad, Jan. 30: A BDO was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly insulting a Scheduled Caste junior engineer whose office he was raiding after receiving several complaints of corruption. 
    
	Vinod Kumar Jha, Tundi BDO, was arrested under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act from his residence  35 km from here  for allegedly abusing Sujit Baski during an inspection on January 14. 
    
	Jha conducted the surprise raid after several villagers complained against Baski, an SC engineer handling NREGA schemes. 
    
	According to the police, several illegal documents and fake records of road works were seized from him. 
    
	After the raid, the police said, Jha allegedly insulted the junior engineer in front of some villagers and warned him not to continue with the irregularities. Apparently, he also made him do sit-ups. 
    
	A warrant has also been issued against junior engineer Baban Pandey, who was with Jha during the raid. However, Pandey is absconding. Dhanbad superintendent of police (SP) Sheetal Oraon said a search is on to arrest Pandey. 
    
	The police have produced Jha in the court of Dhanbad chief judicial magistrate Deepak Kumar who remanded him in the Dhanbad jail.
    
	Jha, a senior officer of the Jharkhand Administrative Service, claimed his arrest was a deep-rooted conspiracy hatched by some colleagues and politicians. 
    
	I tried to uproot corr- uption in NREGA schemes after several complaints against the junior engineer (Baski) reached me, Jha told reporters while being brought to court. 
    
	Look how I have been made a scapegoat? he added, sobbing. He also claimed he never abused Baski.
       
	After the January 14 raid, Baski, who is said to be close to several MLAs, met Tundi MLA Mathura Mahto (JMM) and complained to him of the alleged abuse. On January 18, Baski lodged an FIR at the Tundi police station. Oraon then asked Tundi deputy SP Shailendra Barnawal to investigate. 
    
	Two days later, Mahto staged a dharna in Dhanbad. He also met chief minister Madhu Koda in Ranchi and demanded the Brahmin BDO be arrested for insulting and abusing a Scheduled Caste engineer. 
    
	After Barnawals report reached Oraon, he ordered the arrest of Jha and Pandey.

   Combative amp; confident, PM prays for strength           SANKARSHAN THAKUR                            Manmohan Singh enters Parliament on Monday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                        
	New Delhi, July 21: The UPAs trust move charted a low-octane course in the Lok Sabha today, with the main political action still focused on mustering greater numbers in this House and, crucially, the next one.         
	The treasury called the Indo-US nuclear deal visionary and in the supreme national interest, the BJP labelled it subservient and worthy of re-negotiation, the Left screamed a total sellout to American hegemony.        
	But a major reason why the debate never achieved the fever pitch that often attends such motions was the deep divide between forces that stood opposed to the government.        
	The Left shrank from supporting or applauding NDA speakers even on points of agreement; and very often it protested it wasnt with the saffron coalition. The assault, consequently, never looked formidable enough.        
	Indeed, the combatants over the deal mimicked shadow-boxers as the prospect of the battle that lies beyond the trust vote and outside Parliament loomed.        
	Opening the trust motion, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh bemoaned having to face a totally avoidable vote at a time economic issues, especially containing inflation and implementing welfare programmes, demanded his governments attention.        
	He was pushing the case for stability and governance as his government enters the final months of its mandate; most of his opponents appeared convinced that irrespective of tomorrows verdict, the government was already on borrowed time.         
	Looking beyond the minutiae of a critical vote their withdrawal of support has necessitated, Left leaders intensified negotiations with new prospective partners in the Mayavati-led UNPA with an eye on the next elections. Sources said, though, that Mayavatis attention was equally taken with efforts to wean away MPs and mat the UPA government on the Lok Sabha floor.        
	Mayavati and Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party, which have emerged as rival striking arms in the current showdown, are both claiming to reveal stunning surprises when the trust motion is put to vote tomorrow.                      
	Late tonight, a combative Prime Minister, who arrived in the House flashing the V-sign and giving the thumbs-up, rejected allegations of horse-trading. Anybody can make allegations. If somebody has proof, show it, Singh told reporters while leaving Parliament. He expressed fullest confidence that his government would win the trust vote.        
	Earlier, he had taken a tangential swipe at the current CPM leadership, party boss Prakash Karat in particular.        
	Making his displeasure with Karat known, Singh thanked the sagacity and wisdom of the visionary leadership of Jyoti Basu and Harkishen Singh Surjeet. Watching from the high galleries, CPM politburo member Brinda Karat is bound to have taken the message back to her party chief and husband.         
	Theres another segment the Prime Minister sent out a subtle signal to  the Akalis. In what was seen as a bid to create an emotional schism in Akali ranks, Singh ended with a quote from Guru Gobind Singh that, translated, meant: Give me the strength that nothing should deter me from the path of good work. And when I go to the battlefield, I should emerge the winner. Give me the strength so I dont get distracted and should win even if I lose my life.        
	That could well work as a prayer after tomorrows vote is over and the electoral campaign begins.        
	The scale for tomorrows vote has been tipped both ways by covert hands in the run-up to the debate, so much so that leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani himself conceded the government might well survive.        
	But even if it survives, Advani told Manmohan Singh, making his case against the motion, the peoples verdict will be clear.        
	Advani took issue with the Prime Minister on the background to the trust vote and blamed him, rather than the Left, for it. This crisis has been invited by the government itself, and, Mr Prime Minister, I am sorry to say, by you personally and the Congress president without whom you cannot take a single step.        
	The BJP leader justified the Lefts withdrawal of support, arguing that the Congress had violated coalition dharma with its rigidity on the nuclear deal which was not part of the UPAs common minimum programme.        
	He charged the government with trying to sneak through the nuclear deal behind Parliaments back. Referring to a report in The Telegraph that quoted government sources as saying the nuclear deal would be done even if the government were reduced to a minority, Advani asked: Has Parliament become irrelevant?        
	The riposte came in a spirited speech by external affairs minister and leader of the House, Pranab Mukherjee, who argued that the nuclear deal had been discussed more extensively than any other foreign policy issue.         
	Mukherjee ended chiding the Left. Left leaders have been saying they cant choose their passengers on a train. Should they jump off because the BJP is there, too? No. They can wait for the next station when the train comes to a halt. I plead with you, whatever you do, dont identify yourselves with these (saffron) forces.

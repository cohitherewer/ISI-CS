     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                   
	Calcutta, Feb. 2: Calcutta had a close shave with a cold wave today, but another awaits it tomorrow.
    
	The minimum temperature dropped to 11.5 degrees Celsius, making Saturday one of the coldest days this winter. The Met office warned the next 24 hours could be worse.
    
	Calcutta missed the cold wave criteria by just one degree, said G.C. Debnath, director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore.
    
	The normal minimum temperature for February 2 in any year is 15 degrees Celsius. In winter, if the minimum temperature falls 5 degrees or more below normal, it is described as a cold wave.
    
	Met officials said the temperature tomorrow could dip to 10 degrees Celsius, which would make it the coldest day of the season. So far, the lowest has been 11.4 degrees Celsius, recorded on December 31.
    
	The past two days have been chilly but yesterday was a degree warmer at 12.6.
    
	The North Wind is blowing steadily even though it is not very strong. As Bihar and Jharkhand are in the grip of a cold wave, an icy wind is blowing in from that region. We are going to feel the chill till tomorrow, Debnath said.
    
	Monday onwards, the minimum temperature might rise, he added.
    
	Although Calcutta escaped the cold wave, Purulia, Bankura, Burdwan, Birbhum and Murshidabad did not. Bankura shivered at 8.4 degrees Celsius. Another cold wave warning has been issued for these districts for the next 24 hours.
    
	Darjeeling town had a low of 3.1 degrees Celsius, six degrees below normal. We expect rain or light snow in the Darjeeling and Sikkim hills in the next 24 hours, Debnath said. Met officials also warned of moderate fog reducing visibility in parts of north Bengal tomorrow.

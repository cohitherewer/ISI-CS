The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dhaka stance bolsters Delhi 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Dhaka stance bolsters Delhi 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, April 22: The Centre today made it clear that it was no longer eager to initiate talks with a banned militant outfit that kills at will, around the same time that Ulfa talks facilitator Mamoni Raisom Goswami was making an impassioned plea to Governor Ajai Singh to restart the stalled peace process.         
	Highly-placed sources said Delhi would not want to negotiate with an outfit which continued to be one of the top banned militant outfits in the country.         
	How can we negotiate with someone who is still extorting and indulging in criminal activities? asked the home ministry source. The number of civilians killed in Assam rose from 182 in 2003 to 287 in 2007, according to a home ministry report.         
	Attempts by various groups and Ulfa-appointed Peoples Consultative Group (PCG) have failed to bring the outfit to the negotiating table in the past two years.         
	There is another factor: Bangladesh.         
	The government may be cautious in its approach towards Bangladesh where Ulfa has set up base, but realises that the neighbour has discerningly improved its stance on dealing with insurgent outfits from the Northeast.         
	Last fortnight, Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) director-general Maj. Gen. Shakil Ahmed admitted that Ulfa has a base in that country. Though Ahmed said Ulfa chief Paresh Barua was no longer in Bangladesh, a surrendered Ulfa militant revealed to the BSF on Sunday that Barua was seen in that country on the outfits raising day on March 16.         
	Officially, Baruah is not in Bangladesh, said minister of state for home Shakeel Ahmed. Barua is understood to have moved to Bangkok, if one believes Dhakas version.         
	Moreover, security agencies increasing trust in the neighbour is notable.         
	Intelligence sources said though Bangladesh was sheltering Barua, the militant leader had been warned that under no circumstances should Ulfa associate with jihadi outfits.         
	They have learnt their lesson from Pakistan and know what could happen if the jihadis turn against them, said a source. Ulfa is known to have played into the hands of Pakistans ISI.         
	Minister of state for home Radhika V. Selvi today said in the Lok Sabha while no specific inputs were available on Harkat-ul-Jihad-Islami setting up base in Assam, there are reports that some outfits from the region have links with ISI and other fundamentalist groups.                     
	It was this possible connection between Ulfa and Huji that the government has expressed its concern about during meetings with the caretaker government in Bangladesh.         
	There is also solace for the government in seeing better response from Bangladesh in dealing with other outfits like the NLFT and NDFB.

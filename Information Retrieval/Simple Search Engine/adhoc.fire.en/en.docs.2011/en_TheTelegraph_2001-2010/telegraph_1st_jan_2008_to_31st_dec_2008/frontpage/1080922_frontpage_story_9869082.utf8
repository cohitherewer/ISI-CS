          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                              
	Hyderabad, Sept. 21: Hes shaved his head 200 times, half of it 100 times, cleaned public toilets and roads, even rolled down a market square  all to draw attention to the problems of his people.        
	Now, hes bested himself and his long string of gimmicks by playing dead.        
	Kurnools former mayor Bangi Ananthaiah had himself carried in a funeral procession last week to highlight the growing number of farmers being driven to death by the non-availability of fertilisers.        
	Six persons playing pall-bearers carried his flower-bedecked body through Kurnool town, 225km southwest of Hyderabad, full with hired mourners crying hoarse how much the man cared and how little the government.        
	The first reaction of the people was of shock. But that gave way to bursts of laughter when they cottoned on that their man had pulled yet another stunt for their sake.        
	Tell me another way the issue would have caught the attention of the national media, Ananthaiah, 60, guffawed when asked why he had gone in for a mock funeral.        
	The only person who was not amused was his wife, Ramanamma. I have never objected to or taken any of his protest feats seriously. But this funeral thing has gone too far, the 51-year-old, a day labourer, said.        
	His entire family  wife, two sons and three daughters  conducted special rituals at home and offered prayers at a local temple while he performed.        
	Over the past five years, Ananthaiah has thought up various innovative methods to record his protests. He is a senior party worker of the Telugu Desam and had started off as a municipal corporator.        
	Very popular among the people for raising a laugh each time he protested, Ananthaiah has demonstrated atop donkeys, buffaloes and elephants.        
	He has driven cycle-rickshaws and lorries, plonked himself in a bullock cart and even rowed a boat in the middle of the town to showcase the apathy of the administration.        
	The last time fuel prices were hiked, he rolled down the market square and tugged his old Vespa scooter with ropes.        
	To highlight the plight of day labourers, he has cleaned public toilets, marketplaces, government offices, public buses, schools and roads. He has also mocked judges, police, doctors, lawyers and teachers.        
	Reports say Ananthaiahs innovative protest count could be nearing a thousand.        
	The people of Kurnool only have good words to say about him. He gives us hope and makes us laugh, though none of his feats change anything, said U.R. Kalkura, a local hotelier.        
	Police officers and political leaders said they had learnt to take Ananthaiahs protests with a pinch of salt.

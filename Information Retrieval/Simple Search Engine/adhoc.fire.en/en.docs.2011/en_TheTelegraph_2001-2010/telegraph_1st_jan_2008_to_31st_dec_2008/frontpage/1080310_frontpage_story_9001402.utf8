  - Depleted fleet of fighter jets makes navy flagship a sitting duck          SUJAN DUTTA                             A Sea Harrier on the Viraat deck                                        
	New Delhi, March 9: The Indian Navys only aircraft carrier is almost bereft of aircraft.         
	Nearly the entire depleted fleet of the INS Viraats Sea Harrier jump-jet fleet has been grounded. This means the navys flagship is without its air defence cover and attack capability.         
	The Sea Harriers are the only fighter aircraft capable of taking off from and landing on the Viraat. Bereft of them, the Viraat is little more than a floating airstrip, a sitting duck for enemy aircraft in the event of hostilities.         
	The navy has lost more than half its fleet of 30 Sea Harriers to air crashes since they were procured from British Aerospace in 1983. British Aerospace has stopped producing the aircraft. The upshot is that the Indian Navy is now scouring used-aircraft markets  asking navies that used the aircraft but do not need them any more  to buy vintage jump-jets and cannibalise them to keep its only fleet flying.         
	But even that does not entirely explain the current acute shortage. The navy has only about 10 Sea Harriers that are fit to fly. These aircraft have now been sent into hangars for an urgent refurbishment programme for which the aircraft have been grounded. Defence minister A.K. Antony said Hindustan Aeronautics was carrying out an upgrade programme estimated at about Rs 476.69 crore. The modernisation is to be completed by 2009.         
	This means that the INS Viraat cannot be sent on an operational mission immediately if circumstances so demand.         
	This is not the first time the Sea Harriers have been almost rendered incapable of flying operational missions. In 2005, the navy took up another programme to equip the jump-jets  that have short take-off and vertical landing capability  with Israeli-made Elta-EL/M-2032 multi-mode fire control radar systems.         
	Antony admitted the shortage in Parliament earlier this week. The ongoing upgrade of Sea Harrier programme has temporarily affected the availability of the aircraft, he said in a written reply.         
	The navy is already at sea  in a way it does not like  over the procurement of the Russian-built aircraft carrier, the Admiral Gorshkov. Moscow has demanded $1.2 billion over the contracted amount of $1.5 billion for the carrier. The delivery schedule is also delayed and the earliest India can expect it is 2012.         
	But before that, in 2010, the INS Viraat is due for de-commissioning. With the Gorshkov delayed, the navy will now have to keep the Viraat floating beyond its lifespan. The carrier, again procured from the British, is more than 50 years old.         
	The navy is now proposing to buy 17 Goshawks, again from British Aerospace systems. It is also eagerly waiting for the delivery of MiG 29K/KUB fighter aircraft from Russia. The aircraft were negotiated as part of the package with the Gorshkov.

          OUR BUREAU                                                
	May 4: A 104-run stand off 55 balls should be Twenty20s version of a knockout punch. But yesterday, the Knight Riders managed to make David Hussey and Wriddhiman Sahas brilliant partnership look pointless.        
	Just as the teams original dream partnership  between iconic captain Sourav Ganguly and the games most successful coach, John Buchanan  is beginning to look a non-starter after four straight losses.        
	What went wrong for a team that just two weeks ago threatened to take the Indian Premier League by the scruff of its neck?        
	Experts say last nights game at Mohali provided several pointers. First, the Knight Riders have indeed been non-starters.        
	It takes a real bad start to make a partnership such as Hussey-Sahas look like futile head-banging against a wall. At 50 for five, they had 129 left to score at 12.5 an over.        
	Against Chennai, the Knights were 70 for five, against Mumbai, 77 for five, against Jaipur, 51 for three.        
	You cant win if you lose the first three-four wickets for less than 50 every time, said Anshuman Gaekwad, former India coach and opener.        
	Except for Brendon McCullum (158 off 73 balls) in the first match, none of the teams top batsmen have contributed, another former Test player, Chetan Chauhan, pointed out.        
	Thats the second of the Knights problems: McCullum has left to play for his country as has Ricky Ponting, widely credited as the team motivator. Chris Gayle, the first centurion in Twenty20 internationals, is absent through injury and the banned Shoaib Akhtar has just been cleared to play.        
	Ashok Mankad, one of Indian crickets shrewdest tacticians, said the teams hope lay not in the surviving big names but in local youngsters in what is a young batsmans game.        
	I am not sure whether Sourav or (David) Hussey can do it, but Im confident that Wriddhiman Saha and Debabrata Das can. They have impressed me deeply.        
	Saha (27 off 16 against Chennai and 59 off 32 yesterday) and Das (29 off 22 versus Mumbai) have been benched as often as picked, and often batted too low down, as Saha did yesterday.        
	Backing unknown young Indian batsmen has paid off for several teams in the IPL, such as Jaipur (Swapnil Asnodkar) and Delhi (Shikhar Dhawan).        
	Utpal Chatterjee, former Bengal bowler, wants the Knights to promote Hussey, too. Sourav is out of form. He seems irritated and every dot ball is putting huge pressure on him, he said.        
	Yesterdays turning point had been the 21 runs Ishant Sharma conceded in the final over of Mohalis innings. Many would point a finger at Sourav, who has stuck to his ODI-style thinking that a teams main fast bowler must bowl at the death.        
	Ishant has repeatedly bowled a miserly, wicket-taking first spell only to be tonked for fours and sixes in his last two. Many fans and experts think its a better idea to bowl him out early and hope he takes a few wickets.        
	Spinning great E.A.S. Prasanna believes Ishant is the key. When you have only 20 overs to bowl, four from the main strike bowler can win or lose a match, like it happened yesterday.        
	One other bowling strategy borrowed from ODIs that Twenty20 has hit for a six is the use of the part-time bowler. Think of Andrew Symonds going for 101 runs off his 6.5 overs. The Knights, however, continue to use Sourav, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Mohammed Hafeez and Hussey, who keep bowling one over for 15 or two for 25-30.        
	Umar Gul isnt alone in questioning Souravs captaincy. How different a beast can Twenty20 be that our senior cricketers seem so completely unable to figure it out? a Maidan long-timer was heard asking after yesterdays loss.        
	Although Shane Warne of Jaipur has shown what inspired leadership can do, most former cricketers would not speak of any failing on the part of Sourav or Buchanan.        
	In cricket, a coach hardly makes any difference. Yes, we do have a good coach and the best captain but the team has to deliver, said Devang Gandhi, Souravs former Bengal and India mate.        
	To Gopal Bose, a former Bengal player, Sourav is still the man to turn it around. He has to fire. His failure with the bat is affecting the team. One good innings from him and the scene will change.        
	 Its too early to dismiss the Knight Riders, warned M.A.K. Pataudi, arguably Indias best Test captain. You never know, they may start winning again.

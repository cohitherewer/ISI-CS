	New Delhi, April 11: Inflation has rocketed to a 40-month high of 7.41 per cent, prompting the Centre to ban export of steel and cement in the hope that domestic prices will come down.        
	Officials said more steps, including cement imports from Pakistan and higher duties on iron ore exports, were in the works.         
	But the latest decisions are seen as baby steps that could at best arrest rising prices rather than reverse them.        
	Adding to the worry of the government ahead of the elections, prices are being driven up by vegetables and metals.         
	Another dark cloud appeared on the economic horizon that suggested growth is also slowing down.         
	Government data released today showed industrial production grew 8.6 per cent in February, compared with a year earlier. This is more than Januarys revised 5.8 per cent rise, but far lower than February 2007s 11 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mixed news for Cong in panchayat poll 
                                                                                                        Mixed news for Cong in panchayat poll 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, Jan. 28: There was good and bad news for the Congress in the panchayat election trends that trickled in from the Assam districts today hours after counting of votes began against the backdrop of political violence and bureaucratic chaos.        
	By evening, the ruling party looked set to recapture a majority of the panchayats but not as convincingly as it won 90 per cent of the seats in 2001. The wake-up call for the Congress was in terms of Opposition parties making inroads into some of its rural pocket boroughs. The Congress lost ground in Bongaigaon, Dhemaji, Nalbari, Darrang and Barpeta.        
	The good news came from unexpected quarters. For all the talk about disgruntled voters from the tea tribes boycotting the elections or not voting for the Congress, the party was till late in the evening maintaining its lead in the tea belts of Sivasagar, Jorhat, Golaghat and Sonitpur districts. It did, however, suffer some setbacks in Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts.         
	Counting progressed at a slow pace throughout the day and the state Election Commission was unable to provide even trends from some of the districts because of a communication gap between the returning officers and its office in Guwahati.         
	In Nalbari town, a Congress candidate for the post of gaon panchayat president, Harin Kalita, was injured when police caned a crowd of party workers who had become restless at not getting trends from the counting centre at Bardhan Girls School. Sources said the workers threw stones at the security personnel.        
	The Assam United Democratic Front blamed the poll panel for the delayed results. Throughout these panchayat elections, the State Election Commission has faltered in discharging its responsibilities, the partys working president, Hafiz Rashid Choudhury, said.        
	The Congress was too busy reflecting on the loss of its vote base in parts of Upper and Lower Assam to be bothered about making a statement on the counting process.         
	 The results may not exactly be a setback for the party, but they will definitely call for introspection. This is presuming that the trends continue to hold till the outcome is known, which is likely only tomorrow given the slow progress of counting, a party leader said.         
	The Assam United Democratic Fronts surge in some minority-dominated pockets could hurt the Congress in the long term.         
	The panchayat results are probably an early warning for us as far as our minority vote base is concerned. When we have three cabinet ministers from the community, as against only one from the tea community (another of partys vote banks), we should have done exceptionally well in the minority-dominated areas, a Congress legislator from the tea community said.

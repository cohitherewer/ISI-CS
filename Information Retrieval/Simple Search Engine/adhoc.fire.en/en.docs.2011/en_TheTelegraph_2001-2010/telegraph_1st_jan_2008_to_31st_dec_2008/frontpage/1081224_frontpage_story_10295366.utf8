          ANEETA SHARMA                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 23: Jharkhand is looking at a revenue shortfall of Rs 2,402.65 crore in the current financial year, a 30 per cent shortfall that is likely to be compounded by the current global economic slowdown.        
	The primary sources of state revenues are commercial taxes, mines and minerals, state excise and the transport sector.         
	But with collections having dropped in all, it is unlikely the state will be able to sustain this years Plan expenditure (for development projects) targeted at Rs 8,015 crore.        
	The numbers speak for themselves. According to sources in the state secretariat, against a target of Rs 4,185.65 crore in commercial taxes, the collection has been projected at Rs 3,553 crore leading to a shortfall of Rs 632.65 crore.         
	In the mines and mineral department, the target for the year was fixed at Rs 2,600 crore but the estimated collection was Rs 1,450 crore leading to a shortfall of Rs 1,150 crore.         
	Similarly, the state excise department had fixed a target of Rs 500 crore. But collections are estimated at Rs 320 crore with a shortfall of Rs 320 crore.         
	The target for the transport department was fixed at Rs 500 crore, but with the projected collection touching only Rs 200 crore, there will be a shortfall of Rs 300 crore.         
	In absolute terms, while the budgeted target for revenue collections was Rs 8,448.38 crore, in real terms the figure touched only Rs 2,511.42 crore till October 31.         
	However, the only silver lining was that during the same period last year, revenue collection was Rs 1408.24 crore, and hence despite various constraints and impediments, revenue collection this year was Rs 1,103.18 crore more.         
	But then, the Plan outlay for 2008-09 is significantly higher than that of 2007-08 by almost Rs 2,000 crore.         
	Deputy chief minister and finance minister Stephen Marandi admitted the situation was worrisome. He attributed the revenue shortfall in the transport, excise and mines departments to leaks in the system.         
	We will plug these leaks to shore up revenue collection, he promised.        
	Secretariat sources said the primary contribution to the states revenue receipts came from the commercial taxes department.         
	The second largest revenue earning department was mines and minerals, while the other cash cow for the government was the department of excise.        
	If the projections and estimates were worrying, the real figures were dismal. In excise, Jharkhand has a target of Rs 500 crore  Chhattisgarh Rs 930 crore  but, so far only Rs 78.95 crore has been collected.         
	Similarly, in transport the actual collections were Rs 46.07 against a target of Rs 500 crore.         
	The registration department has collected a meagre Rs 96.82cr against a target of Rs 300 crore.

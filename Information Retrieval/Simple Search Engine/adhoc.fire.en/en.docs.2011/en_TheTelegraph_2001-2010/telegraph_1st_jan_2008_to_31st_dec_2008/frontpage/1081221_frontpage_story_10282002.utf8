          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, Dec. 20: Petrol and diesel prices will go up by a rupee per litre from tomorrow with the Assam government today withdrawing a relaxation given after the nationwide fuel price hike in June.         
	While petrol prices will go up from the existing Rs 46.63 to Rs 47.63 per litre, the price of diesel would go up to Rs 33.48 from Rs 32.48 per litre. The new prices come into effect from midnight.         
	A notification issued today by H.S. Das, the principal secretary of finance (taxation), said the state government had withdrawn the partial exemption granted under sub-section (1) of Section 54 of the Assam Value Added Tax Act, 2003.        
	D. Bharali, chief retail sales manager of Indian Oil Corporation, told The Telegraph that the company received the notification this evening.         
	The Assam government had on June 6 issued a notification to slash the price of petrol and diesel by a rupee each amid widespread protests against the hike.

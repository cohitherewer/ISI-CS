          SANTOSH K. KIRO                               
	Ranchi, Aug. 3: Meant to showcase the caring side of the Jharkhand government, a scheme offering financial assistance to expecting mothers has bypassed many in districts, especially those of Santhal Pargana.        
	Launched in 2006, the Mukhya Mantri Janani Suraksha Yojana entitles women to various cash benefits before and after delivery of their child either in government or private hospitals. But, a survey by an NGO has revealed that a large number of mothers are yet to be benefited by the scheme.         
	Sample this: Duckpin Pharaoh (35), wife of Ripened Pharaoh of Cho village under Sunderpahadi block in Godda district, delivered her baby on November 17, 2007, at Sunderpahadi public health centre (PHC). But she is yet to receive the yojanas benefits despite making several rounds of the health centre.         
	Similarly, Lokhni Paharia, wife of Deva Paharia of Cheo village under Sunderpahadi block, delivered her baby at the PHC on May 16, 2007. She is still waiting for the benefits of the yojana.         
	Gram Swaraj Abhiyan, the NGO which is preparing a list of mothers who are yet to receive the cash benefits, has also recorded instances of women who died during labour, but their next of kin were denied benefits of the scheme.         
	Vijay Narayan Singh, state reproductive child health officer, admitted the findings were serious. It needs to be probed if mothers who had institutional delivery at government hospitals of Santhal Pargana had to run from pillar to post to avail of the benefits of the scheme, he said.         
	That scheme is popular among rural women makes it mandatory for the state government to ensure its benefits reach them. In majority of the cases, cash benefits are being given to mothers. But I have received some complaints where some mothers have been denied the benefits. I am looking into it, said Nagendra Prasad, a civil surgeon of Latehar, one of the more backward districts of the state.         
	The Mukhya Mantri Janani Suraksha Yojana, a rechristened version of what the National Rural health Mission calls Janani Surkshya Yojana, was launched by the state government in April 2006 during the chief ministerial tenure of Arjun Munda.         
	Expecting mothers in rural areas, irrespective of their economic status, were eligible to receive Rs 1,400 under it. She would receive Rs 500 at the time of registering with medical personnel working in the village and another Rs 900 when she delivers her baby in hospital. In fact, rural women were entitled to the benefits even if they chose to deliver at a private hospital. Alternatively, they could also deliver their baby at government hospitals in cities, including the state capital.

	Los Angeles, Feb. 25 (Reuters): Hollywood turned its back on a man in a wheelchair and a woman in a Bob Dylan costume at the Academy Awards yesterday.        
	With only 24 categories, and 21 films receiving multiple nominations, not every contender could expect to share in the Oscar glory. Some were lucky just to be nominated. Even the nights top winner, No Country For Old Men, got four prizes from eight nominations  not exactly an Oscar sweep.        
	Among the high-profile losers was The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, the true story of a paralysed stroke victim. The French-language drama was snubbed in all four categories in which it was nominated.        
	The films director, Julian Schnabel, had been given an outside chance, especially after he won a Golden Globe. But he was no match for the No Country juggernaut and directors Joel and Ethan Coen.        
	In fact, the Globes could be considered an Oscar loser.        
	The event, organised by journalists for foreign publications, is often described as an Oscar barometer. But the Globes picked Atonement for best drama, while the best picture Oscar went to No Country.        
	The Globes have not foretold the best picture Oscar winner for four years.        
	Atonement got seven Oscar nominations but ended up with just one prize, for original score. The British wartime drama had been an early Oscar favourite, long before its North American release in early December.

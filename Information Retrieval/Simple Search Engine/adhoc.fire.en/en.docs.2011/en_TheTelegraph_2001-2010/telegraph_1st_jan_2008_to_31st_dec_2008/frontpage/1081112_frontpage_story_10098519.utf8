          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                              
	Dhanbad/Bokaro, Nov. 11: Chief minister Shibu Soren is in the eye of a storm brewing over alleged high-handedness in the transfer of bureaucrats with several UPA MPs of the state cut up with him.         
	Dhanbad MP Chadrashekhar Dubey today threatened to meet UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi to lodge a complaint against the functioning of the government if the transfer of Dhanbad sub-divisional officer (SDO) Dinesh Chandra Mishra was not annulled with immediate effect.        
	Antagonised Dhanbad MP met the chief minister in Bokaro last evening to express his displeasure over the transfer. He alleged that Soren was not playing the role of a UPA chief minister, but merely acting as JMM chief.        
	Dubey threatened to resort to harsh measures if Mishras transfer was not stayed. Before boarding the train to New Delhi today, he said he would reveal his plans after meeting Sonia. The MP claimed he was not the only UPA MP antagonised over the transfer and posting of officials. Other UPA MPs harboured the same grudge as a majority of the transfers were made without taking them into confidence, despite knowing that polls were due in few months and they would have to answer to voters queries.        
	Hazaribagh MP Bhubaneswar Mehta met Soren and raised objections against the cancellation of the transfer of Hazaribagh SDO R.K. Singh, who has been in the same post for the past several years.         
	Mehta, after meeting Soren, told The Telegraph the chief minister had assured him he would look into the matter personally and justice would be done.        
	According to high-level sources a transfer list of several IPS officers, including Ranchi senior superintendent of police M.S. Bhatia, coal belt DIG Anurag Gupta, north Chhotanagpur IG B.B. Pradhan, Hazaribagh DIG Ajay Singh, Hazaribagh SP Praveen Singh, DIG and former police spokesperson Raj Kumar Mallick, JAP commandant Tadasha Mishra, Bokaro SP Priya Dubey and Giridih SP Murarilal Meena, was prepared yesterday in Bokaro.

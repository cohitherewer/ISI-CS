                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mamata ready for talks with Tatas
          OUR BUREAU                              Mamata, Ratan Tata				                                 
	Calcutta, Aug. 7: Mamata Banerjee has expressed willingness to talk to the Tatas to resolve the Singur standoff, provided a proposal comes from them.        
	The CPM also sought to sound accommodative without making any commitment, suggesting that alternative land for unwilling farmers or ancillary units could be pondered over if the government chose to do so.        
	I am ready to talk to the Tatas if a proposal comes from them. This is a matter of courtesy. Moreover, I am not opposed to the car plant at Singur, Mamata said two days after indicating that she did not want the industrial house to leave Bengal.        
	However, she stuck to the condition that the 400 acres allegedly acquired forcibly from unwilling farmers should be returned.        
	But in the discussions, I would request them (the Tatas) to tell the state government to return the 400 acres to unwilling farmers and set up the car plant on the remaining 600 acres. The Tatas have some social obligations after all, and I have no confrontation with them, Mamata told a news conference in response to a question whether she would hold talks with the Nano makers.        
	In a cautious reaction, an official with Tata Motors said the company was not averse to talking to anyone. He added that it would be premature at this stage to speculate about the specific issues that could be discussed at the meeting, whenever that is held.        
	A close aide to Mamata said her gesture was meant to address the charge that she was anti-development. The perception was reinforced after eight business chambers issued separate carefully worded appeals since Tuesday expressing deep concern at disruptions of major projects        
	We are a responsible Opposition and are at the helm of governance in two zilla parishads, East Midnapore and South 24-Parganas. At this juncture, we want to send a message across the state that we are not opposed to industry to counter the CPMs propaganda, the aide said.        
	If Mamata is looking for a face-saver, the CPM held out an olive branch. Party state secretary Biman Bose said the government could ponder over Mamatas proposal for giving land elsewhere to farmers who are unwilling to part with their Singur plots. It is up to the government to take a decision. I have nothing to say.        
	Bose suggested that if Mamata had a proposal for shifting the ancillary units from the project site, she should come to the negotiation table with a map and other details and put across her views.        
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen had earlier ruled out acquisition of alternative plots but Boses comments  albeit non-committal  suggest the party is keen to bring Mamata to the talks table and defuse the crisis for the time being.        
	Its good that Mamata has expressed her desire to have a dialogue with the Tatas. But before that, she should also talk to the state government. After all, an across-the-table discussion is the need of the hour to clear the misgivings, the usually acerbic Bose said.        
	Industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen also welcomed Mamatas gesture. A negotiation is always good, more so in this situation. I certainly hope it happens. But I cannot answer your question on whether the Opposition would eventually sit down across the table with the Tatas.        
	Asked if she would hold talks with the state government, Mamata said: On my side, there is no problem. But if the government wants to discuss everything except return of the excess land, the discussion has no meaning. They should begin talks with an open mind and without any conditions.        
	Nandigram meet        
	Mamata said tonight that she was not opposed to the chief ministers peace initiative in Nandigram, where another CPM leader was killed today and several families have started fleeing.        
	The chief minister has convened an all-party meeting in Tamluk on Saturday.

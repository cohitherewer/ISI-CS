  - Peter Thangaraj talks of hits, misses in his final interview          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                             The grand old man of Indian football. Picture by Pankaj Singh                                        
	Bokaro, Nov. 25. Legendary footballer Peter Thangaraj died of a massive heart attack at Bokaro General Hospital early on Tuesday.         
	Survived by his wife, three daughters and a son, the last rites of the 70-year-old former India goalkeeper will be performed at a church here tomorrow.         
	Born in Hyderabad on Christmas day, the Arjuna awardee represented the country in the Olympics in 1956 and 1960 and in the Asian Games in 1958, 1962 and 1966. He has also played for Calcuttas top three clubs: Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting.         
	Thangaraj moved to the steel city when Bokaro Steel offered him a job as sports officer and coach in the 70s. Later, he became adviser to Bokaro Football Academy. After his retirement, Bokaro Steel used his skills to promote sports in the rural areas of the district.        
	Thangaraj had spoken to The Telegraph more than week ago while he was at the Mohan Kumar Mangalam Stadium to watch a few matches of the All India SAIL Golden Football tournament. Excerpts...        
	Happy moments         
	There are many The first one came when under my captaincy, Services won the Santosh Trophy beating formidable Bengal. Being included in the India team which represented the country in the 1956 Olympics was the other momentous occasion in my life. Playing alongside P.K Banerjee, Mewalal, Balram, Chunni Goswami, Arun Ghosh made me feel on top of the world. I also have very happy memories of winning the soccer championships at the 1966 Bangkok Asiad and winning IFA Shield for East Bengal by defeating Irans Taj club. I played alongside Habib, Sudhir, Parimal Dey and Santo Mitra.        
	Regrets        
	I havent yet got the Padmashree like many of my peers like P.K. Banerji and others, who gave me lots of love and affection. I did not get the award as no MP of united Bihar or Jharkhand ever referred my name. Even Priya Ranjan Das Munshi told me that he felt guilty after coming to know that no one recommended my name.         
	I felt happy when P.K Banerjee, (Sailen) Manna da, Chunni Goswami got the Padmashree for giving their best to soccer. I too deserve these awards and respect but no politician is coming forward. Right now, I have been assigned the job of developing sports and games in rural areas of Bokaro.         
	Future of Indian soccer        
	Indian soccer has grown, but the standard of international soccer has developed much, more. We will have to go miles to be at par with other countries. There are many Dhonis in football and other sports, but the government does not pay attention to sports in this state.        
	Mistakes        
	The biggest mistake of my life was to shift to Bokaro, where initially I got some love and respect. Later in 2004 when some Bokaro Steel officials hatched a conspiracy to evict me, thanks to your paper, I was able to save my quarters.                                       
	I had gone on a fast after which former chief minister Jyoti Basu, Union ministers Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Ram Vilas Paswan took up my case.        
	Spending time        
	Life has become hell for me and no one recognises me now. In the morning, I go to the grounds in Sector-V to feed crows and dogs all the while repenting my decision not to stay in Bengal.        
	Last wish        
	When I die, India should remember me as a goalkeeper who wanted to raise the standard of Indian soccer. After my death, if the people of Bengal still love me, they should convene a prayer meeting for me as I still love them and I am obliged they gave be prestige and respect. I bow my head to peers like Chunni Goswami, P.K Banerjee, Mewalal who had always told me not to leave Bengal.

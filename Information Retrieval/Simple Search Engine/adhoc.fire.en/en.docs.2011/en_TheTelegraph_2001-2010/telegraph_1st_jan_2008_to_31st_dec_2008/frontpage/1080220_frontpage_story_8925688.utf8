The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Border fence, on island that shifts 
                                                                                                           Border fence, on island that shifts 
          BHAVNA VIJ-AURORA                            The fence on the Bangladesh border along Assams Dhubri district                                   
	Feb. 19: When Delhi sanctioned a 76km fencing of the Bangladesh border along Assams Dhubri district, it had no idea that a six-mile stretch would demand an engineering feat.        
	Never had such fencing been erected across one of Brahmaputras chars (islands), dumps of soft silt and shifting sand that keep changing position and size, thanks to the strong river undercurrent and erosion.        
	A year and eight months on, the 9.3km fence across Mantrichar and Masalabari  the two halves of the island that lacks a name  is almost complete at about Rs 25 crore. A crucial crossing point for illegal immigrants and cattle and ganja smugglers has been blocked.        
	From the start, the job posed challenges, a home ministry official who had been to the site said. Question No. 1 was: how do you take heavy equipment to a place accessible only by boat?        
	The island has a population of 75,000 people, mostly on the Indian side. They had never seen a motorised vehicle till we took our dumpers, road rollers, mixers, JCBs, cranes and vibratory rollers, said BSF deputy inspector-general Hemant Desai, whose men supervised the construction.        
	To ferry the equipment, 70-foot-long barges were specially built with the help of local boat-makers. Each ferry was made by joining two barges and building a platform across the pair.        
	At times, the boats got stuck in the sands of the river because of the heavy load. The equipment had to be offloaded in the river to retrieve the boat, and then pulled up by cranes, the ministry official said.        
	To get the vehicles on the island, ghats had to be built at various heights  because the rivers water level keeps changing.                  
	Onkar Kedia, additional director-general in the ministry, said normal fencing was not possible because of the soft, shifting soil.        
	The foundation would have been weak. So the NBCC (National Buildings Construction Corporation), which did the job, brought in cement, soil and stones from the mainland.        
	A one-foot-deep base was made with stones, over which an apron, 60cm deep and 1.5 metres wide, was built with boulders along the entire 9.3km. This was overlaid with cement and the posts for the barbed wire erected.        
	Two bridges and culverts had to be built: a 70-metre-wide channel of the river runs through the middle of the island.        
	You know, the islands area was never measured because it changed continuously, the official said. Thats the sort of soil we had to build on.        
	But he said this particular char was one of the most stable  which is why permission was sought to fence it. Home minister Shivraj Patil gave the nod after he saw the situation first hand in 2005.        
	Dhubri is one of the worst infiltration-hit districts with its minority population having increased by 29.5 per cent between the 1991 and 2001 censuses. Once a Bangladeshi lands on the island, he just has to take a boat to the Assam mainland  its that easy, the official said.        
	Construction could be done only when the rain stopped, from November to April, while the material had to be transported during the May-October wet season  when there was enough water in the river  and stacked at the site.        
	The fencing will be almost complete by March 31 this year, but the stone-pitching (covering the slopes with a layer of stones) is likely to extend into the next working season. The stones and boulders will be ferried in May-June.        
	How did the islanders react to the construction?        
	When our rollers, cranes and Gypsys started landing, the children were awed. They asked a labourer what the vehicles ate and he said in jest, grass, DIG Desai said.        
	Suddenly, the children began putting grass in the radiator. We then explained to them how the machines worked. Now we sometimes take them out for a spin.

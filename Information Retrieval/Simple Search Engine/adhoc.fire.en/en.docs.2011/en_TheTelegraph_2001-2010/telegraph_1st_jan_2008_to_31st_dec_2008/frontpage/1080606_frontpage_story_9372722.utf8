          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, June 5: The Centre today decided to hit the DHD(J) where it will hurt most  by wiping out mentor outfit NSCN (I-M), with whose help the Dimasa group allegedly flexes its muscles in North Cachar Hills.         
	 A meeting between a Delhi team headed by special secretary (internal security), M.L. Kumawat, representatives of security forces and the state government concluded that if the East-West corridor and the gauge conversion projects in North Cachar Hills were to be completed, it was imperative that the NSCN (I-M) be neutralised.        
	The central team, which arrived here today, directed the security forces deployed in counter-insurgency operations in the state to go all out against the Naga outfit.         
	The DHD (J) on its own is not at all difficult to handle for the security forces, but along with the NSCN (I-M) the outfit becomes an altogether different proposition, an official, who attended the meeting, said.         
	Kumawat, who was appointed chairman of the ceasefire monitoring groups of the two NSCN factions on Tuesday, said he would also take up the matter with the Isak-Muivah faction.         
	He would prevail upon the outfit not to assist the DHD (J) since North Cachar Hills was not within the geographical ambit of the Centres ceasefire with the group, he said.         
	DHD (J) publicity secretary, Paiprang Dimasa, however, denied his group having any links with the NSCN (I-M).         
	Yes, it is true that all groups know each other, but it ends there, he said asserting all operations were carried out by itself and not with help of the Naga militant group. We have nothing in common with them, he said.         
	Welcoming the central teams visit, Paiprang said he hoped the government would take positive steps towards initiating a dialogue with the outfit.         
	Let us hope that the Dimasa issue is resolved at the highest level through negotiations, he said, adding that increasing security forces in the district would not help matters.         
	There are 46 companies of security forces deployed in the district. It is perhaps the highest deployment in a single district in the country, he said.         
	The security meeting also decided to increase the frequency of movement of goods trains on the Lumding-Badarpur section which passes through the district to ensure adequate movement of foodgrains to south Assam and the landlocked states of Tripura and Mizoram.         
	Services on the 185-km stretch were withdrawn after DHD (J) rebels gunned down a locomotive driver and injured three on May 15  the day 10 truckers were gunned down by members of the outfit elsewhere in the district.        
	Only a few goods trains have been gingerly plodding through the tracks for the past few days.        
	The home ministry officials asked the security agencies deployed in the district to ensure that the train services were normalised.         
	Since the monsoon is approaching, our priority is to ensure that there is no shortage of foodgrains in Tripura and Mizoram, said a member of the visiting central team.

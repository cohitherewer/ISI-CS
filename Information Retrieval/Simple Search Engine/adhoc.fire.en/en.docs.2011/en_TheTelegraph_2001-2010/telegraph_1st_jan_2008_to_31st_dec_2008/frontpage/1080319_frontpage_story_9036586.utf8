                                                                                                           Camera catches airport cell thief
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Calcutta, March 18: An airline employee was today caught on closed-circuit television stealing a passengers cellphone at Calcutta airports security check-in counter.        
	Dhiraj Gurung, 24, security supervisor with MDLR Airlines, was detained by the Central Industrial Security Force while he was leaving the airport by the company bus. The mobile was seized from him and he was handed over to airport police, CISF sources said.        
	M.R. Sharma, a passenger of Jet Airways 12.45pm Calcutta-Agartala flight, had checked in at the security counter around noon. He placed his mobile on the tray for X-ray scanning before he was frisked.        
	Sharma then forgot to collect the phone. But a short while later, just as departure was announced, he remembered the phone and rushed back to the counter, a CISF official said.        
	Failing to find the mobile, Sharma informed the CISF. Since his flight was about to take off, he boarded the plane without the phone.        
	The CISF official said Gurung had seen Sharma head for the departure lounge without his phone after the frisking. He immediately walked up to the X-ray counter, picked the phone up and put it inside his right trouser pocket.        
	But he did not realise that the CCTV installed over the X-ray machine had recorded his act.        
	The CCTV was rewound and Gurung was seen picking up the phone from the tray and pocketing it, the official said.        
	Gurung, who is from Kurseong but works in the city, had by then walked to the empty hangar of MDLR and boarded the airline bus that drops staff off at their homes.        
	We were searching for him all over the airport and had alerted all the staff, the official said. As the bus was about to leave the airport around 1.30pm, jawans stopped it. Gurung was identified and asked to get off.        
	He denied the charge but looked scared. The phone was still in his right pocket when we searched him, the official said.        
	Gurung had earlier been sacked by another private airline on the charge of theft, CISF sources said. MDLR officials were not available for comment.

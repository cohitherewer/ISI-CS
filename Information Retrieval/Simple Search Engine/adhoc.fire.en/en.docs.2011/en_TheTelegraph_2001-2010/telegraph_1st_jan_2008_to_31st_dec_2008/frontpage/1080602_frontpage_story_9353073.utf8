The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rice-dal problem for Indians in Britain
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Rice-dal problem for Indians in Britain
          AMIT ROY                             Basmati baron Moni Varma with wife Shoba                                  
	London, June 1: Sunday is normally a day when Indian families all over the UK go out and do their bulk buying of staple food items  and today, as reports started circulating that supermarkets were taking steps to forestall panic-buying of rice, there was added incentive to stock up on bags of Basmati.         
	Although supermarkets have gone out of their way to quash suggestions that they are rationing rice, it has been confirmed that specific stores in Leicester, where nearly a quarter of the population is Indian, have been telling customers that they cannot buy more than six bags of rice.         
	In one store, the purchase was limited to two bags.         
	And the price is rapidly going up.         
	A 10kg bag of Tilda Basmati, which could be bought for 17 or less a few weeks ago, sold for over 22, typically, at a branch of Waitrose in Beckenham in south London yesterday.        
	Speaking today from Durban where he was on business, UK Basmati baron Moni Varma, the chairman of Veetee Rice, said India had stabilised prices domestically by imposing a ban on the export of non-Basmati rice and a new tax of $200 per tonne on Basmati. However, this has deprived Indian farmers of the chance to make money by selling on the world market.         
	He revealed that Asian traders in the UK had cleaned out stocks of Veetee from Costco superstores in the UK, buying 100 bags each at a time on the retail market.         
	Replacement cost is going to be high, he said. Basmati has gone up by 100 per cent.         
	The Telegraph learnt today that the shortages affecting rice now appear to be spreading to pulses.         
	We cannot buy dal from India, complained Chef Andy Varma, who runs the upmarket Vama restaurant in Londons Chelsea. We have to buy our dal now from Australia, which is a very different, harder kind of dal.         
	Varma, who is proud of the dal he serves because he considers it to be one of his signature dishes, said: We have been experimenting with this new dal, seeing how we can cook it.         
	He admitted that the escalating price of rice was affecting him very badly because he was locked into annual contracts with airlines to whom he supplied prepared Indian meals for in-flight services.         
	Despite the denial from supermarkets, the Financial Times, not normally a sensationalist paper, reported yesterday: Supermarket chains have begun rationing rice as the effects of rising prices and disruptions to supply spill over from specialist grocers and suppliers to larger stores.         
	It disclosed that Netto, the Danish-owned discount store, was restricting sales of larger bags of rice to one per person in all stores in recent weeks across the UK.         
	It quoted Mike Hinchcliffe, marketing manager for Netto UK: Were temporarily limiting our larger 10kg bags of rice to one per customer because, like most other UK supermarkets, we are having to manage and minimise the impact the global rice shortage is having on our suppliers. We are experiencing a high demand for rice and have introduced this measure across our 184 UK stores to ensure that all of our customers have a fair opportunity to make their regular rice purchases. Our smaller 1kg packs remain on free sale with no restrictions planned at this time.         
	Netto expected the restriction to continue indefinitely.         
	The Financial Times, along with other newspapers, have identified examples of rationing in Leicester.         
	It said that staff at Tescos Hamilton store in Leicester were limiting customers to two packs per person, irrespective of the size of the bags.         
	Today, when The Telegraph raised the issue with Tesco, a spokeswoman maintained: Leicester is a place where there are big consumers of rice  some people were buying big quantities of rice because of media reports. There was a restriction at this one store for a couple of weeks but this was a mistake. There is no rationing and we would urge people not to panic buy because there is no problem.         
	According to the FT, a manager at Wm Morrisons Freemans Park store, also in Leicester, said: We have been restricting rice to six packs per customer, no matter what size of bag, although we are expecting to get supplies in. Its a directive weve had just for our store. There is something going on with rice at the moment. Other supermarkets are doing the same.         
	Staff at Asdas Thurmaston store in Leicester confirmed similar restrictions at their branch. They said they were not allowed to sell more than six bags a customer.         
	What the supermarkets are probably worried about are grocers and small traders, rather than families, indulging in bulk buying and turning a difficult but manageable situation into a crisis.         
	Questioned by The Telegraph, a spokeswoman for William Morrison sang from the same hymn sheet as her colleague from Tesco: There is no rice rationing, even at this store in Leicester.         
	In London, meanwhile, Varma cannot do anything other than peg prices at his restaurant.         
	If we put up our prices by 30 per cent, people would stop coming in, he pointed out..

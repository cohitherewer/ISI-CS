          AMIT ROY                             Peter Williams                                  
	London, June 24: Some universities in the UK are devaluing British degrees by awarding them to second- and third-rate foreign students so long as they pay their fees, it was revealed today.         
	This criticism about the quality of overseas intakes does not apply to the more than 18,000 students who come from India.         
	The principal concern of the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) for Higher Education is that some institutions see foreign students as a source of much needed revenue and are not particularly bothered about the performance levels of their recruits or their inability to cope with English-language lessons.         
	The QAA, set up in 1997, makes it clear: Our mission is to safeguard the public interest in sound standards of higher education qualifications and to inform and encourage continuous improvement in the management of the quality of higher education.         
	We do this by working with higher education institutions to define academic standards and quality, and we carry out and publish reviews against these standards.         
	Its latest reports are beyond the must-try-harder category and nearer to simply-not-good-enough.         
	Although the five-star British universities  Oxbridge, Imperial, LSE, London University, Sussex, Warwick, York and Bristol, for example  are as good for most courses as anything America can offer, the QAA is worried about other institutions which are filling their ranks with foreign students irrespective of their ability to cope with English lessons.         
	The newer universities in Britain offer subjects not available at more traditional institutions  subjects such as fashion, design, textiles, film and media studies.         
	The problem, which the QAA has addressed, is deciphering which course is worthwhile and which is a complete waste of money.         
	Peter Williams, chief executive of the QAA, told the BBC: The way that degrees are classified is a rotten system. It just doesnt work any more.         
	He said that in general, university standards remained robust. But universities were shooting themselves in the foot by trying to fit so many different types of students and abilities into the grading system of first-and second-class degrees.         
	He was critical that some universities were recruiting overseas students in an unsustainable fashion. At one university, more than 40 per cent of its intake was from overseas.         
	There is a belief from some overseas students that if they pay their fees, they will get a degree, Williams alleged. We have to make clear that does not operate here.         
	The difficulty started with the use of agents who were paid commission on the number of students recruited from abroad. The problem is that when agents are paid to recruit overseas students, they might be encouraged to take short cuts.         
	In defence of British universities, Diana Warwick, chief executive of the higher education representative body, Universities UK, said the quality of UK honours degrees is the envy of the world.         
	Universities were already debating the classification of degrees, said Baroness Warwick.         
	She added: Institutions are well aware of the issue of the sustainability of international student numbers, particularly in an increasingly competitive environment.         
	Last week, the BBC News website published a whistleblowers claim that a leading university was awarding postgraduate degrees to overseas students who could barely speak English.         
	The QAA had touched a raw nerve, judging from the response of a professor at a well-known strong UK university (the kind of place where you need at least three As to get in).         
	The professor told the BBC: Our department is being pressurised from above to award more 1st and upper 2nd class degrees  we were told in no uncertain terms that if we were supposed to be a world-class university full of world-class lecturers then how come only (whatever it is) per cent are being awarded good degrees  we were told that our funding risked being cut if we did not start giving out (what they wanted) per cent of first and upper seconds!         
	Another comment was: I recently completed my MSc (as a mature student of 29 years old) and was amazed and somewhat disgusted with the level of education and language skills shown by many of the foreign students.

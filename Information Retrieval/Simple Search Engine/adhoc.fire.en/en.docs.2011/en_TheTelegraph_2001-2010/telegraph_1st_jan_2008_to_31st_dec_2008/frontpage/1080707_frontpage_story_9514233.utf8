	Ranchi, July 6: Breaking from the age-old tradition, two Planning Commission members Abhijit Sen and B.N. Yugandhar visited Garhwa to gauge the impact of the UPA governments flagship schemes, including the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS).        
	Garhwa is the home district of NREGS activist Lalit Mehta, a close associate of economist Jean Drze.        
	During a closed-door meeting with district administration officials, Yugandhar is said to have refused to agree with various block development officers that Naxalism was posing a problem in implementation of the NREGA. We are not in a position to monitor the schemes properly, one of the BDOs argued.        
	The rebels pose a problem when there are middlemen and contractors involved in the implementation of the schemes. Since the NREGA rules do not stipulate for contractors, there should not be any problem, Yugandhar, who had earlier functioned as adviser to former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, is said to have told them.        
	The two members, for the first time, hit the field to hold a mid-term review meeting with the district officials in Naxalite-hit Garhwa district. Normally, the commission used to hire consultants to conduct the mid-term appraisal of the schemes. But a week ago, it decided to send its members to various states to make a mid-term review of projects.        
	Development commissioner Ashok Kumar Singh and Garhwa deputy commissioner-in-charge Surendra Prasad Singh were present at the meeting.         
	They also met Ashrita Tirkey, the widow of Lalit, and assured her all help to educate her children. According to Jawahar Mehta, the treasurer of Lalits NGO Vikas Sahyog Kendra, Ashrita pointed out to the members that the police investigations had left several questions unanswered. She also urged that the CBI probe should continue.         
	According to sources, the members reviewed the utilisation of backward regional development funds, general forest schemes under NREGA, other forest, agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery and soil conservation schemes.

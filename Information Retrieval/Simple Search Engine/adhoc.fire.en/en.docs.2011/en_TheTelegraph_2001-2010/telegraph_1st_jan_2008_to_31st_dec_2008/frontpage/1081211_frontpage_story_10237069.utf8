          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 10: Any school with over 10 per cent teaching posts vacant can be penalised under the new free and compulsory education bill that the UPA plans to table in Parliament in the session that started today.         
	The proposed law, commonly known as the right to education bill, for the first time makes each school accountable for ensuring adequate teachers for its students, officials have told The Telegraph.         
	The bill aims to make schooling free and compulsory  as the laws name suggests  for all children aged between 6 and 14. It also tries to ensure that once in school, students are not left in empty classrooms without teachers to guide them.         
	At present, there are no legally binding standards in India on teaching strength that schools are required to maintain. Schools in every state, including Delhi, will need to pull up current standards to meet the new requirements, sources said.         
	The first draft of the bill, prepared in 2005, was described by critics  education experts and some politicians  as toothless and lacking in emphasis on quality of education. The revised bill was drafted keeping the criticism in mind, the sources said.         
	Each school will have to ensure a pupil-teacher ratio not higher than 40:1, apart from ensuring that its faculty vacancies do not ever cross 10 per cent of the sanctioned strength.         
	If the school is government-funded, the municipality concerned, the state or the Centre will be held responsible, along with the school administration, and a civil suit can be moved against them.         
	The punishment may be slightly different for private schools, a human resource development ministry official said.         
	Schools in India  private or public  are affiliated to a slew of boards such as the Central Board of Secondary Education, the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations or state boards. Affiliating boards keep track of the sanctioned teaching strength of each school.         
	Under the new law, any school with more than 10 per cent vacancies of its sanctioned strength or a student-teacher ratio worse than 40:1 can lose its affiliation.        
	The standards will have to be met by all schools in the country.         
	The so-called better states in education have a decent student-teacher ratio and less than 10 per cent vacancies overall. But if you study deeper, you find this is because the conditions in some parts  cities in particular  are exceptional, but abysmal in other areas of the state, the official said.         
	The student-teacher ratio requirement is critical to ensure that a school increases its sanctioned strength if it attracts more students, the official said.         
	Once the law is passed, the Centre and state governments will together be legally responsible for ensuring that each child in the 6-14 age group is in school.

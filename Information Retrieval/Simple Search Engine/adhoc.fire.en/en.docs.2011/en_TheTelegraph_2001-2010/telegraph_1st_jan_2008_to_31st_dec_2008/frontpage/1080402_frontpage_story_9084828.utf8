          RAJ KUMAR                                              
	Ranchi, April 1: Aided by night-vision bombs, the police gunned down eight Naxalites after a fierce, three-hour encounter early today in the Makhatu forests of Garhwa district.        
	Among the dead were a CPI (Maoist) self-styled sub-zonal commander Basant Yadav, two area commanders, Lalanji and Rajendraji, and a woman cadre, Chotki.        
	The police also recovered 12 weapons, including a self-loading rifle, four .303 rifles, four .315 rifles, one double-barrel gun, one country-made pistol, 50kg of gelatine sticks and 400 rounds of ammunition.        
	Around Monday midnight, Naxalites opened fire moments after the police intercepted them at a checkpost around 2km from Bandhu village in Ranka police station area, about 200km from Ranchi.        
	A group of around 20 rebels was going towards Rangpura village from Khatwa More on a tractor when the police intercepted them around 12.45am for a routine security check. They immediately opened fire, said state police spokesperson R.K. Mallick.        
	The police retaliated and after a gunbattle of over two-and-a-half-hours, eight Naxalites in their trademark fatigues were killed. No policemen were hurt, he said.        
	In the first half-an-hour there was a continuous exchange of fire. Later, this became intermittent  one following the other. Finally, when the firing stopped it was around 3.30am, said a police officer from Garhwa.        
	In fact, the firing would have probably continued if Naxalites did not retreat fearing more losses, he added.         
	Sources said during the encounter police used para bombs that illuminate the area. Hence, it was relatively easy for us to identify the targets and take aim. Also, the Naxalites could not take advantage of the darkness, another policeman from Garhwa said.        
	Director-general of police V.D. Ram, who rushed to the spot along with inspector-general of police (operations) D.K. Pandey this morning, has declared an award for the policemen who took part in the operation.        
	Constables and officers of the CRPF 13th battalions D company, the Jharkhand Armed Police 7th battalion and a few state police officers would get a cash award of Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000.        
	They will also be recommended for gallantry awards and get a commendation letter from the state police chief. Two officers from the state police will also be promoted, added Mallick.

     ANUPAM BORDOLOI ATONU CHOUDHURRI
                        
	Itanagar, Jan. 31: Sometimes actions say what words do not reveal.
    
	Without mentioning China, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today launched a road project worth Rs 5,500 crore  the 1,840-km-long Trans Arunachal Pradesh Highway  that will connect every district headquarters and facilitate easy movement of civilians and war machinery till the international border.
    
	Read with the decision to start a daily helicopter service between Guwahati and Tawang, the message to Beijing is clear: Delhi is in control of its territory, never mind Chinas claims to some of it.
    
	Another fact that did not go unnoticed was that the Prime Minister was visiting Arunachal Pradesh just a couple of days after the appointment of the armys former chief of staff, Gen. J.J. Singh, as governor.
    
	The Prime Minister, however, gave nothing away in speech. His statements during the public meeting at Indira Gandhi Park were typically bereft of rhetoric and couched in the philosophy of pacifism. Our government in Delhi is keen to ensure that the state progresses along with the rest of the country and we will do whatever it takes to put Arunachal Pradesh among the most developed states, he said.
    
	The minister of state in the Prime Ministers Office, Prithviraj Singh Chauhan, too evaded saying anything on China during the media briefing later. The two BJP parliamentarians from the state, Khiren Rijiju and Tapir Gao, had written to the PMO about the hostile intentions of Indias neighbour and asked for an official condemnation preceding Singhs visit.
    
	Chauhan said the Prime Minister was visiting the state to announce Delhis development plans and nothing else. Any issue with a neighbouring country will be taken up by the external affairs ministry.
    
	The others who accompanied Singh to Itanagar are minister of state for railways Narayanbhai Rathwa, DoNER minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia. 
    
	The sun shone after nearly a week of rain and cloudy weather. Appropriately, the Prime Minister also spoke of the sun. The sun kisses India first in Arunachal Pradesh. It is our land of the rising sun.
    
	While the weather was sunny, it rained projects on the state. Singh unveiled projects worth Rs 10,000 crore, including a rail link between Harmuti in Assam and Itanagar.
    
	The projects for which he laid the foundation stones today are a secretariat, a drinking water facility for Itanagar and power plants for Pare and Dibang. The Prime Minister sportingly donned a traditional Monpa shirt that chief minister Dorjee Khandu gifted him. He was also greatly interested when troupes of different tribes performed at the function.

  - Disabled children amp; orphans set up club to address rights          PRIYA ABRAHAM                            Future secured at their hands                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 15: They are a motley crew comprising disabled children, child labourers, school dropouts, orphans and ragpickers, but they are united by a common thread  Ananya Childrens Club.         
	Biswa Ranjan Mishra, the club secretary, is 12. Yet, he can put a babu to shame when he discusses the NREGS scheme and its importance for the urban poor. And he is confident and articulate while talking of his rights.         
	While state officials and citizens talk, 15 such childrens clubs, set up across nine slums and six villages of Bhubaneswar, are taking on various issues involving children  child labour to school punishment to mid-day meals.         
	So far, children of certain clubs have rescued 112 child labourers who worked in households.         
	The clubs, with 940 members, are known as Shishu Sanghas and were formed in 2003 at nine slums and a village in Bhubaneswar under a programme-campaign against domestic child labour by Centre for Child and Women Development.         
	About 60 per cent of labour force in Orissa are less than 14 years of age and five percent of them work as domes-tic help.         
	Reports say 94.86 per cent of rural children work and the percentage comes to 5.14 in urban areas. In both the cases, girls, outnumbers the boys. Orissa reportedly has about 30-lakh child labourers. Each club has more than 50 members who organise meetings to plan their strategy.         
	We locate homes where kids below 14 work and go to them in groups. We first try to convince them and if required threaten them of police action in case they keep children as domestic helps, said Siba Rao, a member  and a teenager.         
	Of the 112 rescued children 40 now go to school, 37 have returned to their villages and 25 are enrolled in vocational training.                                            
	Clubs have been constituted at slums at BDA Nilamadhav, Niladri Vihar Rickshaw Colony, Science Park, DDK and Padmakesharpur besides villages in close vicinity.        
	But child labour isnt the only issue that the club tackles. Itishree Pardahan (12) and her Alok Jyoti Childrens Club keenly checks corporal punishment in schools.         
	The punishments are a major reason for children dropping out. Some 20 per cent of kids drop out because they fear classrooms, explains Itishree with an ease of a psychologist.         
	The club also actively places suggestion boxes in four schools where children can drop in their complaints. We later take them out and discuss them and make teachers and students understand the situation better, she says. And she is no psychologist.        
	In the same effective manner the children have been monitoring the quality of mid-day meals, the issue of school security and toilet facilities.         
	They shoulder a great responsibility gracefully and they need to be acknowledged for that. We have seen that government schools are hesitant to take in children from the slum area. After seeing these super kids, such a narrow mindset should be changed, said Mahendra Parida, secretary of the CCWD.

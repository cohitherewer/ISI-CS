          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, April 11: Eight hundred labourers of a Polish company ransacked their office to fight for a Rongali Bihu advance but did not bother to look back when one their own fell while trying to flee after a police firing.        
	A labourer of GeoFizyka Toran, a company engaged in seismic survey for Oil India Limited at Behiating in Dibrugarh, was injured when he fell victim to a stampede by his colleagues in their rush to escape on hearing gunshots.        
	The police personnel posted on the company premises, however, had only fired in the air to disperse the mob.        
	It all began this morning, soon after the salaries for March were paid.        
	The months wages in hand, the labourers began demanding an advance for the spring festival.        
	Naren Sonowal, a contractor who is responsible for payment of salary, told them there was not enough cash left and the payments could be made only the day after.         
	Not satisfied with the reply, the workers broke the main gate, ransacked the office and pelted stones at the officials, forcing the policemen posted there to fire in the air.         
	One of the labourers was injured after he fell down while fleeing.         
	Chased away by the policemen, the workers marched about 1.5km to National Highway 37 and began attacking vehicles, to protest the firing.        
	The road remained blocked for several hours till senior police officials and a magistrate from Dibrugarh. The labourers emptied the road only after securing an assurance from the district administration that they would get an advance payment.         
	Following a round of discussions between the administration and the company officials, the labourers were paid 10 days wages, after which they dispersed.        
	An officer at Barbaruah police station later said the policemen at the companys temporary office had to resort to blank firing because there were at least nine foreign nationals present when the workers went on a rampage.         
	Had any of the foreign nationals got injured it would have turned into a major issue, he said.

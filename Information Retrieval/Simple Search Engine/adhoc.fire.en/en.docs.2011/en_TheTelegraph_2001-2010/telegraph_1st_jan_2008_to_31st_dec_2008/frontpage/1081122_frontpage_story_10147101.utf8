	Los Angeles, Nov. 21: When Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt negotiated with People and other celebrity magazines this summer for photos of their newborn twins and an interview, the stars were seeking more than the estimated $14 million they received from the deal.        
	They also wanted a hefty slice of journalistic input  a promise that the winning magazines coverage would be positive, not merely in that instance but into the future.        
	According to the deal offered by Jolie, the winning magazine was obliged to offer coverage that would not reflect negatively on her or her family, according to two persons with knowledge of the bidding who were granted anonymity because the talks were confidential.        
	The deal also asked for an editorial plan providing a road map of the layout, they said.         
	The winner was People. The resulting package in its bestselling August 18 issue was a publicity coup for Jolie, the Oscar winner and former Hollywood eccentric who wore a necklace ornamented with dried blood and talked about her fondness for knives before transforming herself into a philanthropist, UN goodwill ambassador and devoted mother of six.         
	In the People interview, there were questions about her and Pitts charity work and no use of the word Brangelina, the tabloid amalgamation of their names, which irks the couple.        
	Through a spokeswoman, People, which is owned by Time Inc, released a statement denying that any conditions were placed on coverage. These claims are categorically false, the statement said.         
	Like any news organisation, People does purchase photos, but the magazine does not determine editorial content based on the demands of outside parties.         
	While all celebrities seek to manipulate their public images to one degree or another, Jolie accomplishes it with a determination, a self-reliance and a degree of success that is particularly notable. The actress does not employ a publicist or an agent. The keys to her public image belong to her alone, although she does rely on her longtime manager, Geyer Kosinski, as a conduit.         
	Jennifer Lopez, who sold pictures of her twins to People for an estimated $6 million in February, has a team of eight to help her navigate such situations. Jolie, 33, has her mobilee phone, a lawyer and Kosinski (and, of course, the counsel of her partner, Pitt). Shes scary smart, said Bonnie Fuller, the former editor of Us Weekly.         
	But smart only takes you so far. She also has an amazing knack, perhaps more than any other star, for knowing how to shape a public image.        
	Jolie did not respond to interview requests and neither did Kosinski. Her lawyer, Robert Offer, declined to comment. But through interviews with nearly two dozen people who have worked directly with her over the years, a picture emerges of how she skillfully works the press.         
	Jolie expertly walks a line between known entity and complete mystery, cultivates relationships with friendly reporters and even sets up her own photo shoots for the paparazzi.        
	Most skillfully, she dictates terms to celebrity magazines involving their coverage of her and her family, editors say, creating an awkward situation for publications that try to abide by strict journalistic standards.         
	Jolie showed her skill at handling the news media in other negotiations. People magazine bid successfully for photos and an exclusive interview after she gave birth to her first child in 2006. Those pictures sold for an estimated $4.1 million.        
	In a separate 2006 negotiation with People, Jolie invited magazine editors to bid on exclusive photos of her and her adopted Cambodian son, Maddox. But she made coverage of her charity work part of the deal.

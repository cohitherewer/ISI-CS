          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	New Delhi, May 30: Manmohan Singh today greeted Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with news of progress on Calcutta airports modernisation but it turned out to be more a leap than a step when a crucial central clearance for the project came later in the day.        
	The public investment board (PIB) approved the nearly Rs 2,000-crore modernisation, which means it will now only need the stamp of the cabinet. It also possibly means the project has scaled the escalating dispute between civil aviation minister Praful Patel and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.        
	The Prime Minister gave the chief minister a second reason to smile. He said progress had been made on the East-West corridor that would link the eastern and western sides of the Hooghly with an underground railway. But there was no happy coincidence for the project, as with the airport.        
	Bhattacharjee, who is in Delhi to attend the CPMs central committee meeting, also discussed the proposed deep-sea port but the Prime Ministers response was not known.        
	In light of speculation that Bengal was unable to get a date from the Prime Minister whom it wanted to inaugurate a Jindal-promoted steel plant, Bhattacharjee was asked if he had carried an invitation with him. I didnt raise this issue as the Prime Minister recently had a cataract operation, he replied.        
	The failure to get Singh for the project and the delays suffered by several Bengal plans, including the airport modernisation, had been traced to the Prime Ministers apparent unhappiness with the Left for torpedoing his nuclear agreement with the US.        
	Since the plan panel, which is headed by the Prime Minister and run by Montek Singh, and the finance ministry together anchor the PIB, it is now felt that the airport modernisation, expected to cost Rs 1942.50 crore, will not run into objections in the cabinet.         
	Montek Singh had wanted to split the project into two, with the second module kicking in only after the airport touched the point of 15 million passengers a year, from 5 million now, on the argument that demand would fall short of supply.         
	Patel had insisted on implementing the entire project at one go.         
	Calcutta airport officials were exultant. An official said: We expect to complete the work within the deadline of 2010.        
	The airport will be a steel, concrete and glass structure designed around a theme based on Tagores poetry, with the capacity to handle 20 million passengers a year.        
	The government had decided to build a world-class airport in April 2007 and we have already spent about a year since then in planning. Hopefully, we will have final bids for construction work soon after the cabinet gives its clearance next month, senior civil aviation ministry officials said.        
	The tender will be opened on June 16, though the work was initially scheduled to start from January 1, 2008.        
	Six groups  Canadian, Thai, British, Turkish, Hong Kong and Indias Larsen amp; Toubro  had been shortlisted by the Airport Authority of India (AAI) to modernise the airport.        
	Since the integrated terminal buildings capacity too will be saturated by 2015-16, AAI officials said they had devised their own modular approach that would see the integrated terminal building being built for 20 million passengers while retaining an old terminal for 5 million more.         
	The plan panel has asked the civil aviation ministry to consider refurbishing the existing international terminal and offer it for use by low-cost carriers, instead of breaking it all up.        
	After 2016, another terminal will be set up to push the capacity up to 39.32 million.

          SUJAN DUTTA                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: Defence minister A.K. Antony and foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee today defined a no-war-no-peace relationship with Pakistan that ruled out military strikes but underlined normal ties were impossible till Islamabad demonstrated its resolve to crack down on militant outfits.         
	While Antony said in Delhi India was not planning military strikes on Pakistan, Mukherjee told reporters in Srinagar peace talks with the neighbour were on pause.  
	Mukherjee also scoffed at Islamabads plea for evidence against the Mumbai attackers and added that in at least 10 instances in the past, Delhi had given information but Pakistan had not taken measures to their logical conclusion.  
	He referred to Indias demand that Pakistan hand over Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Maulana Masood Azhar, who was freed after an Indian Airlines plane was hijacked to Afghanistan in December 1999.  
	The ministers comments came a day after CNN reported that three unnamed sources in the US department of defence had said that America had information that India began to prepare air force personnel for a possible mission.  
	Antonys statement that we are not planning any military action against Pakistan will calm concerns in the US and in the West. But it is likely to stoke ire at home where the government is contending with Right-wing pressure to be more pro-active.  
	Unless Pakistan takes actions against those terrorists who are operating on their soil against India ... things will not be normal, Antony said on the sidelines of a ceremony to mark the anniversary of Indias victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war.  
	India suspects that the banning of the Jamaat-ud Dawa and the detention of its leaders were temporary measures that would not lead to a destruction of the terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan.  
	Indian officials here have noted that Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani refused to give investigators from the UK access to terrorist detainees and that he had told his British counterpart Gordon Brown as much.   
	Antony has been told by the armed forces in meetings over the past week that terrorist outfits in Pakistan-administered Kashmir have been trying to disrupt the ceasefire along the Line of Control. However, one officer said, the defence minister can scarcely be expected to announce that India was preparing for offensive action mdash; if it were mdash; and dilute it of shock value.  
	Even in December 2001, when the NDA government ordered full-scale mobilisation of the military, the announcement followed only weeks later, by which time it was impossible to conceal the movement of troops, aircraft and ships to staging posts.  
	There has been no such movement yet but Indias military doctrine has changed since 2001 and the top brass believe action is possible in much shorter time than it would have been seven years back.  
	The Indian Air Force is on an operational readiness platform, a state of passive air defence since the November 26-28 gun and grenade battles in Mumbai.  
	But the IAF spokesperson says this is a standard operating procedure after a big terrorist attack.   
	A series of visits by senior US and UK figures followed worries that the IAF was preparing to cross the border and target suspected terrorist camps.  
	Even the Pakistani press began reporting that among Indias targets were the Jamaat Ud Dawaahs headquarters at Muridke near Lahore. Agencies report that state department spokesperson Robert Wood said in Washington that the US does not want to see a situation in South Asia that will lead to escalation of conflict.

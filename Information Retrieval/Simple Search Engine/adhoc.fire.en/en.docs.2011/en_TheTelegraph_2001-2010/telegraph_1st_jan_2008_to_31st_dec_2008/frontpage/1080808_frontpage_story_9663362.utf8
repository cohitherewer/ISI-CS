  - Judge recuses after sharp exchange          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                                
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: The Supreme Courts second senior-most judge today refused to hear a graft case involving judges after a heated exchange with lawyers over allegations that the court was shielding corrupt judicial officers.        
	I am not a sanyasi that I can keep my cool, Justice B.N. Agarwal said and withdrew from the case after warning senior counsel and former law minister Shanti Bhushan not to argue like a street urchin.        
	Agarwal is the second judge after Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan to withdraw from hearing the case in which a sitting apex court judge and several high court judges are accused of siphoning off crores from the provident fund of employees of a Ghaziabad court.        
	The chief justice had recused himself after Bhushan  who along with his son Prashant is representing Transparency International, one of the parties in the case  challenged the executive instructions Balakrishnan had issued asking Ghaziabad police to submit questionnaires to the accused judges.        
	When the court reconvened today after yesterdays daylong hearing, Agarwal took offence at Bhushans argument that Balakrishnans instructions gave the impression that the court was trying to shield corrupt judicial officers.        
	These remarks are contemptuous, Agarwal thundered.        
	But Bhushan stood his ground and dared Agarwal to take action against him. He withdrew the remarks only after the judge threatened not to hear the case.        
	Sparks flew again when Bhushan Senior contended that an earlier judgment, which makes the Chief Justices nod mandatory to file an FIR or a chargesheet against a sitting judge, should not apply in this case.        
	Public confidence demands that the court order a free and impartial inquiry into the case, he argued.         
	If that protection is removed, what will happen to the independence of the judiciary? Agarwal replied. Cases will be filed against honest judges and they will be arrested and thrown in jails.        
	But Bhushan insisted that the role of the judges in the scam be probed under the general criminal law which applies to all.        
	If they are honest, nothing will come out of the probe, he said. The Supreme Court should not give the impression that it is trying to shield corrupt judicial officers, he repeated.        
	Justice Agarwal, whose integrity most lawyers vouch for, flared up at this, saying he was not a sanyasi that he wouldnt lose his cool.        
	When Bhushan retorted that all he had meant was the court was giving the impression that it was trying to put fetters on the probe, Agarwal said he was getting provoked.        
	Bhushans son Prashant then joined the fray, accusing the judge of putting words into the mouth of the senior counsel.         
	You have no respect for anybody. Not even one judge of the Supreme Court, Agarwal fumed and then passed orders saying that since it was not conducive to hear the case he was recusing himself.        
	He later waved off Bhushan juniors apologies.        
	Lawyers later said it was up to a judge to decide whether to withdraw from a case or not. But things should not have been allowed to go to this extent that a judge feels constrained to give up a matter and not go ahead with the case, constitutional expert P.P. Rao said.         
	What is happening is very unfortunate, said senior lawyer T.R. Andhyarujina. I have never seen such drama in this court before. It demeans the court.         
	Another senior lawyer, C.S. Vaidyanathan, said the lawyers should have understood the subtleties of the situation and avoided attacking the court directly.         
	After all, Justice Agarwal is well-regarded as an intellectually and financially honest judge, he said.

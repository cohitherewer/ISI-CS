          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      Sreesanth and Harbhajan in New Delhi on Monday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha		                          
	April 28: Match referee Farokh Engineer has done his bit by banning volatile Harbhajan Singh for the rest of the Indian Premier Leagues inaugural edition.         
	Now, the Super match referees  specifically the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) brass  will be getting into the act.        
	Harbhajans very public apology (telecast live in fact) for the slap on Sreesanth notwithstanding, more bad news awaits him in the near future.        
	The BCCI is, of course, following procedure before disciplining Indias most successful off-spinner, but the mood among many within is to ban him for a substantial length of time.        
	Some, according to The Telegraphs sources, are even talking of keeping Harbhajan out of all forms of cricket for as long as two years.        
	Thats probably more of an extreme view, but it wont surprise if the BCCIs disciplinary committee (headed by an angry president, Sharad Pawar) bans Harbhajan for a minimum of three months.                    
	Such punishment would mean Harbhajan having to miss the short tri-series in Bangladesh, the Asia Cup in Pakistan and the Test series in Sri Lanka.        
	Only recently, we spent sleepless nights trying to protect Harbhajan We backed him blindly during the (Andrew) Symonds controversy, but look at what hes done Well be the laughing stock if we dont act firmly, is what a key BCCI official said.         
	The BCCI has appointed one of Ahmedabads leading lawyers, Sudhir Nanavati, as commissioner to make the preliminary inquiries. Nanavati, who has been associated with cricket in Gujarat for long, has to submit his report to Pawar within 15 days. The ball will then be in the disciplinary committees court.         
	Harbhajan has also apologised in his reply to the showcause from the BCCI, but thats just not good enough.        
	Whatever the punishment handed out by the disciplinary committee, its unlikely that the intra-team wounds will heal completely.        
	Clearly, irrespective of the Harbhajan-Sreesanth handshake, the Team India dressing room wont quite be the same again and Anil Kumble (the Test captain) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (at the helm in ODIs) surely cant be the most relaxed men around.         
	Sreesanth is no saint either and was warned by the BCCI before he headed to Australia for the one-off Twenty20 International and the tri-series this year.        
	After the Harbhajan-Symonds tamasha in the Test series, which almost forced a premature end to the tour, Pawar and Co. didnt want another nightmare, this time involving Sreesanth.        
	For the record, Engineer gave Sreesanth a stern warning during this afternoons hearing in New Delhi.

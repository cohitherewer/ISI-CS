The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Techie tangled in killer wheels
                                                                                                           Techie tangled in killer wheels
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, March 15: A young software engineers legs had to be disentangled from the front wheel of a bus after it dragged her some 100 feet in Salt Lake this afternoon.        
	Debjani Sinha, who worked for an IT company in Sector V, died a few hours later at NRS Hospital, having suffered severe abdominal injuries and multiple thigh fractures.        
	Eyewitnesses said Debjani, 24, was speaking on her cellphone while she crossed the road in front of Bidyut Bhavan in Karunamoyee, but was not to blame for the accident.        
	The driver, they said, was so engrossed in racing another bus that local people had to pelt his vehicle with stones to force it to a stop. The bus, plying on route 201, had to reverse before Debjanis legs could be freed.        
	A couple passing the site hired a taxi and took the injured woman, a resident of Baranagar in north Calcutta, to hospital.        
	After the bus stopped, the passengers ran out. A mob pulled the driver and the conductor out, said Partha Banerjee, who lives in a nearby housing estate.        
	The duo were beaten up and the bus set on fire. By the time two fire tenders arrived some 10 minutes later  around 2.10pm  the bus was charred. In the confusion, the driver fled.        
	Well arrest him soon, said North 24-Parganas police chief Supratim Sarkar. He added: The woman was not to blame. The accident occurred because of rash driving.        
	The drivers of both the buses have been booked for rash driving and charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Their licences will be revoked, Sarkar promised.        
	Debjanis uncle Subrata Sinha said she had joined the company three months ago.

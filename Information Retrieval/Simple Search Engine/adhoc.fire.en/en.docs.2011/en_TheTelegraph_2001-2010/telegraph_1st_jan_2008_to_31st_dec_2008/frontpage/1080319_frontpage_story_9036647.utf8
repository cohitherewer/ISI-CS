	McLeodganj, March 18: The Dalai Lama today said he would step down as Tibets political leader if the unrest in his homeland spiralled out of control.        
	If Tibetans choose violence and things become out of control, then my only option is to completely resign, he said to reporters, confirming what his government-in-exile had told The Telegraph yesterday.        
	The statement by the Dalai Lama, who called himself semi-retired, caused a flutter and officials rushed to clarify that he would remain the spiritual leader of the Tibetans even if he gave up his role as head of state.         
	He has two responsibilities: one as spiritual leader and another as political leader. He cannot resign as spiritual leader as it is a responsibility of a lifetime, said Thubten Samphel, secretary in his governments department of information and international relations.        
	The talk of resignation came as Premier Wen Jiabao, in Chinas highest-level response, described the Dalai Lamas claim of a cultural genocide in Tibet as nothing but lies and repeated the phrase Dalai clique used earlier by officials in Beijing.        
	New Delhi has been in touch with the Dalai Lama since the protests began in the Tibetan capital Lhasa last Friday. His resignation offer is being seen as a pressure tactic as well as a message to China that has accused him of orchestrating the protests in Tibet.                  The Dalai Lama    
	Rejecting the allegation, the Dalai Lama said Chinese officials were welcome to come to Dharamsala, the seat of his government, to investigate. Investigate thoroughly Check our various offices. They can examine my pulse, my urine, my stool, everything.        
	The Dalai Lama disapproved of the march to Tibet that has been undertaken by 50-odd Tibetans, citing the embarrassment to New Delhi if they enter the homeland. It is useless to face the Chinese forces, he added.         
	Youth organisations are determined and are critical of our stand, our approach. (But when) I ask them how to get independence, they say dont know, he said, acknowledging that youths were choosing independence over greater autonomy.        
	But the youths  shouting slogans like Hindi-Chini bhai bhai hai, Chin ka yahi dhoka hai  are undeterred. Come what may, we are going to reach the end, Chime Youngdung, leader of the marching party to Tibet, said over the phone from Punjab, where they set up camp this morning.         
	Tomorrow, the Dalai Lama will speak to the youths on what he fervently believes is right for the Tibetans: meaningful autonomy.         
	Whether they listen or not, it is my moral responsibility to talk to them, he said. I say to China and the Tibetans  dont commit violence.        
	The Dalai Lama had offered to resign once earlier  in 1987-88, when similar protests had erupted.

	Mumbai, Dec. 26: Some things have changed a month after the terror attack, but most have not.         
	The metal detectors still dont work at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus; Riyaz Khan still serves customers at the station restaurant, the image of Ajmal Kasab throwing the first grenade etched in his memory; and Captain Amitendra Kumar Singh still tells reporters hell pull through.        
	What has changed is commuter Praveen Mulyes habit of stopping to chat with friends at CST before catching his train. Now he just gets out fast. And unlike before, Captain Singh has time to stop and chat with reporters.        
	The National Security Guard commando had shooed journalists away on November 27 morning when he spotted a couple of them discreetly tailing his team as he did a quick recce outside the Trident.        
	Brusque and all business, he had refused to take questions. I want to get this over with. Well pull through, he had said before walking into the hotel to battle the militants.        
	Today, just released from Bombay Hospital, with one eye lost in the rescue operation, he used almost the same words as he spoke to The Telegraph from Chennai.        
	I want this to get over. At Bombay Hospital, doctors said I would not regain my vision. I have now come to Shankar Nethralaya in Chennai for a second opinion for my familys sake. This loss does not bother me. I will pull through, he said.        
	Pulling through has almost become a catch-phrase for the 30-odd people still battling terror injuries in city hospitals. For them, unlike the rest of Mumbai, its less about moving on, explained the Bombay Hospital spokesperson.        
	Its about pulling through, Dr Ashish Tiwary said.        
	Jharna Narang, 32, has been comatose and attached to a ventilator for a month. She lost her entire family in the Taj while celebrating her brothers birthday.        
	Jharna will pull through she is a fighter, Dr Tiwary said.        
	Like Railway Protection Force jawan Jhullu Yadav. Yadav, caught without a gun at CST, had grabbed the jammed.303 rifle of a Government Railway Police constable and tried to fire when most policemen just ran away.        
	If he was lucky to survive, waiter Riyaz saved himself by diving behind the chairs and tables in the first-floor food plaza, from where he got perhaps the clearest view of the attack.        
	He watched Kasab walk calmly into the large courtyard, teeming with passengers, and hurl a grenade at a family waiting to board a long-distance train.        
	I think it was a Bengali family from Nalasopara who were to catch the Geetanjali, said Riyaz, 29, pointing at the exact spot.        
	He recalled that Kasab changed the magazine of his Kalashnikov three times. Fifty-six died and 95 were injured at CST.        
	Kasab and his partner faced no resistance the first 15 minutes. Only when they mowed down everyone in sight and moved into the suburban section that police began countering them, Riyaz said.        
	That would have been Jhullu Yadav and a few of his colleagues. Yadav today alleged his seniors want a cut from his Rs 10-lakh railway award for bravery  suggesting some things even a 26/11 cannot change.        
	For instance, most passengers were walking through the wide spaces left between the eight metal detectors at the terminus today. Even when the detector beeped, the police looked uninterested in frisking anyone who was dressed well.        
	Nothing has changed, feel aggrieved staff of the state-run JJ Hospital, 27 of whose 294 patients  mostly orthopaedic cases -- are yet to go home. The nurses and the ward attendants are bitter that the government overlooked them while felicitating city hospitals for their work during the crisis.        
	They mainly felicitated the doctors but it was us who worked the hardest. Its demoralising, said Shalini Apte, a trainee nurse who says she worked 52 hours without a break.        
	The state government, fearing a backlash from the politically crucial hospital unions, has decided to hold a separate felicitation for Class III and IV staff.        
	CST sweeper Sushila Pyarelal wants nothing for the extra work she had to do. She worked all night to wash the blood. And she needed seven to eight gunny bags just for the shoes and slippers.

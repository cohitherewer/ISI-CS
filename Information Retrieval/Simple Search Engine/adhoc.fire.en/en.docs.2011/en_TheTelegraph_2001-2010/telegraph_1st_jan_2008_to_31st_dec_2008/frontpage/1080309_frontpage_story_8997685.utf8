  - 14-yr-old leads band to carve shortcut through forests          GAUTAM SARKAR                            Two children on the new road. Picture by Mani Keshri                                        
	Amrapara (Pakur), March 8: Kamlesh was tired of walking 14 km everyday to his Morio Middle School. So, as the eldest among a group of seven friends, he took the initiative and decided to build their own road  a 1.5km shortcut through dense, hilly forests.         
	Today, elders have joined Kamlesh and his band of young workers on the home stretch of their dream road, something they managed to pull off without the help of the local administration.         
	The local BDO chose to ignore the boys efforts throughout their months-long effort. But now, the Pakur deputy commissioner has recognised their feat and has organised a visit of his officials to the area to include the road in the official map of the district.         
	It was a nightmare to reach our schools through dense forests everyday. We had to do something, says the 14-year-old with pride.         
	People of Morio, a sleepy Paharia hamlet under the Singershi Panchyat at Amrapara nearly 58km from Pakur district headquarters, are thrilled at Kamleshs efforts. There are 18 to 20 similar hamlets nearby and people helped out in various ways.         
	But the bulk of the work was shouldered by seven youngsters all between 7 and 14  Jama Paharia, Jabra Paharia, Bamra Paharia, Kalu Paharia, Bodhra Paharia, Jarba Paharia and Kamlesh.        
	We did not have equipment, so the work took more time. It was really tough on the young ones, says one of them pointing to another, who looks as young as the rest.         
	There have been pitfalls too. A huge boulder slipped when we tried to push it out of our way and he was hurt, adds Kamlesh, pointing to eight-year-old Naresh Paharia. But, he did not stop working.        
	While Kamlesh and his friends dont want to talk about it, village elders are disappointed none of the local officials and political leaders  including Littipara JMM MLA Sushila Hansdak and Rajmahal MP Hemlal Murmu  offered help in this mission.         
	Under NREGA roads were constructed in nearby villages like Kashkura or Baghapara but no one was interested to do anything for our locality, alleges Shankar Paharia, a local resident.        
	Local BDO Jaikishor Prasad was unaware of the boys achievement at Morio, barely 18km from his office. If the boys have taken the responsibility, it is very praiseworthy, he said in a condescending tone.         
	But officers at the nearby Singarshi Air Force station were wholehearted in their appreciation. The boys have led by example. We were thrilled to see their passion for helping the community, commented an IAF officer.

He won the gold medal in men's 10-meter air rifle event after earning a total of 700.5 points.

  He scored a series of 100,99,100,98,100 and 99 in the qualifiers.

In the Air rifle event at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, Manchester, he won gold in the Pairs event and silver in the individual event. At the 2004 Olympic Games, he broke the Olympic record but failed to win a medal.   He is a recipient of the Arjuna award in 2001 and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award for the year 2001-2002.

          REBECCA SMITH                            A customer sleeps in a sleeping capsule in Hong Kong. (AFP)                                  
	London, Dec. 29: Insomnia has been linked to feelings of paranoia  just as Shakespeare depicted in the play Macbeth  scientists have found.         
	Insomnia has been linked to paranoid delusions after researchers in the UK questioned people with a history of mental health problems and compared the results to answers from healthy volunteers.        
	Experts found that 70 per cent of ordinary people who scored highly for self-reported symptoms of paranoia had difficulty sleeping.        
	On the flip-side more than half of the psychiatric patients, who all experienced feelings of persecution, suffered from moderate to severe insomnia.        
	Experts said the results show that good quality sleep is vital for our mental health as well as physical health.        
	Shakespeare linked insomnia and paranoia in the play Macbeth in which the lead character is unable to sleep after committing the famous murder of Duncan, King of Scotland.        
	Sleeping problems have already been linked to heart disease and shift workers are known to be at higher risk of certain cancers.        
	Daniel Freeman, from the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College London, who led the research, said: As most of us know, a few nights of poor sleep can make us feel stressed, muddled in our thinking, and disconnected from the world.        
	These are ideal conditions for paranoid fears to take hold. Regular, good quality sleep is important to our psychological well-being.        
	Insomnia is known to cause stress, anxiety and depression, which are themselves associated with paranoid thoughts.        
	Freemans team looked for evidence that lack of sleep contributes to persecutory ideation  fantasies of being victimised and picked on.        
	A total of 300 healthy people and 30 psychiatric patients completed questionnaires designed to highlight symptoms of insomnia and paranoia.        
	Although the study was small the scientists wrote in the journal Schizophrenia Research: The results were clear: higher levels of insomnia were associated with higher levels of persecutory thinking.        
	Freeman said the research, funded by the Wellcome Trust, suggested that tackling an inability to sleep could reduce the risk of paranoia.        
	The good news is that there are several, tried-and-tested ways to overcome insomnia, he said.        
	In particular, cognitive behaviour therapy has proven benefits. The intriguing implication of the research is that use of the sleep techniques may also make us feel safer and less mistrustful during the day.         
	A good nights sleep may simply make us view the world in a much more positive light.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

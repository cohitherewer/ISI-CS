  - New faces make their presence felt at rich mans club         K.P. NAYAR                             Manmohan Singh (third from top left), Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, George W Bush and Hu Jintao (second, third and fourth from bottom left) at the summit. (AP)                                        
	Washington, Nov. 16: The stirrings of a change in global equations were in evidence in the White House State Dining Room on Friday, a day before leaders from 20 countries began a summit here on the financial crisis.        
	In addition to the usual white faces plus a Japanese that have traditionally gathered around the table to discuss global economics or world politics, there was a turbaned Sikh at one head of the table, a black leader from Africa two seats away from him and a shoeshine boy from Sao Paulo with no formal education who rose to become the most popular statesman in Latin America in this decade.        
	Their presence at a summit initiated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and hosted by US President George W. Bush has changed the composition of what has traditionally been called the rich mans club in international economic diplomacy.        
	A shadow over the summit was the worry that the presence of new entrants into this hitherto exclusive club could mean loss of power, influence and relevance for some of those seated at the White House dinner.        
	A new confidence sweeping over countries like India, Brazil and South Africa when they stand up at summits such as this one prompted Montek Singh Ahuwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, to point fingers at a media conference in the direction of the old rich mans club.        
	The current crisis is unique in one respect that it did not originate in developing countries. It started in the US and then spread to Europe, but the worst affected would be the developing countries. They would not only be hit by recession directly, but because of recessionary trends in advanced countries, the capital flow too would get restricted, Ahluwalia said.        
	At his media conference that would have drawn only Indian reporters a decade ago, there were French, British and Japanese correspondents, among others. It was a reflection of a changing world.        
	If Ahluwalias statements  and that of finance minister P. Chidambaram  reflected a swagger among what are called emerging economies, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the shoe-shine boy who rose to be Brazils President, went further.        
	He asked if the Group of Eight (G8) rich countries can any longer offer solutions to crises such as the present one. We must use the crisis as an opportunity to correct things that were wrong before the crisis and strengthen multilateral bodies, because in a globalised world we need serious and representative forums to take global decisions, Lula said here.        
	To the left of Bush at last nights dinner, wearing the occasional grin of a Cheshire Cat was Chinas President Hu Jintao, to whom the Americans are especially looking to for some solutions to the current crisis.        
	It was a reflection of the challenge before the summit that Bush chose to speak about Fridays dinner than anything substantive in remarks on Saturday morning as leaders began arriving for the formal meeting.        
	We had a good dinner last night, Bush said. Indeed, it was, with fruitwood-smoked quail, thyme-roasted rack of lamb and baked Vermont brie with walnut crostini, along with three wines. The financial crisis did not intrude into the menu.

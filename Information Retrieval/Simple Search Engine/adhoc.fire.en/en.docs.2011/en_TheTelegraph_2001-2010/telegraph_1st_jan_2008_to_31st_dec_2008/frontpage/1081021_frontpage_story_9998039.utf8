          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: Information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi was today shifted to Apollo Hospital here from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences where he had been revived after a massive heart attack last week.        
	Das Munshi, who was moved to the private hospital in an ambulance around 11 this morning, is very critical and continues to be on life support, Apollo Hospital said in a statement this evening.         
	He is on a ventilator and under the care of a multi-disciplinary team of doctors, hospital officials said.         
	Doctors at the AIIMS said he was shifted to Apollo on the request of the family. Das Munshi has been admitted to AIIMS last week after a heart attack and failure of the main pumping chamber of the heart.         
	AIIMS medical superintendent D.K. Sharma said the minister had been revived after he was brought to the institute, but the heart attack might have affected blood flow to the brain.        
	His cardiac status is fine, but his neurological status is being observed, evaluated and monitored by doctors here, Sharma said.         
	A cardiac arrest has the potential to affect blood supply to the brain. The absence of blood supply for a considerable period of time could cause damage to the brain, doctors said.

          ARUN KUMAR THAKUR                            Students of a CCL-run school in Giridih display their science skills.   The coal company now wants to start a college                                        
	Ranchi, May 17: Construction work for an engineering college of the Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) will start next month.        
	CCLs director (personnel) said the college was the most visible symbol of corporate social responsibility.        
	Almost along with the laying of the foundation stone, the construction work too would start on the plot adjacent to Gandhinagar Colony of CCL, said T.K. Chand, the director (personnel) of CCL.        
	We have got a 22-acre plot next to Gandhinagar and we have estimated that about Rs 35 crore would be spent on the construction work and preparing other infrastructure support for the engineering college, he added.        
	The CCL board of directors accepted the proposal and a few days ago, the board also put its stamp of approval after taking a look at the financial requirements, Chand said.        
	Besides offering courses in core engineering subjects  such as mechanical, civil and electrical  this college will offer course in mining engineering, too.        
	As CCL is basically a mining company, graduates in mining will be favourably placed to find a job in Coal India Limited (CIL) and its subsidiaries.        
	CILs subsidiaries include Bharat Coking Coal, Central Coalfields, Western Coalfields, Eastern Coalfields, Mahanadi Coalfields and Central Mine Planning and Design Institute Limited, among others.         
	Chand said: We could have started the engineering college in a makeshift building but keeping our objectives and our commitment in mind, the management decided to first complete the construction work for a full-fledged engineering college.        
	He expects the first batch of students to be admitted by June 2009.        
	Under its community development projects, CCL is already providing education to about 40,000 students through its 68 schools.

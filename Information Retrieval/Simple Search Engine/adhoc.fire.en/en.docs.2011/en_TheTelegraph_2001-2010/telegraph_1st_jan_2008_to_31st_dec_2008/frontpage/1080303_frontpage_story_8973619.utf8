The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Poll test for voters and veterans
                                                                                                           Poll test for voters and veterans
          E.M. JOSE AND UMANAND JAISWAL                              
	Shillong/Tura, March 2: Meghalaya will take a call tomorrow on whether it needs to go back to single-party rule after five years under a Congress-led coalition that redefined loyalty to leadership by changing its chief minister midway, only to oust the successor a few months later and go back to the original one.        
	This election will also make or break the careers of several veterans, including the small big man from the Garo heartland, Purno Agitok Sangma.         
	Like the Congress and the United Democratic Party, Sangmas Nationalist Congress Party has urged the 12.32-lakh electorate in 59 Assembly constituencies  polling in one constituency has been countermanded because of a candidates death  to vote one party to power. But that could be asking for too much in a state where political affiliations are as fickle as the weather in the beautiful capital city of Shillong.        
	Sangmas confidence stems from the fact that he has never lost an election, being elected MLA once and MP nine times from Tura. He hopes to retain his hold on the Garo Hills, which has 24 seats, and make a dent in the Congress and other parties strongholds in the Khasi and Jaintia hills.         
	The former Lok Sabha Speaker has projected himself as the next chief minister and even fielded both his sons on popular demand.         
	Knowing the damage he can do to its plans, the Congress has gone all out to portray Sangma as a disloyal man  he left the party to protest Sonia Gandhi being projected as a future Prime Minister  and is concerned only about his own survival.        
	The other veterans who could consolidate their positions or fade away after the polls are chief minister D.D. Lapang and his deputy Mukul Sangma, a doctor who found his calling in political. For Mukul, upstaging the senior Sangma in the Garo Hills is the toughest challenge.         
	Former chief minister Salseng C. Marak is trying to make a comeback, as are two others who have left the Congress to join the UDP  E.K. Mawlong and J.D. Rymbai.         
	Mawlong is confident of coming back stronger since the Calcutta Meghalaya House deal that led to his ouster no longer hangs like an albatross around his neck. He has been absolved in court of corruption charges vis--vis that deal. On the other hand, Rymbai is out to prove that there is life outside the Congress, having suffered the humiliation of being ousted by the very man he had replaced as chief minister. The image of a man of integrity is his USP.        
	With the Congress, NCP and the UDP deciding to go it alone, the 73 Independents in the fray could be the main players in the post-election scenario.         
	The other parties  Meghalaya Democratic Party, Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement and the Hill State Peoples Democratic Party  are likely to support any ruling combination. The BJP is regarded untouchable only by the Congress and vice-versa.        
	The voters wishlist is what it was in the last elections  deliverance from poor road connectivity, unemployment, insurgency and the electricity crisis.

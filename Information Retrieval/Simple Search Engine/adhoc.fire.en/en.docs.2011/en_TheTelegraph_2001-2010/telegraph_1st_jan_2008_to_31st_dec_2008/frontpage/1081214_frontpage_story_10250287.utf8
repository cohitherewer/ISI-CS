   Police flash Ajmal letter
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Ajmal: Cry for help                                        
	Mumbai, Dec. 13: Captured terrorist Mohammed Ajmal Amir Iman Kasab has written to the Pakistan high commission in Delhi stating he is a Pakistani national and the mission should arrange legal aid for him, police said today.         
	Pakistan so far has refused to acknowledge that any of the 10 terrorists who attacked Mumbai was a citizen of the country.         
	Joint commissioner (crime) Rakesh Maria, who is spearheading the investigations, flashed Ajmals three-page letter, written in Urdu and dated December 11, at a news conference this evening.         
	He said the letter had been forwarded to the ministry of external affairs to be passed on to the Pakistan high commissioner.         
	Indian foreign ministry sources said they had received no such letter till now and denied that consular access had been sought.        
	Police said Ajmal had written he was a Pakistani national and a Lashkar-e-Toiba operative, and admitted his role in the November 26 attacks. He also described his training at Lashkar camps and how he carried out the strike.         
	Ajmal has named Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed and Lashkar trainers Abu Hamza and Kahfa in the letter.        
	The letter requests the Pakistan high commission to provide him legal assistance in India.         
	Mumbai lawyers had refused to defend Ajmal when his police custody was extended on December 11, the day he wrote the letter. Dinesh Mota, a lawyer summoned by the Maharashtra Legal Aid Committee to represent Ajmal, had refused to take up the case on moral grounds.        
	Ajmal has said that Ismail Khan, his module partner, was also a Pakistani citizen and hence Pakistan should claim his body and cremate him.         
	The crime branch has written a separate letter to the Union home and foreign ministries asking them to take up with Pakistan the issue of cremation of the nine slain gunmen. The bodies are at the JJ Hospital morgue.         
	RDX use        
	A report from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Kalina, has confirmed that the bomb which exploded in a taxi at Vile Parle on November 26 night contained a mix of RDX and petroleum oil.         
	This mix is similar to the ones used in the serial explosions of 1993, said Maria.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Guwahati, June 23: The Centre today extended its suspension of operation agreement with the Dima Halam Daogah (Nunisa) for another six months while Dispur continued to wonder if it should respond to the peace overtures of the Jewel faction.        
	Militants of the Jewel Gorlosa faction declared a three-month unilateral ceasefire from March 25, but picked up the gun again in May in retaliation to the alleged killing of a dozen of its members by the army, disrupting development projects in the NC Hills.         
	The Centre, however, today extracted an assurance from the Dilip Nunisa group that it would not put roadblocks in development projects.        
	The suspension of operations pact with the Nunisa faction was due to expire on June 30 and has now been extended till December 31.        
	The outfits chairman, Dilip Nunisa, too, felt that the Jewel Gorlosa faction, also called the Black Widow, is the disturbing factor. It is the Black Widow which is disturbing development. They have said they killed 118 people and injured 75, Nunisa said after the talks with central and state government officials.        
	A seven-member delegation of the outfit attended todays meeting held with the joint secretary (Northeast) of the ministry of home affairs, Naveen Verma, and Assams inspector-general of police Khagen Sarma.        
	The truce with the Nunisa group raised speculations if it would now help the Centre fight the rival DHD (J) faction.        
	The Jewel problem is a law and order one; it is the government which has to take action. I dont want to say much about this anti-India outfit, Nunisa said.        
	Earlier this year, Nunisa had called on home minister Shivraj Patil and asked the government to expedite the peace process with the Dimasa outfit and find a solution.         
	Though the government is not in favour of carving out one more state from Assam  the outfit has been demanding a separate state for the Dimasas called the Dimaraji  it urgently needs to bring peace to the North Cachar Hills.        
	Nunisa did not comment on the possibility of talks with the United Peoples Democratic Solidarity (UPDS) on bringing back peace and stability in the Karbi Anglong and North Cachar Hills districts.         
	There has been speculation that with ethnic reconciliation between the Karbi and Dimasa communities, there is a possibility of co-operation between the two outfits.        
	Dispur, on its part, has asked the security forces to keep an eye on the Jewel faction while it takes a decision on its peace overture.         
	A high-level review meeting was held at Dispur this morning to take stock of the situation in the district vis--vis the two national projects and the plying of goods and passenger trains.         
	The meeting assumes significance because it comes on the eve of the expiry of the ceasefire and chief minister Tarun Gogois proposed visit to Delhi to attend a meeting convened by the Prime Minister, the first of its kind, on the progress of the development projects on July 1.         
	CMO sources said the meeting expressed satisfaction with the overall situation in the district. If peace prevailed, there could be some positive developments round the corner vis--vis the ceasefire provided the DHD (J) did not indulge in adventurism.        
	The DHD (J) also suffered a big jolt when one of its top leaders Paiprang Dimasa was arrested recently. Paiprang is the third in command in the outfit.

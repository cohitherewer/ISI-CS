          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai/New Delhi, Nov. 3: American Express spoke of sacking employees in its Indian operations on a day the Prime Minister asked industry leaders to avoid knee-jerk reactions like large-scale lay-offs in fighting the economic slowdown.        
	American Express, known in India for its credit card and travel-related services, had said last week it would cut 7,000 jobs worldwide, about a 10th of its workforce.         
	In India, the number is less than a hundred, PTI quoted Vibha Bajaj, American Express Indias public affairs and communications director, as saying late tonight.        
	Earlier, a spokesperson had confirmed the India-related decision, adding that the number was well below 200.        
	I cannot give you a specific number, the spokesperson said. The reductions primarily focus on management and other positions that do not interact directly with customers.        
	At a meeting with industry leaders in Delhi, Manmohan Singh said: While every effort needs to be made to cut costs and raise productivity, I hope there will be no knee-jerk reaction such as large-scale lay-offs which may lead to a negative spiral.        
	He told the audience, which included Mukesh Ambani, Sunil Mittal and Infosys co-chairman Nandan Nilekani: Industry must bear in mind its societal obligations in coping with the effects of this global crisis.        
	Last week, industry chamber Assocham had warned of up to 25 per cent job cuts in sectors such as steel and textiles. But officials of rival industry chamber Ficci and the Confederation of Indian Industry said jobs were unlikely to be shed and that industry leaders had privately assured Singh of this.        
	Jet Airways had to roll back a bid to cut staff last month after protests by unions and politicians.         
	Singh today announced a high-level group of ministers that would meet daily to review the economy, signalling a more proactive approach in running the real economy, a job he had left to aides such as finance minister P. Chidambaram and plan panel deputy chief Montek Singh Ahluwalia. Both of them, and commerce minister Kamal Nath, will be in the group.        
	Singh said the global economic crisis was now likely to be more severe and prolonged but added: Our banking system, both in the public and private sectors, is safe and the government stands behind it and no one should fear for the safety of bank deposits.        
	A meeting between Chidambaram and state-run bank chiefs tomorrow is expected to signal a rate cut  by half a per cent to one per cent  by several banks.

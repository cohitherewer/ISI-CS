          BISWAJIT ROY AND INDRANIL GHOSH                            Jyoti Basu                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 9: An ailing Jyoti Basus bedside has offered the CPM an unlikely venue to request Mamata Banerjee to take a reasonable stand on the Singur controversy.        
	The patriarch also reportedly requested the Trinamul leader to sort out the problems amicably when she called on the ailing leader in the intensive care unit of a city hospital.        
	After the interaction, a CPM leader said: We got the impression that she would not stick to her claim of 300 acres. She, too, knows very well that it would be difficult to convince the Tatas to give up a substantial part of the land meant for ancillary units. We hope that the hiccups will be cleared by this week.        
	A Trinamul leader said: She also told Jyotibabu that he is not to worry, things would be sorted out soon. The Trinamul source refused to say whether Mamata was referring to Basus health or the Singur impasse.        
	In view of the informal contact with the Mamata camp, the CPM postponed a meeting of the Left Front, slated for this evening, sources said.         
	Mamata wished Basu a speedy recovery and presented him a bouquet of flowers. Opposition leader Partha Chatterjee, who signed the Sunday Singur agreement on behalf of Trinamul, accompanied her.        
	I pray for your recovery. Get well soon. The countrys politics still needs you, Chatterjee quoted Mamata as telling Basu. He said Basu and Mamata spoke to each other for a few minutes but declined to divulge what transpired.         
	CPM sources said the patriarch thanked her for calling on him and also for talking to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Singur. Both of you should be in contact to solve the land issue and ensure that the Tata project stays in Bengal, a CPM leader quoted Basu as saying.        
	Amra 67-68-e esab korechi. Ekhon apnara korchen (We have done these things in 1967-68, today you are doing this), Basu reminded Mamata, apparently referring to the militant peasant movement.        
	But, as in the dispute over the word maximum in the Singur agreement, Trinamul had a different version. Amra to 68 theke chalacchi. Ekhon tomra koro (We are running the government from 1968. Now it is your turn). This is how a Trinamul leader quoted Basu, referring to the United Front government.        
	My days are coming to an end, Basu told Mamata with a smile. Now its the turn of younger people like you.         
	Moved, Mamata told Basu: Please dont say things that make us sad.        
	She re-arranged the pillows, helping the veteran to recline against them. Why is it that you do not allow an attendant in your room, why do you go to the bathroom on your own? Mamata said, drawing another smile from Basu.         
	Mamata sought Basus permission to bring in a few more visitors. Basu nodded and smiled again when he saw Samir Putatunda, who was once with the CPM and now a Trinamul ally, and his wife trooping in. Why, they were all with us till sometime back, then went away one day, Basu said.        
	He also greeted Purnendu Bose, a Naxalite member of the Save Farmland Committee. Oh, you too, Basu said.

	New Delhi, Sept. 29: From communist cadre to nuclear cadre.        
	Jadavpur University, the alma mater of many a communist, will be among the early birds to make use of the nuclear deal being midwifed by George W. Bush and Manmohan Singh and opposed by Prakash Karat.        
	The department of atomic energy has tied up with Jadavpur University to start a two-year postgraduate course aimed at building a cadre of nuclear engineers.        
	The students are expected to help meet Indias growing demand for experts in building and maintaining nuclear plants that is set to bloat further. The country is standing on the threshold of signing deals aimed at expanding nuclear energy generation.         
	The tie-up follows a growing demand from the Nuclear Power Corporation, the only company in India that builds and operates nuclear plants, for nuclear engineers, government and university officials said.         
	Jadavpur Universitys handshake with the atomic energy department is merely the tip of the iceberg, said a government official who added that courses in nuclear engineering could be started in a number of other institutes across the country.        
	The Bengal varsity will start its course next year and will begin the programme for an elite batch of 10 shortlisted students, vice-chancellor Pradip Narayan Ghosh said.         
	There is already a gap between demand for and supply of nuclear engineers in India. That gap is set to widen further with the Indo-US nuclear deal and similar pacts with other countries unless we move now, Ghosh said.         
	Nilotpal Basu, one of the CPMs television faces that fought the battle of soundbites against the nuclear deal, is an alumnus of the university. The CPM holds sway over the university establishment but its student wing has been unable to replicate the stranglehold on the campus.         
	The deal, which will allow India to buy nuclear reactors and fuel, has been cleared by the US House of Representatives and is pending in the Senate. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, now in France, may sign a civilian nuclear agreement with that country.        
	The pacts, however, threaten to expose Indias traditional neglect of nuclear engineering as a stream at its engineering colleges, government sources conceded.         
	Apart from Jadavpur University, only the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur has a nuclear engineering and technology department. The IIT Kanpur department was started in the seventies following the Pokhran tests.        
	Only recently has the atomic energy department made demands for nuclear engineering as a stream at our premier engineering schools. For decades, we have never had such a course as most of our reactors were imported. The few engineers who studied abroad and came back were sufficient for our programme, quot; a senior Planning Commission official said.         
	The deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, had last week projected that India could generate up to 600,000 MW of nuclear power by 2050 by vigorously pursuing the nuclear energy programme.        
	The growing demand for nuclear engineering and technology has now moved IIT Madras to consider launching a course along the lines of IIT Kanpur, sources said. They, however, clarified that no timetable for the course launch had been finalised.         
	Delhi University this year started an MSc course in nuclear science -- not in engineering. There is likely to be a spike in jobs for nuclear engineers. It is going to be a profession in high demand. Returns for the companies will be high, and the jobs too are likely to be lucrative, an IIT Kanpur official said.         
	Indian private companies likely to enter into the nuclear technology market after proposed amendments to the countrys atomic energy law, will also need nuclear engineers, Ghosh said.

	Dec. 7: A SIM card suspect arrested by Calcutta police could be a counter-insurgency policeman from Kashmir on an undercover mission, according to highly placed sources.        
	If the claim is established, it will mean the law enforcement network unwittingly helped the Mumbai attackers procure communication cards. It will also blow the cover of an undercover operative, which puts his life and that of his family at risk.        
	Calcutta police, unaware that the suspect could be associated with counter-insurgency, though he screamed I too am a police constable at the time of his arrest in Delhi, had publicly announced his name yesterday. The Telegraph is mentioning his name as it is already in the public domain.        
	Mukhtar Ahmed was arrested after a SIM card found on a slain terrorist in Mumbai was traced to him, according to Calcutta police, which are still to verify whether he is a policeman.        
	The sources said senior police officers in Kashmir have demanded Mukhtars release, saying he was one of their own and had infiltrated the Lashkar-e-Toiba. However, Calcutta police said they had not heard from Kashmir.        
	The arrests of Mukhtar, 37, and Tausif Rehman, the Calcutta youth who allegedly bought 22 SIM cards for him, were the first after the Mumbai attacks.         
	Several days back, my son told me he is going to Jammu. This morning, I received a call from him and he said he is fine and would be home in a day or two, Mukhtars father said in Srinagar today.         
	The father, a shopkeeper, said his son was in the police and was working with a senior officer. After reports that Mukhtar was arrested, I approached (the officer) and he told me my son is perfectly all right, he added.         
	The officer, however, told The Telegraph in Srinagar: I know nothing about him. There were thousands of policemen working under me (in his last posting).         
	Kashmir police are not commenting on the arrest officially. I have not been informed about the issue. How can I order an investigation when I have no information? state police chief B. Srinivasan said.         
	But police sources said Mukhtar was on an undercover mission and had successfully penetrated the Lashkar. He was recruited some years ago after his brother Aijaz was killed by militants, and had been promoted as constable.        
	Such undercover operations have helped crush the Hizb-ul Mujahideen and fight the Lashkar and the Jaish-e-Mohammed, a source said.        
	Lashkar men had sought his help for procuring some SIMs, for which he had approached Tausif Rehman in Bengal, a source said. The central agencies were informed about these SIMs and they were told to monitor them.        
	One of those SIMs was found in the belt of slain terrorist Abu Ismail in Mumbai.         
	The sources said one phone connection was first activated on October 9 briefly, probably for testing. Thereafter, signals from the SIM were picked up on November 26  the night of the Mumbai attacks, the sources added.         
	A senior police officer said: Sometimes we use our men in counter-insurgency operations to provide SIM cards to (militant) outfits so that we track their plans down.        
	Another source in Delhi said Calcutta police had gone by an alert from Mumbai and the eastern force would not have had any information on the counter-insurgency operation in Kashmir. In intelligence operations, the left hand need not always know what the right hand is doing.        
	However, the source added, Calcutta police should have verified Ahmeds claim thoroughly as soon as he cried out that he was a constable. The reported site of the arrest in Delhi, the J amp;K House, should also have alerted the police to the possibility of a government link.        
	Calcutta special task force officer Rajeev Kumar said: We inquired about it and there was no confirmation. We will request our counterparts in Jammu and Kashmir to inform us in writing about Mukhtars background.        
	He underscored that terror charges had not been pressed against Mukhtar. We booked him under the particular charges applicable for the crimes that he committed in Calcutta. Whether he had any role in the terror attack in Mumbai is for our counterparts in Mumbai to find out, Kumar added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lid off hijack plot
                                                                                                           Lid off hijack plot
  - Deccan staffer arrested   for helping Ulfa         A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, Feb. 11: An Air Deccan staffer was arrested today for allegedly helping the banned Ulfa hatch a hijack plan and a rights activist who mediated with Delhi for peace talks detained on charges of doubling as an adviser to militants on subversive missions.         
	Police said customer care executive Sumanta Dutta, in his twenties, was arrested on the basis of statements made by an Ulfa militant arrested on Saturday. The arrested rebel, Manoj Tamuli, told interrogators that he accompanied Dutta and another Ulfa member, Akash Thapa, to New Delhi in November for a meeting with militant leader Sashadhar Choudhury.        
	The Air Deccan staffer allegedly obliged Choudhury with security-sensitive information about Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport and flights taking off from there, the police said.        
	Air Deccans duty manager at the city airport said the airline had heard of Duttas arrest, but knew little else.         
	On whether that meant Duttas credentials were not verified before he was appointed, the duty manager said the ground handling agent for Air Deccan was responsible for all appointments at the airport and that a thorough police verification of the candidate was mandatory to get a gate pass from the Airports Authority of India.        
	The crackdown on Ulfas network of civilian helpers continued with the detention of Lachit Bordoloi, a member of the team that was handpicked by the outfit to mediate with Delhi.         
	Bordoloi was returning to Guwahati from Upper Assam in a luxury Volvo bus when a police team detained him at Moran, in Dibrugarh district, around 11am. The detention was on the request of Guwahati police, who had raided the Peoples Consultative Group members residence in the city yesterday and seized some items.         
	Tamuli named Bordoloi as one of his advisers.         
	Guwahati lawyer Nekibur Zaman, who represents Ulfa members in court cases, is under the scanner too. His mobile phone was seized yesterday and he is under police watch.        
	A senior police official said there could be more arrests and detentions on the basis of Tamulis confessions.         
	 The Manab Adhikar Sangram Samity, of which Bordoloi is the chief adviser, gave the police 24 hours to release him without conditions or face statewide protests on February 13. The outfit said the state government was actually trying to derail attempts to revive Delhis peace process with Ulfa.         
	Writer Mamoni Raisom Goswami, who is credited with starting the peace process, was shocked at Bordolois detention. Do you think he could be involved in such activities? she asked.         
	The Peoples Consultative Group, too, backed Bordoloi. The people of Assam know what is happening. Bordolois detention reflects the fascist nature of the government.The government seems to be opposed to the peace move. The government will be responsible for any untoward situation, the groups spokesman, Arup Borbora, said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Kokrajhar, April 1: With a high school principal being shot dead near Kokrajhar this evening, former Absu president and Rajya Sabha MP from Kokrajhar, U.G. Brahma, today sought Governor Lt Gen. (retd) Ajai Singhs intervention to bring the situation under control.        
	The governor should take charge of the Bodoland Territorial Council area to maintain the law and order and check the ongoing fratricidal killings, Brahma said.        
	Two gunmen shot dead the principal of Patgaon Jwngma Boro Foraisali High School and director of Kokrajhar-based television channel, Bodosa Narzary, at Titaguri Bhabhanipur, 4km from Kokrajhar.         
	Narzary, a former BLT member, was on his way home in Kokrajhar when two men on a motorbike shot him dead around 4pm.         
	Brahma demanded that the army and paramilitary forces be deployed in the council areas to bring the situation under control.        
	The former student leader also accused the state government of doing little to stop clashes between the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) and the now disbanded Bodo Liberation Tigers.         
	Dispur is aware of the gravity of the situation, but it is not taking any action because of political reasons. What is happening in Bodoland is a shame for democracy, he said.        
	Narzary was involved in various development projects in Patgaon.                          
	 He started a Bodo-medium residential school and a television channel, which broadcasts local news in Bodo, Assamese and Bengali. Various social organisations, including Absu and Bodo Sahitya Sabha, have condemned the incident.

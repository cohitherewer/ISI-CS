The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | daddy calls jet set back   Swearing by mom, Goyal reinstates all 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   DADDY CALLS JET SET BACK     -  Swearing by mom, Goyal reinstates all 
          OUR BUREAU                            A Jet Airways employee demonstrates outside Delhi airport before Goyal announced the reinstatement. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                        
	Mumbai, Oct. 16: Jet Airways will reinstate all sacked employees, chairman Naresh Goyal declared close to midnight on Thursday.        
	Speculation on the trigger behind the stunning somersault swung between whether Jet had succumbed to political threats to ground flights or the suspected pressure tactic for a bailout had paid off.        
	I swear by my mother that I wasnt aware of the sacking decision, Goyal said at one of the most dramatic media conferences in recent times.        
	I cannot see tears in their (the employees) eyes. It is not under political pressure and I have not met anybody. It is my personal decision as the father of the family, he added. I apologise (to the employees) for what they have gone through... the management may have taken a decision but I want to go beyond the management.        
	The 1,900 dismissed employees, who have been running to potential saviours as disparate as Raj Thackeray, Citu and the Delhi chief minister, can rejoin work tomorrow.        
	Goyal, who was in Hyderabad, had a two-hour meeting with civil aviation minister Praful Patel, sources said. Patel, the sources said, tried to impress upon Goyal that he was under pressure from his party, the NCP, to ensure that the dismissals did not become a political issue in the run-up to the elections. The issue has already been seized by Raj as many of the employees are Maharashtrians.        
	Aides to Raj, the leader of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, met Jet officials and threatened to stop the airlines operations out of Mumbai unless the company took back the employees, MNS sources said, rushing to claim victory.        
	When the Jet officials said it was impossible, the MNS leadership suggested that the staff be reinstated with a 15 to 20 per cent salary cut. The Jet officials agreed to this, the sources claimed.        
	Our people met Jets HR officials in Mumbai today and asked them to accommodate the retrenched employees with a salary cut to which they responded positively, Shirish Parkar, the MNS spokesperson, said. The salary cut may also be extended to employees who hadnt been retrenched, other sources said.        
	But Goyal told the media conference that I have not decided about salary revision.        
	Jet employees welcomed the reinstatement. Reema Lepcha, who got her sack notice yesterday in Calcutta, said: We saw the announcement on TV. We havent got any communication. But it seems our jobs are secure. We are so happy.         
	Distancing himself from the dismissal decision, Goyal said: The management has decided it and when I read about it, I saw tears in their eyes, I decided on my own to call them back. There is no internal or external pressure... as a family, we will decide how to fly.        
	Asked about the threat by Raj to block Jet flights and the reported conversation during the day between Goyal and the young politician, the airline chief said: It does not matter what anybody says, I have not even asked my wife.        
	Claiming that he did not know about day-to-day decisions of the management which may have taken the call because of the economic condition, Goyal said the dismissals had nothing to do with Kingfisher with which Jet had entered into an alliance 24 hours before the broom was wielded.        
	Requesting journalists not to ask more questions as he was distraught, Goyal said: My daughter is 19 years old. They (the employees) are 20 or so. I have gone through this.... I cannot see their trauma and agony. I couldnt sleep at night.        
	Earlier in the day, several politicians, including a hurt Murli Deora, the petroleum minister, had requested Goyal to reinstate the employees.        
	Speculation was rife tonight that the government might announce a cut on the duty on aviation fuel, citing falling global oil prices. Oil prices fell below $70 a barrel on Thursday for the first time since August last year. The petroleum ministry so far has been resisting aviation minister Patels appeals for relief.        
	Goyal tonight said that help from the government would also be needed.        
	During the day, Air India had piled pressure for some relief by speaking of a leave-without-pay scheme that could bench as many as 15,000 employees  almost half its workforce.        
	The labour ministry also stepped in, convening a tripartite meeting in Mumbai tomorrow that looks redundant after Goyals announcement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Skidding on strike puddle, air passenger cracks skull in city
                                                                                                           Skidding on strike puddle, air passenger cracks skull in city
          A STAFF REPORTER                                              
	Calcutta, March 12: A passenger suffered brain haemorrhage and a skull fracture after slipping on a puddle in a Calcutta airport terminal that was not cleaned for 12 hours because of a strike.         
	Amarjeet Singh Gill, 55, made the mistake of landing in Calcutta on the first day of the airport employees indefinite agitation that had little impact on the rest of India.        
	The airport in Dum Dum became the worst affected in the country because the non-co-operation movement is being enforced by an outfit  the Airports Authority Employees Union (AAEU)  that is backed by Citu.        
	Gill, who reached Calcutta today from Amritsar, fell in the toilet in the domestic terminal near the arrival gate. He is now recuperating in the Neuro-Intensive Care Unit of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital.        
	The patients condition is yet to stabilise. A CT scan has revealed that there is some blood on the left side of the brain, said Binod Kumar Singhania, the neurosurgeon treating Gill.        
	He suffered a fracture in his skull because of a fall which led to cerebral injury and bleeding from the ear. His blood pressure shot up after the accident and we have put him on anti-epileptic drugs to prevent convulsions, and his vitals are being monitored, the surgeon added.        
	If Gills condition stabilises, he will be moved to a separate hospital room. In any case, he will have to spend at least two or three more days here, Singhania said.        
	Yes he slipped on a puddle of water and fell down in the toilet, said Gills wife, who did not want to disclose her name.        
	Gill and his wife, NRIs settled in Canada, arrived at the city airport around 11.30am from Amritsar by an MDLR flight. Gill had gone to the restroom, only to find dirty water swirling on the floors.        
	While trying to negotiate the puddles, Gill slipped and fell, hitting his head and losing consciousness. Other passengers who were in the toilet tried to revive him but in vain.        
	They then rushed outside and informed Gills wife and carried him to the lounge. Airport officials were also informed.         
	He was bleeding through his left ear. We provided primary treatment and referred him to the hospital in an ambulance, a medical officer of the airport said.        
	The toilets cannot be cleaned like normal days because of the agitation. Cleaners from the Central Industrial Security Force were engaged but they are not adequate, an airport official added.         
	Shyamal Chakraborty, the state president of Citu, termed the incident unfortunate but blamed the Centre. It is equally unfortunate that jobs of thousands of employees are threatened. The Centre has failed to satisfy the expectations of those who clean the toilets, and so it must take responsibility for the incident, he said.        
	The employees have gone on strike demanding that the Centre keep open the existing airports in Hyderabad and Bangalore when alternative facilities get off the ground this week and later.        
	The Centre has said it is obliged to close down all commercial civil aviation operations at the existing airports once the new airports are made operational. But it has promised to either retain or relocate all employees in the old airports.        
	The Delhi government had yesterday invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act (Esma) to ensure that passengers are not inconvenienced.         
	But Bengal home secretary Ashok Mohan Chakraborty today said the state government had not taken any decision to impose Esma.         
	I am shocked to hear that a passenger fell down and got badly injured. However, there has been no government decision to imposed Esma here, Chakraborty said.

	Ranchi, Sept. 19: JMM MLA Jagannath Mahto attended Day-1 of the Assembly session only to claim that the matter of his pending arrest wasnt serious.        
	A warrant is out since 2003 against the Dumri MLA in connection with a 1985 murder case. On July 20, a Bokaro district judge issued orders to Bokaro SP Priya Dube to execute the warrant without any further delay. Yet, despite making all the right noises, the police has shied away from arresting Mahto.        
	Today, both Opposition and ruling party leaders cried foul. But Mahto was unperturbed. It is not at all a serious matter. I came to know about the things from you (media) people. If (the) charges against me are serious I will apply for bail, he said after spending over two hours in the House.        
	In his trademark white shirt and trousers, the JMM MLA looked happy to be the cynosure of all eyes inside as well as outside the Assembly throughout the day.        
	 Leader of the Opposition Arjun Munda said the JMM MLAs case was indicative of how the states law and order situation had deteriorated. Also, that a ruling party MLA roamed free despite being issued an warrant by a court, indicated the state government had little regard for the law of the land.         
	The government should ensure Mahtos immediate arrest but it seems they are extending protection to the legislator who is charged of murder, Munda told The Telegraph.        
	He promised to raise the matter in the Assembly which was adjourned today after customary condolence messages were read out for Late Ramesh Singh Munda and other MLAs.        
	Deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi, an Independent MLA, did not hold back when he said legislators who enacted laws should also follow them as any other common citizen. It may happen that due to political rivalries, charges are framed against a politician. But one cant evade arrest after a warrant has been issued, he said.         
	Speaker Alamgir Alam was his usual self. Asked how a legislator against whom an arrest warrant was pending attended the Assembly session, he said he hadnt been officially informed about any such warrant pending against Mahto either by the Bokaro district authorities or the state government. I am yet to be informed about the case, Alam said. Another deputy chief minister in the Shibu Soren government, Sudhir Mahto conceded that Dumri MLA was seeking legal opinion. If he is advised to surrender in court, he will do so. He was initially granted bail but a long absence resulted in the court issuing a warrant against the JMM MLA again, he claimed.        
	Mahtos arrest warrant was issued in 2003 for his alleged involvement in a murder committed 18 years ago. The case was revived with Bokaro district judge B.B. Mangal Murthy issuing written orders in July this year to the Bokaro SP, asking her to execute the permanent arrest warrant.        
	The warrant was issued on April 3, 2003, against Mahto by additional district judge of the Tenughat fast-track court.

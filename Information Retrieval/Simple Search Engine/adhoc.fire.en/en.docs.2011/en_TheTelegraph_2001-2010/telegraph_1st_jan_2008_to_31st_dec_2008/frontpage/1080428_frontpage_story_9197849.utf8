	Ranchi/Hilltop Pokharia (Dumka), April 27: Easy cash as levy, less police concentration, poor progress or forced land acquisition  the reasons might be plenty, but the fact is Maoists have made a foray into the forests of Santhal Pargana.        
	Even in the recent past, the men in khaki and khadi in the state were busy curbing the Maoist menace  declared by the Prime Minister most threatening to internal security  in Latehar, Chatra, Palamau, Garhwa and other areas oblivious of the condition prevailing in Santhal Pargana.        
	Yesterdays morning attack in which five persons, including three policemen, were killed at Hilltop Pokharia, 55km from Dumka, was an eye-opener to them.        
	Senior police officers attributed the rebels attempt in getting foothold in the tribal-dominated districts to the opening of Panem coal mines. The Naxalites found it a breeding ground to encash on the resentment among villagers for not getting adequate compensation for land, said a police officer. Besides, a large number of crushing mills in Shikaripara block is a big source of revenue for the rebels, he added.         
	Deputy inspector-general of police R.K. Mallick, a former Dumka district police chief, said Manoj Deheri was a vital catch. Manoj was instrumental in recruiting primitive Paharia tribes in rebel ranks, he added. In Hilltop Pokharia, the police today tried to tap the cellphone of Deheri so that the Maoists who fled the village yesterday could be held, but to no avail.         
	A flush-out operation is still going on to trace the Maoists, including four girls who were last seen entering the dense forest surrounding the Paharia village of about 22 families after the ambush. Their strength is about 12-13, but they are equipped with sophisticated arms, Mallick said, terming the attack an isolated incident. One Ramgopal Deheri, son of Bara Mangala Deheri, was apparently detained today as the rebels had reportedly taken shelter at his house in the village. The village itself wore a deserted look today with most of the houses remaining empty.        
	Chief minister Madhu Koda today said the Maoist issue should be handled with utmost care.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   MP threatens to strip in House
  - Bodo leader fumes at govt silence on Assam clashes         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Bwismuthiary                                         
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: A Bodo MP today threatened to undress in Parliament after the government refused to respond to his tirade against Muslims for allegedly attacking tribals in Assam.        
	A stunned Lok Sabha  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi were in the House  watched as Sansuma Khunggur Bwismuthiary took off his jacket in the well. He was about to remove his trousers when some members persuaded him to return to his seat.         
	Bwismuthiary was protesting against the governments reluctance to order a CBI probe into clashes in Assam that have left over 50 Bodos dead and over two lakh people homeless.         
	Speaker Somnath Chatterjee allowed the MP to raise the matter as soon as the House reassembled after an adjournment in the morning.         
	Bwismuthiary wasted no time in blaming Muslim attackers for the clashes. With no one from Assam to dispute his claim in the House, his verbal onslaught continued unabated.        
	Violence erupted in two Assam districts  Udalguri and Darrang  earlier this month after mobs attacked tribal villages, killing people and setting homes on fire.        
	Bwismuthiary said the carnage had been engineered by pro-Pakistani Muslim jihadis, who had allegedly shouted anti-India slogans while looting, raping and murdering innocent tribals.        
	By this time, the CPMs Mohammad Salim had had enough. He slammed the Bodo MP for his tirade against Muslims and urged the government to find out the truth.        
	As some other Left leaders joined Salim, the BJP members rose to their feet to back Bwismuthiary.         
	While the BJP brigade chorused shame, shame, party deputy leader in the House Vijay Kumar Malhotra said the government should make a statement as Bwismuthiarys allegations were grave.         
	The government refused, prompting all Bodo members to rush to the well and squat on the floor. When that, too, failed to elicit any response, Bwismuthiary stood up and threatened to strip.         
	He was persuaded to go back to his seat, but the commotion continued and the Speaker adjourned the House till 4pm.

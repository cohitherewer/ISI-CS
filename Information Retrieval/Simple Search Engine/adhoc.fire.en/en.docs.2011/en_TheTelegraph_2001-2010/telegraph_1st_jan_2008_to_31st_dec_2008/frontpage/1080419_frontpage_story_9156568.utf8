          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 18: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today shunted deputy commissioners of police of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack apparently in the wake of the murder of Biranchi Das.         
	Although home secretary T.K. Mishra described the shuffle a routine affair, political and administrative circles here believe that the move is a direct fallout of the murder, in which gangster Raja Acharya is a prime suspect.         
	The state police had to face scathing criticism for its failure to nab the culprits even five days of the incident.         
	The image of the police has also come for a severe beating after the city police commissioner, B.K. Behera admitted about a possible nexus between the prime suspect and gangster, Raja Acharya and a few police officers.         
	Against this backdrop, the chief minister ordered for transfer of eight senior IPS officers, including DCP of Bhubaneswar, Amitabh Thakur and DCP of Cuttack, Soumendra Priyadarshi.         
	While Thakur was appointed assistant inspector-general and posted at the state police headquarters in Cuttack, Priyadarshi was shifted from Cuttack to Keonjhar.         
	Similarly, Nayagarh SP Rajesh Kumar was posted as DCP, headquarters at the police commissionerate in Bhubaneswar in the wake of allegation about his failure to counter the Maoist attack on various police establishments in the district on February 15 night.         
	Sixteen policemen were killed in the Maoist attack and a huge cache of arms and ammunitions were looted by the rebels, when the SP was reportedly gheraoed by a group of rebels at his residence.         
	On the other hand, Bolangir SP, Himanshu Lal, who is said to have achieved some breakthrough in the abduction of trader, Rashmiranjan Mohapatra and had a stint in Maoist-affected Malkangiri district, was rewarded and posted as DCP, Bhubaneswar.         
	Similarly, Sundargarh SP, Praveen Kumar, who has a good track record of countering the Maoists, has been suitably rewarded and appointed as the DCP of Cuttack.

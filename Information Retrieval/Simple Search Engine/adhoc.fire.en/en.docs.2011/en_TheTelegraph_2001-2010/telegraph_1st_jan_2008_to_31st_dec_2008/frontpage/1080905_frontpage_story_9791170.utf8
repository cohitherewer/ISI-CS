  - Council Chamber: Curzon curse then, Singur meet now          BARUN GHOSH                            The Council Chamber in Raj Bhavan                                        
	Calcutta, Sept. 4: If the governor hosts tomorrows Singur talks in the Council Chamber as scheduled, the ghost of a momentous  and disastrous  decision will be looming over the well-appointed room.         
	In the same room on July 19, 1905, Lord Curzon, the then viceroy and governor-general, formally took the decision to partition Bengal, igniting a chain of events that eventually dislodged Calcutta as the capital of British India.         
	The issue on the long, mahogany table tomorrow will be as pivotal for Bengal as it was 103 years ago: if Calcutta fell from a prized perch then, the exercise on Friday will play a part in deciding whether the city and the state are about to fall off another precipice.        
	If it was the partition of a people then, a wrong move now could mean the perdition of a generation.         
	But the choice need not be so grim: on December 4, 1829, William Bentinck signed the decree abolishing sati in the same room.        
	The building housing the stately room was once called Government House and now Raj Bhavan where Gopalkrishna Gandhi will facilitate talks between the Trinamul Congress and the state government.        
	The Council Chamber, so christened because the governor-generals executive council would meet here, was being spruced up today for tomorrows meeting. Over 30 employees were busy through the day to clean the room, located in the northeast corner on the first floor of Raj Bhavan.         
	Calcutta police officials visited the hall twice with sniffer dogs to oversee the security arrangement. Gandhi also inspected the venue during the day.         
	Former acting governor Shyamal Sen recalled that he used to hold several important meetings with the then chief minister Jyoti Basu in the Council Chamber.         
	When the room is not used for such discussions, the governor holds meetings there with representatives of organisations of which he is either chief patron or chairperson.         
	I held several meetings of the Red Cross Society and St. John Ambulance and Bharat Scouts and Guides during my short tenure as acting governor in 1999, said Sen, now chairman of the state human rights commission.        
	Twenty-three governors-general, who lived in the majestic edifice until the capital was shifted to Delhi in 1912, used the Council Chamber to discuss matters of governance.         
	But few were as controversial as the partition decision, which set off such a firestorm of protests that it was revoked in 1911. But Calcutta paid a price because the British did not want to take a chance and decided to shift to the more strategically located Delhi.        
	The ill-fated move did not bode well for the occupant of the building either. Months after the decision to divide Bengal was taken, Curzon resigned and left India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pratibha in Chile on an all-woman trip 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Pratibha in Chile on an all-woman trip

	Guadalajara (Mexico), April 20: The much-awaited womens reservation bill, a potent symbol of empowering women in India, may be held up, but Pratibha Patil is determined to do her bit for that politically correct cause during her maiden presidential trip abroad.        
	Her three-day visit to Chile, beginning today, will be a womens affair all the way.         
	Pratibhas Chilean counterpart and main interlocutor is a 56-year-old woman, Michelle Bachelet, a single parent with a 14-year-old daughter and two other grown children.        
	Bachelet, elected to office two years ago, is somewhat of an icon in the western hemisphere for her courageous fight against the despised former military dictatorship in Chile under General Augusto Pinochet.        
	Her father was a general in the Chilean air force and died in prison for opposing the junta.         
	Bachelet and her mother, Angelica, were tortured in Pinochets notorious detention camps for dissidents before they fled the country.        
	The first person to meet Pratibha when her special Air India flight touches down in Santiago tonight will be Indias woman ambassador to Chile.         
	Chile is the only country included in Pratibhas current Latin American tour where Indias envoy is a woman.        
	Sushmita Gongulee Thomas will board Air India One after it lands at Santiagos Arturo Merino Benitez International airport and request the President to deplane.        
	Thomas has already finished her tenure in Santiago and has been posted as consul-general in San Francisco. Because she is yet to move to her new posting, Thomas has become a key part of a rare bilateral womens summit in Chile tomorrow.        
	A fluent speaker in Spanish, Thomas was Indias ambassador in Cote DIvoire, a tough posting for a woman diplomat in a country torn by civil war.        
	The delegation that is accompanying Pratibha to Chile itself showcases woman power in India.        
	Two of the three members of Parliament who are in the presidential entourage are women, Kanimozhi of the DMK and Mabel Rebello of the Congress.        
	The chief of the presidential security set-up, Renuka Muttoo, is a woman, too, much to the surprise of her Latin American counterparts, whose profiles usually fit a macho mould.        
	The only Indian Foreign Service officer currently on the Presidents secretariat, Vijay Thakur Singh, is her joint secretary.        
	Singh, also a fluent Spanish speaker, who defied the odds and recently completed a rare tenure in Afghanistan for a woman diplomat, is an integral part of Pratibhas ongoing travel through Latin America.        
	Two of Pratibhas three spokespersons on the trip are women  Archana Datta, officer of special duty in Rashtrapati Bhavan, and Nagma Mallick, a director in the ministry of external affairs.         
	The third spokesperson, Nitin Wakankar, deputy press secretary to Pratibha, has several years of Rashtrapati Bhavan experience.        
	Other women on the presidential entourage are Rasika Chaube, Pratibhas financial adviser and Parvati Singh Bais, the Presidents physician.

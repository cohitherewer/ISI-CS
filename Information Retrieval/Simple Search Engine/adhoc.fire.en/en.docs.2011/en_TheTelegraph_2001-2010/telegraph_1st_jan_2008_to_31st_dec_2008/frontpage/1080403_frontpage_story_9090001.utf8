          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Scarlett Keeling                                   
	Mumbai, April 2: The Goa government today cleared the decks for a CBI probe into the death of Scarlett Keeling, three days after the British teenagers mother flew her body back to the UK.         
	Senior Goa police officers confirmed that the government had given the final nod after the top brass said it had no objection to the move.         
	The formal orders to hand over the case to the CBI are yet to be issued, but the government has given its final approval. The formalities may take a couple of days more, an officer said.         
	Chief minister Digambar Kamat had said in the Assembly that his government was willing to hand over the investigation to the CBI  a demand made by Scarletts mother Fiona Mackeown.         
	After Kamats statement, Mackeown brought the 15-year-olds body from Goa Medical College to Mumbai and flew it back to Devon for the funeral rites on Sunday.         
	Mackeown and her nine children, including Scarlett, had arrived in Goa in November 2007. She left Scarlett with a local guide, Julio Lobo, in Siolim and travelled to Karnataka with the rest of the family. Scarlett was found dead on Anjuna beach on February 18.         
	The police initially conducted an autopsy and declared that it was a simple case of death from drowning. But Mackeown pointed out the abrasions on Scarletts body and alleged she was murdered. The police then ordered a second autopsy that revealed she was raped and murdered.         
	The police arrested Samson dSouza, a bartender at Luis Caf on Anjuna beach where Scarlett was last seen, and a local drug peddler, Placido Carvalho, on charges of drugging, raping and murdering Scarlett.         
	Mackeown demanded a CBI inquiry, alleging that Goa home minister Ravi Naik and director-general of police B.S. Brar were part of a drug nexus.         
	Kamat initially rejected her demand, questioning Mackeowns decision to leave her daughter with a guide.         
	Goa police have now been informed by their Delhi counterparts of another case of alleged rape of a New York-based NRI woman.         
	The woman, 52, alleged she was molested in the lobby of a five-star hotel in Panaji and later raped in her room. She went to New Delhi and then lodged a complaint.         
	She arrived in Goa on March 1 and claimed in her complaint that she was dragged into her room around 11.45pm on March 7 by an unknown man and raped. She did not lodge a complaint, and travelled to New Delhi where she told doctors at Max Hospital in Saket that she had been raped in Goa, said a senior police officer.         
	The hospital authorities informed south Delhi police, who lodged a handwritten complaint on March 17. The woman then disappeared from her Delhi address.         
	On March 31, Delhi police forwarded the complaint to Goa police. The womans whereabouts are now unknown.

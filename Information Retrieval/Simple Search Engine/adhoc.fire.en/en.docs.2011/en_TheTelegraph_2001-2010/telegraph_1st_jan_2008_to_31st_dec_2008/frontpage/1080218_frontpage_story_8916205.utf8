          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 17: The Maoist raid in Orissa has stunned the men in uniform here and the headquarters has given special instruction to all police stations to be on guard.        
	Senior officers have been asked to carefully monitor the anti-Naxalite operations and take preventive measures.        
	Director-general of police V.D. Ram has ordered superintendents of police to increase security of armouries, police stations and pickets. Combing operations in East Singhbhum and Gumla districts are on in full swing.         
	Four police officers from Jharkhand have been rushed to Orissa to gather the latest news even as Naxalites fled towards Andhra Pradesh after the Nayagarh attack.        
	On the precautionary measures, police spokesman R.K. Mallick said: The Santhal Pragana region is comparatively peaceful but we are on red alert because in urban mobile warfare, Naxalites target safe areas.         
	DGP Ram said officers have been given the necessary instructions.         
	However, despite the special arrangements, 30 families from Amda village in Dumaria have fled their houses fearing rebels retaliation.

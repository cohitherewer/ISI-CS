The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Somnath in vote-for-Cong threat 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Somnath in vote-for-Cong threat 
  - Speaker ticks off Karat, expected to quit after meet with Basu          OUR BUREAU                                                    Chatterjee, Karat    
	July 12: Curtains are now lifting on a drama in which an angry Somnath Chatterjee told Prakash Karat he would vote for the Congress if he was forced out of the Speakers chair in haste.         
	The remaining acts of the unpublicised theatre are expected to unfold over the next two days when Chatterjee is expected to heed CPM patriarch Jyoti Basus advice and step down as Speaker.        
	Sources said Chatterjee put forth his differences in very strong words to the CPM general secretary after the Speakers name was included in the list of MPs submitted by the Left to the President.        
	The inclusion of Chatterjees name was a clear signal that the CPM expects him to vote against the expected trust motion, which would have required him to relinquish the Chair. The CPMs move had raised eyebrows with many feeling that it amounted to reducing the Speaker to a partisan MP for the sake of one vote.        
	The sources said so angry was Chatterjee at one stage  raucous members of the Lok Sabha will recall the sting of his tongue-lashing  that he told Karat if he was made to vote, he would do so for the Congress.        
	The outburst was enough for the CPM leadership to turn to Chatterjees mentor Basu who apparently sympathised with the Speaker but advised him not to do anything that would weaken the party.        
	The stage is set to shift to Calcutta tomorrow when Chatterjee is expected to meet Basu. The Speaker is likely to tell the patriarch that he would like to preside over the trust motion debate and then step down. That will also ensure that he does not vote against the Congress, a source said in jest.        
	If events play out according to the script, Basu is expected to persuade him to resign by Monday as the party has already tied itself in knots over the issue. Almost every day, the CPM leadership is having to play poker and repeat the one-liner that the decision lies with the Speaker.        
	Today, too, asked about Chatterjees continuance in the Chair, Karat drew attention to what he had said earlier: The Speaker will decide for himself.         
	The irony of Karat using the good offices of Basu to settle the issue is also hard to miss. Karat had played an instrumental role in denying Basu prime ministership in 1996 and Chatterjee the office of the President as well as the Vice-President last year.        
	The veteran who later immortalised the 1996 denial by describing it as a historic blunder is now helping the party get over another fiasco of its own making.        
	When some CPM leaders were not keen on a party nominee accepting the Speakers post, Basu was among those who favoured the proposal.        
	But CPM sources still insist they have no idea why so much of dust is being raised about the inclusion of Chatterjees name in the list furnished to the President.         
	He was elected on our party ticket. Every vote is precious when it comes to defeating a confidence motion and Chatterjee will vote against the motion as an MP after he demits the office, a CPM leader said.        
	The CPMs discomfiture was compounded today by the RSS, which praised Karat for withdrawing support to the UPA. The Organiser, the Sangh mouthpiece, said:  Karat has reasons to be fuming. He has accused the Congress of humiliating his party and betraying its trust. He is right.         
	The unwanted compliment came on a day the CPM was forced to clarify that the Left parties would not have any floor co-ordination with the BJP on the trust motion. There is no floor coordination with the BJP, politburo member Sitaram Yechury said.

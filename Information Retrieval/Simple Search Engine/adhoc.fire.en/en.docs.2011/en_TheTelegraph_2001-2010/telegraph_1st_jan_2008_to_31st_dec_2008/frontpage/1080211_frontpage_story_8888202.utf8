                                Penelope Cruz                            
	Berlin, Feb. 10 (AP): Spanish actress Penelope Cruz is looking forward to getting older, and she wont entertain discussions over whether her looks pose a career problem.        
	Cruz, 33, appeared today at the Berlin film festival to promote fellow Spaniard Isabel Coixets Elegy, in which Cruz stars as Consuela  a student who embarks on an affair with a much older professor, played by Ben Kingsley, 64.        
	Asked at a news conference whether she thought about aging herself, Cruz replied: Im looking forward to (it)... I want to experience things; Im looking forward to having backaches and using that in my work.        
	Cruz swatted aside a query about whether she felt her looks made it harder for her to be taken seriously, saying she had plenty of offers for roles that have nothing to do with any of that.        
	I think you also have to be pretty egocentric to think that you have that problem, added Cruz, who was nominated for a best-actress Oscar for her role in Pedro Almodovars Volver last year. I dont engage in that debate because I am allergic to it.

  Rebuff greets CMs direct talks letter          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            The sun sets over the Tata Motors plant in Singur on Monday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 25: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today sought direct talks on Singur in a half-page letter but Mamata Banerjee rejected the offer in three lines.        
	The chief ministers appeal came with the rider that the Tata Motors project must be kept intact in its entirety. The Trinamul Congress leader responded by saying no discussion was possible unless the 400 acres forcibly acquired from unwilling farmers were returned.        
	Mamatas rebuff has clouded the attempts at a rapprochement but sources said efforts to break the deadlock would continue. The CPM and the government are toying with a few proposals but are wary of making them public for fear of immediate rejection by the Trinamul leader.         
	Asked whether shifting of ancillary units and alternative land for unwilling farmers would be discussed with Mamata, the chief minister said: We are open to all kinds of discussions with her. Everything can be talked about but we cannot miss this important project.        
	A fresh shot at peace is expected to depend on how the siege plays itself out in the next few days and the response it evokes. The crowd in Singur was much smaller compared with the 40,000 yesterday.        
	The number picked up in the evening with around 6,000 to 8,000 people converging around the podium when Mamata stood up to read out the letter from the chief minister.         
	The gathering started thinning after Mamata left the dais. At night, around 1,000 people squatted around the podium. It is not easy to carry on with peoples protest sitting on the roads. At times, it rains and causes problems. Then there are mosquitoes, some big ones like malignant malaria mosquitoes and Tata mosha (Tata mosquitoes), Mamata said.        
	In his letter, Bhattacharjee had said: Keeping the project intact in its entirety and staying within the existing legal and constitutional framework of the country, we must find a mutually acceptable solution to protect the interests of farmers affected by land acquisition in Singur. So, I want to have direct talks with you. For speedy execution of the small-car project and for the states image, I hope you will call off your agitation and agree to have discussions.        
	Before penning her reply, Mamata had told reporters: I am always willing to hold talks with the government in the interest of the state. I am ready to participate in talks on the future of the unwilling farmers. I welcome the chief ministers letter but will take part in discussions only if 400 acres are given back.        
	Trinamul sources had earlier said Mamata might interpret the word entirety in Bhattacharjees letter as applying to the mother plant alone, minus the ancillary units. She had been arguing that the Tatas need 600-650 acres for the small-car plant and, hence, the ancillary units can be shifted to a nearby location. Buddhababus letter does not specifically state whether the entire project means both the mother plant and ancillary units and, hence, leaves scope for interpretation, a Trinamul leader said.        
	Last week, the Tatas had told the government that the ancillary units were an integral part of the project.        
	Asked to react to Mamatas stand, industries minister Nirupam Sen said: Of the 11,500 people whose land had been acquired in Singur, 9,500 gave it willingly. Unfortunately, she is talking about the interests of a small section of farmers who did not accept cheques.        
	The minister left it to Mamata to propose the sort of compensation she expected from the government. It is for the Trinamul chief to say what she wants for the unwilling farmers. Providing alternative land will mean taking Shyamals land and giving it to Amal. It is not viable, he said.

	New Delhi, Jan. 30: Taslima Nasreen finally got herself a change of scene, but only for three nights.
    
	The Bangladeshi author was last night discharged from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where she had been admitted on Saturday after she complained of uneasiness.
    
	The author today told PTI that she had fallen ill because of an overdose of drugs prescribed by a doctor she was taken to by government officials in the capital.
    
	Doctors at the hospital diagnosed my illness was caused by the poisonous effect of medicines prescribed in multiple doses, she said. I almost collapsed.
    
	The author was first examined for possible adverse drug reactions, AIIMS sources said. But by Sunday evening, tests had revealed that she was suffering from hypertension. 
    
	Doctors attending to Taslima said although her condition was normal, they did not want to take any chances as she has diabetes. 
    
	Taslima complained that her blood pressure had shot up because of her virtual confinement in the capital since being moved out of Calcutta on November 22 following protests there. 
    
	Initially, we thought it was just another of her complaints but then we realised she was a little breathless. After a few quick phone calls, the decision was taken to take her to AIIMS for a check-up, a home ministry official said.
    
	A doctor at AIIMS conceded that loneliness could lead to a rise in blood pressure for people prone to hypertension. 
    
	The home ministry official said Taslima seemed cheerful at the hospital as she was getting a chance to interact with some people, even if they are doctors and nurses.

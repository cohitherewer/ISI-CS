	Ranchi, June 17: NREGA director Satyendra Prasad Singh is visiting various districts in Jharkhand, including Palamau, for first-hand information on glaring irregularities in the UPA governments flagship rural job scheme. But, may be he isnt looking hard enough for clinching evidence.        
	For, Singh will be skipping Chhatarpur block, where social activist Lalit Mehta, an associate of economist Jean Drze, was killed while he was conducting a social audit of the job scheme. I visited Patan block in Palamau today to see if NREGA norms were being followed or not. I am in Hussainabad tomorrow, but I am not going to Chhatarpur, Singh told The Telegraph, adding he was on a routine monitoring trip.         
	I am making spot verifications. The irregularities have to be matched with the records. Only then will I be able to say whether the scheme was implemented properly or not, he maintained.         
	Mehtas killing on May 14 has generated widespread condemnation with villagers holding public hearings in Palamau. Now, eminent social activists like Aruna Roy, Swami Agnivesh, CPI leader D. Raja and other have backed demands for a CBI probe into the killing. Union rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has also asked chief minister Madhu Koda to intervene.        
	State NREGA commissioner Amitabh Kaushal said they were examining a report from Palamau deputy commissioner who acts as district programme co-ordinator for the job scheme. We hope to take action against erring officials in a couple of days, he added.         
	But Roy, Drze and others have requested the Centre to reject the Palamau DCs report, alleging it was meant to hush up the case and tarnish their image. So far, the district administration has lodged FIRs against four persons based on the findings of Drze and GB Pant Institute of Social Sciences who were conducting the social audit. They were Baidyanath Ram, forest guard Jai Kumar Mishra, panchayat sevak Bodhan Prajapati and gram sevak Rajesh Ram. Action has also been recommended against forest ranger Vinay Kumar.        
	Drze is scheduled to hold a public hearing on NREGS in association with NGO Bharat Gyan Vikas Samiti at Markachcho in Koderma district tomorrow.

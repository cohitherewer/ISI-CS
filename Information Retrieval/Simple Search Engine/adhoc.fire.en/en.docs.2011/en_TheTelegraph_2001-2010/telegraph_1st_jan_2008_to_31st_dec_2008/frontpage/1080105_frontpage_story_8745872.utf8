The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cloud 90 lifts, ton shines on Sachin
                                                                                                        Cloud 90 lifts, ton shines on Sachin
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                                SCG  Sachin cricket ground: Sachin   celebrates his century at Sydney Cricket Ground. (Reuters)    
	Sydney, Jan. 4: Like 15-year-old Christy Doran, an opener who plays in the local Green Shield, or the Young-based Helen Hamblin (in her 40s), just about each one of the 29,358 who went through the SCG turnstiles today did so with a prayer on their lips.        
	It had nothing to do with those wearing the revered Baggy Green. Rather, the Dorans and the Hamblins were praying that their hero No. 1  Sachin Tendulkar  wouldnt disappoint them in what appears to be his last Test here.        
	Sachin, who grasps situations better than mere mortals, didnt. Hes one for the occasion, after all.         
	Indeed, Sachin couldnt have chosen a better venue (outside India, that is) to smash the 90s jinx. After as many as seven dismissals in the past seven months, the maestro reached three figures in front of an adoring crowd.        
	Sachins following had touched another level when the late Sir Donald Bradman told the world that the Mumbaikars batting reminded him of his own.        
	That was in 1996.        
	Over the past fortnight or so, ever since Team Indias arrival in Australia, Sachins popularity has grown even more. Youve got to be around him to actually gauge the awe and frenzy.        
	We dont stay in Sydney, but have put up at a friends place for this match. This could be Sachins last Test at the SCG and I couldnt just watch him on TV... My family and I are so delighted that he got a super hundred, Hamblin said.        
	That sentiment found favour across the stands.        
	Sachin himself said that he was relieved at not falling in the 90s again. He had words of affection for the Sydneysiders too.        
	It felt different this time (on getting to his 38th hundred).... From Ireland last June, Id missed a lot of hundreds and didnt want that to continue.... Wanted to move on from the 90s and the start of 2008 was important.... The year has begun well and Im quite relieved.        
	Asked by The Telegraph whether son Arjun (who is here with the rest of the family) had again given tips on overcoming the jinx, Sachin laughed: No, no. Not this time.        
	Arjun had asked him to reach three figures with the help of a six. That was before the Gwalior ODI against Pakistan, in mid-November, but Sachin hadnt paid heed.        
	He fell for 97.         
	Today, Sachins unbeaten 154 and his handsome partnerships with Sourav Ganguly (whod been timing in ethereal manner) and plucky Harbhajan Singh took India to 532, a lead of 69 over Australias effort of 463.        
	With two days remaining, anything  including an Indian win in this 3 mobile-sponsored Test  is possible. The first, at the MCG, had gone Australias way by the length of the Harbour Bridge and more.

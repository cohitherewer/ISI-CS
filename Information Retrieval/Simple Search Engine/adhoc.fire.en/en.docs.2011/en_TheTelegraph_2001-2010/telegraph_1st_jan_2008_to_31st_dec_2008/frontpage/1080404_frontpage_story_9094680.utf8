	London, April 3: An Indian has become possibly the first person in the UK to be convicted of reckless driving on the basis of accident impact details stored in a device in his car.        
	Antonio Boparan Singh, the son of a wealthy Indian businessman, will be sentenced on April 24 for speeding and colliding with a Jeep carrying a baby who suffered brain damage.         
	Two years back, Boparan was weaving in and out of traffic at high speed in a Range Rover when he lost control while overtaking. A device fitted in the cars airbag system allowed investigators to calculate the precise speed at which Boparan hit the Jeep carrying the 11-month-old.

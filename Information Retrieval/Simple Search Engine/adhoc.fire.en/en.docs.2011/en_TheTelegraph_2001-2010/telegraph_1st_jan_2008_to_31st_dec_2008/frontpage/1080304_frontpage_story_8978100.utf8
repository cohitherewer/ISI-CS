     A STAFF REPORTER 
               
	Guwahati, March 3: An estimated 7,000 HIV-positive people in Assam are ignorant about their status and most likely spreading the virus, health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said today.
    
	Sarma revealed this piece of statistic while speaking to the media about the arrival of the Red Ribbon Express, a seven-coach special train criss-crossing the country to spread awareness about the disease. 
    
	The train is scheduled to chug in on March 8. 
    
	The health minister said Assam was still in the low HIV-prevalence category, but vulnerable nevertheless.
    
	Vulnerable because we have been able to detect only 2,369 of the estimated 10,700 HIV-positive cases. That over 7,000 people are still moving around without knowing their health status is the most worrying part. 
    
	He said the state needed to make the most of the Red Ribbon Expresss arrival to reach out to the masses. 
    
	The idea is to prevent more people from getting infected. Testing and counselling have improved significantly since 2006, but we still have to be on guard.
    
	Health commissioner V.S. Bhaskar and the project director of the Assam State AIDS Control Society J.S. Rao were also present at the media briefing.
    
	Kamrup district leads the states HIV-prevalence tally with 1,370 confirmed cases, followed by Cachar with 263. Dibrugarh has 207, Golaghat 86 and Sonitpur 69. Dhemaji and Hailakandi have only four and three confirmed cases. 
    
	Kamrup also leads the districts with the most number of full-blown AIDS cases (460), followed by Golaghat (36), Nagaon (35), Sonitpur (21) and Jorhat (16). 
    
	Assam has so far had 737 cases of full-blown AIDS. 
    
	Sarma said the Red Ribbon Express would make its first stop at Kamakhya station in Guwahati, enter New Tinsukia station on March 13, Mariani on March 14 and Chaparmukh on March 15. Apart from the cultural troupes aboard the train, local groups will travel to the stations and nearby villages on bicycles and buses to spread the message.
    
	We plan to cover at least 50 villages in and around the four stations and also encourage people to visit the train stations. The Red Ribbon Express has all the facilities required to detect HIV. There are people for counselling, too. We will be distributing condoms during the campaign, the health minister said.
    
	Flagged off by Sonia Gandhi in Rajasthan on December 1, the train will cover 180 stations countrywide. 
    
	The first three coaches are reserved for exhibits. One coach is for the cultural troupes and officials and the rest house an auditorium-cum-conference room and counselling, testing and administrative centres.

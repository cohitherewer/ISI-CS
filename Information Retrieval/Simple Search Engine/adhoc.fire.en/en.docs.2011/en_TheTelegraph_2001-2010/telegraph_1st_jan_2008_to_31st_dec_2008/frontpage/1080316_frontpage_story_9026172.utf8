The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Phew!Padma done it
                                                                                                           Phew! Padma done it
  - Sanjay chills as Paris connects with Bengal           AMIT ROY                            Bhansali with Tanusree after the premiere                                        
	Paris, March 15: Sanjay Leela Bhansali was taking it easy in his Paris apartment late this morning following the triumph of the night before. The premiere of the Indo-French opera, Padmavati, had ended to rousing and sustained cheers of Bravo! Bravo! from the ecstatic 2,500-strong audience in the Theatre du Chatelet.        
	God, I was so stressed yesterday, admitted the Bollywood director, who has been rehearsing in Paris for two months, with his highly regarded choreographer Tanusree Shankar, head of costumes Rajesh Pratap Singh, set designer Omung Kumar Bhandula, in-charge of lighting Somak Mukherjee and 25 young men and women dancers from Tanusrees dance academy in Calcutta.        
	I shall be more relaxed and enjoy the five remaining shows, said Bhansali, who was the last to appear on stage to a rapturous reception before the curtain fell. Tanusree, who had been backstage, looked characteristically graceful in her dark green sari as she took her bow.        
	Padmavati has been staged only twice before  in 1923 and in 1947. So the Indian ambassador in Paris, Ranjan Mathai, was lucky enough to witness a historic occasion.        
	 Somak, who was responsible for the lighting on the giant stage which went through a spectrum of hues  white, pink, bright yellow, blue and finally blood red as Padmavati commits sati after stabbing her husband, Ratan-Sen, to stop falling into Alouddins lustful clutches  knew where the credit was really due.        
	 This is the triumph of Bengal, he said with a straight face as Tanusree went about like a mother hen making sure her brood of dancers was enjoying the after-show party.                    Dancers of Tanusrees troupe      
	 One of her girls said she had heard the opera-ballet  as Albert Roussels Padmavati is called because it combines orchestral music, singing and dancing in a complex but sophisticated amalgam  would tour to Italy and possibly other European countries later this year following what is deemed to have been a hugely successful experiment in Paris.        
	 The Telegraph noted that the Frenchman seated next to the correspondent did not show any emotion during the whole performance. He neither clapped nor stood up, choosing to remain motionless throughout the evening.         
	Anne Marret, the chief press officer for the Theatre du Chatelet, rolled her eyes. He must have been a French critic, surmised a weary Marret, who has built up a big bundle of cuttings of the French medias coverage of the run-up to last nights premiere.        
	They tend to sit still, she said. They never clap. It does not mean they dont like it or like it. I am now waiting for the reviews. They will start coming in from Monday onwards.        
	 Somak, who was the cameraman on Subhash Ghais Black and White and also in the well-received film Herbert, guided The Telegraph through the intricacies of collaborating with the French.        
	I have never worked with such sophisticated computerised equipment, everything is cued in by computer, he marvelled.         
	At first, they wondered whether I should use so many colours but I wanted to express emotion through a graph of colours. Sanjay backed me up completely  let him do what he has come to do. Another thing is that the French would arrive on time for rehearsals  I live now in Mumbai where this is not always the done thing.        
	 Somak suggested: You should speak to the conductor, Lawrence Foster. He is a fantastic man.        
	 Foster, who is indeed a key man whose name appears even ahead of Bhansalis in the billing for Padmavati, reassured The Telegraph that the opera-ballet had gone down well with last nights audience. In Paris, they boo if they dont like something. They did not boo. For me, conducting was a difficult experience, matching the music to the dance. The music has to keep tempo with the dancing and the singing, and the singing has to keep tempo with the music. And Roussels music is a great work.        
	 He had a word of praise for Bhansali, who in a quiet but authoritative way has put his personal stamp on the production.         
	The bits that worked best, in The Telegraphs opinion, were where Indian sensibility as represented by the best of Bollywood  for example, the sati sequence  were most apparent. Although Bhansali has stuck more or less faithfully to Roussels Padmavati, he does allow the Rajput queen and Ratan-Sen to rise again through a process of reincarnation.        
	 Artistic collaboration between such contrasting cultures as French and Indian might have engendered personal tensions but this appears not to have been the case.         
	Bhansali has been shuffling round the Theatre du Chatelet, one of the high temples of French opera, with his shabby, chic bearded look wearing a dishevelled desi kurta and shawl.        
	 Back in India, people may have had it in for him for tampering with Sarat Chandras Devdas and his Saawariya may have been beaten by Om Shanti Om. In Paris he has come of age.         
	When he wandered into a video store in Paris, the owner eyed him suspiciously.        
	You Indian?        
	 The Indian owned up that he was, indeed, Indian.         
	You should buy this Devdas DVD  its good, the Frenchman said gruffly.        
	 Bhansali said he already had a copy. He resisted making the crack: Forget Devdas, get Om Shanti Om.        
	 Last night there was genuine emotion in Fosters voice as he said: I would welcome the chance to work again with Bhansali. Hes a genius  and a wonderful person.        
	 Meanwhile, Tanusrees boys and girls have located the things that really matter in Paris. And they were not talking about visiting the Louvre for a sight of the Mona Lisa.        
	 One of us can cook really well, a male dancer confided. And we have found ilish maachh in a Paris market.

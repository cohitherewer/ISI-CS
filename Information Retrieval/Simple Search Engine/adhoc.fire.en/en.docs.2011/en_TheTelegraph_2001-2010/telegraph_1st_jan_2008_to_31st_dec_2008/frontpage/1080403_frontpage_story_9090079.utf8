          LAURA CLOUT                             Gadget crazy                                  
	London, April 2: Madonna has revealed that she cannot bear to be without her BlackBerry  and even sleeps with it under her pillow.         
	The singer, who turns 50 in August, said her husband, the film director Guy Ritchie, is similarly attached to his gadget. She said: We lie right next to each other with our BlackBerrys under our pillows.        
	Its not unromantic. Its practical. Im sure loads of couples have their BlackBerrys in bed with them.         
	I have to sleep with my BlackBerry because I often wake up in the middle of the night and remember that Ive forgotten something, so I jump up and make notes.        
	She added: Guys always waiting for me to come to bed, so he plays Brick on his Blackberry until Im ready.        
	In an interview with Elle magazine, Madonna said she and her husband, 39, were well-suited because they both have strong personalities.        
	I had to marry someone as tough as me. Guys definitely tough. He doesnt give in.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

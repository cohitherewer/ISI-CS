The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 4km gap in VIP armour   Cops failed to scan full road
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   4km gap in VIP armour
   Cops failed to scan full road          PRONAB MONDAL                                                    
	Calcutta, Nov. 3: An overconfident special force stopped sanitising a road four kilometres from the spot where a bomb struck two Union ministers convoy in West Midnapore yesterday, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	The spur-of-the-moment omission  apparently based on an assumption that the topography did not match that of usual Maoist operations  goes against guidelines that make inspection of the entire route mandatory.        
	Road-opening parties are mandatory before VIP movement in any insurgency-affected area. In Bengal, the task falls on the Special Security Force, which reports to the state police.        
	Union ministers Ram Vilas Paswan and Jitin Prasada and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had gone to attend the stone-laying ceremony for the Jindal steel project in Salboni. Had the special force followed the guidelines, the 27km stretch from Salboni to Midnapore town should have been scoured with an array of gadgets.        
	However, when the scanners reached Bhadutala, around 18km from the project site in Salboni, they decided to call off the drill, sources said.        
	Till Bhadutala, the terrain had shrubs and bushes  features favoured by Maoists because they provide cover. From Bhadutala onwards, wide swathes of paddy fields line both sides of the road.         
	The special force concluded that as paddy fields do not offer cover, extremists were unlikely to use the stretch for an attack. The events that unfolded yesterday afternoon at Barua, around 4km from Bhadutala, suggest the attackers chose the spot precisely because the paddy fields offered an untrammelled line of vision.        
	A 1,200-metre-long wire snaked from the bomb-pit on the side of the road across the paddy fields towards a mound of earth near railway tracks. Investigators believe the bomb was ignited from the mound, helped by scouts who might have positioned themselves in the paddy fields and signalled their comrades near the railway tracks.        
	It was overconfidence on the part of the police, a state intelligence officer said.        
	Records show Maoists carried out all their strikes in places surrounded by jungles. But this particular stretch has open paddy fields on both sides, said another officer.        
	Even if the special force had reached till Barua, it cannot be said with certainty that the buried landmine would have been detected.        
	The norms require 50 yards on both sides of a convoys route to be checked.         
	But in this case, no one stepped out from the metalled road and examined a single inch of the muddy area and paddy field, an officer said.         
	The bomb that went off yesterday was buried by the roadside, not under the metalled surface.

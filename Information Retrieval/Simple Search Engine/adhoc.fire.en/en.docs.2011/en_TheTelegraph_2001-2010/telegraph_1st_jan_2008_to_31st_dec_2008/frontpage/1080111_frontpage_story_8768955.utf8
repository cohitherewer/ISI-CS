 election mockery

     OUR CORRESPONDENT 
                     
	Hailakandi, Jan. 10: At least 19 people were injured as supporters of panchayat candidates clashed in Hailakandi a day after polling officials made a bonfire of ballot boxes, reducing the final phase of rural elections in Assam to a farce.
    
	Army and paramilitary forces were out on the streets of Ratakandi after supporters of two candidates indulged in rioting. Two shops were looted, as many houses set ablaze and five more partially damaged. All 19 injured, including nine women, were admitted to Hailakandi Civil Hospital. 
    
	An organisation that calls itself Ganatantrik Adhikar Surakhya Mancha declared a 12-hour bandh tomorrow, demanding that elections be held afresh in the district. 
    
	Polling officials who had revolted yesterday for allegedly not being protected from goons hired by parties remained firm about not doing election duty again without adequate armed personnel guarding them.
    
	The district administration filed complaints with the police against several polling officials for their act of burning ballot boxes and other polling materials, but nobody was arrested.
    
	Deputy commissioner S.P. Kakati Bora said the complaint was filed by additional deputy commissioner Rupak Gupta on my behalf. 
    
	I have informed the heads of departments of these officials (most of them are schoolteachers) to initiate appropriate action against them, he added. 
    
	Teachers and other employees associations said at least 100 polling officials were undergoing treatment for injuries inflicted by goons throughout Tuesday night and during polling yesterday. One teacher appointed as the presiding officer of a booth was stripped and tortured, they said.
    
	 Repolling has been ordered in 309 booths in the district. The Ganatantrik Adhikar Surakhya Mancha wants polls in all 621 booths. 
    
	The Assam United Democratic Front backed the demand for fresh polling in all booths. 
    
	The partys working president, Hafiz Rashid Chodhury, said between 100 and 150 ballot papers were missing from almost all 621 booths. He claimed that Congress workers rigged votes the night before polling in many centres.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bokaro, April 1: The district police, along with 26th CRPF battalion, this afternoon found 83 landmines kept under a culvert on the highway between Sadhubera and Palamau villages.        
	While three of those weigh between 25kg and 30kg each, 80 others were relatively smaller with each weighing 2kg.        
	A convoy of CRPF and district police was to cross the small bridge near Mejurmarwa forest zone area, about 70km from here, on long-range patrol when the landmines  camouflaged with Sal leaves and stones  were recovered.        
	About 24 of these landmines were also planted in middle of the road so that they could be triggered on time, said CRPF commandant V.S. Sharma.        
	The recovery also included 300 metres of explosive-tagged wire which had timers fitted with it.        
	Sharma said soon after the murder of a CCL employee last week, the Naxalites were expecting police raid and planted the devices to entrap the men in khaki.        
	Bokaro superintendent of police Priya Dubey said: We have more such information but we will act cautiously.

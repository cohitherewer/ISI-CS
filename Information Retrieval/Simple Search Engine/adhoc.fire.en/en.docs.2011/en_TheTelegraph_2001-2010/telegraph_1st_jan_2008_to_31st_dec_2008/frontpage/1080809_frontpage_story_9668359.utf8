	New Delhi, Aug. 8: Manmohan Singh and Prakash Karat came face to face today, for the first time since their political ties snapped a month ago, in honour of the man who had forged that alliance.        
	At the CPMs condolence meeting for Harkishen Singh Surjeet, the Prime Minister sat right next to the Marxist general secretary on the dais, earning appreciation from the Left.        
	The bonded slave and his former master, however, looked stiff for the half-hour that Singh spent at Mavlankar Hall.        
	Karat greeted the Prime Minister with folded hands and signed off with a namaste when he left. They spoke briefly twice, their expressions betraying nothing of what was on their minds.        
	In a parting shot to Karat on the day of the trust vote, Singhs speech, largely unread because of the din, had mentioned how the Left wanted me to behave as their bonded slave.        
	Today, the Prime Minister was seen smiling only when he spoke to T.R, Baalu, who sat on his left, and Sharad Yadav.        
	The tension dissipated from Karats face after Singh left. He shifted into a more comfortable position in his seat and was soon laughing with A.B. Bardhan and Yadav.        
	If Karat was accused of isolating the Left over the nuclear deal, there was little sign of it at the meeting. Barring the BJP, almost every party was represented.        
	Mayavati couldnt make it because of a rally in Lucknow but sent a message through a BSP Rajya Sabha member, Ambetharajan.        
	One prominent absentee was Sonia Gandhi, away at another communist-organised programme in Beijing  a happy rather than a sad occasion  where she was seen waving to the Indian contingent at the Olympics march past.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, however, told the assembly that Sonia had instructed him to join this congregation to express our (the Congresss) homage to this great leader.        
	The clue to the gatherings character  the DMK and the MDMK sat cheek by jowl  lay in the motif that ran through the speeches. Every leader, including Singh and Mukherjee, saluted Surjeet as a great, perhaps the greatest, Indian coalition-builder.        
	Singh made it a point to refer to him as Sardar Surjeet and not Comrade, the honorific used by the rest. The gravitas didnt allow anything overtly political but the Prime Minister couldnt help what seemed to be a barb or two at Karat.        
	I may have differences with the Left parties but on social justice our futures stand united. That was the burning desire of Sardar Surjeets life but he was aware of the political compulsions. He was willing to take a pragmatic view to take (along) people of different persuasions to take forward the social justice movement, Singh said.        
	Blessed is the land in which people of Sardar Surjeets calibre are born. May his tribe flourish for ever and for ever.        
	Mukherjee said Surjeet was a visionary who, in the 1990s, had anticipated Chinas rise as a great power.        
	With the dismantling of the Soviet system, he recognised the meaning of having a forum in which India, Russia and China can work together, Mukherjee said.

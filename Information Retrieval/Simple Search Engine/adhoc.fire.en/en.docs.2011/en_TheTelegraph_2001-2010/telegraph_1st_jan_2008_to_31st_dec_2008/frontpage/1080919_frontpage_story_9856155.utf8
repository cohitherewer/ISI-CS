	Ranchi, Sept. 18: The Jharkhand government today appointed senior lawyer Prakash Kishore Prasad as the new advocate-general of the state, breaking weeks of tense speculation.         
	Prasad took over the office after the incumbent S.B. Gadodia resigned, following a diktat from Governor Syed Sibtey Razi.         
	Though Gadodia had lobbied hard to keep his post, Soren decided not to yield to the pressure exerted by some of the ministers, including Stephen Marandi and Bandhu Tirkey.         
	I hope to live up to the expectations of the high office of the advocate-general. The advocate-general is the first member of the Bar and I am aware of my responsibilities. With my team of government advocates and pleaders, I will help in dispose of cases fairly and respect orders of the bench, Prasad said.        
	Prasad, an alumni of the Chotanagpur Law College in Ranchi, began his practice as a counsel in 1981 in the then Ranchi bench of Patna High Court and was groomed under the guidance of Supreme Court judge S.B. Sinha.        
	Prasad also discharged his duties as a senior standing counsel of the central government and the state government. Prasad has been in the legal profession for more than 27 years and has a wide experience in the field of civil, constitutional and criminal law.        
	The senior lawyer also has been asked to assist several prestigious organisations, such as Central Coalfields Limited, Steel Authority of India, Tata Group of companies and Ranchi Municipal Corporation among others.        
	He happens to be the fourth advocate-general of the state after M.M. Banerjee, Anil Kumar Sinha and S.B. Gadodia. After his appointment was declared in the high court in the afternoon, Prasad met Jharkhand Chief Justice Gyan Sudha Misra.         
	Prasad has assured to fully co-operate with the government, comply with the court directives and uphold the justice system under all circumstances.

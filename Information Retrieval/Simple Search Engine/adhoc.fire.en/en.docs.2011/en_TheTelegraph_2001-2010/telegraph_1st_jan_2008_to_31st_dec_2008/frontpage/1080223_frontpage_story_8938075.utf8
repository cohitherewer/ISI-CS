  - Abductions amp; allegations on election eve          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Agartala, Feb. 22: The Election Commissions plans for a model poll in Tripura tomorrow could be spoiled by an explosion of terror, both militant and political.         
	As the two rival formations  the Left Front minus the Forward Bloc and the Congress and its two allies  played mind and muscle games, militants entered the poll frame last night by abducting four CPM men, including a relative and polling agent of party candidate Nirajoy Tripura.        
	Police said the Borok National Council of Tripura was responsible for the abductions from Natinmanu, a remote village in Chhawmanu constituency.         
	The Congress and its allies, the Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra and the Party for Democratic Socialism, accused the ruling CPM of displaying pretty much the same predatory instincts. The Opposition alliance said CPM cadres were spreading political terror in constituencies across the state.         
	The Congress candidate for the Panisagar seat in North Tripura, Radhika Ranjan Das, was assaulted yesterday by five men suspected to be CPM members. The police have arrested one of them, Jayanta Purkayastha.        
	The CPM has launched a terror campaign, intimidating voters and threatening them with dire consequences if they queue up to cast their votes tomorrow, Union minister and AICC general secretary Prithviraj Chauhan told the media today.        
	He said many of the steps promised by the Election Commission like air surveillance and flag march by paramilitary forces in all constituencies remained unfulfilled. We have made hundreds of complaints to the Election Commission and now we can only hope that people will be able to vote freely and fearlessly tomorrow to democratically unseat the Left Front.        
	As many as 43,000 paramilitary personnel will be deployed in the 2,391 polling booths.         
	The number of candidates in the fray for the 60 Assembly seats at stake is 313.         
	The presence of 31 women among them is 3 per cent higher than the national average of seven.         
	The election department has insured each of the requisitioned personnel for Rs 2 lakh each. Seven polling officials and 16 paramilitary jawans will be on duty in the Jampui Jala Colony booth under Takarjala constituency for a mere four registered voters. The booth has been notified as one of the 108 very very vunerable polling stations.

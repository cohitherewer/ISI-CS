  - IT WAS JUST A SPECIAL DAY                                Jenna Bush exchanges wedding vows with Henry Hager (right) as priest Kirbyjohn Caldwell looks on in Crawford, Texas. (AP)                                  
	President Bush spent months joking about being a father of the bride, but yesterday he was downright wistful about giving his daughter Jenna away to her longtime beau.        
	Our little girl, Jenna, married a really good guy, Henry Hager, Bush said, standing next to Laura Bush at an airport in Waco where he boarded Air Force One for his flight back to Washington. The wedding was spectacular. Its just  its all we could have hoped for.        
	Unlike other first family weddings that have been broadcast live, the Bushes did not share their daughters nuptials with the nation. The day after, however, they briefly shared their joy.        
	The weather cooperated nicely, Bush said about the wedding at his 1,600-acre Texas ranch. Just as the vows were exchanged, the sun set over our lake and it was just a special day and a wonderful day and were mighty blessed.        
	A reporter asked the President if he had been up late partying. Bush winked, then turned towards the plane, ignoring a second question about whether the wedding had given the slumping US economy a boost.        
	In recent days, the White House has dribbled out details about the brides dress, the ring, the wedding attire and pre-wedding events. It was part of a carefully orchestrated communications strategy to disclose bits of information.        
	But it was not a complete media blackout. On Sunday, while it disclosed no more details, the White House released 11 photos of the affair at Bushs Prairie Chapel Ranch. Former President George H.W. Bush, who did a reading during the ceremony with former First Lady Barbara Bush, walked back to the press section of the plane, but would not reveal any details. Bush senior said he dutifully replied Yes sir! when he was told not to disclose details.        
	A White House official confirmed by email today that Jenna and Henry, the son of the chairman of the Republican Party in Virginia, had been officially hitched. The post-wedding party ensued. The more than 200 family and friends were entertained by the Tyrone Smith Revue, a 10-piece party band from Nashville, Tennessee. At Tricia Nixons White House wedding in 1971, President Nixon and his daughter danced to Thank Heaven for Little Girls. Bush and Jenna glided across the dance floor to You are so Beautiful  a ballad made famous by Joe Cocker.

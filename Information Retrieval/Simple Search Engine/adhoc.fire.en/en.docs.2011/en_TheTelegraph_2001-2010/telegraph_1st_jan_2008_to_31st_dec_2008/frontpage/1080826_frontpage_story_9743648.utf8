          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                            Chiranjeevi                                  
	Tirupati, Aug. 25: Tomorrow at Tirupati, actor Chiranjeevi will be Idol No. 1.         
	The Telugu stars launch of his political party at the Avilala grounds, 20km from the pilgrim town, is expected to attract at least five lakh people, 10 times the average daily arrivals at the temple.        
	Over 2,500 buses and 30-odd special trains have been booked from small and big towns, and some 5,000 tents and 200 dormitories set up for those who choose to spend the night.        
	Public expectations have gone through the roof, reminiscent of the time another film icon, N.T. Rama Rao, launched the Telugu Desam Party a quarter of a century ago.         
	A girl in a group of college-goers from Anantpur and Khammam districts said: We are glad that Chiru has decided to enter politics. We are confident he will weed out corruption from society like he does in his films.        
	Three film units and 2,500 NGO volunteers are overseeing arrangements for the launch. Five film cameramen will shoot the event, part of it from two chartered helicopters, amid a dazzle of special effects designed by Chennai and Bollywood technicians.        
	A signature song composed by music directors from Chennai and Hyderabad will play in the background. A huge digital screen will show the name and the flag of the new party while 25-odd plasma screens bring the actor-politician closer to the audience.        
	About 2,500 policemen and 50 armed guards from a private security firm will guard against stampedes. Chiranjeevi has told his associates to ensure there are no deaths, injuries or accidents at the rally, a source close to the actor said.        
	Chiranjeevis maiden political speech, spelling out his pro-people policies, has been prepared by his mentor Amit Mitra, nephew of late Marxist ideologue P. Sundaraiah, and a team of journalists and political scientists, who have also drafted the partys constitution.        
	Our focus will be on the common man but youll get to see how different well be in our approach, promised Allu Aravind, the actors brother-in-law.

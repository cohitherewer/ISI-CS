  - US, Hyderabad firms await final nod from govt        AMIT GUPTA                                    
	Ranchi, May 18: The state government is making a habit of announcing ambitious projects and then not implementing them.        
	If Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) tenders for building houses for the urban poor is yet to be floated, the grandiose idea of framing master plans for Ranchi and Dhanbad is hanging fire even though the Ranchi Regional Development Authority (RRDA) has awarded the jobs to US-based consultants Global Superior and Hyderabad-based Specs Systems for the respective cities.        
	All it now needs is a final nod from the state urban development department. But that hasnt happened for the last two months.         
	Ask urban development minister Harinarayan Rai and hes surprised. During the last review meeting, he claimed, he had directed officials to give the nod at the earliest. I will ensure that the preparation of the master plan for Ranchi and Dhanbad takes place soon, Rai said.        
	The master plans for the cities would look at a comprehensive development model, chalk out land-use patterns and include transportation plans. Once ready, the plan documents would form the basis of development in the next 20 years.         
	The work is estimated to cost over Rs 5 crore and expected to take at least a year and a half. The work to prepare the plans couldnt be started. We are awaiting a nod from the urban development department before issuing work orders, said RRDA vice-chairman Maheshwar Prasad Mishra.        
	The master plan would ultimately pave the way for giving shape to Greater Ranchi, the much-touted new state capital the government wants to build over 700 hectares in Kanke and Sukurhutu areas.        
	Urban development secretary Shailesh Kumar Singh said that the master plan file is at the final stage of approval.        
	Greater Ranchi would house all government machinery including a new state Assembly building, a state secretariat, and residential quarters for ministers and government officials among others.        
	Chief minister Madhu Koda has announced the formation of a Greater Ranchi Development Authority that would handle the project. But so far, the authority is a virtual non-entity.         
	According to urban development secretary Shailesh Kumar Singh, the Greater Ranchi Development Authority  he has been named its managing director  was entrusted with two tasks. One, to implement the Greater Ranchi project and two, to act as state-level nodal agency for the JNNURM. Former Mecon official Ravi Rath has been appointed director (technical).         
	This is absurd. The master plan of a city gets prepared after deciding on the new state capital. It should be the other way round, the master plan should decide the locations  the institutional area, residential area, commercial area  for a new state capital, said Ajay Khare, the head of architecture department at BIT, Mesra.         
	We have been hearing about a master plan and Greater Ranchi since 2000. Nothing has moved since then as the state government isnt motivated at all, added the professor, who has been part of several meetings regarding the master plan.

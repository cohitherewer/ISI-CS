	New Delhi (Reuters): A bomb ripped through a crowded market in New Delhi on Saturday, killing one person and wounding 15 others, police said.              
	 quot;We heard one boy was killed, quot; said Rajan Bhagat, a spokesman of Delhi Police, who later confirmed the blast was caused by a bomb.              
	 quot;We are examining witnesses who saw two men throw a piece of plastic bag from a motorcycle. That caused the blast. quot;              
	TV stations said the blast was of a low intensity and occurred in a flower market in a south Delhi neighbourhood.              
	 quot;I saw a boy pick up a tiffin box from the road, and suddenly there was a big explosion, quot; a witness told private news channel. quot;His head was ripped off. quot;              
	TV images showed a crater on the road. Police cordoned off the blast site. Many people, including wailing women, tried to break through the cordon.              
	People were seen walking in blood-stained shirts. Locals carried the injured to hospital.              
	Police said they were evacuating people from all major markets in the city.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Police and military on Basus lips
  - CPM leaders clarify stand          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, June 20: Jyoti Basu today said police and military may be needed to keep the work going in Darjeeling but CPM leaders clarified that the stand was not at variance with the Bengal governments conciliatory approach.        
	The Morcha leaders did not attend the bipartite meeting that Buddha (chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee) had called. What else can be done? If necessary, the police and military may be needed to keep the work going, said Basu after emerging from the partys state secretariat meeting at Alimuddin Street.        
	The former chief minister, however, said the state government would definitely participate in a tripartite meeting with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha if the Centre called one. Bimal Gurungs party had turned twice down the offer for bipartite discussions and said it would join the talks table only if the call came from Delhi.         
	Although nobody is quite sure what Basu meant when he said police and the military, there are guesses galore especially since the current chief minister has been insisting that force would not be used to break the indefinite bandh called by the Morcha in the hills.         
	At the end of an all-party meeting  the Trinamul Congress and the SUCI had stayed away  on Tuesday, Bhattacharjee had stressed the need for a political solution through a sustained dialogue with patience and tolerance. Bhattacharjee had even said: Policing wont help, only a political solution would. We dont want to invite any confrontation.        
	In such a situation, sources in the party gave different interpretations of what Basu had meant, all of which indicated that the former chief minister did not suggest the use of force against the Morcha.                                
	Some party leaders said like Bhattacharjee, Basu, too, does not want any confrontation with the Morcha leaders. What he basically meant was that the police or the military might be required to keep the supply lines to the hills open to mitigate the sufferings of the people, a party leader said. After all, how long can the people survive without any supplies.        
	The CPM leader said after Basus experience with the GNLF in the eighties when violence ruled the hills, the veteran leader would hardly want another ugly chapter to be reopened in Darjeeling.        
	We are certain that as much as the government, Basu, too, wants peace in the hills. This cannot be achieved through use of force by either the police or the military, the leader said. He basically meant that supplies should reach the hills if and when required.        
	Party sources also said Basu may have meant that only if there are law and order problems should the police and military be used to bring the situation under control.        
	Maintaining peace is the job of the police, another CPM leader said. So, obviously, it is hardly surprising if they are asked to do their job.        
	This is a view that was echoed by CPM secretariat member Benoy Konar as well. The administration will have to intervene if the law and order problem crops up during Morchas indefinite bandh, Konar said.         
	He added that Darjeeling was not discussed in todays state secretariat meeting.

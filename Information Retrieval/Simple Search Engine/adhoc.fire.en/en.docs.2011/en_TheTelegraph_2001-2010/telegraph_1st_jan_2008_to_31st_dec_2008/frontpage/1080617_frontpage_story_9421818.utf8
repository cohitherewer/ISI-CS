	Dhanbad, June 16: Naxalites today attempted to blow up a small bridge, about 20km from here, near Kolhar More on the Tundi-Giridih road.        
	The blast around 1am damaged a portion of the bridge, though it did not hamper traffic for long. Flow of vehicles was affected for some time in the morning.        
	A team of Tundi police reached the spot around 7am and said the rebels had used can bombs. Traffic movement was not affected but the road was damaged, the police said.        
	Law-enforcers connected the blast to two reasons: the Maoist bandh today in North Chhotanagpur to protest against the killing of their comrades and JVM chief Babulal Marandis visit to Tundi to address an Assembly workers committee meeting at Tundi high school today.        
	Around 1pm, Marandi arrived in Tundi from Bokaro via Dhanbad and left for Ranchi at 4pm. Over 1,500 JVM workers from Topchanchi and Baghmara welcomed their party chief.        
	Two persons, including a child, were injured when the Giridih police fired at the Naxalites at Gohar, 90km from Giridih. The Naxalites had blocked the Giridih-Hazaribagh road at Gohar.         
	Giridih district police chief Murali Lal Meena said that as the police fired at the place of the roadblock in poor visibility during evening hours, the two victims were hit. However, the victims were yet to be referred to a hospital. The police had reached Gohar late this evening after getting information about the Maoist roadblock.         
	After bomb blast in Tundi, the police have intensified long-range patrolling.

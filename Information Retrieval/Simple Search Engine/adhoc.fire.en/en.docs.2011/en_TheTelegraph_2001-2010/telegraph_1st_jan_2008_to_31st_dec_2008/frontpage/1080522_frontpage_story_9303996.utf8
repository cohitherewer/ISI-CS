	Jamui, May 21: A joint team of district police and Special Task Force arrested 80 Naxalites from Jamui district in Bihar late last evening.         
	The police also claimed that they had foiled plans of possible future attacks, though they failed to arrest self-styled Maoist zonal commander Kundan Da.        
	Out of the 80 rebels, there are a few heavyweights who were allegedly held from the Khaira forest area.         
	While Jamui superintendent of police Vinay Kumar said 98 people were arrested, of which 95 were confirmed Naxalites, after interrogation the number came down to 80, that included 15 women.         
	Inspector-general (operations) S.K. Bhardwaj also concurred in the figures and said the arrests were made while the cadre were being trained at a makeshift camp deep in the Khaira forests, some 200km from Patna. Bhardwaj explained the joint operation was conducted with a surge in rebel activities in Jamui with five railway policemen being killed in Jhajha railway station on April 13.         
	Kumar, who was part of the combing team, said 150 people were detained during the raid and were later released after interrogation. One Prakash Das, who is suspected to be involved in the murder of former Munger superintendent of police K. Surendrababu, was also arrested last night.         
	Bhardwaj explained the police had chalked out strategies to raid possible Naxalite hideouts, mostly located in the hills and jungles near Munger and Jamui. The STF has and would be co-ordinating with the police in Gaya, Jehanabad, Aurangabad, Jamui, Sitamarhi and Muzaffarpur during the combing operations.        
	Police sources report that interrogations have exposed six to seven training camps that were being run undercover in the dense forests, where newly recruited cadre were usually taken.         
	Zonal commander Kundan Da had arrived in Debudehi to address a public meeting and other leaders had also followed when the police conducted the raid, admitted an officer on condition of anonymity.         
	The police recovered Naxalite literature, posters and handbills, microphone sets, one generator set and CDs during the raid. But no arms or ammunitions were seized as Kundan Da allegedly managed to escape with the arms.         
	The police have also blamed villagers for making it easy for the rebels to escape.        
	The raids, at least the planning for it, started in the morning when the police received a tip-off that armed rebel squads had been spotted near Magobanda village under Khaira police stations. In the evening police teams surrounded the village but failed to arrest anyone there.        
	Allegedly, Jamui MLA Abhay Kumar was also present at the village attending a ceremony.        
	Deputy inspector-general of police (Munger) Monohar Prasad said that the rebels had assembled to address a meeting there under the banned outfit  Bidi Majdoor Sangharsh Samiti. Prasad said the polices prompt action prevented some major untoward incidents in the area. Jhajha circle inspector Mohammed Shahid Akhtar said the rebels had forced villagers to attend the meeting.         
	Sono and Batiya valley are is fast becoming a safe zones for Naxalites. Before planning any big hit, rebels assemble here and hold meetings, said an officer of the intelligence bureau.

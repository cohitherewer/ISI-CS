The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Blackmail plot goes wrong
                                                                                                           Blackmail plot goes wrong
          A STAFF REPORTER                            Gupta                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 16: A blackmail plot gone awry killed Rakesh Gupta, the 40-year-old found in a gunny bag in Sodepur, police said today.        
	The blackmailers, who strangled Gupta to keep him from going to the police, were led by a smart and handsome young man whom the victim had first met six months ago at a mall, officers said.        
	Gupta had of late developed certain homosexual tendencies and that is how he met Shibu. They became very close friends, North 24-Parganas police chief Supratim Sarkar said.         
	Shibu planned to cash in on Guptas sexual preferences and blackmail him, Sarkar added.         
	The 28-year-old, a Sodepur resident, drafted two friends  Chandan Basu, 25, and Jeet alias Mithun Ghosh, 23  to help him. Shibu already faced attempt-to-murder and extortion cases; Chandan and Jeet, too, had shady backgrounds, Sarkar said.        
	Chandans arrest yesterday from his in-laws place in Gobordanga blew the lid off the mystery. We were tracking criminals who had left their homes after the murder. Using underworld sources, we eliminated a few and targeted Chandan. He broke down and confessed, Sarkar said.         
	His men found Jeet already in custody, at Khardah police station, in connection with a theft. They then picked up two women: Laxmi Chakrabarty, 35, said to be Chandans paramour, and her sister-in-law Phulmoni Chakrabarty, 45.        
	The four, charged with murder and trying to do away with evidence, have got four days police remand. The police are looking for Shibu and the driver of the Tata-407 used to get rid of the body.        
	Gupta, a Teghoria resident, had taken a cab to the airport on Sunday afternoon to see off his mother. On his way back, he got a call from Shibu to meet him at Dum Dum station.        
	Shibu enticed him to a house in New Barrackpore for a few hours of fun. The house belongs to Laxmis brother Basu, a goon who once terrorised Baguiati, Sarkar said. Other than Phulmoni, the rest of the gang was there.        
	Gupta was told there would be CDs and blue films. But soon, the gang demanded money, threatening to reveal his homosexual activities.        
	When Gupta refused to pay up or hand over his ATM card, there was a scuffle.        
	The gang realised Gupta could go to the police and strangled him with a handkerchief, Sarkar said. They then hired the Tata-407 and went to Ultadanga, where they met Phulmoni and took her help to get the gunny bag and nylon ropes to tie the body up.

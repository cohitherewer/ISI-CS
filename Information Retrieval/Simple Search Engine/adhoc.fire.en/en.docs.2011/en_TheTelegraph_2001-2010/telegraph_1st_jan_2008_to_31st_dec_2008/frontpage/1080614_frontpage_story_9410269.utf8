          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Rahul Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, June 13: Rahul Gandhis experiment to democratise the Congress will start from Uttar Pradesh, where the district and block units will be involved in selecting the Lok Sabha candidates.        
	Rahuls radical concepts aim to make the command structure more flexible in a party where power is concentrated in the hands of the president and her team of advisers.        
	Sources said the idea was to end the practice of candidates names being finalised in the state capitals and Delhi, and the district and block presidents being presented with a fait accompli.        
	Rahul, they said, also wants an end to the tradition of the local committees being at loggerheads with the poll candidates from their constituencies. Ideally, the sources added, the state and the central leaderships should intervene only to resolve conflict.        
	If the new scheme proves effective in Uttar Pradesh, it will be replicated in other states.        
	At a June 2-4 meeting in Lucknow, the Uttar Pradesh Congress discussed the schemes implementation in the states central and east-central regions. Coincidence or not, Amethi and Rae Bareli, the constituencies of Rahul and Sonia Gandhi, fall in this belt.        
	The district and block units (those that have not gone defunct) have been told to shortlist their candidates and send them to state Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi.        
	It has been broadly decided that while the sitting MPs and the runners-up (from 2004) would be re-nominated, those who came third and fourth would be replaced.        
	Rahul also wants to set up booth-level units whose workers would have as much say in decision-making as their leaders at the district and block levels.        
	He recognises their importance in an election because they get the nuts and bolts in place, from ensuring that the list carries the names of the voters to organising their identity cards and ferrying them to the booths, a source said.        
	It was Jawaharlal Nehru who had come up with the concept of 10 workers for every booth, but down the years the Congress got more and more obsessed with high command politics.        
	Sonia and Rahul have made it clear that apart from being given a role in candidate selection, the local units must be revamped. The party is assessing how many district and block units are defunct and need to be reconstituted.        
	Rahul and Sonia have laid it down that the new committees must accommodate every caste, burying the notion that the Congress continued to be a party of the Brahmins.        
	After the June 2-4 Lucknow meeting, which Rahul and Sonia did not attend. the Congress held another in Delhi this evening to draw up a similar checklist for western Uttar Pradesh.        
	The process is expected to be completed by the end of July, and the first list of candidates may be announced in August.

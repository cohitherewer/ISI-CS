The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Quota but skimmed   Creamy layer thrown out 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Quota but skimmed     -  Creamy layer thrown out 
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                                    
	New Delhi, April 10: The Other Backward Classes education quota comes into effect from the 2008-09 academic year, but the creamy layer is out of it.        
	The Supreme Court today upheld the constitutional validity of the 27 per cent reservation for the group in central educational institutions. However, for the first two years at least, the OBCs are likely to get less than 27 per cent reservation with the Centre deciding to stagger its implementation over three years.        
	The Centre will increase seats at the affected institutions by 54 per cent (so that the number of general category seats does not fall) gradually over three years, and the full OBC quota will apply only at the end of the process.        
	It hasnt been confirmed if the seat hike starts from 2008-09, so the wait for the full quota could possibly be longer than two years.        
	The court verdict, which exempted minority institutions from the new reservation, is expected to delay admissions to the Indian Institutes of Management by at least a week this year.        
	The IIMs have put off releasing their final lists of selected candidates, which were expected tomorrow, since they must now prepare separate lists for general and OBC students, based on different cutoff marks.        
	We have been tense and the delay will prolong our agony. They could have gone ahead with the general list, said Calcutta-based software professional Tanshuman Das, 23, who has received calls from IIMs Bangalore, Indore and Kozhikode.        
	In deciding who makes up the creamy layer, the court went largely by the existing list drawn up to exclude the well-off from the 27 per cent OBC quota in government jobs.        
	But one of the five judges made an appeal to Parliament: please include the children of MPs and MLAs on the creamy layer list.        
	The court ruled that the quota was constitutionally valid because the OBCs had not been determined solely on the basis of caste but also educational backwardness (the list is the same as that for the OBC job quota).        
	If caste and other considerations are taken into account for determining backwardness, it cannot be said to be violative of Article 15(1) (right against discrimination) of the Constitution, the constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, said.        
	The court rejected as not a legally acceptable plea the argument that the quota was merely meant to please a section of the community and win votes.        
	The list of OBCs can be challenged in court, the bench said. It clarified that the concept of creamy layer would not apply to the SCs and STs.        
	But it did not rule on whether the new quota could be imposed on private, unaided institutions, though one of the judges observed that such a move would be unconstitutional.        
	The court asked the Centre to review the quota every five years to find out if it was benefiting the targeted groups.        
	Three of the judges said the country needed to gradually shift towards reservation based on economic criteria, for that was the way towards a casteless, classless society.        
	The government had got the Constitution amended, with the support of all parties, to enable the quota to be introduced. The move was challenged by individuals, students groups and NGOs, such as the AIIMS Resident Doctors Association, Youth for Equality, the All India Equity Forum and Citizens for Equality.        
	The court said the Centre wasnt giving enough importance to primary and secondary education among the backward classes.

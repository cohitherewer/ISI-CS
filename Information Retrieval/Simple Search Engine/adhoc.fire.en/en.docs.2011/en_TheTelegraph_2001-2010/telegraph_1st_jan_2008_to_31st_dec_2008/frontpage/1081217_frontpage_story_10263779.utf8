	New Delhi, Dec. 16: Moisture brought in by winds during a relatively warm winter is contributing to the fog over Calcutta and other parts of eastern India over the past two days, weather scientists said today, predicting another fog cycle in the near future.         
	The fog threw flight and rail schedules haywire for the second day on Tuesday (see Metro).        
	In the 45 days since the beginning of November, Calcutta recorded normal minimum temperature only on three days. On all other days, temperatures ranged between 2C and 6C above the normal for winter days.         
	Remnants of eastward-moving low pressure systems  also called western disturbances  over northern and eastern India had drawn wind from the Bay of Bengal over the land, raising temperatures and adding moisture.         
	As the disturbances have now moved away and temperatures are lower than earlier, the excess moisture is precipitating as fog, Asish Kumar Sen, a meteorologist at the India Meteorological Department, Calcutta, said.         
	The temperature today is only 2C above normal, Sen said. The colder and drier it gets, the lower the chance of fog formation. Parts of Orissa and Jharkhand also reported some fog, but it has been transient, dispersing within 30 to 90 minutes, he said.         
	If a new western disturbance now over north-western India moves eastward into Bihar and northern Bengal, the temperatures could again rise and start a fresh fog cycle in eastern India, IMD scientists said.         
	Fog conditions have steadily worsened in India over the past three decades.         
	Airports across northern India that used to report about seven days of poor visibility between December and February during the 1970s were reporting about 60 days of poor visibility during the 1990s.         
	The IMD has also predicted fog and visibility reduced to 200m over the Delhi region from about 4.30am on Wednesday but a scientist said it is expected to last only a short while.         
	Scientists also believe that greater levels of vegetation and tree canopy are contributing to fog across northern India.         
	Around 20 flights were delayed for departure from Calcutta since late last night while 11 flights had to be diverted as visibility had dipped below 350m, a situation when category-II instrument landing systems cannot function. The first flight could take off from Calcutta at 8.10am and flights were delayed by two hours on an average.         
	Thirteen city-bound long-distance trains were delayed by several hours.

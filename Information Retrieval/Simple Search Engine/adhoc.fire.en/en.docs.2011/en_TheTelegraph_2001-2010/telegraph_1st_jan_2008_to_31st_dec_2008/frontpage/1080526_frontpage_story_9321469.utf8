  - Gogoi aspires to live up to sobriquet          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Guwahati, May 25: Dispur today announced a Rs 1,500-crore development package for the state to be implemented over the next three years, the benefits of which will touch all sections of society.        
	The announcement was made by chief minister Tarun Gogoi at a function at Judges Field to celebrate the completion of his governments two years in office.        
	Gogoi, flanked by party heavyweights, announced that a state Pay Commission would be constituted on June 1 to look into the grievances of the state employees. Till then, he said, an interim relief of 10 per cent of basic pay would be given to the employees. For this, the state exchequer will have to shoulder an additional burden of Rs 344 crore.        
	The announcement by Gogoi came minutes after his party colleagues coined the sobriquet  the architect of modern Assam  to describe him.        
	PCC chief Bhubaneswar Kalita and education minister Ripun Bora said Gogoi was the architect of modern Assam who, they claimed, has changed the face of the state.        
	Several Congress leaders present at the second anniversary celebration of the government linked the branding of the chief minister and the announcement of the sops to the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. They said an effort was on in the party to create a larger-than-life image of Gogoi and the sobriquet was part of the plan.        
	In an attempt to live up to the reputation, Gogoi even went to the extent of claiming that no chief minister in the state had ever done so much for the development of the state  especially in the education sector  as he did.        
	He justified the adulation by announcing a slew of schemes, packaged as Mukhya Mantrir Asom Bikash Yojana. The schemes would be implemented in the next three years, he added.        
	Most of the schemes that were announced today have been part of the governments plans for the last two years. A Congress leader even admitted that completing these in the next three years would be a Herculean task.        
	The highlight of the ambitious schemes was the creation of one lakh jobs in the government sector in the next three years and the creation of a corpus fund of Rs 5 crore for the higher education of meritorious students.         
	Apart from announcing a financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh to all educational institutions that have completed hundred years, Gogoi said scholarships to meritorious students would be extended to one lakh students from the current 50,000 students in the next three years. The amount of scholarship would be enhanced too, he added.        
	All the government-appointed gaonburas (village heads) will be given mobile phones to communicate with government officials for better administrative functioning, Gogoi said.        
	All pregnant women will be given Rs 1,000 so that they can afford nutritious food. The government will also open a fixed deposit of Rs 5,000 in the name of every girl child born in below poverty line families.

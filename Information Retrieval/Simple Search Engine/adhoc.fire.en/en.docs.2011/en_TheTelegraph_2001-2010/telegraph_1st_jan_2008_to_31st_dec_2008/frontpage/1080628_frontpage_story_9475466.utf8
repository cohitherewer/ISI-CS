          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Itanagar, June 27: Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Dorjee Khandu today said the arrest of a relative of Gegong Apang and two others, including a former NDFB militant, had led to the safe release of Apangs son Getam last night.         
	Getam and his companion Narain Rai were abducted from Itanagar on June 18.         
	Tahak Tatak, who is also a policeman, is a maternal uncle of Getam. The two others arrested were Tapiam Tali and Upen Basumatary, a former NDFB rebel.         
	The three were part of a rag-tag group that was believed to be behind the abduction. The motive was to collect ransom.         
	I must give credit to the security forces for the safe release of Getam Apang and Narain Rai, Khandu said.         
	The abducted men were taken somewhere inside the deep jungles in Sonitpur district, which has NDFB presence. The abductors had no option but to release the youths as intense pressure was mounted on them, Khandu said.         
	He said the security forces had cordoned off the border area of Sonitpur and Papum Pare districts of Arunachal Pradesh.         
	The chief minister said police had kept the arrest of three persons under wraps, as it would otherwise have hampered investigations. The three were arrested in Itanagar on June 21. Another accomplice, Romeo, an NDFB linkman, is absconding.         
	Tatak was working as a police constable at Itanagar police station. Both Tatak and Tali are from Pasighat West Assembly constituency, which is represented by Omak Apang, Gegong Apangs eldest son.         
	Both Apang and Rai recounted their ordeal as they were forced to march at gunpoint into the jungles of Sonitpur. We virtually lost hope. We never thought of seeing our families again as our abductors took us from Holongi checkgate deep into the jungles. At times they threatened to eliminate us.         
	When they feared a raid by the army, we feared that we would be caught in the crossfire. We found a glimmer of hope when one of the abductors talked about releasing us on June 25. We were held captive there for a day as at least 10 to 12 masked men stood guard. Some talked about their organisation, which comprised youths from all the states of the Northeast and even Bhutan.         
	They released us around 4.30pm yesterday after making us walk for hours to a point near Holongi, from where we walked to Holongi checkgate and entered the Arunachal border, Getam said.         
	On whether any ransom was paid, Gegong Apang said: I had made it clear to the abductors that I would not pay a penny. I decided not to succumb to any pressure. I was even prepared to face any eventuality.        
	The Apang household appeared relieved with Apangs wife Yadap, sons Omak, Oken and Jyani and daughter-in-law Audrey milling around.         
	Arunachal Citizens Right, an NGO, Arunachal Pradesh Womens Welfare Society and All Arunachal Pradesh Students Union, in a joint news meet today claimed that it was the collective effort of the three organisations, which mediated with Bodo Sahitya Sabha, All Bodo Students Union, All Bodo Womens Welfare Federation and All Bodo Womens Justice Forum that ensured the safe release of the hostages.

          MATTHEW MOORE                            Lincoln: Buttbuttinated                                  
	London, Sept. 2: President Abraham Lincoln was buttbuttinated by an armed buttailant after a life devoted to the reform of the US consbreastution.         
	Not an extract from an essay by a particularly poor history student, but a selection of the nonsense phrases created by automatic software designed to remove offensive words from articles posted on the Internet.         
	The phenomena, known as The Clbuttic Mistake after a mangling of the word classic that is believed to be the first identified instance of the problem, can be found on thousands of websites.         
	The error is caused by poorly programmed anti-obscenity filters  similar to spell checkers  that automatically replace words considered rude or offensive with more acceptable variants. Butt is replaced by ass, breast is substituted for tit, and so on.         
	Rudimentary versions of this software do not just replace obscene words, but also alter longer words which contain banned letter combinations, so assassination becomes buttbuttination, passenger becomes pbuttenger, and passerby becomes pbutterby.         
	The error appears particularly common on foreign sites hosting English-language articles, but a similar mistake on an American Christian news website caused international amusement earlier this year.         
	The American Family Association had programmed its filter to replace the word gay with homosexual, causing an article about sprinter Tyson Gays triumph at the US Olympic trials to begin: Tyson Homosexual was a blur in blue, sprinting 100 meters faster than anyone ever has. Further on in the piece the runner was referred to as the 25-year-old Homosexual.

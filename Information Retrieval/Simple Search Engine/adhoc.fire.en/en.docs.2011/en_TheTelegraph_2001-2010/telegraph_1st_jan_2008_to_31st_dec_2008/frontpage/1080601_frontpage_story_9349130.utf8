          OUR BUREAU                              
	Lucknow/Calcutta, May 31: IIT Kanpur student Toya Chatterjee had lied to her father saying she had passed her finals. She was horrified when he decided to come over from Calcutta to watch her receive her degree at todays convocation.        
	Last night, she hanged herself in her hostel room as Kunal Chatterjee, 65, waited for her to join him for dinner at the campus guesthouse.        
	The 22-year-old bio-engineering student from Tollygunge left a suicide note for her father: I lied to you; I wont be receiving my degree tomorrow. I cant show my face to you. Take care of mother. Forgive me if you can.        
	IIT sources said Toya got an F in two subjects: psychology and project paper.        
	She could have told her father the truth, it wouldnt have been a problem, said Prawal Sinha, dean of student affairs. She was to reappear in the two subjects. These are not difficult papers. She would have got the degree by July. It was just a matter of time.        
	Toya, an only child, had gone home to Chanditala Lane, Tollygunge, after her exams. When the results were announced on Wednesday, she told her parents she had passed.        
	I was overjoyed and insisted on attending the convocation. She grew very quiet after that, Kunal, a retired CESC employee, said.        
	After they arrived on the campus yesterday, Toya introduced Kunal, who had checked in at the guesthouse with many other parents, to all her batchmates. Then she left for her hostel.        
	When she failed to turn up for dinner as she had promised, Kunal informed IIT officials. They broke open the door around 10.30pm to find her hanging from the ceiling.        
	Toyas teachers said she had done well in all the other subjects. She became a victim of her lie, a teacher said.        
	Toya, who had topped her school Nava Nalanda in Madhyamik, planned to do her masters in bio-engineering. She was a cheerful, chirpy girl, said classmate Kirit Srivastava.        
	Her mother Ena, who teaches statistics at Ashutosh College, left for Kanpur today.        
	Toya was very mature and hardworking. She was a good student and wrote for the school magazine a lot, said Sita Ray, assistant headmistress at Nava Nalanda.

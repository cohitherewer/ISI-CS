	Calcutta, April 19: A Videocon warehouse in the heart of Salt Lakes Sector V caught fire this afternoon, putting the tech firms around it on edge.        
	Twenty-two fire engines took two hours to control the blaze that brought fire minister Pratim Chatterjee running to the citys IT hub. His colleague, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, also dropped by.        
	Some 20 employees were inside the Videocon Kitchen Appliances (India) Limited godown. No one was injured.        
	The godown had raw material for colour televisions and a stock of finished colour televisions. Although the loss is yet to be ascertained, it could be Rs 1-3 crore, a company representative said.        
	Firefighters said the warehouse was packed with inflammable material, including cardboard, thermocol, television components and TV sets. As a result, the blaze that started from where the thermocol was stacked swept across to the other end in no time.         
	Forensic experts will probe the cause of the fire. We will check if all firefighting norms were followed, Chatterjee said. Its time firefighting norms at highrises, malls and offices are strictly implemented.         
	The warehouse is in the sprawling Videocon Industries compound located near the IT park. Several IT companies have their offices behind it.         
	Company officials said 500-plus employees were in the compound when thick black fumes first appeared around 4pm. Some of the staff, who were outside, saw the fumes and raised the alarm.         
	The flames kept leaping with every passing minute and we felt it would soon spread to other offices. We could hear the picture tubes burst and it was very frightening, said Manas Mondal, an employee of Chembiotek, a pharma research company.        
	The 40,000sqft godown has concrete walls and a tin-and-fibre roof. As the flames leapt up, the fibre sheets melted and a part of the roof caved in. The area was cordoned off and senior police officers arrived to control the crowd.         
	We have to check if the firefighting system was up to the mark. We need to check how the fire licence was renewed without inviting fire officials for an inspection, said Gopal Bhattacharya, director-general of West Bengal Fire Services.

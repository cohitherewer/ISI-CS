	Bangalore, Nov. 22: A livid Mahendra Singh Dhoni today neither confirmed nor denied reports that he threatened to resign as captain after failing to retain R.P. Singh in the team for the fourth and fifth ODIs.        
	Dhoni said it was disgusting that selection meeting discussions were being leaked to the media. I dont know where the report came from. It cannot be a report. It is disgusting and disrespectful when what happens inside a meeting when the selectors, the captain and the coaches are there comes out.

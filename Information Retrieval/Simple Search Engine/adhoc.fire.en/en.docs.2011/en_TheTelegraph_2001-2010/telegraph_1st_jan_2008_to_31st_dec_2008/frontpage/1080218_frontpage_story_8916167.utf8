  - Combing operation to counter Naxalite attack        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 17: Retaliating to the Naxalites attack in Nayagarh last Friday, police killed 20 Maoists combing the Gasama forest in Ganjam district, bordering Nayagarh, since yesterday.        
	State home secretary T.K. Mishra told the reporters this evening that intense combing operation was on in Ganjam, Kandhamal, Gajapati and Rayagada, bordering Nayagarh.        
	At least 20 Maoists, including a few young women, had been killed in the anti-Naxalite operation, claimed the home secretary without confirming the number of bodies recovered from the site of operation.         
	Three policemen in the combing operation team also lost their lives during the exchange of fire, said Mishra.        
	The director-general of police (DGP), Gopal Chandra Nanda, said the deceased personnel included an assistant commandant of Special Operation Group and two jawans of the Orissa State Armed Police.         
	The operation will continue tonight till all the rebels are vanquished. I hope the operation will be over soon, the home secretary said.        
	DGP Nanda declined to give the details about the police personnel engaged in the operation, but confirmed several groups had been constituted to carry out the combing operation in the forest areas bordering Nayagarh.         
	The operation is being carried out jointly by the Central Reserve Protection Force, three units of Greyhound forces from Andhra Pradesh and the state police led by additional director-general (Operation) M.M. Praharaj.         
	Two Air Force helicopters have also been pressed into service to monitor the movement of personnel and overall supervision, said the state home secretary.        
	The 600 CRPF personnel deputed by the Centre have joined the ongoing combing operation, said inspector-general (Operation) S.S. Hansdah.        
	The inspector-general is co-ordinating the action from Bhanjanagar.         
	Hansdah said around 100 armed rebels, who are hiding in Kutuni hills and surrounding areas, had been encircled by the joint forces.         
	A senior police official said local residents had informed the police that they had seen around 15 bodies of extremists inside the forests. But the number of extremists killed in the operation could be higher, he added.         
	The police, however, could not recover more than 1,100 weapons that were looted by the rebels from the police armoury during the Friday nights operation.        
	Meanwhile, a central team headed by special secretary of Union home ministry M.L. Kumawat, who heads the national taskforce on Naxalites, arrived at Nayagarh to take stock of he situation.         
	He also discussed the issue with the state home secretary and senior police officials before leaving for Nayagarh.

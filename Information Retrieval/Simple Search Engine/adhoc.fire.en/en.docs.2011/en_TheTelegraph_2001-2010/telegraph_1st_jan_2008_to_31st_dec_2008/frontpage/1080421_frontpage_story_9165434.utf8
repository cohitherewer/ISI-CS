	Ranchi, April 20: Rahul Gandhi will begin his last leg of Discover India tour from Jharkhand on April 23 with the partys recovery campaign by mingling with tribal groups, eating rotis and assuring them that Congress hai naa.        
	He will visit Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh after Jharkhand.        
	National Youth Congress president Ashok Tanwar said over phone from Delhi that Rahul would be in Jharkhand on April 23. Let us see as how many days he stays in Jharkhand, he said. State Congress spokesman Alok Dubey said that Rahul would land here by a special flight. The next day, he would visit Ulihatu, the birthplace of tribal icon Birsa Munda, in Khuti, about 60km from Ranchi.        
	The AICC general secretary would also visit Chaibasa and Simdega. After a meeting with Tana Bhagats in Gumla, he would return the same evening.        
	Though both the leaders refused to give details about the April 23 programme of Rahul, a highly placed source added that the young Gandhi would take a visit to Santhal Pargana, the principal vote bank of Shibu Sorens JMM, soon after he lands in Ranchi. He will devote a day to the Santhal Pargana by meeting various tribal groups, the source said.        
	He is also likely to make unscheduled visits to several places to get a first-hand account of the various welfare activities carried out by the state government with huge funds from the Union government.         
	Jitendra Singh, the AICC secretary and central in charge of Youth Congress, Youth Congress chief Ashok Tanwar, AICC secretary in charge of NSUI Meenakshi Natarajan and other state leaders would accompany him during the visit. According to Congress leaders, Rahul would take the Forest Rights Act as a weapon to empower the tribals.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	Ranchi, Oct. 14: Ever since he took over as chief minister over a month-and-a-half ago, Shibu Soren has been busy  he has either been travelling across the state on a perpetual ribbon-cutting exercise or has been waiting in New Delhi for an audience with UPA chief Sonia Gandhi.        
	So much so that ministers who were so used to travelling by the state chopper during Madhu Kodas tenure have been reduced to a whining lot. Invariably, the chopper has remained booked either for the chief minister or for security forces, pointed out a civil aviation department official.         
	Sorens many destinations during this time included his hometown of Bokaro, Dumka, Garhwa and even Jamshedpur, where he inaugurated various programmes official or otherwise.        
	Apart from that, not much has happened in the state for which the new chief minister can be proud of. In fact, even deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi agreed it was time Guruji settled down in his office and began work in right earnest to get the state back on track.         
	Marandi added bluntly that the government was still groping in the dark. We should begin work to send a message to the public that we mean business, he said.        
	Soren, he pointed out, held two crucial portfolios of power and roads. There is an urgent need to closely monitor road construction as well as power generation. The roads department has utilised only Rs 30 crore out of the Rs 630 crore of the annual budget, he said. Soren has spent the last 40-odd days in speeches. In fact, he is yet to begin governance in the true sense, merely issuing statements and making promises, another minister pointed out.        
	Soon after assuming office, Soren stayed away from Jharkhand for a week. He was in New Delhi, where he met senior UPA leaders on a thanksgiving mission, and Chhattisgarh where he attended a tribal rally.        
	In between, he also had to appear in courts in Giridih and Sahibganj in connection with two pending cases  one, a murder case of April 1973 and the other concerning an alleged poll code violation.        
	In one of his first speeches after becoming chief minister on August 27, Soren issued a stern warning to government officials on the need to strengthen the public distribution system. But he is yet to conduct a review of the PDS system himself. He also vowed to hold a janata durbar every Monday. But after the first one on September 15, he is yet to find time for another. As for Cabinet meetings, he has held only three, two of which were mere formalities.         
	Soren has also upset industrialists no end by declaring that he intended to review the states resettlement and rehabilitation policy, which was cleared after an arduous delay by the Madhu Koda government.         
	The timing couldnt have been worse as investors are particularly peeved with the state government for its inaction in matters pertaining to land acquisition for mega projects  the assault on land surveyors of Bhushan Steel in Potka block acting as a pointer to what might be in store for those looking at investing in Jharkhand.        
	His stand on the R amp;R policy has upset Koda no less. How can he talk like that when he was present throughout the meeting of the UPA that cleared the R amp;R policy? Koda said adding that projects initiated by his government needed to be speeded up.        
	Understandably, allies like the Congress and the RJD were muted in their views on Soren. He is using the chief ministerial position as an image-building exercise and to shore up JMMs stock, pointed out a sulking Congress leader. Soren is a mass leader and you cannot expect him to always sit in the office to clear files, reasoned senior RJD legislator Girinath Singh. We can only hope that Guruji does not shirk his responsibility, he said.        
	 The chief ministers political adviser Ajit Kumar, however, said it was wrong to say that Soren wasnt paying attention to development work. His main focus is on development of integrated farming, he said in his bosss defence.

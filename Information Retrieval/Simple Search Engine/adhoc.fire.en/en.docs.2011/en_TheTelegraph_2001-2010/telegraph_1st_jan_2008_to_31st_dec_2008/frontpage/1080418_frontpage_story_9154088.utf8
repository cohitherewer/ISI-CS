          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 17: In Bengal, even the Election Commission gives right of way to bandhs.        
	The state poll panel today extended by a day the last date for withdrawal of nomination papers for the first two phases of the panchayat elections on May 11 and 14, removing a roadblock before Mamata Banerjees 12-hour shutdown on April 21.        
	The Trinamul Congress was in two minds whether to go ahead with the Monday shutdown against price rise as it would have stood in the way of the poll process. The last day for withdrawing nominations assumes significance because of an undeclared reason: this is when deals are struck and some candidates drop out to ensure votes are not split.        
	However, with the Election Commission thoughtfully giving more time, Mamata is now certain to press ahead with the bandh.         
	But the Election Commission said it had its own reasons to defer the deadline. April 21 was also scheduled for scrutiny of nomination papers for the third phase of polls on May 18.        
	If you please, you may call it the poll panels support to the bandh. Its your way of looking at things. But it is our duty to ensure that candidates of political parties can withdraw their nomination papers without any trouble, state election commissioner Ashok Gupta said.        
	Besides, I must see to it that my officials can carry out the scrutiny of nomination papers for the third phase of the polls. As both the withdrawal of nomination papers and the scrutiny of nomination papers for the third phase fall on April 21, the day on which a Bangla bandh has been called, I was left with no option other than to extend the date by a day, he added.        
	However, in its zeal to help candidates, the Election Commission seems to have unwittingly given Trinamul a chance to crow and credit the panel with an accomplishment that is not part of its job.        
	Trinamul president Subrata Bakshi said: Its good that the poll panel has risen to the occasion by judging peoples support behind the April 21 bandh.        
	If Trinamul is celebrating the survival of the bandh, the CPM is not complaining either. CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said: We are against the bandh and we will oppose it. But what will the Election Commission do if a bus carrying candidates in Nandigram is attacked by bandh supporters?         
	The Election Commission virtually pleaded helplessness and echoed Konar. If transport is not allowed to ply on the bandh day, how can the candidates travel to block development offices for withdrawal of their nomination papers? Gupta asked.         
	Former poll panel chief Ajoy Sinha said a shutdown in the run-up to the panchayat polls was unheard of. I cant recall a single instance of a bandh being called while the election process is on, Sinha said.

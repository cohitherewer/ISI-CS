The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cabinet sets date for budget session
                                                                                                        Cabinet sets date for budget session
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 5: The Madhu Koda cabinet today resolved to hold the budget session of Assembly from February 27, amid speculation pertaining to the governments survival.         
	The Assembly session will conclude on March 27 and would have 20 working days.        
	The governor is yet to prorogue the winter session of the Assembly though the House was adjourned sine die on December 17. A couple of weeks later, the cabinet approved the adjournment of the winter session with retrospective effect. Today, too, the cabinet agreed to prorogue the House so that the Assembly session could begin again.        
	But principal secretary to the governor Amit Khare said the cabinet was not empowered to prorogue the House. The authority was with the governor, Syed Sibtey Razi. Khare, however, added that the cabinet could request the governor to prorogue the House.         
	Considerable political significance is being attached to the move by the Koda government because the Congress would be again forced to face awkward situations.         
	Toppling the Koda government while the budget session is in full swing will be practically difficult for the Congress. Defending the Koda government on the floor of the House will be embarrassing for the party, as it had declared the government as a failure.        
	But if the government tables the budget, Union minister of state for food processing Subodh Kant Sahay said the Congress would vote for it as it will be our responsibility to see to it that the government functions smoothly as long as we are supporting it.         
	Sahay said AICC general secretary Ajay Maken was unlikely to submit his final report on Koda government before February 10.         
	Other decisions        
	The cabinet today named important buildings of the mega sports complex for the National Games after martyrs from Jharkhand.         
	In another decision, the cabinet agreed to constitute a selection panel to fill vacancies in the juvenile justice board and in the child development committee.

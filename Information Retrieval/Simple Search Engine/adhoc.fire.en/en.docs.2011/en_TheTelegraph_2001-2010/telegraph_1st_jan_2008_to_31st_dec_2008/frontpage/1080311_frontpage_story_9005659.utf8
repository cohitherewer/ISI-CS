	Jodhpur, March 10: A BJP worker has kicked up a controversy by worshipping Vasundhara Raje as a deity, less than a year after his posters showing the chief minister as a goddess sparked a court case and a probe.        
	Hemant Bohra has organised a seven-day yagna since Shivratri (March 6) at the Peepleshwar Mahadev temple, where Vasundhara has been deified as shaktiroop Kalyani Devi, the goddess of strength, riding a lion.        
	Special prayers and a 108-bead garland were offered on Saturday to mark the chief ministers 55th birthday. Mantras were chanted 108 times for the desired effect.        
	The puja and havan will culminate on March 12. The garland is to make a wish for the BJP to win over 108 seats in the Assembly elections (scheduled later this year), said Bohra, whose posters had portrayed the chief minister as Annapurna (goddess of harvest) last year.        
	Bohra, expelled as priest from the Sri Krishna temple for his single-minded devotion to Vasundhara, justified the worship and her divine status.        
	I saw her at the parivartan yatra before the elections in 2003 and was awed by her energy, vigour, control and the dazzle on her face. She has done so much for the people of Rajasthan that she needs to be revered.         
	Bohra said he did not force anybody to worship the chief minister, though some BJP leaders were said to have offered prayers at the temple on her birthday.        
	On June 19 last year, Sheetal Kunwar, wife of BJP leader Jaswant Singh, had filed a complaint in a local court against Bohra and BJP MLA Suryakanta Vyas, the publisher of the poster, for depicting Vasundhara as a goddess showering blessings on her ministers.         
	Atal Bihari Vajpayee (as Vishnu) L.K. Advani (Brahma) and Rajnath Singh (Shiv) were shown blessing Raje. Two Rajasthan ministers, Laxmi Narayan Dave and Pratap Singh Singhvi, were depicted as Kuber and Indra, the gods of wealth and rains, respectively.         
	Kunwar had sought action against Bohra and Vyas for criminal conspiracy and offending religious feelings. The court had asked police to file a report on the posters.         
	The Congress has slammed the worship, saying such acts has no place in a democracy. C.P. Joshi, the partys state unit president, said: Worshipping Raje is another proof that BJP is encouraging such a redundant culture, which should be banned immediately in a democracy.         
	But the BJP distanced itself from the controversy.         
	This worship is purely an individuals perception. Neither the party nor Madam Raje asked them to worship her. They are doing it on their own. If anyone is hurt, they should approach the court, party leader Kailashnath Bhatt said.

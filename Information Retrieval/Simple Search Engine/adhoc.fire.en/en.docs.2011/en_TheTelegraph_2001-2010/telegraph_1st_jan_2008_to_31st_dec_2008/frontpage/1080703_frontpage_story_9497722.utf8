          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 2: The Samajwadi Party does not appear to have demanded the draft of the nuclear safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).        
	The Left parties have been saying that the draft should be shown to them  a demand the government has turned down.        
	This evenings PMO statement, which lists the clarifications sought by Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh, does not make any mention of the demand for the draft.         
	However, following a meeting with national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, Amar told reporters: Like our friends in the Left, we have a whole lot of misgivings about the deal. We have raised these concerns in our meeting and we are not able to say anything until we get a public clarification from the Prime Minister himself.        
	The Samajwadi-led UNPA, made of the Telugu Desam Party, AGP and the INLD, is meeting tomorrow to thrash out a common approach to the deal. But the odds are the formation will break because the Desam and the AGP are unequivocally against the deal.        
	The Samajwadis, on the other hand, sources said, would discover reasons to be satisfied with the PMOs hurriedly framed and lengthy public response.        
	Much of the PMO statement traversed the already-covered territory of assurances on national and nuclear independence.        
	India has always followed an independent foreign policy the civil nuclear co-operation agreement did not and would not affect the autonomy of decision-making in regard to foreign affairs in any manner, the statement said, adding: India has always regarded its strategic autonomy in these matters as sacrosanctunder no circumstances would this position undergo a change.         
	In response to the Samajwadi Party leaders queries on the status of Indias nuclear weapons programme and testing ability, the statement said: The Prime Minister has iterated on many occasions that the deal would not in any way impinge on our strategic programme.

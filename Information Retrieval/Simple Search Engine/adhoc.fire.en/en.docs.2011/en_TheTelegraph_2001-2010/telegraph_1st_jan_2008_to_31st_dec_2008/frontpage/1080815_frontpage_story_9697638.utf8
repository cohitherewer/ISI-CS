          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 14: Calcutta High Court today accepted the CBIs conclusion that Rizwanur Rahman had committed suicide and cleared the agency to chargesheet seven people, including his father-in-law Ashok Todi and three police officers, for abetment.        
	The three others are Ashoks brother Pradip Todi, relative Anil Saraogi and the Rahmans family friend Pappu, all accused of trying to break up Rizwanurs marriage with Priyanka Todi, which her father did not approve of.        
	The city polices attempts to arm-twist the couple were unconstitutional and inhuman, the court said, adding that then police commissioner Prasun Mukherjees conduct had encouraged his subordinates to harass the couple even more.        
	The three officers to be chargesheeted are Ajoy Kumar, Sukanti Chakraborty and Krishnendu Das. The charges of abetment to suicide, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy carry a maximum punishment of 10 years in jail.        
	Justice Dipankar Dutta also recommended departmental proceedings against Prasun and then deputy commissioner (headquarters) Gyanwant Singh for acting irresponsibly on the false accusations made by Ashok Todi.        
	He said Prasun had suppressed facts and shown more interest in helping the Todis than the young couple. Gyanwant had been the first officer to call the couple to Lalbazar before referring the case to Ajoy Kumar.        
	The trial will be held in a CBI court at the Bankshall Court premises in Calcutta.        
	However, the court stayed the operation of the order for three weeks, giving the Todis and the government time to appeal before a higher bench. Government sources indicated the state would appeal.        
	Mamata Banerjee today demanded that the chief minister quit and apologise to Rizwanurs mother since the verdict had gone against his government.

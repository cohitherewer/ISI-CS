          SAMBIT SAHA AND SOHINI MOOKHERJEA                            Nirupam Sen                                  
	Calcutta, April 14: The Bengal government has received positive vibes from German carmaker BMW about investment in the state, a senior official said today.        
	The vibes were positive. We are encouraged by the response. This is our first meeting with BMW. For a company like this, we would need to have a series of such meetings, Sabyasachi Sen, principal secretary, commerce and industries, told The Telegraph from Munich.        
	Led by industries minister Nirupam Sen, a delegation from Bengal visited the BMW plant at Munich. The states presentation centred on the efforts to develop Bengal into an auto component hub  a decisive factor that prompted BMW to choose Chennai for a project last year.        
	An earlier unsuccessful attempt to court another German auto maker, Volkswagen, has led the Bengal government to keep its fingers crossed but Sabyasachi Sen said BMW did not rule out the possibility of investment. I was there at the meeting with Volkswagen two years ago and I can feel the difference, he added.        
	The delegation has invited BMW officials to visit Bengal. Sabyasachi Sen was with Nirupam Sen when they met David Panton, the senior vice-president (Asia Pacific) of BMW, today. Panton is in charge of the Indian operations of BMW, which is setting up a facility in Chennai to make the 3 and 5 Series cars.        
	The Bengal government seems to be hoping to showcase before BMW the Tatas Singur project and the component units scheduled to come up in the vicinity. Our strategy is to also invite the component makers of BMW to set up shop here (in Bengal), Sabyasachi Sen said.        
	The state government is developing an auto component park with Calcutta-based Srei Infrastructure in Kharagpur.        
	Srei managing director Hemant Kanoria, too, made a presentation on the auto-park for BMW officials. Kanoria said BMW agreed to pass on details of its vendors so that they, too, could be tapped.        
	The industries minister and the secretary are expected to visit the Daimler factory in Stuttgart this week.         
	Nirupam Sen today inaugurated the Bengal Centre in Munich to facilitate business with Bavaria. Prasun Mukherjee, the director of New Kolkata International Development, is the chairman.        
	The centre will organise an Indo-Bavarian summit on May 26 in Calcutta.         
	Bayern Initiative, a Bavarian trade promotion body, is hoping to bring along heads of 19 industrial clusters, ranging from auto to infotech and biotech.

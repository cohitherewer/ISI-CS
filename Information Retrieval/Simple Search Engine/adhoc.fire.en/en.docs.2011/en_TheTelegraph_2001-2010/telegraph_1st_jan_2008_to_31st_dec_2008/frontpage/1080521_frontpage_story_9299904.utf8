  - Pass percentage goes up but gap persists          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	Calcutta, May 20: Higher secondary: 80.38 per cent; ISC: 97.04 per cent.        
	The results of the Class XII examinations declared today revealed disparity in the success rates despite the Bengal boards efforts to bridge the gap.        
	The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education has been trying to catch up with the pass percentage of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination to provide candidates a level playing field.         
	However, although the gap has narrowed with the success rate climbing from 62.60 per cent in 2004 to 80.38 per cent this year, the state council still has a long way to go.         
	Over the past five years, we have been working to make our examination system more modern and scientific on a par with equivalent examinations of other boards, said an official of the council. The results have started showing, but we still have some way to go. This is because we have been a late starter in modernising the higher secondary curriculum, compared to other boards.        
	The examination reforms were put in place to help students score more marks and compete with candidates from other boards during college admissions.        
	Gerry Arathoon, the additional secretary and officiating chief executive of the Delhi-based Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination, which conducts the ISC exams, said it had started the modernisation process  which the state board initiated only five years ago  in the early nineties.        
	We had started the drive to modernise the ISC syllabus and the examination system much before, in fact more than 15 years ago, Arathoon said. This is reflected not just in the high success rate of ISC examinees but also in their top scores.        
	Kumudh Bandyopadhyay, a student of Garh Raipur High School of Bankura, topped this years higher secondary examinations by scoring 95 per cent.         
	In the ISC examination, Gaurav Sood from Doon School top-scored with 99 per cent. Closer home, Saptarshi Bhattacharya of Salt Lake English Medium School and Annesha Chakraborti of Calcuttas GD Birla Centre for Education obtained 98.25 per cent.        
	Although some other boards have higher scores, the changes we have introduced since 2005 are working well. The number of examinees scoring 80 per cent and above in various subjects is higher now, said Debashis Sarkar, the HS council secretary.        
	But higher secondary students feel that even though the overall success rate has increased, ISC candidates would beat them in college admissions as they have scored higher marks in aggregates and in various subjects. This is especially so as Calcutta and some other universities have scrapped the system of deducting marks of ISC and CBSE students.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   We will remember the years of pluck, not the day of duck
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            The last lap: Sourav races up the stairs in his last padded-up return to the pavilion in a Test match. (AFP)				                                 
	Nagpur, Nov. 9: Sixty years after crickets most stunning dismissal, which denied Sir Don a Test average of 100, another evoked much the same emotions. This time featuring Sourav Ganguly.        
	Figures werent compared  Sir Don stands head and shoulders above the much lesser mortals  but it was about the end of an era. Cliched, perhaps, but apt.        
	Souravs last day as an India cricketer is tomorrow, but he has played his final innings.         
	If it was leggie Eric Hollies who did the damage then, offie Jason Krejza caught Sourav (leading edge) off his own bowling this afternoon, the Australia-series penultimate day.                  
	The Oval it was in August 1948; today it was the new and handsome VCA Stadium in Jamtha.        
	Getting out on the dreaded duck didnt exactly reduce Sourav to tears, but the acute disappointment couldnt be hidden. It was evident when one met him in his Pride Hotel suite.         
	Bradman will remain Bradman... Such is destiny... Such is life... You cant score in every innings... It was destined that I wouldnt get a run... (Michael) Hussey and (Virender) Sehwag were destined to get 90s only, Sourav told The Telegraph.         
	His tone, though, suggested he himself hadnt been convinced by the rather philosophical explanation.         
	The reality is that it turned out to be a Bradmanesque end for a fascinating Test career which began with a hundred, at Lords, in the summer of 1996.        
	However, its not the duck that Sourav will be remembered for. It will be for the many moments of thrill provided as a batsman and for encouraging a look-the-opposition-in-the-face attitude as captain.        
	For many, hell remain the face of a changing India: Confident, combative, courageous. With apologies to Greg Chappell and Kiran More, an excellent package that.         
	Thanks Dada read one of the banners as Sourav began the walk back. In attendance at the stadium this afternoon were many more die-hard fans of Indias most successful Test captain.        
	I had a good run and Im happy about that... I missed out on a hundred in the first innings (getting 85) and failed to score in the second here... It happened... Whatever the level, nobody likes to get out for a duck... It was the first ball (Sir Don, in his final innings, fell on the second) and I didnt get the time to adapt, Sourav said.        
	Its with good reason that cricket is seen essentially as a one-ball game.        
	The perfect delivery for a new man at the crease, is how the venerable Ian Chappell described the flighted one from the debutant.        
	So perfect that it left Sourav in a daze.        
	Asked who was being remembered when he looked at the sky on the way back to the dressing room, Sourav replied: Nobody... I didnt realise Id been looking up till (wife) Dona wanted to know what had been on my mind... I probably did it out of instinct.        
	He added: I wouldnt say I was stunned... Very disappointed, yes, which is why Id kept my pads on after returning to the dressing room...        
	Souravs cricket gear, much of which has been given away, wont be out till edition No. 2 of the IPL, next April-May. Unless, of course, Bengal is in dire straits and his services are needed towards the end of the year.        
	The day, incidentally, saw the end of the Fab Four partnership. After thousands of runs over the years, their final innings together saw as little as 19 being contributed.        
	Destiny?

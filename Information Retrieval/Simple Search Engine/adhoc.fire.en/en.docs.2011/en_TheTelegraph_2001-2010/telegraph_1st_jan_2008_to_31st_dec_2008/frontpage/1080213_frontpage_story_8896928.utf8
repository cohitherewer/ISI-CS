	Calcutta, Feb. 12: Poultry products will be available in most of Bengal, including Calcutta, from Wednesday.        
	The government has decided to lift the eight-day-old ban on the movement and sale of chicken, duck and quail and their eggs in 17 out of 19 districts from tomorrow.        
	The ban will only be partially withdrawn in Birbhum and Murshidabad  the worst hit among the 14 districts affected by bird flu.         
	In Birbhum and Murshidabad, movement of poultry will be allowed from organised farms. Unorganised (backyard) farms will have to get certificates from animal resource deputy directors before moving poultry.        
	Police camps will be set up on the borders of the two districts to ensure that uncertified products are not smuggled out.        
	Animal resource development minister Anisur Rahman said poultry farming would not be allowed for three months in culled areas. They account for 8 per cent of the area under poultry farming in the state.        
	The West Bengal Poultry Welfare Association welcomed the decision to lift the ban. We have lost over Rs 10 crore because of the ban, said Tapas Bandopadhayaya, the association president.         
	Rahman said tonight that he had heard that nearly 1,800 chickens in Jalpaiguri had died over the past two days. Samples will be sent for tests.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                              
	Srinagar, Dec. 29: Farooq Abdullah today stepped aside so his son could be Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, but Omar Abdullah must now convince the Congress he is ready for the job.        
	Farooq capped yesterdays double somersault with a third today to declare Omar the National Conferences candidate for the top job.        
	He is the best man to handle the state. I had made up my mind when Omar was made president of the party (before the 2002 elections), but we could not win the numbers. Now the time has come when he should lead, Farooq, a three-time chief minister, said.        
	The Congress, with which the NC must tie up to form the government, is not so sure. While the party believes that Omar, 39, is a more earnest politician than his father, it doubts how well a rookie can run the sensitive state at a time of Indo-Pak tensions.        
	A Congress lobby is highlighting Omars inexperience and pitching for a tie-up with the Peoples Democratic Party with support from Independents. One of its arguments is that a soft-separatist PDP can create more trouble in the Opposition compared with the NC. Omar is in Delhi and is expected to meet Sonia Gandhi tomorrow.        
	Farooq had been the NCs shadow chief minister but surprised everyone yesterday by backing Omar. But within hours he claimed he was still the party candidate for the top job. He apparently woke up a changed man today, saying he was more interested in national politics.        
	I am not leaving the field and I am going to lead the party, he said. I will work for the party.        
	The father-son rivalry had begun about a year ago when Farooq staked claim to the top post if the party came to power. NC sources said Omar agreed reluctantly.        
	During the campaign, however, Farooq was criticised for several insensitive statements, such as his threat to jail pro-independence rallyists. Omar is more aware of peoples sensibilities. The dominant feeling in the NC is that the party is safer in Omars hands, a source said.        
	A source said Farooqs rethink was forced by the fractured mandate, which has given the NC 28 seats in an Assembly of 87, the Congress 17 and the PDP 21.        
	Farooq sahib wanted to be chief minister for a couple of years mainly because he realised his public image was not so good and wanted to improve it, the source said. He could have (been) chief minister had we got the numbers on our own.        
	The Congress, however, has dark memories of its 1987 alliance with the NC when Farooq, after a rigged election, became chief minister. Within a year the state was in the grip of militancy.        
	Besides, Farooqs image as a non-serious politician prone to giving actresses rides on his pillion, and as an opportunist who had tied up with the BJP-led NDA, had hobbled the NCs efforts to form a government in 2002. Then too it was the largest single party. At that time, the Congress knew little about Omar, who was the official chief minister candidate but had lost the election.        
	Today, Omar has excellent relations with Rahul Gandhi and his family, an NC source said. These ties were cemented by his speech in Parliament when he supported the UPA on the trust motion.        
	If Farooq made way for Omar in Srinagar, the younger Abdullah had to leave the stage to his own son in his constituency, Ganderbal, today.        
	Nine-year-old Zahir accompanied his father on a victory lap and almost stole the show. Wearing a red jacket and grey denims, he stood beside Omar holding a plough, the party symbol, PTI reported.        
	He then hopped onto the jeeps bonnet and handed a microphone to Omar but only after testing it himself. The crowd roared its approval.        
	After Omars speech, Zahir climbed atop the vehicle again and waved to the crowds and shook hands with them. An old woman walked up to the child and handed him a Rs 100 note as a token of love.

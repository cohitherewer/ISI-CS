          ROGER DOBSON                            Turn-on                                  
	London, Dec. 14: For years women have complained that some men are more interested in football than sex. Now scientists claim to have found out why.         
	Neurologists who looked into the brains of football fans while they watched a match found that seeing their team score triggered immediate activity in a particular area of the brain known to be associated with intense pleasure and sexual arousal.        
	When a goal was missed, or during open play, different areas of the brain were activated.         
	Our main aim was to exploit the passion that some people have for sport and capture the acute and intensely pleasurable feeling experienced by supporters when a goal is scored, said clinical scientist John McLean of the Institute of Neurological Sciences, Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, who led the study.        
	Our results show that the part of the brain associated with intense pleasure, and which has been associated with arousal, is most active at the time a goal is scored, compared to other times. Whether it is as powerful a stimulus as sex, I dont know; perhaps for some people. It might be difficult, however, to do a study with people having sex in a scanner.        
	In the study, being reported in the journal Psychiatry Research Neuroimaging this week, researchers used brain scanning equipment on nine fervant Glasgow Rangers fans, all season ticket holders or former season ticket holders, while they watched a series of video clips of goals scored by their team. Each of the 30 clips was four second long, to avoid boredom setting in, with three seconds of build up followed by the goal.        
	For comparison, scans were also taken when the men were watching 30 clips where a goal was missed, and 52 which showed open play away from the goal. No sound was included in any of the clips.        
	Results show that activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the brain was substantially higher when a goal was scored than when chances were missed and in open play.        
	Other research has found that the ACC is also highly active at times of intense pleasure. One study investigating sexual stimulation in men and women found that the ACC was one of the brain areas involved with arousal in both sexes.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, June 6: Arrested journalist Mukul Pathak today dropped a bombshell that could put the CBI itself into a soup along with arrested former Assam education minister Ripun Bora.        
	Brought to the Tis Hazari court here this morning, Pathak did not reveal anything before the court besides asking for fresh clothes and expressing satisfaction at the CBIs conduct.         
	On coming out of the court, however, he told journalists that the nephew of CBI officer A.B. Gupta and a surrendered Ulfa militant (Sulfa) were involved in the bribery routine that put Bora in jail on Wednesday.        
	The police were granted a days remand to question the journalist today.         
	Tomorrow, Pathak will be produced in court along with Bora and Maheshwari. The trio were accused of bribing CBI officials to extricate Bora from the Daniel Topno murder case.        
	Pathak named Abhigyan Gogoi, the nephew, and Digant Saikia, a Sulfa, as being involved in the bribery case.        
	I do not know about this, but if it is true then it will be a matter of investigation, CBI director Vijay Shankar told The Telegraph.        
	The arrested journalist alleged that the duo had approached him and made an offer for Bora.         
	According to the offer, Bora was to pay Rs 3.5 crore to hush up the murder.         
	However, instead of Rs 3.5 crore, only Rs 17 lakh was paid in sums of Rs 7 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, Pathak alleged.        
	Boras wife and daughter were allowed to meet him today for half-an-hour at the CBI headquarters.        
	Sources said his wife and daughter, accompanied by former Congress MLA Nilomony Sen Deka and a lawyer from Assam, were allowed to meet him after they had obtained permission from the court.         
	The CBI had raided the former ministers houses in Guwahati and Delhi yesterday.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Members of Left parties conduct an anti-clash march on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 3: More than a month after she filed a complaint, the Orissa government today arrested four persons for the alleged rape of a nun in strife-torn Kandhamal and referred the case to the crime branch for further investigation.        
	Considering the case delay, the administration also placed inspector in charge of Baliguda police station K. Narayan Reddy under suspension for laxity. Addressing reporters in the state capital today, chief minister Naveen Patnaik confirmed the probe, while sources said that an officer in the rank of inspector-general would be supervising the investigation.         
	Naveen also said that stringent action would be taken against those who had committed the shameful and savage act. The law will see that perpetrators of such inhuman acts are punished appropriately, he said, but evaded questions on the delay in initiating action.        
	The 29-year-old nun had lodged a complaint (number 70) at the Baliguda police station under Kandhamal district on August 26 alleging she was raped and paraded naked by a Hindu mob on August 25.         
	The police sat over the case and collected the medical examination reports only two days ago. Kandhamal superintendent of police S. Praveen Kumar confirmed the arrests of the four men today. Explaining the delay, the police chief said the victim had not named the accused in the FIR. Besides, he added, the complainant was not traceable, since she was under treatment at an undisclosed clinic for her trauma. Still, we have arrested four who were a part of the group that committed the crime, he said.         
	In her two-page complaint written on August 26, the nun had stated: Forty armed men arrived at our centre on August 24. Father Thomas Chellantharayil and I jumped over the boundary and ran to the nearby forests. The next day we concealed ourselves in the house of one Prahallad Pradhan of K-Nuagaon, but at 1pm the mob found us and dragged me and Father out. They took me to a deserted building of an NGO and stripped me. There they raped me. After that, they paraded me without my clothes on the streets.        
	Two doctors had examined her on August 25 and she lodged a formal complaint at the local police station the next day. But, it took the state government and the police almost 38 days to react.         
	The government did not respond even after Sister Nirmala, the superior-general of the Missionaries of Charity, wrote to Naveen seeking justice.        
	K. Narayan Rao, the inspector-in-charge of Baliguda police station, who was suspended today for the alleged laxity, said: I was busy maintaining law and order that is my number one priority. I have just one sub-inspector and 13 constables at my disposal.         
	The victim is the daughter of a resident of Dakara village under Dakma police station in Sambalpur, and had been working as an administrator at the Divyajyoti Pastoral Centre in Kanjamendi village. Father Chellantharayil (55) is now under treatment in Kerala.

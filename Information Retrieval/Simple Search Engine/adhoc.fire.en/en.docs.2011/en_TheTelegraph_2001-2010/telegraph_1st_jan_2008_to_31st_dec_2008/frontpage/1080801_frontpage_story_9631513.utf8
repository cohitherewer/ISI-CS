          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, July 31: Investigators from Delhi have picked up a man in New Jalpaiguri to find out whether he had any links with the serial blasts in Ahmedabad and Bangalore.         
	A PTI report said five persons had been detained.         
	The police team from Delhi reached north Bengal on the basis of information provided by one Mohammad Hakim, who was apparently arrested in Delhi three days ago.        
	Delhi police have not made any announcement of an arrest but a suspected Simi activist, Abdul Halim, had been picked up in Ahmedabad.         
	It was not clear whether the Siliguri sources were referring to Halim.

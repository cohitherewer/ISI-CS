	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 26: The communal tension prevailing in the state for the past three days today snowballed into a virtual war between two communities and police, killing at least seven people in the past 24 hours.         
	The toll in violence following the murder of prominent VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati reached nine today.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik confirmed death of four persons today in a group clash at Barakhama in Khandhamal district, while three others were killed in minority-populated Raikia area in the same district last night when their houses were torched.         
	On Sunday night, one Radheshyam Pradhan of Rupa village under Tikabali police station had fallen prey to the communal tension, while Rajani Majhi, a woman inmate of a missionary school at Khuntpali in Bargarh district, died yesterday afternoon when the hostel of the cradle was set on fire.         
	Even as DGP Gopal Chandra Nanda said the police were forced to open fire to disperse a mob and prevent a group clash in Barakhama, the chief minister denied police opening fire there.        
	We are keeping a close watch on the situation in Khandhamal, which witnessed widespread violence for the past three days in protest against the killing of VHP leader Laxmanananda Saraswati, Nanda said.         
	Two companies of RAF had been deployed in the area, said a senior police officer, but violence continued in the district.        
	At Phiringia in Khandhamal district, an irate mob set two government residences on fire. Two government officials, including the local BDO, were attacked at Barimunda. Panicked, the villagers fled to a nearby forest, reports said.         
	There was palpable tension throughout the district, even as the prohibitory orders were in force and the curfew was extended to Tikabali, Sankarakho and G Udaygiri. Earlier, curfew was clamped in Phulbani, Tumudibandh and Rayagada.        
	Reports of violence were also received from Gajapati and Rayagada districts.         
	The situation at Padmapur under Bargarh district is gradually improving with deployment of more forces at sensitive places and inside the town, reports our Sambalpur correspondent.        
	This small township and a nearby village Khuntpali witnessed an unsavoury situation when a missionary hostel was set on fire during the bandh yesterday, leading to the death of the caretaker of the hostel, Rajani Majhi. She hailed from a poor family of Jagdalpur under Jharbandh block. Besides working as a caretaker in the hostel, she was also pursuing her graduation in Padmapur College, the police from Padmapur said.         
	Meanwhile, revenue divisional commissioner of northern division Jamil Ahammad Khan, DIG Y.B. Khurania, Bargarh collector Suresh Chandra Padhi, SP Ajay Kumar Biswal and all other senior officers visited the spot today and accelerated police action.         
	Meanwhile, church leaders from across the undivided Koraput district assembled at JELC church in Jeypore for praying for VHP leader Swami Laxamananda Saraswati.         
	Cardinal Telesphore P. Toppo today condemned the murder of the VHP leader and the retaliatory attacks on churches and Christians in Orissa. He called upon the Centre and the Orissa government to maintain law and order, reports our correspondent from Ranchi.

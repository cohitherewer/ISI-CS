	Chandernagore, Nov. 11: The CPMs Suhrid Dutta (in picture) and Debu Malik were today found guilty in the murder of Tapasi Malik, a Save Farmland Committee campaigner in Singur, in December 2006. They will be sentenced tomorrow.         
	The Trinamul Congress, on the defensive since the Nano pullout, sensed an opportunity to turn the tables on the CPM and announced Saturday would be observed as Tapasi Malik Divas in Singur.

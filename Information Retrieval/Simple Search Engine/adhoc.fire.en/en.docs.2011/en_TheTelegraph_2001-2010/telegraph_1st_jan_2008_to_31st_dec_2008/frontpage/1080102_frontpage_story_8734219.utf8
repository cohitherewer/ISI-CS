     RANJAN DASGUPTA
               
	Ranchi, Jan. 1: The New Year could not have started on a worse note. In a bid to stop the erratic supply of power from hydel plants in the central pool, Jharkhand had asked the Centre to restore supply from thermal plants. But the Centre, it has been learnt now, has rejected the plea.
    
	Jharkhand, along with representatives of electricity boards of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, met the Union power minister on December 27 demanding restoration of its power supply from the central quota through thermal power stations. But Jharkhand State Electricty Board engineer-in-chief C.D. Kumar, who attended the meeting, disclosed the bad news only now. 
    
	Since November 2007, the ministry had stopped supply from thermal power plants at Khalgoan (Bihar) and Talcher (Orissa) and started providing power from Tala hydel power plant in Bhutan. But supply from Tala has been erratic due to fluctuations in water levels. 
    
	Jharkhands quota from Tala is about 230 MW a day. But it is getting around 60MW on an average. The situation is likely to remain unchanged till the monsoons. 
    
	The new arrangement has hit Bihar and Jharkhand the hardest as these two states are dependent on the central allocation of power. During the meeting, state representatives expressed their annoyance that coal-bearing states were being deprived of assured power supply from the Centre.
    
	Power from Khalgoan and Talcher are now being linked with northern and western grids to strengthen supply. The ministry wants to boost the power supply in Delhi ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, these officials alleged. 
    
	The only silver lining for Jharkhand is the ministrys assurance  it has now sent a letter to this effect  of providing 40MW of additional power to the state shortly. We have received the ministrys communiqu a few days back. We will start getting the additional power soon, a board official said.
       
	Chief minister Madhu Koda and several Congress leaders had met Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde sometime back and pleaded for more power from the central pool to tide over the gloomy power scenario in the state.

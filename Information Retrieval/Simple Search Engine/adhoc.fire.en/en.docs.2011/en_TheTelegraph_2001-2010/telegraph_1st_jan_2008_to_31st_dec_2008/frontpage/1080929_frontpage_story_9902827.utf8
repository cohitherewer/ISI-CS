          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                            Santoshs mother Rekha breaks down on seeing his body on Sunday. Nine-year-old Santosh died in Saturdays blast. (Reuters)                                   
	Sept. 28: A Delhi police team has been sent to Jalpaiguri amid suspicion that Bangladeshi militants were behind yesterdays Mehrauli market blast.        
	Santosh, a boy whose head was ripped off when he picked up a bag dropped by two motorcyclists and ran after them to return it, was cremated today. He was such a nice brother, Bambam Kumar, the dead boys brother, said.         
	A senior police officer in Jalpaiguri said Delhi police had conducted several raids in the district in July-end and arrested one person, Md Hakim, for alleged involvement in a small blast early this year.         
	Officers from Delhi again visited the district in August in search of Hakims associates. We have heard that a team from Delhi will visit in connection with the recent blasts but we have not been informed, he said.        
	Sources said the Delhi team was headed to Shantinagar under Bhaktinagar police station in Jalpaiguri.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told a Calcutta police gathering: Those who are involved in terrorist activities have international links. They are choosing crowded places in metropolitan cities. We are surrounded by Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh we have to be more careful.        
	The smoke that came out of the tiffin bomb before it killed Santosh yesterday reminded police of Abdul Karim Tunda, who was held responsible for low-intensity blasts in the 1990s and is thought to have fled to Bangladesh.         
	His bombs would be simple devices made using a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium chlorate, ball-bearings, a dash of sugar, and sulphuric acid in a container. Balloons or condoms were used to cover the container.         
	The police suspect that the smoke first seen when Santosh picked up the tiffin-box bomb might have been from sulphuric acid, a source said.         
	It is a device that uses a liquid detonator and a balloon as a timer removing the possibility of the terrorist leaving footprints while procuring detonators, said an official.         
	At the same time, investigators say, the difference in bombs used yesterday and in the September 13 blasts could be an attempt to confuse them.         
	Tahir Ahmed, 22, injured in the serial blasts, died today in hospital. I have been here praying for his recovery since that fateful day. Now my son is no more and it seems I am dead too, said father Zaheer Ahmed. All who say Muslims are terrorists should come and see my boy. Terrorists have no religion. It affects everybody, Tahirs mother wailed.        
	In Guwahati, BJP leader L.K. Advani blamed the Mehrauli blast on illegal Bangladeshi immigrants sent by Pakistans ISI. The bomb used in yesterdays blast was different from the ones used in the earlier blasts. This bomb was sent from Bangladesh, he said.         
	The earlier blasts were blamed on the Indian Mujahideen. A man was arrested at Delhi airport after he arrived from Jeddah today on suspicion that he was funding the outfit.        
	Sources said sleuths were probing if an injured youth admitted to the AIIMS after the Mehrauli blast is one of the two bombers Santosh ran after. But Delhi police denied he was under their surveillance and said they did not know if the Intelligence Bureau was treating him as a suspect.

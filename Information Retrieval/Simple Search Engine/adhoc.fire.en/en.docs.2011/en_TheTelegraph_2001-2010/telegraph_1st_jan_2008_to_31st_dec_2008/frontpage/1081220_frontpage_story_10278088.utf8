	New Delhi, Dec. 19: Paternal care of the young observed in 90 per cent of the worlds known species of birds is a behaviour that originated in the era of the dinosaurs, scientists reported today.         
	A team of palaeontologists in the US said its examination of fossilised dinosaur eggs and nests suggests that males from at least three species of dinosaurs provided parental care to the young.         
	The fossilised remains of adults found with the eggs lack maternal and reproductive features associated with these dinosaurs, the scientists said in a research report that appeared in the journal Science today.         
	The researchers have found evidence of paternal care in the Troodon, the Oviraptor and the Citipati  three dinosaurs that lived between 75 million and 65 million years ago and are related to the ancestors of birds.         
	The presence of males with a large numbers of eggs suggest that the males of these species protected and incubated the eggs, possibly laid by several females.         
	Until now we had no idea whatsoever about parental-care strategies among any dinosaur, said team member Jason R. Moore, a British palaeontologist at the Texas A amp;M University in the US.         
	Moore worked with David Varricchio from the University of Montana to analyse the eggs, nests and fossilised bones of dinosaurs discovered in Montana and Mongolia several years ago.         
	Scientists have long known that birds are the evolutionary descendants of the dinosaurs. The new findings suggest that male care of infants widespread among birds of today had emerged long before the origin of flight.         
	It is possible females of these species required more energy. If the females had taken care of the young, they would not have had as much time for gathering food and thus energy for themselves, Moore told The Telegraph.         
	High levels of energy for the female dinosaurs would have translated into evolutionary gains. The greater the food intake, the higher the levels of energy they could invest in their eggs. This could mean healthier young ones, Moore said.         
	In the absence of any previous data on parental-care strategies, some evolutionary biologists had earlier suggested that paternal care in birds might have coincided with the transition to flight.

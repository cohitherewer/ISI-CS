  - Long queues at polling booths and rallies not sign of Kashmir solution          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                            Voters queue up near Srinagar in the first phase of polling. (AP) Enter bullet before ballot Phase II, Page 4                                        
	Srinagar, Nov. 22: First the good news, because there is always so little of it. The long queues that became the headlines of the first phase of this election have set a trend and more Kashmiris might feel inspired, even in this deepening chill, to turn up at the polling booths. Only two things can prevent that happening  unpredictable snow or a very predictable terror strike.        
	Now the bad news: it is certain as death that at the end of all of this, Kashmir will remain what it has long been  a problem. As a would-be voter here bluntly put it, What these elections will deliver us is a government, what we also want is a nation.        
	You couldnt get more lucid about a people who seem to delight in tormenting the pundits with their caprice. How did the insurrectionary torrents of aazadi sweeping across the Valley in August turn into conformist streams depositing their will into voting machines in November?        
	This is no nudge-and-knock vote forced at the securitymans gunpoint; after all, even the Hurriyat, stunned as it is by the turnouts, isnt making that facile allegation. Neither is this some rigged-up sham masquerading as popular vote; else one or the other of the chief pretenders to the Kashmiri throne would have cried foul by now. Instead, they are all plunged deep into an election nobody seemed to care for just a few months ago.        
	Rallies in rural parts can get several miles long; the overhang of buntings in village squares can get so thick its tough to see the sky through them. Does anybody know whats happening here? After-prayer speeches are still calling a boycott, but the desperation in that call is easy to sense  it is being made in the name of God, no less. And it is still being drowned in the dust and clamour of criss-crossing processions  God is in heaven, its the hour of the candidate on earth.        
	Till just a few weeks ago, you couldnt have begun to count the number of political parties ready to go to the polls; today, youve lost count and you still arent finished. Forget the National Conference, the Peoples Democratic Party, the Congress and their many splinter formations, theres also Laloo Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal and Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party crowding the field. That theyve found candidates sounds miraculous enough, the odds are they may eventually eat into percentages too.        
	From the depths of secessionist revolt, a swirl of democratic contests has suddenly, and incredibly, swirled up. Kinships of caste and creed are being invoked, the rhetoric of change is battling the plea of continuity, loyalties are being proclaimed anew, treacheries are being committed, promises unfulfilled are coming to haunt and new promises are being made. This is an election.        
	An old dynasty is battling to resuscitate itself, a new one is seeking to establish suzerainty. Thrown out on an angry tide in 2002, Farooq and Omar Abdullah may well suspect this is their last chance to prevent burial. The wily Mufti Mohammed Sayeed and his workmanlike daughter, Mehbooba, may well believe that one more blow to the Abdullahs, and the Muftis can become the new ruling clan. This is an election. And yet, neither was willing to countenance it two months back. Will someone explain what has changed?        
	The problem with interpretations is that there will always be more than one. The votaries of New Delhi are running away waving every stamped ballot as another certificate of Kashmirs accession to India. The voter himself is saying he may have certified nothing more with his vote than who best can ensure the local drain stops spilling putrescence.        
	The choices on my ballot arent going to be India or independence, the choices are going to be this party and that, said Nazir Butt, a teacher who was part of several aazadi protests this summer. Please see the vote in that context. If the Kashmiri wants a representative in the Assembly or government, it does not take away from his aspiration for freedom. Who should he go to for roads and electricity and schools and jobs? To the governor? We want our people in government but that does not mean we do not want aazadi too.        
	Thats nothing this election can address.

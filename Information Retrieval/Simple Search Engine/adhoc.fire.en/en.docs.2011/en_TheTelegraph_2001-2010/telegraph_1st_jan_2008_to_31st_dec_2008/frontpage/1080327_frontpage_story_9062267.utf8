The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kashmir regains almond paradise
                                                                                                           Kashmir regains almond paradise
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                            A gardener at work in Badam Vair. (AFP)                                  
	Srinagar, March 26: Srinagars almond alcove, its favourite picnic spot till negligence and terror struck, is blooming again.        
	The white flowers bathing Badam Vair herald the beginning of spring and are expected to pull Kashmiris, as they did 28 years ago.         
	My childhood is lost somewhere under these almond trees. I am here again to snatch it back, said Kashmiri poet Zarief Ahmad Zarief, visiting the garden after over three decades.         
	The Mughal garden, by the sprawling Nagin lake, ran into decay thanks to official negligence. Then, the blazing guns of militants buried any chance of restoration.        
	Hope sprouted 14 months ago, when Jammu and Kashmir Bank stepped in to give back the garden its lost glory. It spent Rs 3.5 crore to redevelop a 20-hectare stretch, and the gates to the alcove were thrown open to the public yesterday.         
	I remember the almond bloom would last a few weeks but people, mostly families, would visit the place throughout the year. So many times I have taken my meals in the shade of these trees and so have many others in Srinagar. We used to bring samavars and enjoy salt tea prepared in it, Zarief recalled, his eyes misty at the memory.         
	Akbar had built the majestic wall ringing the city, which he called Naagar Nagar, and his son Jehangir adorned it with the garden. The Afghans built a fort atop a hill a few hundred metres away and the Dogras planted hundreds of almond saplings.        
	Zarief said the Dogras used to transport water for their soldiers camped in the fort from a deep well in the garden, which is one of its big attractions. The authorities now plan to link the garden with the fort by a ropeway.         
	The fort complex has a shrine to Sufi saint Hazrat Makhdoom Sahib. A temple and a gurdwara stand outside.         
	The 200-year-old fort was reopened in 2007, 17 years after it had been occupied by security forces.        
	The bank authorities have taken care to blend their constructions with the gardens landscape. An amphitheatre that can seat 2,000 people, an art gallery and a 1km joggers path are the new attractions.         
	This is our most ambitious social initiative. We want to preserve the heritage of this site, bank chairman Haseeb Drabu said.        
	We have preserved the basic elements of this historic garden, restored the burza pash (traditional wooden roof), embellishing it with lattice work and Khatamband (a Kashmiri ceiling craft).        
	A faade of the Mughal gate, Kathi Darwaza, welcomes visitors to a paradise regained.

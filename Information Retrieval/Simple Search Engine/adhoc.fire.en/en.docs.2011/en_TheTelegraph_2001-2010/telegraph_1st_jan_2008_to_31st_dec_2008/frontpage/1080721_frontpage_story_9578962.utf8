  - Northeast fears shortage of essentials in marathon blockade         OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Dhubri, July 20: The 1,000-hour economic blockade called by Koch-Rajbongshi students today slammed the brakes on the movement of over a thousand trucks and buses on the West Bengal side of the Chagolia inter-state checkgate.         
	An acute crisis of essentials looms over the entire Northeast as the Biswajit Roy faction of the All Koch Rajbongshi Students Union (Akrsu) flexed its political muscle to intensify its demand for a separate Kamtapur state that it wants to be carved out of North Bengal and Assam.         
	However, there was no report of violence on the first day of the marathon bandh which began at 5 this morning. A thousand-hour siege translates into roughly 40 days.         
	Sources said nearly 1,000 trucks were stranded at the inter-state border at Baxirhat in West Bengal.         
	Roy yesterday rejected Dispurs initiative to form a committee that will make a strong case to secure Scheduled Tribe status for six communities of Assam.         
	He dubbed the constitution of the three-member committee for each of the six communities as another way of delaying the communitys demand.         
	Today, the impact of the blockade was along expected lines as Roy said yesterday that the blockade would mainly target inter-state trucks and tourist buses.         
	Sources in the Chagolia said only 476 vehicles that had set off from Bahalpur in Cooch Behar, plied on National Highway 31 and crossed the inter-state checkgate with police escorts.         
	The Dhubri deputy superintendent of police (headquarters), Subhasis Baruah, however, claimed that over 1,000 trucks and buses plied under police protection during daytime.        
	In normal times, 1,200 vehicles cross the checkgate from both sides. More than 300 Akrsu activists trying to enforce the blockade on National Highway 31 in Dhubri, were arrested.         
	Of them, 162 were arrested from Biratnagar Chariali under Golokganj police station in Dhubri district.         
	The picketeers, except Akrsu general secretary Kartik Roy and organising secretary Lalji Roy, were released, Baruah said.         
	The blockade also affected regular traffic on NH 31(C) passing through Srirampur in Kokrajhar where around 400 Akrsu activists were arrested around 10am. They were released after six hours.         
	Police are closely monitoring the movement of vehicles on NH 31 and no untoward incident was reported from any part of the district till now, Baruah said.         
	While claiming the first day of the blockade a success, the general secretary of Akrsu, Pradeep Roy, said more than 2,500 activists were arrested at Srirampur and no truck could ply on the national highways in Dhubri and Bongaigaon districts.         
	The blockade will continue until and unless the government gives us an assurance on our demands in writing, Roy said.

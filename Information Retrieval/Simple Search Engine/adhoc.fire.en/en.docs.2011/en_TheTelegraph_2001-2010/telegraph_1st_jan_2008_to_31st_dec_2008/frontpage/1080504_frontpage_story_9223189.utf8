          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 3: A passenger was caught stealing the cellphone of another on closed-circuit camera at Calcutta airport this afternoon.         
	Ashok Agarwal, a Rajasthan-based garment trader, was arrested for picking up the phone that city businessman Mohammed Hussain had forgotten at the security counter.        
	When Hussain rushed back to get it, it was missing. CISF personnel scanned the CCTV footage and saw Agarwal pocketing it. The trader was found waiting to board a Bangalore flight and taken to the CISF office, where he initially denied the allegation but broke down after he was shown the footage.

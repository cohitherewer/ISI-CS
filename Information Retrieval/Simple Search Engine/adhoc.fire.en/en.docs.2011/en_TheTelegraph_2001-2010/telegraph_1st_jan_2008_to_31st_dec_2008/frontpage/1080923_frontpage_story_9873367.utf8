          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 22: Chief minister Shibu Soren today said he was willing to extend all possible help to industry, but would never force tribals to flee their homes.        
	Clearing the air on the states position on acquisition of land, Soren said he expected industries to do justice to those who had been displaced, before asking for more land for projects.         
	In an exclusive interview with The Telegraph, Soren said industrial activity in Jharkhand had made tribals aliens in their own land. They have been evicted from their homes and denied compensatory jobs, he said.         
	Alluding to the September 11 assault on Bhushan Steel officials who had gone to scout for land for a proposed steel and power plant, Soren said the displacement caused by industries and the raw deal meted out to those who had been displaced had created a turbulent situation. Giving land to new industries was not an easy job under such circumstances.        
	Soren recalled how Tata Steel MD B. Muthuraman had come to see him a few days ago to discuss the companys plans. But, he was rendered speechless when I asked him what the Tatas had done for the displaced tribals and Mahtos in Dalma forests, he said.        
	Soren said the Tatas had reaped the maximum benefit from Dalma. Land acquired by them belonged to tribals and Mahtos. A majority of land donors were denied compensatory jobs and they were forced to flee from their homes in search of bread and butter.        
	Soren said those who had chosen to stick to their soil, had been doomed to sell hadia or country liquor. The situation, he added, was similar in Bokaro, Dhanbad and other industrial areas.        
	Today, if the tribals are chasing away industrialists, it is but natural. They ought to win their trust first, through execution of community development programmes, Soren said.        
	Industry minister Sudhir Mahto, who was with Soren, said Jharkhand could not afford a Singur-like incident.

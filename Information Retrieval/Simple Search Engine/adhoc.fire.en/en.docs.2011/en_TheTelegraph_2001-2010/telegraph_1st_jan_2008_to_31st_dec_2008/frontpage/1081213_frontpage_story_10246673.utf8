										      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                       
	New Delhi, Dec. 12: The dog days have returned to haunt India Inc after a gap of over 14 years.         
	For the first time since April 1994, Indias industrial production shrank by 0.4 per cent  a sudden and unexpected contraction that appeared to fly in the face of the governments strenuous assertions that the economy was in fine fettle and would grow by over 7 per cent this year.        
	Industrial production fell by 0.4 per cent in October this year as against a 12.2-per cent expansion a year ago as the impact of the global economic downturn deepened in the country.        
	The pundits had predicted a slowdown in industrial growth in October: a straw poll of economists by Reuters had estimated that the index of industrial production (IIP) would show a 2.2 per cent growth, down from 5.45 per cent in September and 12.2 per cent in October 2007.         
	The shock announcement sparked a clamour for a fresh round of interest rate cuts and a flurry of policy measures to crank up a stuttering economy.        
	This is the time to release the second economic stimulus package. We must release a third package of measures in mid January in order to ensure a sustainable growth rate of 7 per cent this year, said Ficci secretary general Amit Mitra.        
	Last week, the RBI trimmed short-term lending and borrowing rates for banks, sending out a clear signal for softer rates. On Sunday, the government announced a Rs 30,000-crore package and has promised to come up with another next week to ratchet up falling demand.        
	Industry contributes to 26.4 per cent of Indias $1-trillion economy  and a wobble in industrial growth has only accentuated fears that the recession that has hit the West could start to nibble at one of the three pillars that prop up the worlds second fastest growing economy.        
	The services sector forms the main pillar and accounts for 55.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The share of agriculture has been steadily declining and stands at 18.5 per cent.         
	Most economists expect a further contraction in industrial output in November.        
	We expect the IIP to continue to remain weak till the end of the first half of the next fiscal (2009-10). But it will not recover till the end of March when the current financial year ends, said D.K. Joshi, principal economist at credit rating agency Crisil.        
	There were two principal causes for worry: growth in the manufacturing sector -- which accounts for about 80 per cent of overall industrial output  had shrank by 1.2 per cent for the first time in three and a half years.         
	Second, growth in the consumer goods had contracted by 2.3 per cent  the first time that this segment has shown a negative growth this year.         
	Carmakers have already cut back production and there were signs that other mass-market producers might also be trimming output to keep pace with faltering demand.         
	Banks must reduce interest rates and should lend money to people who want to buy vehicles. Unless they do so, the situation wont change, said Rajeev Kapur, chief executive officer at Fiat India.        
	The beleaguered Manmohan Singh government has asked cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekhar to lead a cabal of secretaries to draw up sector-specific stimulus packages. Textiles may be the first sector to win a package of incentives, indirect subsidies and an assured flow of credit.        
	The textile industry, which accounts for 17 per cent of Indias exports and employs 88 million people, is likely to generate a third less than its targeted revenue of Rs 150,000 crore. Officials say lack of orders from the US, European markets has prompted a sharp cutback in production.        
	A global and domestic economic outlook, rising prices and job cuts had ensured low consumer spending which, in turn, saw consumer goods and manufacturing industries cutting back production... this downturn will take some months to repair, said S.P. Gupta, former Planning Commission member.        
	Moodys said the contraction in industrial growth was the result of a tight monetary policy under the former RBI governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy.        
	Indias central bank continued to tighten monetary policy until July the moderation in demand is a result of the tight monetary policy settings in the first nine months, said Moodys Economy.com, a subsidiary of the credit rating agency.

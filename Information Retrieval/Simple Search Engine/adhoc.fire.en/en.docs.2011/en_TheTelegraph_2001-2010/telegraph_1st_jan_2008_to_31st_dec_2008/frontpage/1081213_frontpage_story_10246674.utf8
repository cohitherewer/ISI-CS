  - Tone turns sharp as Islamabad insists on evidence, Delhi points to report on dad          OUR BUREAU                             Negroponte in Delhi. (AFP)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 12: The Indian establishment today scoffed at Pakistans request for evidence on the countrys alleged links to the Mumbai terror attacks.        
	It is like a murderer asking for evidence against himself when he knows very well that the evidence will be shown in a court of law, a government source shot back, asked for a response to Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshis statement last night.         
	The reply signals a definite escalation in the war of words between the neighbours over the November 26 strikes.        
	Qureshi had said: Pakistan itself has been a victim of terrorism. However, our own investigations cannot proceed beyond a certain point without provision of credible information and evidence pertaining to the Mumbai attacks. Despite our requests, no evidence or information has been shared.        
	Pakistani newspaper Dawn today tracked down the family of Mohammed Ajmal, the lone surviving attacker now in police custody in Mumbai, to Faridkot.        
	India sees in the report the vindication of its claim that the terrorists had been launched from Pakistan. But Islamabad says India has not furnished any evidence that links the suspect with the Pakistani government.        
	The shaky civilian government in Pakistan runs the risk of a political backlash if it moves strongly against the suspects without making public the evidence.        
	Delhi might not have taken Islamabad into confidence, but it has shared information with the US and the heads of missions of countries whose citizens were killed.        
	India made its position clear to US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, when they visited Delhi. US deputy secretary of state John D. Negroponte today met foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee. He was in Islamabad yesterday.         
	We think it is imperative that these attacks be thoroughly investigated and we think it is also imperative that those responsible for perpetrating these attacks be brought to account. So the effort at the moment is concentrated on investigating these attacks and bringing those responsible to account, Negroponte said after meetings in Delhi.        
	Indias response is also conditioned by a long history of denials by Islamabad. Deniability, an official said, is built into such actions.         
	For instance, at flag meeting after flag meeting this year, Pakistan had been denying ceasefire violations on the Line of Control in Kashmir.        
	Although Mukherjee has been harping on elements in Pakistan, government sources are inclined to show a collusion between Pakistani state agencies and the terrorists.         
	Countries that are friendly to both India and Pakistan (read the US) have taken up the issue of the Pakistani elements complicity in the attack, a highly placed source said.         
	The elements in Pakistan  their ISI, even their ministry of defence  were complicit in the attack. And there are terror training camps in PoK and other parts. Do they need evidence to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure?         
	The Pakistan foreign ministrys suggestion that a high-level team, possibly headed by Qureshi, visit India has been cold-shouldered by Delhi.         
	What can a high-power committee do when Pakistan continues to be in a state of denial? There is no dearth of committees. What we want is action, a source said.

	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Ambulances accompanying Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her children Rahul and Priyanka will henceforth carry stocks of matching blood groups instead of synthetic substances that have limited use in emergencies.        
	The Union government has ordered crystalloids and plasma expanders  artificial substances that help expand blood volume  to be substituted with blood matching specific blood groups of VIPs under protection of the Special Protection Group for use in emergencies.         
	Transfusion experts say crystalloids and plasma expanders help maintain the volume of blood in the event of blood loss.         
	A circular ordering the replacement of the crystalloids and plasma expanders has been sent to all state governments and Union territories, sources in the ministry of home affairs said.         
	The sources said the decision was taken in consultation with medical experts and was not promoted by any special security issue.

	Hazaribagh, June 22: In a late night strike yesterday, Naxalites killed two villagers after bombing a school classroom, a cluster resource centre and four rooms of a Jain dharamsala in Vashisth Nagar near Chatra.        
	The 70-odd Maoists left pamphlets labelling them police informers and warning others of same consequences.        
	Chatra superintendent of police Akhilesh Kumar Jha, who reached the spot this morning, said that the villagers were innocent and not working as informers.        
	According to sources, the Maoists reached the house of Saket Bihari Sharma in Jhagartari village under Huntergunj police station area, about 25km from Chatra town, around 8.30pm.         
	They found 35-year-old Pankaj Singh alias Pintu, son of Saket, sitting outside the house. Pankaj was forced to follow the rebels who reached neighbouring village, Vashisth Nagar, and caught Bhuvaneshwar Ganjhu, 42.        
	Taking the duo hostage, the Naxalites reached adjacent village Dantar and blew up a classroom of a school then damaged the resource centre and four rooms of the Jain dharamsala. The dharamsalas caretaker, Nemichand Jain, was also roughed up. After the explosions, Ganjhus throat was slit with a sharp-edged weapon. Pankaj was killed next.         
	The police reached there this morning and recovered the bodies. A bag was tied with Pankajs body carrying the message: Mukhbiro ka yahi haal hoga (informers will meet the same fate).

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Silchar, Sept. 23: The United Liberation Front of Barak Valley  a seven-year-old militant outfit of Reang tribals  will surrender before Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi on September 30.         
	Hailakandi district superintendent of police Bibekananda Das today said the surrender ceremony would be held at the ITA Centre in Guwahati.         
	The big names of the outfit, including its president Pancharam Apeto, general secretary Jaldhihan Apeto, home secretary Chandi Ham Sema and publicity secretary Rabirai Reang would be among those who will surrender, Das said.         
	The police officer said the government would discuss their rehabilitation package and charter of demands after the surrender. He will accompany the group to Guwahati on September 29.         
	Apeto told The Telegraph that his outfit had held preliminary talks both in Hailakandi and Dispur.         
	The outfit has demanded the formation of an autonomous council for the tribals in Barak Valley, including the backward Reang community, and development of the tribals in the three districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi.         
	The ground for this surrender was laid by Das and inspector-general of police (special branch) Khagen Sarma.         
	The outfit was suspected to be behind the kidnapping and murder of Pratul Deb, a businessman related to Assam minister Gautam Roy. The CBI is probing the case.              
	Sources in the home department in Guwahati said though the group could not compare with names like Ulfa, the NDFB and the DHD, it still had enough wherewithal to keep security forces in the district on their toes.         
	It enjoys the blessings of the community it represents and, therefore, it was difficult for the security forces to deal with it, an official said. He said more than 300 rebels would lay down arms on the day of surrender.         
	We expect Barak Valley to return to peace with the outfit coming overground, he said.

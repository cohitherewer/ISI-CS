                                                                                                           Late bird bags IPL title for Rs 200cr 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 13: Real estate giant DLF today pocketed the Indian Premier League title sponsorship for Rs 200 crore, skittling out two top players in the ring.        
	DLF, which entered the fray only yesterday along with World Sports Group and Percept DMark, will sponsor the tournament for five years at an annual cost of Rs 40 crore. It will have to be approached before bids are called again.        
	Till Monday, the only bidder  the base price was set at Rs 23.6 crore by the Board of Control for Cricket in India  was 21st Century Media but it pulled out at the last moment refusing to divulge the product segment it would promote.        
	The title sponsorship race was tightly contested between three participants with DLF emerging the final winner through a fair and transparent process, IPL chairman Lalit Modi said this evening.        
	An IPL spokesperson said one of the pre-qualifications for bidding had been submitting the product category. 21st Century Media was not ready to divulge that, so they pulled out, he said.        
	IPL sources said Percept DMark, too, had refused to reveal its product segment but promised to if it won the bid.        
	But 21st Century Media did not agree to even that and so failed to meet the pre-qualification. It seems they planned to sell the sponsorship rights to a product after winning the bid and so were not in a position to divulge the product segment, the source said.        
	The BCCI had initially asked bidders to hand in a performance guarantee deposit of Rs 10 crore by Monday but was forced to extend it by a day when it found only one company in the fray.        
	Interest apparently picked up after Modi announced that Australian cricketers were welcome to play even without a no-objection certificate from Cricket Australia.        
	Unavailability of players like Ricky Ponting, Andrew Symonds, Brett Lee, Matthew Hayden for the first few matches starting August 18 was giving the sponsors cold feet, the source said.        
	The Australians will have to return their signed contracts by Sunday or face a three-year ban. Player auctions for the eight IPL teams begin on February 20.

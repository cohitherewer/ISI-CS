The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PMO cracks madarsa whip
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   PMO cracks madarsa whip
  - 5-day deadline for Arjun ministry, political whiff in rush          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                        Manmohan, Arjun: Nuclear cloud?                                        
	New Delhi, June 26: The Prime Ministers Office has accused the human resource development ministry of repeatedly delaying a plan to mainstream madarsa education, pledged in the UPAs common minimum programme four years ago.         
	In a rare departure from standard practice, the PMO yesterday directed the ministry to explain the delay in launching the Rs 45.45-crore scheme for madarsa modernisation by June 30, top government officials told The Telegraph.         
	Letters from the PMO seeking explanations from a ministry rarely issue a time frame for a response, sources said. A notice period as short as five days is even rarer, and may be linked to the uncertainty surrounding the future of the government, they said.        
	The principal secretary to the Prime Minister is extremely unhappy with the delay in the madarsa modernisation scheme, the letter dated June 25 says, before holding the ministry responsible for the delay.        
	The scheme involves the inclusion of modern science and math as subjects in madarsas. Under the scheme, the madarsas are to be computerised and are to offer vocational courses under the guidance of the National Institute of Open Schooling.         
	The Planning Commission had recently approved the funding pattern for the scheme, after nearly a year of deliberations with the human resource development ministry.        
	Ministry sources said the scheme was likely to be cleared by the expenditure finance committee of the finance ministry before July 10. After the clearance, the scheme will be presented before the cabinet.         
	The madarsa modernisation programme is the UPAs flagship programme to improve the educational status of Muslims, and gained even greater importance after the findings of the Sachar committees findings, a ministry official said.        
	The committee under former Delhi high court chief Justice Rajinder Sachar, which conducted independent Indias first exhaustive study on how Muslims fare in education and employment compared to others, established that the community was lagging in both sectors.        
	Twenty five per cent of Muslim children in the age group 6-14 have never been to school, though the national average primary enrolment rates are above 95 per cent, the committee found.         
	Only one out of every 25 undergraduate students at premier educational institutions like IITs and IIMs is a Muslim, the committee said.         
	The Sachar committee also found that only 3 per cent of Muslim children went to madarsas, denting the governments argument for using the modernisation of religious schools as a means to improve the communitys primary education.        
	The proposed scheme has seen its share of controversy earlier, too. A plan to set up a central madarsa board, offering degrees on a par with other education boards like the CBSE and the ICSE, was opposed by clerics who feared an erosion of their religious rights. The board, the government felt, would give validity to madarsa degrees for students seeking higher education.        
	The clerics argued that an anti-minority government -- a veiled reference to the NDA -- could use the boards authority to target all madarsas. The identity of separate Muslim sects with their own form of madarsa education may also be lost under a single national board, they said.        
	Following the opposition, the government decided to separate the madarsa boards proposal from the modernisation plan. A committee headed by junior minister M.A.A. Fatmi is examining the madarsa board proposal.

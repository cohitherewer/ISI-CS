          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Kohima, Oct. 3: The Naga reconciliation process suffered a big jolt today as NSCN (I-M) militants gunned down three activists of the rival NSCN (K) in a fresh burst of fratricidal killings here in the early hours.         
	The killings came just as preparations were on for the October 9 friendly football match between the two outfits as part of the reconciliation process initiated by the Church and several other organisations.         
	Heavily-armed NSCN (I-M) cadres raided the rivals hideout at Agri-Forest Colony around 2am and gunned down three of them. Police said there was a heavy exchange of fire between the rival groups, which lasted for about half-an- hour. The raiders used hand grenades and mortars in the attack.         
	NSCN (K) spokesman Isak Sumi said their hideout was surrounded by cadres of the rival faction, who fired indiscriminately from automatic rifles, lobbed grenades and fired mortars. Sumi said 12 NSCN (K) cadres were asleep in the house during the time of the attack.         
	NSCN (I-M) leaders refused to comment.        
	The slain militants were identified as Toshika Sumi, John Rengma and Mughavi Sumi. The police later handed over the bodies to the relatives. An unexploded hand grenade was recovered from the spot.         
	Despite several attempts, the police have not been able to flush out militants from civilian areas.         
	According to the ceasefire ground rules, NSCN cadres are not allowed to stay in civilian areas, but in designated camps. But both factions violate rules regularly.         
	Though preparations were on, it was not clear whether the proposed football match between the Naga outfits will finally kick off because of the ongoing spate of killings and factional clashes, particularly in Dimapur and Kohima.         
	The Church and other tribal organisations, which are spearheading the unity bid, have, however, vowed to carry on the process despite the setback. The government has deployed IRB in all vulnerable areas in Kohima to avert more clashes in civilian areas.

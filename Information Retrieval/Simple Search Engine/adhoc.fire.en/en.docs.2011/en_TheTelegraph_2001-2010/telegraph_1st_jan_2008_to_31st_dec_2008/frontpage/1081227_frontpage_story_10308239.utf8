                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Pak tries troop blackmail     From Afghan to India border

	Dec. 26: Pakistan has begun moving some troops away from the theatre of Americas war on terror and towards India, the shift coinciding with a US reminder that Islamabad still has a lot to do to achieve the objective of eliminating the groups behind the Mumbai attacks.        
	Pakistan has also cancelled the leave of its operational military personnel.        
	Associated Press quoted two intelligence officials as saying some 20,000 troops were on the move and the armys 14th Division was being redeployed close to the Indian border.        
	A military source in Islamabad declined to cite a figure but confirmed to The Telegraph that the Pakistan Army was repositioning troops along the Indian frontier.        
	Pakistan has to take minimum defence measures to ward off any threat. Our troops are on a state of high alert to deal with any eventuality, the source said. The leave of operational personnel in the army, navy and air force has been cancelled and those who were on leave have been asked to report back.        
	Defence sources did not deny reports that Islamabad was moving several brigades towards the frontier in the Lahore sector, the Daily Times newspaper reported. An Associated Press reporter in the northwestern Dera Ismail Khan district said he saw around 40 trucks loaded with soldiers heading away from the Afghan border.        
	The move, which stands to weaken Pakistans US-backed campaign against al Qaida and Taliban close to Afghanistan, could offer Islamabad leverage with Washington in its current tensions with Delhi.        
	But a senior military official told The New York Times that essential troops in limited numbers are being pulled out of areas where no operations are being conducted or where winter had already limited their ability to manoeuvre.         
	If the troops movement gathers steam, the US, which had hoped both sides would avoid raising tension, faces a double-barrelled scenario: the risk of a confrontation between two nuclear-armed countries and a thinning of forces in the fight against Taliban.         
	The reports of the troops transfer came a few hours after Richard Boucher, the US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian Affairs, said: Pakistan has taken some promising steps, but there is a lot to be done to tackle the menace.        
	Lets find the people responsible, lets eliminate the groups who were responsible and lets make sure we do everything we can to prevent India from suffering this kind of an attack again, he told All India Radio. We are having a very active diplomatic and investigative dialogue with India.         
	Unattributed reports said the Pakistan Army had moved its 10th Brigade to Lahore and ordered the 3rd Armoured Brigade to head towards the Jhelum following an alleged concentration of Indian troops along the border.        
	The Pakistan Armys 10th and 11th Divisions have also been put on high alert and troops moved to forward posts on the border facing Rajouri and Poonch sectors in Jammu and Kashmir, the reports said. These are reinforcements for the formations already deployed in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and the Sialkot and Lahore sectors.        
	The Commander of Pakistan Fleet, Rear Admiral M. Asif Sandila, has inspected the deployment of the naval fleet.        
	PM meets chiefs        
	In New Delhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was today briefed by the chiefs of the armed forces and given an assessment of military threats.        
	Since the Mumbai attacks, interactions between the political and the military leadership have steadily intensified with one taking place almost every day. This is the third time since then that service chiefs or the military top brass were asked for briefings and assessments by the Prime Minister.        
	The UPA government has so far not liked to identify closely with the military top brass in the formulation of policy, if only because a peace process was on. But that process has now been paused.         
	Toeing foreign minister Pranab Mukherjees line, spokespersons for the military said the Pakistani hysteria was aimed at diverting attention from Indias demand to crack down on terrorist outfits.        
	Admiral Sureesh Mehta, the chairman, chiefs of staff committee and the navy chief, General Deepak Kapoor, the army chief, and Air Chief Marshal Fali Major, the air force head, were present at this afternoons meeting.        
	A defence ministry official said the meeting was a review of preparedness, almost exactly the same words used to describe a similar gathering in South Block last week. It is expected that assessments on what is happening across the border would be based on the militarys surveillance. Footage from UAVs and field intelligence reports form the basis for such inputs.        
	The Cabinet Committee on Security today reviewed the security scenario and defence preparedness.        
	Kashmir quiet        
	If there is a war cloud hovering over the subcontinent, it appears to have bypassed the central theatre of discord. All the attention and excitement in Kashmir is still focused on the election result that will be declared on Sunday.        
	In the garrison towns of Kupwara and Baramulla, no unusual movement of troops towards the front was seen. An officer said: It is business as usual. We have got no fresh orders since arrangements for elections were put in place.

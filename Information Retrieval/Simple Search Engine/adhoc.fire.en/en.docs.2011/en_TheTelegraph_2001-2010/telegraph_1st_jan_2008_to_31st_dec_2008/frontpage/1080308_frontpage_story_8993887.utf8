  - Grade IV staff demand promotions        OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Grade IV government employees protest in front of Project Building in Ranchi. Picture by Prashant Mitra                                        
	Ranchi, March 7: The state secretariat was force to shut down today after a huge gathering of government employees demanding Central payscales turned raucous when a group of four among them tried to immolate themselves.         
	Among the four all Grade IV employees Bhirgu Nath Pandey, a peon in the finance department, is critical after sustaining 40 per cent burns. He and one Atish Jha have been admitted to RIMS.         
	Others, Shiveswar Jha and Megha Oraon, were released after being treated at the HEC plant hospital.         
	Chief minister Madhu Koda and finance minister Stephen Marandi, who visited the spot in the evening, seemed amenable to their demands which include Central payscales, promotions and bonus due from 1999.         
	The doors for negotiations were always open, Koda said. We are not their enemies. We will review the situation, added Marandi.         
	The employees, belonging to the Jharkhand Rajya Sachivalaya Chaturth Vargiya Karmachari Sangh and the Non-Gazetted Employees Federation, have decided to continue their agitation outside the state secretariat tomorrow until their demands were met.         
	Today, the state secretariat spread over various HEC buildings, including Nepal House and Project Building, had to stop work even after the police intervened.         
	We closed down all offices at the secretariat after our cadres tried to immolate themselves and the police began a lathicharge, said non-gazetted employees federation general secretary Singheshwar Singh. Tomorrow, too, we stop all work.         
	The federation is holding a meeting late tonight to try and rope in other government employees unions in their stir.         
	Things went out of control at the Project Building in the afternoon after the police intervened to stop some of the protesting workers from setting fire to themselves. Deputy commissioner Abinash Kumar and senior police superintendent M.S. Bhatia rushed to the spot as soon as the employees began their agitation.         
	An eyewitness said policemen were quick to react. The police used the water from the campus fountain and doused the flames. Three of the employees were saved immediately, but it took sometime for the police to reach Pandey, said Sanjay Raut, a peon.         
	Karmachari sangh spokesman Jawahar Jha said their agitation was pre-planned and they had informed the finance secretary and the police. The government has been ignoring our demands for last four months.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Commandos on Delhi list
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                             Sachin Tendulkar has volunteered to join the torch relay in Delhi, Suresh Kalmadi said                                 
	New Delhi, April 7: Glued to television sets rippling with images of the Paris protest, the Indian security establishment as well as Tibetan activists have started drawing up contingency plans for April 17, when the Olympic torch is scheduled to reach Delhi.        
	Officials said the successive protests in London and Paris, which have electrified Tibetan supporters across borders, could prompt copycat attempts in India.        
	Indian security services are now thinking of deploying Black Cat commandos in civvies so that loose-cannon protesters can be tackled in case they breach the multiple layers of guards.        
	The inner ring security on the truncated 3km stretch might be in the hands of Chinese commandos arriving from Beijing, sources said.         
	A worrying factor for the security forces is that Tibetan activists are beginning to operate on their own, rather than as a group which is relatively easy to monitor.        
	Official sources said there was little chance of large groups being able to breach the security. They cited an instance on Republic Day when a group of Tibetans had apparently got passes for an entire stand in the spectators gallery. Alerted by the bulk request, police posted two constables each for every Tibetan, thwarting the protest.        
	The vice-president of the Tibetan Youth Congress, Dhondup Dorjee, did not disclose the nature of the protest planned but added: You will see on April 17.        
	Dorjee said his organisation would stick to peaceful demonstrations. He said since India was their host, unlike the UK and France, the protesters here would be more restrained. The victory, however, is that the relay route (in Delhi) has been reduced from 9km to a mere 3km.        
	But individuals could be unpredictable. Since the protests began on March 10, individuals have often been noticed drifting away from parent organisations. Several women had joined the march to Tibet  they are now 50km from Delhi  and insisted on complete independence though the Tibetan Womens Association stood by the Dalai Lamas middle way.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
               
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: The Election Commission today announced the dates for Assembly elections in Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland.
    
	Chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami said elections would be held in Tripura on February 23, in Meghalaya on March 3 and in Nagaland on March 5. Election commissioners Navin Chawla and S.Y. Quraishi were also present. 
    
	The fate of several national and regional parties will be decided for 180 Assembly seats in these three states. 
    
	The announcement comes even as Nagaland is under Presidents rule and under the shadow of an emergency imposed by a parallel government of the militant National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah). 
    
	Presidents rule was imposed on January 4 while the NSCN (I-M) imposed its emergency on Sunday under the provisions of the Yehzabo (constitution) which was approved by its Bangkok-based chairman Isak Chishi Swu. 
    
	Security in Nagaland will be tight given apprehensions of violence during elections. The government plans to send enough forces to the state, the last to go to the hustings among the three. 
    
	In Tripura, while the Congress has managed to resolve the wrangling within the party, chief minister Manik Sarkar of the CPM is firmly in the saddle. 
    
	In Meghalaya, former Lok Sabha Speaker, Purno A. Sangma is fighting hard to return to state politics. He will not only ride on the changing equations but also on the factionalism within the Congress. Chief minister D.D. Lapang is likely to lose the support of its ally, the United Democratic Party.
    
	The Assembly in Tripura expires on March 19, in Meghalaya on March 10 and in Nagaland on March 13.

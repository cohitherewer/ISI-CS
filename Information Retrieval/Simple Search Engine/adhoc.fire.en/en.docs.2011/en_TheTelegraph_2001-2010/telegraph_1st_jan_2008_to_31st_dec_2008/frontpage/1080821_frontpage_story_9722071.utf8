          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                              
	Madanapalli (Andhra), Aug. 20: Nothing stirred on the highway. Cars, buses, trucks and goods vehicles stood bumper to bumper, most without anyone inside. They had all hopped off to grab the basketfuls of ripe, red tomatoes  coming for free.        
	Rows of farmers had set up tomato mounds by the roadside, with placards saying Free: Take it home stuck in them. They were giving away 10kg for nothing; the Rs 2 they were charging was by way of basket and transport costs.        
	For people travelling on the Chennai-Bangalore highway, the six-hour snarl at Mulbagal, 400km from Hyderabad, would not be new. Between June and August, farmers in Kurnool and Chittoor districts have been giving tomato sales for some years now.        
	We only charge people for the price of the basket and transport costs, said farmer Govind Reddy.        
	Snowed under a bumper crop, desperate farmers have been opting to gift their wares rather than accept the dirt-cheap prices offered by dealers and middlemen. Having been fleeced year after year, they have also begun distributing pamphlets to highlight their plight.        
	When wholesale prices dipped to less than 20 paise a kg in Madanapalli market in early June, the frustrated farmers decided to distribute the tomatoes for free in slums and at temples. Earlier, prices went down to Rs 5 for a 10kg-basket from Rs 8 in the interiors of Chittoor and Kurnool districts.        
	From July 15, the farmers decided to block supply to local markets to prevent prices from falling further and break free of the stranglehold of middlemen.        
	We boycotted the wholesale dealers and stopped the produce from reaching the local market, said Ramakrishna Reddy of Ramasamudram mandal in Chittoor.        
	Reddy has grown a variety of hybrid tomatoes that has yielded 30 quintals per acre this season. Some 1,000 farmers from the mandal have joined the blockade.        
	At least we can hope the market will stabilise when supply is short, Gurappa, another farmer, said.        
	The farmers also appealed to local traders not to source supplies from neighbouring districts and pay between Rs 15 and Rs 20 for every 10kg-basket. Local officials joined the campaign.        
	Tomato prices have picked up after the month-long campaign ended on August 15, touching almost Rs 22 a basket. A former president of the farmers federation said this was the first victory for the farmers.        
	The farmers have learnt their lesson the hard way. They have now grouped themselves to fight discrimination and exploitation, Chenga Reddy said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Shoaib thanks big brother
  - Express lands in Edens city with gratitude for SRK          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Shoaib Akhtar in Calcutta on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                        
	May 5: Being politically correct hasnt strictly been a feature of Shoaib Akhtars 11 years as an international cricketer.        
	On reaching Calcutta tonight, though, not one word was out of place. The result, perhaps, of the monitoring process set in motion by the Pakistan Cricket Boards appellate tribunal chief, Justice (retd) Aftab Farrukh.        
	Actually, Shoaib was expected tomorrow. Its around noon that he changed his mind and conveyed the same to a member of the Kolkata Knight Riders team management.        
	Shoaib, who arrived from Lahore via New Delhi, is accompanied by his manager, Salman Ahmed.        
	Im not taking any questions No questions, were Shoaibs first few words to the media.        
	Once hed set the ground rules in the porch (yes, thats where the cameras and mikes had to be placed) of The Sonar, Shoaib made a brief statement. Im not talking about my case the proceedings are on. Im really happy to be here and the Eden Gardens is my favourite ground.        
	Its the ground which made my career when I got Sachin Tendulkar out on the first ball (in the February 1999 Asian Test Championship). Its been good to me and I love the ground. The crowd is fantastic.        
	As Ive been under so much of stress, I havent been able to train as much as I should have done. But Im fit. Theres no pain, no niggle. Ill try to get match fit as fast as possible.        
	As Shoaib finished his statement and began to move away, The Telegraph asked whether hed been overwhelmed by the support extended by the Knight Riders owner, Shah Rukh Khan.        
	Realising he needed to publicly thank Shah Rukh, Shoaib stopped in his tracks and went back to face the mikes and cameras.        
	Shah Rukh Khan has supported me a lot. Hes been there like a big brother. Has always been so. Shoaib said.        
	Shoaib, in fact, followed Shah Rukhs advice (conveyed through these columns on April 10) and apologised to his board and its chairman, Dr Nasim Ashraf.         
	That, more than anything else, went a long way in the appellate tribunal suspending his five-year ban for a month.        
	Asked whether even a couple of days ago, hed dreamt of being in Calcutta tonight, Shoaib paused before answering: Such is life.        
	The ban has only been suspended till June 4, but given the corner he was in, Shoaib couldnt have asked for more. Any relief is welcome.         
	Shoaib wont figure in Thursdays playing XI against the Bangalore Royal Challengers, at the Eden, but could make his Indian Premier League debut in Hyderabad on Sunday.

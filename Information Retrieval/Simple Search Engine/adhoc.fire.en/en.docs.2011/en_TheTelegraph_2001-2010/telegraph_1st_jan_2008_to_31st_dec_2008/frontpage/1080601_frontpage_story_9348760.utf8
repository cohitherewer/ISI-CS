	Guwahati/Jorhat, May 31: Five Assam Rifles jawans were arrested on charges of abducting a girl in Jorhat after high drama in the heart of the town past midnight.        
	As news of the incident spread like wildfire through the town this morning, activists of the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad gheraoed the main police station and staged demonstrations at several places, demanding stringent action against the jawans.         
	The five jawans, identified as Debendra Singh, Rajnish Kumar, Amrit Kumar, Harpal Singh and Suresh Raita, were sent to judicial custody after being produced in court.         
	Jorhat superintendent of police Deepak Choudhury said the jawans, who were in uniform, were waiting near a link road to the railway station at Dohaborachuck in a white Maruti Gypsy last night.        
	They were allegedly drunk and chased three girls and a boy who were returning home from a Bihu function around 11.30pm. While two girls and the boy managed to escape, the jawans caught hold of the third girl and picked her up in the vehicle before speeding away along the Jorhat-Mokokchung road, Choudhury added.        
	However, the driver lost control of the vehicle on a speed-breaker near the Buddhist monastery at Rajabari, about 3km from the abduction site, and the vehicle turned turtle. No one was critically injured and the girl managed to escape in the commotion. She took shelter in a house by the roadside.         
	Sensing trouble, the jawans got the vehicle back on its wheels and sped away.         
	A stallowner, Bibhuti Bhusan Adhyapak, who had withnessed the abduction, rushed to a police station. The police sealed all the entry and exit points to the town and gave chase. The jawans took a U-turn at Cinnamara when they saw a police checkpost ahead. They started fleeing towards their transit camp at Nephabari through a link road via Lichubari.        
	A police patrol, led by additional superintendent of police Mukul Saikia, accosted the vehicle near Assam Agricultural University. The jawans gave in, but not before a verbal duel with the police.        
	They were put through a medical test and brought to the police station, the Jorhat SP said. They were produced in the court of chief judicial magistrate S. Dey today and have been booked under Sections 34 (collective crime with a common intention), 366 (kidnapping) and 354 (criminal outrage of women) of IPC.        
	I was so scared. I have been through hell, the young girl, in her early twenties, told The Telegraph between sobs. A hand clamped down on my mouth, cutting of my screams, and another pair of hands took hold of my legs, lifting me into the vehicle.         
	The girls are from Sivasagar district and stay in Atiliagaon, half-a-km from the site of the incident, and study paramedics at Jorhat Civil Hospital. The boy studies there, too. An official at the Assam Rifles base in Jorhat said the jawans had illegally left the camp with the official vehicle. They were on transit from Arunachal Pradesh to Manipur and had been put up at the Assam Rifles camp. He said a departmental inquiry would be conducted.        
	The Jorhat SP said the jawans would be treated like ordinary criminals. The Assam Rifles has also asked us to treat them like ordinary criminals, he added.

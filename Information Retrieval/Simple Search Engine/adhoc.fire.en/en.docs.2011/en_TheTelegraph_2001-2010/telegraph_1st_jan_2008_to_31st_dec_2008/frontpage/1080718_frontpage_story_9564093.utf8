  - After HRD prod, cinemas to screen anti-ragging clips          PRIYA ABRAHAM      
	Bhubaneswar, July 17: Next time in the movie theatre, before you get to watch the hero get into his sing-and-tease routine with a harassed heroine on the first day of college, expect an anti-ragging message to pop up on the screen.        
	Orissa will be joining several states of the country that are showing a 20-second anti-ragging clip in cinemas before the screening of a movie or during intervals.        
	The move was planned by the Union human resource development ministry to coincide with the beginning of the new academic session. The directorate of advertising and visual publicity is spearheading the campaign and the ministry has issued a circular in this regard.         
	D.P. Pattnaik, the information officer in the directorate of field publicity, explained that the anti-ragging clip was supposed to be screened at theatres across the country from July onwards. However, procedural delays postponed the move. But, the problem would be soon sorted out, he said.         
	The decision comes in the wake of the Supreme Court pressing the HRD ministry to be more pro-active and put an end to the malpractice.         
	The messages will certainly be a positive effort by the government to check the menace. Youngsters would be receptive to messages if they are presented in an audio-visual, said B.N. Pattnaik, the principal of BJB Autonomous College, one of the premier educational institutions in the state.        
	Though instances of ragging in Orissa is not as prevalent as it is in other states, with growing number of educational institutes in the state, there is a major concern. The move therefore comes at a right time, said Banabihari Mohanty, the professor at the Acadamy of Management and Information Technology.         
	Following the UGC guidelines, city colleges have already printed anti-ragging measures in prospectus and application forms.        
	Orissa cinema audiences are expected to return after realising the ill effects of ragging and know the difference between reel and real life  and what a films hero might do and an ordinary boy or girl cannot.

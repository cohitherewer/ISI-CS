The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Severe pilot crunch hits training in IAF
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Severe pilot crunch hits training in IAF
          SUJAN DUTTA                             Attrition blues                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: The Indian Air Force has lost pilots at such a high rate that it is now unable to train fliers in adequate number for the new aircraft that are joining its squadrons, an audit report has found.         
	Between 2001 and 2006, 305 fighter pilots, 189 helicopter pilots and 148 transport pilots have left the force. This means that an average of 107 pilots left the service each year for six years.         
	However, only an average of 167 pilots was inducted into the air force every year in that period.         
	This leaves a huge gap in the fighting capability of the force that is already struggling to keep its strength to the desired level of 39.5 squadrons. The strength is down to about 32 squadrons currently.         
	A report of the Comptroller and Auditor General has found that between 2001 and 2006, the IAF planned to train and induct 1,100 pilots for its fighter planes, transport aircraft and helicopters but there was a shortfall of 15 to 31 per cent.         
	A tally of the shortfall for each of the years compiled in the report, called PA 5 of 2008, puts the total at 292.         
	The IAF had set itself a target of training and inducting 220 pilots each year during 2001-05 and 110 pilots in 2006.         
	The IAFs requirement of trained pilots will substantially increase during 2008-18 to meet expansion needs of IAF squadrons, and fill up backlog vacancies and also the vacancies arising from high attrition rates in recent years, the report said.         
	But the IAF has not implemented any effective training strategy for meeting the increased intake requirements by addressing problems related to limitations of air space/runway occupancy and other infrastructural constraints, it added.         
	For 15 years, the IAF has put off drawing up and implementing the long-term training programme. Instead, it has opted to work on the basis of ad hoc plans for short periods of two years each.         
	Even the targets set in the interim plans have not been met because of a combination of factors  from lack of infrastructure to a high attrition rate because of lucrative offers from private airlines to IAF pilots.         
	The IAF is currently evaluating offers from six global firms to buy 126 (seven squadrons) medium multi-role fighter aircraft for about $10 billion.         
	The first of the aircraft is expected only in 2012 but it takes at least that much time to train fighter pilots and make them fully operational.         
	In the CAGs opinion, even the existing capacity to train 270 pilots a year (including for the Indian Navy and the coast guard) may not be adequate enough to meet the increased requirement of the IAF.

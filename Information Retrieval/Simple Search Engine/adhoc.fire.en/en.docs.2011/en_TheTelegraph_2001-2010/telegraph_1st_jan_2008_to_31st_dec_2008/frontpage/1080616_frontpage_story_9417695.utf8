  - Session chalks out roadmap for poll         RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Sonia Gandhi                                        
	New Delhi, June 15: As the Congress gropes for a way out of the rut, a roadmap has come from the state where the party suffered its worst defeat after coming to power at the Centre in 2004.        
	The Gujarat Congress has taken the lead in organising a chintan shivir, to be followed by similar introspection camps by other state units and the partys central establishment.        
	Sources said the proposals from the June 7-8 shivir in Dwarka anticipate the expected recommendations from the high-level committee set up by Sonia Gandhi to plot a strategy for the next lot of elections.        
	Some of the 75 ideas thrown up at the Gujarat brainstorming are:        
	 Finalise candidates a month before Assembly polls and three months ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. The central Congresss assessment is that while the second is practical, the first is not.        
	Digvijay Singh, the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, is already trying to identify parliamentary candidates from the state. But its the wrong area for a pilot project because we arent finding ticket-seekers (in Uttar Pradesh), a source rued.        
	 If candidates cannot be announced on time, at least the women nominees should be told well in advance. They take longer to form networks on the ground because of gender and social biases, a source said.        
	 Drop as many sitting members as possible; bring in new faces.        
	 Prune the state and district units and reduce the tenure of office-bearers to two or three years (they now continue indefinitely because organisational polls are rarely, if ever, held on schedule).        
	 Abolish the state leaders loyalist quota. That is, do not allow the office-bearers, including the state president, to form their own teams and create a clutch of vested interests.        
	Some members asked that independent panels of senior leaders, who do not hold formal positions in the party, be set up to recommend names for the state committees. Also, the party should stop leaving posts vacant for too long.        
	 While selecting poll candidates, the choices of the block and district committees should be honoured to ensure their co-operation.        
	 Central office-bearers in charge of states should spend at least 15 days every month in their work areas and not hang around the party headquarters in Delhi.        
	 Accountability should be fixed even on senior officials. Asked where the buck will stop, a source said: Realistically speaking, with the state president or the general secretary. But not further up.        
	Bharatsinh Solanki, who offered to resign as Gujarat unit president after the December 2007 rout, has appealed to the central leaders to take a decision and not keep him hanging because he was unable to work.

          OUR BUREAU                            Manmohan Singh at the inauguration of the Baglihar power project on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Srinagar/New Delhi, Oct. 10: Kashmir erupted today amid a two-day trip by the Prime Minister, leaving two dead and 70 injured as mobs protesting the visit clashed with police.        
	Manmohan Singh expressed grief over the deaths, offered to solve Valley youths resentment through dialogue, and said he was open to talks with all sections, even those who have so far opted to stay out of the political process.        
	He, however, disappointed the Hurriyat moderates hopes of separate talks with them today as he met mainstream parties, with whom the separatists had refused to share a platform.        
	Singh remained non-committal on when the state elections would be held but promised free polling. Sources in Delhi, however, said the Centre had recently told the Election Commission it was prepared to hold the polls virtually anytime.        
	The Prime Minister ruled out any redrawing of the countrys borders but added: While we cannot change the borders, we can make them irrelevant.        
	He cited the initiative to start trade across the Line of Control and added: We are making efforts where borders will not matter... a Kashmiri living in Srinagar or Muzaffarabad should not feel any difference.        
	Singhs remarks came as Srinagar, ending a months relative calm, teetered on the brink of chaos over the two deaths  one in a direct hit by a tear gas shell and the other from a police bullet.        
	One of them had his skull broken by the impact of possibly a tear gas shell, said a doctor at Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences. We tried hard to save his life but couldnt.        
	Thousands had poured on the streets in Srinagar and other towns after the Friday prayers to protest the visit by Singh, who is here to inaugurate the Baglihar power project and a railway line and to meet mainstream parties. The injured include around 30 police and CRPF personnel.        
	We have not imposed curfew so far, Srinagar police chief Ahfad-ul Mujtaba said.        
	The Valley had been largely peaceful during Ramazan, and the authorities had met with rare success on October 6 when they successfully aborted a march to Lal Chowk, reviving hopes that the separatist movement was beginning to lose steam.        
	The Union home ministry has told the poll commission the situation is normal in the Valley, and that it could provide enough security forces whenever elections were held, sources in Delhi said.        
	A PTI report quoted officials as saying the Centre was ready for a three to four-phase election next month.        
	A three-member team, led by home secretary Madhukar Gupta, told chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswamy at a recent meeting that enough forces had been sent to the state during the Amarnath pilgrimage and the land-transfer agitation.        
	The BJP wants immediate elections while the Congress has left it to the poll panel. Kashmir-based parties say they would abide by the commissions decision although they believe the atmosphere isnt conducive to polls.                    
	Officials say Pakistan has revved up efforts to help infiltrators sneak in before winter to try and destabilise the situation enough to make polls impossible.        
	Delhi, however, is hoping that initiatives such as opening of cross-LoC trade would create the right atmosphere for elections.

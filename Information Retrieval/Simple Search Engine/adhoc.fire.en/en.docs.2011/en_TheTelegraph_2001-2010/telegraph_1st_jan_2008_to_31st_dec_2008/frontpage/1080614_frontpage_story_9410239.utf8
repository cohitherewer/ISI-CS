Vodka bests Scotch
          AMIT ROY                             Singer Amy Winehouse, nicknamed Wino, is a role model for vodka drinkers                                   
	London, June 13: Vodka has overtaken Scotch for the first time to become Britons favourite spirit, according to the latest figures from the UKs Off Licence News.         
	Vodka, used as a cocktail base, is now outselling traditional blended whiskies. Drinkers spent 747 million (around Rs 6,274 crore) on vodka in shops, supermarkets and off-licences in the 12 months to April, an increase of 11 per cent in one year. Sales of blended Scotch increased by only 1 per cent to 742 million.         
	This is a landmark moment for one of our most treasured national drinks. While Scotch has lots of heritage, which has propelled sales overseas, at home its had a tough time appealing to a younger audience, Rosie Davenport, from Off Licence News, reported.        
	Until recently, vodka, more fashionable and popular with younger customers  some see whisky as a stuffy old mans drink  was the best-selling spirit in pubs. But in off-licences, whisky was the top seller. At parties, Indians who have stepped fresh off the boat, still ask for whisky, not realising this is so yesterday.         
	In India, moves are under way by Vijay Mallyas UB group to increase sales of both whisky and vodka.         
	Analysts say premium vodka brands and strong marketing have won over drinkers as whisky has struggled to find new customers. That about 230,000 Polish immigrants, who traditionally favour vodka over whisky, registered to work in Britain between May 2004 and March 2006 might also have made a difference.        
	The figures reveal that blended whiskies, such as Bells, Teachers and Famous Grouse, have been knocked off the top spot by vodka from Absolut and Smirnoff.         
	However, vodkas primacy was disputed by the Scotch Whisky Association, whose spokesperson, David Williamson, pointed out: If you take blended and malts together, more people drink whisky than vodka. Whisky is still Scotlands most important export last year, with exports worth 2.82 billion.         
	Malt whisky sales rose five per cent to 130 million.         
	The influence of role models in the rise and rise of vodka cannot be discounted.         
	For example, it has been reported: She has had half of Colombia up her nose, but now Amy Winehouse has turned to Russia for her latest hits. The crack-smoking jazz diva has taken up Prince Harrys former favourite pastime  of snorting neat vodka up her hooter.         
	It is further claimed that last year soldier boy Harry, 23, was caught on camera inhaling a shot up the royal snout while on holiday with girlfriend Chelsy Davy. And it seems Amy, 24, had a go at the potentially lethal game during another of her wild nights out at Londons trendy Bungalow 8 with (Page 3) pals Kelly Osbourne, Kimberly Stewart, Miquita Oliver and Mark Ronson. Medics say its dangerous because it gets alcohol absorbed directly into the bloodstream. (Drinkers would say that was precisely the intention).         
	According to an insider, the singer was the life and soul  she sat next to Kelly and Miquita when she covered one nostril, tilted her head back and sucked the vodka shot down her open nostril through a straw. She threw back her head and reeled in shock and everyone around her looked stunned.         
	Winehouse, nicknamed Wino, performed the stunt after a round of 20 shots was brought to her table.         
	The source added: She necked the top of the shot and lit the rest with a lighter. Then she grabbed a straw and sucked what was left up her nose.         
	Such antics do have an influence with the young who tend to emulate the behaviour of their pop star heroes.

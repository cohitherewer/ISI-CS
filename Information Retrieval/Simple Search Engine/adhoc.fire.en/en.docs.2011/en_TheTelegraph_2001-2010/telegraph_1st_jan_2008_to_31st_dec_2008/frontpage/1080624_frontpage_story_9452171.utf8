       When it comes to north indian fare, Nondon Bagchi cannot stop talking about chef Aftab at Kalash in HHI                        Pictures by Rashbehari Das      
	A couple of years ago when I visited a restaurant  just newly opened, off AJC Bose Road  I walked in for lunch and found that it was a multi-cuisine place  Indian, Oriental and Continental  which is the usual formula. Personally I am not too fond of these three-in-one establishments, though Tangerine, on Outram Street, I consider an exception. But even here, each visit will mean dining only on one style at a time. I prefer not to mix and mismatch.  
	So that day, at lunch, I decided to stay with Indian, which was in fact basically north Indian  Mughlai and Punjabi. It was an enjoyable meal, and at one stage I remarked that the full-bodied, robust gravies with their individuality of taste, hue and texture, reminded me of the hand of Aftab Khan, who looks after Kalash, the Indian restaurant at Hotel Hindusthan International.   
	The young man who was overseeing our meal that day, looked at me in some surprise, and said slightly sheepishly, Actually, I worked under Aftab bhai for quite some time and I learnt quite a few of these dishes from him.   
	In the corporate world of five-star hotels, it is rare to find someone associated with one place for over 20 years, but such is the case with chef Aftab, who has been with Kalash since its inception. It is also rare these days to find someone in charge of a five-star outlet who gained most of his knowledge in the field, so to speak, without attending any catering college or institute of hotel management. Again, such is the case with chef Aftab.   
	Born in 1957 in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, he recalls his youth with a smile and a twinkle in his eye. I didnt get myself a proper education. I wasnt much interested in that. I was actually much better at swatting flies!   
	At age 14 or 15 years he moved to Allahabad where he spent some time in a hostel where they cooked their own meals  and this part he remembers fondly  taking turns to cook the rotis, dal or main course, the camaraderie they shared, and so on. It didnt last very long and then came his first job at the princely salary of Rs 60 per month, to run a small tea shop where they also sold snacks.   
	A gentleman he referred to as haji sahab ran a restaurant opposite the tea shop and he noticed Aftabs dedication and hard work and hired him to look after the tandoor preparations and so began an odyssey which took him through Lucknow, Benaras, Kanpur and Delhi, cooking up chaaps, biryanis and curries in Mughlai restaurants very like the ones we have in Park Circus and then into his five-star kitchen  the Taj Ganges in Varanasi  and finally here at Kalash, in early 1988.  
	The menu has seen many modifications; I first visited Kalash in 1997, and have made many visits since then. It is surely one of my favourite places for north Indian fare. At present, the menu is more compact than I have seen so far, with just nine or 10 items listed under each of the four categories  non-veg kebabs, veg kebabs, non-veg main course and veg main course. Plus biryanis, breads and dessert, and a new section called Bangla Ranna with nine time-tested favourites.   
	My favourites from the current menu are Bhutte Mutter Ki Shammi  corn kernals and green peas shaped into shammi kebab-like rounds and done in a tandoor; Gobi Hariyali  baby cornflower florets marinated in coriander mint and green chilli; Mahi Tikka Sarsonwali  large chunks of bekti in a mustard marinade cooked in a tandoor and Adraki Chaap  lamb chops marinated with ginger, garlic and red chilli. This is among the kebab/starter section.   
	Among the main course items, Murgh Tikka Lababdar is an Aftab classic with a thick onion-tomato gravy; there is also Hariyali Gosht and Rogan Josh which are available widely but at Kalash they are excellent. I wont say the best, because that is a subjective matter. The vegetarian main course selection is arguably one of the most varied and imaginative you will find, and as for Dal-e-Kalash, just give me their crisp, thin, pure atta tandoori roti, a pickle and some raita and I can make a meal of it.   
	Calcuttans are thrifty. Give us something half as good at one-third the price, and we might bite. But Kalash deserves a heavier footfall.

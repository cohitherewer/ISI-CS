The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bond film name was my idea, says Craig
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Bond film name was my idea, says Craig

	London, Sept. 29: Daniel Craig has disclosed that the baffling name of the new Bond film, Quantum of Solace, was his idea.         
	The 007 star rejected more conventional titles during a brainstorming session with the producers. Quantum of Solace is the name of a little-known short story by Ian Fleming. Its announcement last year as the title of the 22nd Bond adventure had fans scratching their heads.        
	However, according to Craig, all Bond titles are essentially nonsense.        
	Asked if he agreed with fans who have laughed at the new name, Craig told GQ: No, because I was involved in making the decision.         
	Names were coming out, some ludicrous stuff was going back and forth  I cant remember exactly, but you know the sort of thing: The Blood On Your Face. I knew I didnt want death, die, bleed or any of those things in the title.        
	We had it written down on boards and wed literally go and sit in rooms and stare at this title. If you look at Qs, theyre really weird in a title.        
	As soon as it came out, people were saying: Ooh, it sounds like Harry Potter. No, its Quantum of Solace. I was saying: Its a Bond title! The name of a Bond film is not about anything. Live And Let Die? Octopussy? What does it mean? It means very little. Weve got nothing to worry about.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Orissa High Court                                  
	Cuttack, Sept. 13: The Supreme Court has stayed the Orissa High Court order restraining incumbent state higher education secretary Madhusudan Padhi from drawing his salary.        
	Acting on a state government petition the two-judge bench of justices Arijit Pasayat and J.M. Panchal stayed the state high court ruling on Friday.        
	On August 21 the high court had ruled restraining Padhi from drawing his salary with effect from September. The ruling was prompted by non-compliance of a court order issued on May 9, 2003.         
	While initiating contempt proceedings the high court also issued orders for a personal appearance on September 15, fixing the date to pronounce punishment.         
	The state government, however, took the matter to the Supreme Court with the plea that the contempt case was initiated when Ramesh Chandra Behera was holding office as the higher education secretary.         
	In fact, Behera had also made a personal appearance before the high court. So there is no rationale behind restraining Madhusudan Padhi, the incumbent higher education secretary from drawing his salary.         
	Padhi, who was the revenue divisional commissioner had taken charge in July only, the government argued.         
	The high court had imposed the embargo in an interim order on a contempt case involving a direction for release of salary as per University Grants Commission (UGC) pay scale to a lec- turer. Jatindra Sabat had filed the complaint.

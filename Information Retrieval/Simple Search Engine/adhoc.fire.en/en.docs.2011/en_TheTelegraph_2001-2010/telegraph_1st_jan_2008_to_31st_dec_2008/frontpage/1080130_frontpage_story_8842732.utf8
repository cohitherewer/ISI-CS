										      NONDON BAGCHI tries out Kurry Klub rsquo;s latest offering.                      The seafood platter at Kurry Klub.  Picture by  Rashbehari Das                          
	The third of Calcuttas Kurry Klubs opened during Durga Puja. The first one, on Sarat Bose Road, started 14 years ago and in those days the concept of an Italian restaurant (Mexican was added later) in the heart of south Calcutta was a novel one, and in fact it was quite a courageous thing to do. But that first branch has stood the test of time and in 2004, Kurry Klub opened in Kankurgachhi, focussing mainly on Oriental cuisine, and now there is the new one at 55A Mirza Ghalib (Free School) Street, where the USP is seafood.        
	The man behind Kurry Klub, Pradip Rozario, has to be considered something of a pioneer in the citys culinary scene, not only for introducing various styles of international cuisine, but also for evolving his unique brand of fusion food, which is available at the fourth restaurant he runs, KKs Fusion, on Narkeldanga Road, right next to Swabhumi. This is where he is in his true element, experimenting and innovating, using Indian makhani gravies in pasta dishes, marinating tikka kebabs in Sichuan sauce and serving curried paneer on a bed of noodles  and with a remarkable degree of success.        
	While the new Kurry Klubs USP is their seafood, the approach to many of the dishes is typical of Rozario  unexpected and adventurous combinations of ingredients yet with quite delicious end results.        
	I dropped in there for lunch the other day and the first thing they did was to show me the blue crabs they prepare there. Brought in from Kerala, these are soft-shelled crabs which have moulted their hard shells and the newly-formed shells are thin, crunchy and edible. I have not come across this particular variety anywhere.         
	They were prepared in an Oriental style and served with a spicy aioli  a sauce with a mayonnaise base. The crabs are marinated with salt, pepper, egg and flour and then deep-fried. They are then sauteed with black mushroom, babycorn, bell peppers, spring onions, soya sauce, wine and red chilli flakes. The dish is called Le Grand Aioli.         
	Another fine item is Grilled Prawns with Spring Onion Sauce. Large tiger prawns are grated and then sauteed in a cream sauce containing spring onions. These are topped with a preparation made with minced shrimps and then served with Nasi Goreng, the celebrated Indonesian fried rice flavoured with soya sauce and curry powder and cooked with vegetables, meat, seafood or omelette.        
	Smoked Lobster and Potato Salad is one of their specials. Lobster meat cleaned and thoroughly washed is marinated for about an hour in red chilli paste, garlic, yoghurt, chopped parsley and seasoning. The lobster is then smoked in a clay oven and served on a bed of chilled, mayonnaise-coated potato salad garnished with chopped mustard leaves and capers.         
	Seafood menus usually have some hearty soups and this is true of Kurry Klub as well. I have not tried them but they sound interesting. Floating Market Seafood Soup is a soup where ingredients available in the market when they are fresh and in season go in. Right now they are using bean sprouts, basil, chilli, coriander leaves, vermicelli, prawns and fish fillets. Mexican Tomato Soup with Assorted Seafood is another.         
	They have one squid item  Wok-fried Squid marinated in Chilli Garlic sauce as well.         
	But it is far from true to say that all you get here is seafood. Popular items from all the Kurry Klubs and also KKs are on the menu at Mirza Ghalib Street. Fondues (one cheese and one spinach), pastas, lasagnas, bakes, risottos, tacos, nachos and enchiladas from the Sarat Bose Road menu. Oriental items from the Kankurgachhi selection and a number of KKs favourite including a Fusion Kebab selection which come to the table hanging on skewers, are to be found here. There is a healthy vegetarian selection too  in part as substantial as the non-veg and I would say its a 50-50 choice. And the Rozario signature is everywhere, with a surprise ingredient or an unusual accompaniment in most dishes.         
	Chef owners (a term used in hotel and restaurant circles) are not very common here, but Rozario is one. At KKs mainly, he still spends a lot of time in the kitchen. Last October, the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India conferred on him the Young Hotel Chef Award for 2007. The citation makes special mention of his having created his own dishes and designed his own menus and in general his success with fusion food. Not surprisingly.

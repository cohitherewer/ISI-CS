The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Shah Rukh fan, Lalu AC
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Shah Rukh fan, Lalu AC

	Fan Shah Rukh has met his AC. Lalu Prasad, equally at ease preaching rural brethren on caste issues and lecturing IIM students on the turnaround of Indian Railways, today took the test to see if he was smarter than a fifth-grader during a guest appearance on Kya Aap Paanchvi Paas Se Tez Hain, the quiz show hosted by King Khan.         
	The show on STAR Plus has so far had indifferent response, primarily because of the IPL T20 league, which ate into its viewership, but the channel and its producers are banking on the ratings picking up once the tournament gets over on Sunday.         
	As part of the plan to bolster ratings, the producers have lined up several episodes with celebrity guests, including one with the current hot couple Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor.        
	But the showstopper is expected to be the one featuring Lalu Prasad.         
	We have lined up a special episode for the grand finale scheduled on June 20 with Lalu Prasad, Priyanka Chopra and Harman Baweja, said Anita Kaul Basu of Synergy Adlabs, which produces Paanchvi.        
	Lalu Prasad seems to be making a habit of appearing on such shows. Last year, the railway minister wowed audiences with his inspiring speech on music and government systems in an episode of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge on Zee TV.         
	Today, he charmed Shah Rukh during the shoot.        
	This is the first time that I have come to an event on time and it is because of Laluji. As a star, one gets many privileges. One of them is getting to meet people like Lalu Prasad. I am his fan, said the actor.        
	The minister, known for his wordplay, was so fast with his repartee that he left even the quick-witted actor speechless. If Shah Rukh is my fan, I am his AC (air-conditioner), he replied.        
	As King Khan played teacher, Lalu Prasad took a crack at questions ranging from geography  the location of Golaghar  to, of course, the railways  how many digits does the railway ticket PNR have.         
	He also spoke about his student days.        
	Later, Priyanka and debutant Baweja, who will be seen together in Love Story 2050, shot for the same episode.        
	Shah Rukh has filmed some episodes with celebrity guests earlier, too. They will all be telecast after the IPL gets over. We have obviously taken a hit because of that, said Basu.

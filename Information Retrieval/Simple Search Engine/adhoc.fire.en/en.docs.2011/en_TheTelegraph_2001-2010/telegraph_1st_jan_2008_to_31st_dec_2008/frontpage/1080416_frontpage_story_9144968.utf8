                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bullet Bonds jailed for three days
  - Americans spotted ammo clip in umbrella in Darjeeling but chose to clam up        OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Heather Bond (in front) and Monica on the way to the Siliguri court from the lock-up on the premises. A Telegraph picture                                        
	Siliguri, April 15: The American women arrested in the bullet case had become aware of the ammunition in Darjeeling by chance but chose to proceed to Bagdogra airport with the lethal luggage  a mistake that has sent them to jail for at least three days.        
	Monica Bond, 57, and her daughter Heather K. Bond, 37  tourists from Santa Barbara in California  were today sent to judicial custody for three days, but they have been charged under the Indian Arms Act that carries prison terms ranging from three to seven years.        
	The Bonds told investigators that they had stumbled on the clip of 11 bullets in their luggage in Darjeeling, where they had gone after coming through Bagdogra airport last week. The ammunition was inside a folded umbrella. During their stay in Darjeeling, they took out the umbrella when it was raining one day and found the loaded clip, a police officer said.        
	Had the Bonds told authorities of the discovery of bullets immediately, they would have been treated leniently. However, an officer added: Since they did not have any documents for the bullets, we would have had to charge them anyway.        
	A factor that could still work in the Bonds favour is their reported clean record in the US. The FBI has faxed some details about my clients, confirming that they do not have any criminal record in the US, their lawyer Abhay Prasad Chatterjee said. Their passports are valid and they have visas till August 4 this year.        
	The two were detained yesterday at Bagdogra airport when the security staff of Deccan found the bullets in a 9mm pistol clip in one of their backpacks while scanning their registered baggage. Monica, a retired nurse, and Heather, an employee of Californias forest and fire protection department, were scheduled to board Deccans Flight 619 to Delhi via Guwahati.        
	Darjeeling police chief Rahul Srivastava said the Bonds failed to produce any document that allowed them to carry ammunition apart from an expired gun licence. The two said the bullets had been in the travel bag from an earlier trip in the US and were brought to India by mistake.        
	In California, Heathers boyfriend Sean McGaughey last night told Santa Barbara Daily Sound, a local daily, that the bullets belonged to him and had probably found their way into the bag on one of the couples trips in the Santa Barbara backcountry, where they regularly carry weapons.        
	Lawrence Bond, Monicas husband, said the bullets went through security at four airports, including Los Angeles, before being detected. The Daily Sound quoted him saying: The weird thing is they went through security at LA, Taipei and New Delhi at least twice.         
	The newspaper said McGaughey has already faxed his licence for the 9mm pistol to officials concerned. I am worried and sick. Ive been up ever since trying to pull strings and get some action. Theyre so far away and that was my concern before they left, that if anything happened, how was I going to help them? Lawrence was quoted as saying.        
	Today, at 12.20pm, the Bonds were produced in the additional chief judicial magistrates court in Siliguri. We sought legal help and have a lawyer now. He is yet to tell us the charges against us, Monica told reporters while walking to the court lock-up. The police have also informed our embassy officials in India.        
	The bail plea forwarded by me was rejected, lawyer Chatterjee said. The court asked the police to place the case diary on April 18 and sent them to jail. The women were taken to Siliguri Special Jail this evening.         
	Chatterjee said officials from Santa Barbara and the American consulate in Calcutta had contacted him.

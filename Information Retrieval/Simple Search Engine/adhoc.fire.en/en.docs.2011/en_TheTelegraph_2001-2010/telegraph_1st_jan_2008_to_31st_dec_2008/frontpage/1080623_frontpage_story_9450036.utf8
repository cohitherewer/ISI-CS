	London, June 22: The haunting song of the worlds biggest animal, the blue whale, is getting deeper, researchers have discovered.         
	Underwater recordings of the giant endangered mammals have revealed that the tone of their rhythmic pulses and moans has become steadily lower as their population have slowly recovered after being nearly wiped out by whaling.        
	Marine biologists believe the changes offer a new insight into blue whale culture as entire populations alter the tone of their songs as they grow in numbers.         
	Professor John Hildebrand, a blue whale expert at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego, has used recordings of blue whales since the 1960s to track the changes in their songs.         
	He found that in 1962 blue whale calls were at a frequency of around 22Hz, well below the range of human hearing, but last year had decreased even further in frequency to around 15Hz.         
	He said: This is giving us an insight into the culture of blue whales as they are clearly listening to each others songs and changing them. It takes a conscious decision to make the calls deeper, so it is a reflection of what is going on in the population.        
	These animals have a finite lung capacity, so their songs are a trade off between frequency and volume. They can either make the song really loud or really deep, Hildebrand said.

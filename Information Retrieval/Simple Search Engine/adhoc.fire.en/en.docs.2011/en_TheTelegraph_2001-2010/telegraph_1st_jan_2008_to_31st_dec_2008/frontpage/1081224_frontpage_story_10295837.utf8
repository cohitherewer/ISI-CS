The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Endgame looms   on Abdullahs
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Endgame looms   on Abdullahs
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             Farooq Abdullah                                         
	Srinagar, Dec. 23: Their long lease on power was rudely snatched away in 2002. Now, six years later, the once-hallowed house of the Abdullahs appears to be fighting an even longer banishment from Kashmirs political centre stage.         
	Phase after phase in this long-drawn campaign in the Valley, the Mufti-Mehbooba combine of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has become more ebullient, the Abdullahs of the National Conference have turned more desperate. The lull before tomorrows final round in Srinagar could be the eerie eve of the clans second humbling.         
	It cant be a good sign if Farooq Abdullah has to scurry, last minute, to file papers from a second seat. It cannot be a good sign if he is not sure and safe even with two. It cant be a good sign if he has to leap out of bed early in this chill to go on a door-to-door SOS mission in his neighbourhood borough of Sonwar a day after the official end of campaigning.         
	It cannot be a good sign if his son and National Conference chief Omar has no more than the company of a solitary partyman as he mulls departure to New Delhi for a Christmas break. It cannot be a good sign if he is telling you he is not repeating the 2002 mistake of putting our carts far ahead of our horses this time. Back then, we had begun to look for a chief secretary and a police head well before the results came, not this time, Omar says. There is no doubt we are winning this one, but fingers crossed.         
	Memories of the ignominious ouster of 2002 perhaps haunt the young Abdullah enough to keep him tethered to caution. Omar lost in Ganderbal in that election and was left stunned and alone beneath a chinar tree outside the counting station as the bad news poured in from all across.         
	But there could be reasons of more recent origin that prevent him making unbridled claims. Chief among them is the sour turn of his own fathers pulpit rhetoric in the penultimate weeks campaigning. In what many see as a sign of resignation, the senior Abdullah has been blaming separatists for helping out the PDP  he has been blaming secessionist spearheads like Syed Ali Shah Geelani for asking his cadres to go out and vote.         
	This is the sign of a desperate man, remarked a retired bureaucrat who had worked closely with the senior Abdullah during his chief ministerial years.         
	Instead of attacking the PDP and its policies, he has trained his guns on people who have boycotted these elections. Are we to think Farooq Abdullah senses the vote is going against him?         
	There are other causes for the Abdullahs to worry  the thinning out of attendance in their meetings, the widely reported indifference of party cadres, the march of the PDPs green brigade into newer and newer areas of the Valley. A day before the end of campaign, hundreds of PDP rallyists clashed with supporters of Ali Mohammed Sagar of the National Conference in Khanyar in downtown Srinagar.         
	As a senior local journalist remarked: Sagar had the separatists to fear because the downtown is their fortress, but even I am a little surprised the PDP could stage such a battle there, this is not their territory, they have obviously spread beyond their south Kashmir bases.         
	It has not helped the Abdullahs that they are seen as pro-India and possessed of the blessings of New Delhi, whatever the truth of the latter claim. They were the ones who spoke for elections when the Valley was still convulsing under the fallout of the Amarnath land row; they were the ones who backed an agreement still seen as a sellout in the Valley; they are the ones who said Pakistan, or targets in Pakistan, should be bombed following the Mumbai terror attack. All of those positions have run against the mood in the Valley.         
	The PDP has benefited by the sheer contrast it has been to the Abdullahs and the National Conference. It opposed elections initially and became a late and reluctant participant, it stands opposed to the Amarnath accord, it has stayed well clear of apportioning blame for the Mumbai attack and has remained even farther from suggesting action against Pakistan.         
	They have played their cards well and in consonance with the present sentiment, conceded a National Conference leader. Actually, many among us thought the PDP will also boycott the polls, that is why our leadership was in a hurry to push it.         
	Once the PDP came into play, virtually at the eleventh hour, the Abdullahs were taken by a sense of panic. What probably took them by even greater surprise was the high turnout, especially in rural areas. It has been the widely agreed wisdom of this election that low turnouts would have helped the National Conference  a cadre-based party with the machinery, however rusty  to get its supporters to the polling booths.         
	The high turnout, many believe, is prompted somewhere by a subliminal urge to teach a lesson to those who thought they could impose an election on Kashmir at a time they werent prepared. That cant be a good sign for the Abdullahs either.

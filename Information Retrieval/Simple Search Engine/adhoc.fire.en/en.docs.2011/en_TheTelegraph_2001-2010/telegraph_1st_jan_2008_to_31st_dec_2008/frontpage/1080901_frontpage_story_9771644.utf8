The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bumpy road to nuclear waiver
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bumpy road to nuclear waiver
          JAYANTH JACOB AMP; RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: India will face a tough battle when the Nuclear Suppliers Group meets on September 4-5 to consider a revised US proposal to exempt Delhi from its nuclear trade guidelines, sources said today.        
	The reworked document was circulated among the member nations today, five days before the elite club sits in Vienna for its second meeting.         
	While India earnestly hoped to get a clean waiver, the sources cautioned that there was no place for absolute optimism, considering the varied views among some members of the NSG that decides by consensus.        
	It is a bloc of 45 countries. There are diverse views, and some of them find the clean exemption letting India circumvent the non-proliferation regime hard to grant. We cant accept extraneous conditions or prescriptions. The tenets of the July 18, 2005, Indo-US joint statement (issued after the George Bush-Manmohan Singh meeting on the deal) should be honoured, an official said.         
	India has made it clear it will not accept a waiver that is not clean and unconditional. National security adviser M.K. Narayanan echoed this line yesterday, when he was quoted as saying by a channel that the promises made by the government in Parliament were sacrosanct.        
	There is no question of change, cosmetic or otherwise. There are certain issues which have been drawn in red lines because those are the commitments which have been made by our PM. This is what we have said in Parliament. These red lines are sacrosanct and if these are not met, we cant endorse the agreement, he had said.        
	India has been saying it is ready to address the concerns of any NSG member but those cant be linked with the waiver.         
	The US Congress will hold its last session before a regime change from September 8, which means Singh will have to get re-elected or wait for his successor to pick up the baton and run the extra mile again for the deal to see the light of day.         
	The government is mainly counting on the USs ability to work on the opponents at the NSG and deliver what, as a source put it, was its part of the bargain.        
	The Congress has said there was no way it would approve of India crossing the red lines. A highly placed office-bearer said: The Prime Minister made certain commitments to Parliament and he is bound by that.        
	He rubbished the view that Singh might force his partys hand on accepting reworked and watered-down NSG guidelines. Not when we have elections round the corner.         
	Congress sources said they were aware that if this NSG sitting was also inconclusive, the government would miss the US Congressional deadline.         
	There is inspired talk about incorporating the USs wishes in the draft through semantic jugglery. This is not a work of diplomatic finesse. Its a hard-driven bargain, and it will be subject to close scrutiny by the Left and the BJP, especially the former. There is no way we can pull wool over their eyes.... Everything will be spelt out in black and white, a source said.        
	The Congress has put on hold the publicity campaign it was about to unleash once atomic watchdog IAEA had approved the India-specific safeguards agreement as it fears that a bad patch at the NSG would mean egg on its face.        
	Sources said in such a scenario, the best face-saver would be to tell people: We tried our best in supreme national interest and we were forced to give it up in supreme national interest.

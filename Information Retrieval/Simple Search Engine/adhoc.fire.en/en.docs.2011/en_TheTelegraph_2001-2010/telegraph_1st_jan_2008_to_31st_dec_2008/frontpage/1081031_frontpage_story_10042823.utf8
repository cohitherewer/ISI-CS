        OUR BUREAU        
	Oct. 31: Under attack for his campaign against north Indians, MNS chief Raj Thackeray today softened his stand on 'Chhat' puja, saying that he was not opposed to the festival being celebrated in Maharashtra but warned against it being used as a show of political strength.  
	 ldquo;I have never opposed Chhat Puja but only spoke against political 'tamasha' (stunt) associated with it.... People from Bihar who live here can perform the religious rituals according to the customs. My party has never opposed it, rdquo; he told reporters here.  
	 The MNS chief, whose detention under National Security Act has been demanded by some union ministers in the wake of attacks on north Indians in Maharashtra, warned that he would not tolerate disregard of the Marathi speaking people in the state. 	The Chhat festival will be celebrated on November 4. 	Thackeray also asked his supporters to exercise restraint and accused the media of distorting his views and spreading falsehood.  
	 Justifying the killing of a youth who had hijacked a bus in Mumbai, he said the police action was ldquo;proper rdquo; as no one knew from which state the youth came from. 	 rdquo;What if he had shot some commuters, then you people would have taken the police to task, rdquo; he said.  
	 Thackeray also downplayed the killing of a youth in a suburban train during a brawl with a group of youngsters.  
	 ldquo;Even the Railway police are saying that there has been no involvement of any political party, rdquo; he said. 	Besides, he recalled that in an incident sometime back, four Marathi youths where thrown out on tracks by a group of people from other states. ldquo;But no one said a word about the incident, rdquo; he said.

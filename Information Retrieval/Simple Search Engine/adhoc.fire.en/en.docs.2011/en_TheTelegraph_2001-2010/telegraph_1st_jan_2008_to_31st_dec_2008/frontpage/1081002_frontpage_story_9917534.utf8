- Why the hurry, asks magistrate in showcause to jailer, doctor           SHASHANK SHEKHAR                            JMM leader and Dumri MLA Jagannath Mahto being examined by Dr AK Sinha at Tenughat jail on September 27, the day he surrendered. Telegraph picture                                  
	Bokaro, Oct. 1: A magistrates court has taken umbrage at the way Dumri MLA Jagannath Mahto was rushed out of Tenughat jail to a premiere hospital of Ranchi within one-and-a-half hours of his much-publicised surrender last week.        
	D.K. Mishra, the first class magistrate of Tenughat, summoned the local jail superintendent and a physician yesterday to explain why they sent the JMM leader, wanted since 2003 in connection with a murder case, to the Ranchi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in such a hurry without taking permission of his court where he surrendered.        
	Issuing a showcause notice (no: 266/08) to Tenughat jail superintendent Ramesh Prasad and attending physician A.K. Sinha, Mishra asked the two to appear before him on Friday, the next date of hearing, to explain in detail what forced them to send the MLA to RIMS within one-and-half-hours of his surrender without the courts knowledge.        
	Mishra noted that since Mahto had surrendered in his court it was mandatory for jail authorities to take his permission before moving out the MLA from Tenughat.        
	When Jagannath Mahto was referred to jail after surrender and the attending doctor was asked to administer the best medical facilities, no permission was taken for transferring the MLA, the magistrate noted.         
	Mahtos case was revived after The Telegraph reported on September 10 that Bokaro district judge Mangal Murthy had ordered Bokaro SP Priya Dube to execute a permanent arrest warrant issued by the Tenughat fast-track court against the MLA way back on 3 April 2003.        
	Surprisingly, even after the judges order, the police did little to arrest the MLA, who continued to roam freely within the state, occasionally interacting with the media to brag about his invincibility and also attending the monsoon session of the Assembly.        
	On the day of his surrender on September 27, Mahto claimed he was doing so on his own will.         
	But he hardly spent time in jail even though Mishra ordered him to be sent there after denying him bail on health grounds  the magistrate, however, ordered that he receive medical treatment.        
	Sources now reveal that on the day of his surrender, Mahto did not see the inside of a jail cell.         
	Throughout the time he was at Tenughat jail  about one-and-a-half-hours  he was seated at the superintendents office along with a dozen supporters.        
	After that he was sent to Bermo sub-divisional hospital, 112km away.         
	After spending about three hours there, he left for Ranchi on his personal vehicle, a black airconditioned Scorpio without a licence plate.         
	At RIMS, Mahto has been ensconced in the airconditioned comfort of a cottage (nos: 3) where he is being showered with luxuries not usually made available to prisoners.         
	As reported in The Telegraph today, not only is Mahto being allowed to get food from outside, he is in constant company of his supporters. He has access to newspapers and has been allowed unlimited use of his cellphone.         
	The case dates back to August 11, 1985, when one Karam Mahto alleged in an FIR that he saw his nephew, Dilu Mahto, being murdered the day before. He blamed four persons, including Jagannath, for the killing.        
	Investigations led to a case being lodged under various sections, including 341, 323 and 302/34, of the IPC. A permanent arrest warrant was issued on April 3, 2003.        
	Surprisingly, Jagannath did not surrender in connection with the 2003 Dilu Mahto murder case.         
	Instead, his lawyer S.N. Dey cited a 1993 case registered in the Chandrapura police station relating to an altercation the MLA allegedly had with a teacher of Bhandaridah school.         
	He was booked under IPC sections, 147, 323 and 341, all of which were bailable.        
	But according to sources at the Tenughat court, there were three other cases registered against Jagannath.         
	And since he had not appeared in any of them, Jagannath had been remanded in all five pending cases.        
	On September 27, talking to this correspondent at the circuit house before surrendering, Jagannath blamed the media for making a mountain out of molehill in a case for which he wasnt guilty.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, May 2: Chief minister Tarun Gogoi today directed the home department to ask the CBI to probe the spurt in rhino poaching in the state.         
	Forest minister Rockybul Hussain said the chief minister had directed the home department to write to the investigating agency to probe the cases and expose those behind the heinous acts. Now everything will become clear, he said.         
	Hussain said he had requested the chief minister for a CBI probe on January 25 after a series of killings of rhinos that month. Most of these killings took place at Kaziranga National Park.         
	The minister pointed to a possible conspiracy behind the spurt in poaching. Poachers have let loose a reign of terror in two rhino habitats  Kaziranga National Park and Rajiv Gandhi National Park at Orang  killing 10 rhinos so far this year, including six this fortnight.         
	This has led the All Assam Students Union (AASU) to hint at a nexus between the poachers and a section of people in power. The students body had demanded an investigation by the CBI.         
	Natures Beckon, an NGO, had also demanded a CBI probe into the killings while cautioning that there could be a nexus between forest officials and poachers.         
	The AASU has called for statewide protests tomorrow against the killing of rhinos.

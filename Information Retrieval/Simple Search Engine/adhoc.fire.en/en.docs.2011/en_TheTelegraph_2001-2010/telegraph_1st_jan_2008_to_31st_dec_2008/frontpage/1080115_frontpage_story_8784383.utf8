 Army at CMC door for water 
   OUR BUREAU
        
	Calcutta, Jan. 14: The Burrabazar fire continued to burn, entering its fourth night with army sources suggesting that the turf-conscious state fire authorities were to blame.
 
	Army officers said they were allowed their own source of water only this afternoon after over two days of non-cooperation by fire officials.
 
	And yesterday, the fire services rejected our plan to blow up the top two floors of the Nandaram building with explosives, which would have stopped the blaze from spreading, a senior officer said.
 
	The fire did not spread much today. It stayed confined to floors 8 to 13 of Nandaram, only reaching the front side from the rear, but burnt as strong as last night. Flames still flickered from the top floors of the gutted 10-storey Kashiram building.
 
	Army officers said that frustrated by the fire brigades attitude, they had approached the civic body today.
 
	A senior army officer got in touch with the chief engineer, water supply, and sought access to the underground reservoir at Manohardas Katra (a market near Nandaram), a source in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation said.
 
	The reservoir was connected to the hydrants in the neighbourhood of Nandaram and the water made available for army use. The army was also given its own supply point at the Mullickghat pumping station, where the state fire tenders, too, were filling up, the source added.
 
	Officers said had they been given more independence right at the start, things could have been different.
 
	The water jets of the state fire services were not reaching the affected areas, said Major Anurag Trivedi as he supervised his mens firefight efforts with foam and carbon dioxide gas.
 
	The army had been denied use of the fire brigades lone aerial ladder on the first day, preventing the soldiers from spraying foam. The foam helped avert an explosion in the generator room yesterday when the troops took the stairs to the 12th floor.
 
	A second ladder was brought from Haldia this evening but developed a snag, halting plans to finally attack the fire from two sides. It was repaired and began working around midnight.
 
	There was some initial misunderstanding with the army but it was sorted out, fire minister Pratim Chatterjee said, adding the government would buy Rs 12 crore worth of firefighting equipment.
 
	The minister stirred controversy by refusing to meet a visiting team of ministers, MPs and MLAs from Rajasthan, the home state of most of the affected traders.
 
	We are shocked. He told us he had nothing to say about the fire and walked out of his chamber, said Sikar MP Subash Meharia of the BJP.
 
	The government has ordered a probe into the cause of the fire. We cannot say how long it will take to put out the fire, said Gopal Krishna Bhattacharya, state fire services deputy director.

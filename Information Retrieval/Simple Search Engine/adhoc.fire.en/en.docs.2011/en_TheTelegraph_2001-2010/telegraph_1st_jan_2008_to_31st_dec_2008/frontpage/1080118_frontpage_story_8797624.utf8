     OUR BUREAU
                          
	Jan. 17: The bird flu outbreak in Bengal is the most serious the country has seen and threatens to mirror the prolonged crisis faced by Bangladesh, Thailand and Vietnam, experts and the World Health Organisation warned today.
    
	Two factors make Bengal more favourable for fast spread of the H5N1 virus than the four other states affected in the past two years, an expert said.
    
	One, Bengal has more water bodies and marshland than Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh or Manipur. Two, its dense poultry population.
    
	Ducks and waterfowl in these water bodies might serve as virus carriers, the expert said. The fear is that waterfowl will pick up the virus from infected poultry and transmit it to more poultry.
    
	This is one factor behind the persistence of the virus in Thailand and Vietnam, the expert said. Bangladesh, as swampy a country as any, has reported 64 outbreaks in the past one year.
    
	An official in Delhi said Bengal had a higher density of poultry than the other four states. The human population density is also higher.
    
	The WHO added two more reasons. More serious risk factors are associated with this current outbreak than previously encountered, including that the affected areas are more widespread and (close to) border areas, PTI quoted it as saying.
    
	Burwan in Murshidabad and Nanoor in Birbhum joined the list of affected areas today, taking the count of confirmed bird flu-hit districts to three (see chart). Over 61,000 poultry birds have died in these districts.
    
	The WHO stressed public information and education, but villagers seemed unaware of the risk in worst-hit Birbhum, where the disease has been confirmed in eight blocks and deaths reported in two more, Bolpur and Luvpur.
    
	Thousands are in danger. They are handling and eating diseased and dead chicken, said Bengal animal resource development director Dilip Das.
    
	At Majharipara in Mayureswar I, villagers had dumped dead chicken in a field where children played with their feathers, putting them inside their mouths. Badal Tadu, an adult, was cooking a dead hen because I was given it free. Jiten Led was dressing another with bare hands: Well have it for dinner tonight.
    
	Although 85 per cent of the birds have died here, there has been no awareness camp, said Jamir Ali. Health officials passed through the village twice but spoke to no one.
    
	Authorities have warned people not to handle sick or dead poultry with bare hands.
    
	The culling teams achieved only 60 per cent of the days target of 25,000, suggesting the current overall target of 3.31 lakh would take over 20 days. But a central official said Bengal had promised to finish the job in five-six days.
    
	Bengal animal resource minister Anisur Rahman denied reports that the state had woken up late to the outbreak. He blamed the Centre, saying it had a couple of months ago announced that India was free of bird flu.

          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                    
	Chandigarh, Oct. 16: Hugely talented rebels like Avishek Jhunjhunwala have reason to be despondent: talks between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the outlawed Indian Cricket League (ICL) have failed.        
	I cant go into details as I must first take my board into confidence and, then, report to the executive board of the International Cricket Council (ICC).... All I can tell you is that talks have failed, BCCI president Shashank Manohar told The Telegraph this evening.        
	Manohar, who has been at the helm for less than three weeks, confirmed that Zee supremo Subhas Chandra (who is bankrolling the ICL) had telephoned him in New Delhi earlier in the day, some hours after hed returned from the ICC meeting in Dubai.         
	I did get a call from Mr Chandra, but the talks failed.... Nothing else is planned.... I have 21 days to report back to the ICC, Manohar said.        
	Till late at night, Chandra couldnt be reached for a comment. The ICL chairman, Kapil Dev, though, sounded more than disappointed.        
	I dont know all the specifics, but I understand the BCCI wants the ICL to be a closed chapter.... That, let me reiterate, is not possible.... Right now, I wouldnt like to say anything more.... Of course, Im unhappy at what happened, he told this newspaper.         
	Chandra made the first move within 48 hours of Manohar informing the ICCs executive board that he would, in a significant shift in position, hold discussions with the ICL.        
	The change, one learns, had come about after a prod from former BCCI president Sharad Pawar.        
	The ICC got into the picture after the ICL approached it for recognition.        
	Mr Chandra ought really to have moved the BCCI.... The ICC should only be approached if somebody wants to start a non-recognised form of the sport.... Twenty20 is very much an accepted form, pointed out somebody in the know of things.        
	Its not clear what the ICC will say, but its worth noting that the BCCI has considerable clout in the executive board and outside.        
	The Jhunjhunwalas, by the way, arent the only ones barred from official cricket. In the same boat are coaches and officials whove joined the ICL.        
	Makes todays development more unfortunate.

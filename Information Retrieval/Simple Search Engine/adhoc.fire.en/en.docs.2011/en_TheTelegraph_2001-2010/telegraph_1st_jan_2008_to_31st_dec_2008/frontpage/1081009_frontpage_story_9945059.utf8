          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Christians at a peace march in Delhi                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 8: A six-member Orissa police team that went to Delhi to persuade a nun, who was allegedly raped in Kandhamal on August 25, to return to the state and co-operate in the investigation has failed to trace her.        
	The state government today asked the all-woman team headed by inspector-general of police B. Radhika to return from Delhi. The police team has failed to trace the rape victim in Delhi. Efforts are on to contact her, state home secretary T.K. Mishra said, adding that three teams had been formed for the purpose.         
	The government has also requested church leaders to co-operate with the police so that the culprits can be brought to book. Additional resident commissioner S. Satyanarayana, stationed in New Delhi, had contacted archbishop Raphael Cheenath to know about the victims whereabouts. However, we have not received any response yet, Mishra said.        
	Recently, talking to some private TV channels, the nun had stated that she could identify the accused. This, apparently, prompted the search. A police team had visited the nuns native village in Sambalpur district, but failed to get much information. The police are planning to send another team to Kerala, a senior officer said.        
	Director-general of police Manmohan Praharaj yesterday said that the state police had assured protection to the nun. Praharaj said that though the main accused in the case had been arrested and steps were being initiated to expedite the investigation process, absence of the victim was proving to be a big hindrance. The culprits cannot be identified because she is missing, he said.        
	The police had arrested Somanath Pradhan, the main accused, from his Rajaghar village home in the Baliguda police station area on the basis of concrete evidence. Pradhan was the fifth person to be arrested in the case. Earlier, four people had been rounded up by the crime branch. More arrests are likely to be made soon, hinted crime branch superintendent of police Yatindra Koyal.        
	Meanwhile, a team of senior officials visited Kandhamal today and reviewed the implementation of a package announced by the chief minister.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Agartala, March 6: A brick hurled by a nephew who used to be his Man Friday ended former Tripura minister Vivekananda Bhowmiks evening stroll yesterday and his life this morning.        
	Bhowmik, 78, set off from his residence at Dhaleshwar in Agartala around 5pm and had walked for around 15 minutes in a nearby lane when his nephew Usharanjan Roychowdhury let fly the brick without warning. It struck the back of his head and he never regained consciousness.        
	The former CPM leader, who was a minister in the first Left Front government in Tripura in the late seventies, was declared dead at 7.30am.         
	Usharanjan, 38, made no attempt to flee after committing the crime and was arrested yesterday itself.         
	Assistant superintendent of police Arif Mohammed said the youth was mentally unstable and may have attacked his maternal uncle without any known motive.         
	BJP leader Pramod Mahajans murder by his brother Pravin was the last instance of a senior politician being killed by one of his own.        
	Like Pravin, who seemed to be burdened by the knowledge of being a famous brothers less successful sibling, Usharanjan was his uncles shadow at the height of his political career but became frustrated when he did not land even a government job.        
	I think he lost his mental balance because of intense frustration and vented his ire on his maternal uncle, who he dearly loved otherwise, one of Bhowmiks close friends, R.K. Debnath, said.        
	A bachelor, Bhowmik started his career as a teacher at Prachya Bharati Higher Secondary School.         
	He joined the Tripura Government Teachers Association in 1966 and graduated to full-time politics by contesting the Assembly elections of 1978.         
	He won the Banamalipur seat as a Left-supported Independent candidate.        
	Bhowmik became health minister and lasted a full term, but never won another election. After exiting politics, he devoted most of his time to the Ramthakur Ashram.         
	His brothers cremated him at Dhaleshwar this afternoon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Didi in drivers seat, industry in low gear
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Didi in drivers seat, industry in low gear
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 19: The Bengal Chambers Palladian Lounge was today transformed into 30B Harish Chatterjee Street in front of captains of industry who could do little but grin and bear it.        
	The event in central Calcutta was supposed to be a closed-door affair where eight chambers of commerce were to interact with Mamata Banerjee.        
	Instead, it became a public spectacle beamed live on television, prompting the industrialists  never known to challenge politicians in public  to desist from asking inconvenient questions and contesting Mamatas sound bites that were aimed at the larger audience outside the lounge.         
	What happened today, she does from her residence every day, an industrialist said, referring to the media conferences Mamata holds at her Harish Chatterjee Street home in south Calcutta.        
	The only difference is that it was Palladian Lounge today. After I came here, I got to know that it is an open meeting, the industrialist added.        
	Sources said the Trinamul Congress had told the organisers that Mamata might not attend the meeting if it was a closed-door session. We had to give in or the meeting could have been in jeopardy, a source said.        
	The participating chambers were then requested to accept the condition as the meeting was the first tentative step to engage in long-term dialogue, the source added.        
	Several industrialists said they would have asked piercing questions on Singur had the session been held behind closed doors. Here, you cannot argue. There was already a fear that she may stomp out of the meeting, another industrialist said.        
	The upshot: Mamata had a cakewalk, getting away with comments like from what I hear, the ancillary units will be supplying everything from iron to wine.        
	Few stood up to point out that the ancillary units are expected to generate more jobs than the mother plant and that the pricing of the Rs 1-lakh car rests decisively on proximity to vendors. Easy and assured accessibility will help the car plant scale down stocks of supplies and cut costs.        
	Besides, 30 of the 55 units have started work and Rs 1,500 crore has already been spent on the whole project. If the units are relocated now, a part of that amount will go down the drain.        
	Sandipan Chakravorty, the managing director of Tata Ryerson  one of the ancillary companies  tried to dispel confusion over the vendor park, only to be told by Mamata that the components could be brought from anywhere else.         
	Ravi Poddar, a former chairman of the CII and a real estate developer, mustered courage to say that Trinamul should go to tomorrows meeting with the industries minister with an open mind.        
	But an industry veteran said: She is gaining politically from her stance. I do not see her changing track.        
	On record, everyone appreciated Mamatas participation. We should engage in discussions. That she agreed to come and speak her mind is positive, said Chakravorty, who is also the eastern region chairman of the CII.        
	It is only the beginning. There should be many more interactions in the future, said Sanjay Budhia, the president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce.  
	BANDH TODAY  
	Bengal will wake up today to the incongruous spectacle of a 24-hour Left bandh crippling normal life, and the Left Front government hosting talks to facilitate re-industrialisation.  
	 Mamata Banerjee has made shutdowns a bargaining chip. ldquo;I am urging industrialists to persuade the government to resolve the Singur issue. In return, I will consider solving the bandh problem, rdquo; she said.

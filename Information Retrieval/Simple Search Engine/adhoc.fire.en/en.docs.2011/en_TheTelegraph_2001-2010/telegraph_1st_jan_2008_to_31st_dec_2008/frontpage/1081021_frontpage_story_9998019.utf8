	Two other women of the same family, Ashiss wife Deepali and her sister Sefali Mitra, did not accompany the group and had stayed back in their hotel in Gangtok. They were told about the deaths later in the evening after relatives in Calcutta were contacted. Shefalis son Abhisek, who works for IBM, left for Sikkim after he heard of the accident.

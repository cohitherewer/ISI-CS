                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   A slice of Santiniketan in London     -  Gallery to promote young artists
          AMIT ROY                                         Installation by Kirti Chandak and (above) an untitled work by Jayanta Mondal                                        
	London, July 31: Work by artists who have studied at Santiniketan, some old masters, others reasonably well established and many just starting out, will be showcased in London for the first time.         
	In all, about 120 paintings, sculptures and installation works by 56 artists have been selected for the exhibition, The Art of Santiniketan: Masters and Emerging Artists, in the Henry Moore Gallery at the Royal College of Art from August 27 to September 1.         
	This is my baby, proclaimed Sangeeta Ahuja, of SA Fine Arts in London, who has curated the collection, with the help of Jogen Chowdhury, the noted contemporary Indian artist and professor emeritus of Kala Bhavan, Visva-Bharati University.         
	Ahuja said: I am not knocking the Baroda School or art from Bombay or elsewhere in India but, in many ways, art from Bengal is superior but no one promotes these artists. Like everyone else, they need a chance.         
	She added: This show is conceptualised by SA Fine Arts, London, with guidance and support from Jogenda. We are not associating with any other gallery and its a direct association with the artists and alumni of Santiniketan. We are trying to unravel the mystique and magic of this great institution from the 1900s to the present day.        
	The artists whose work will be shown in London are divided into four categories.         
	The old masters, whose work has been sourced from private collections in the UK since they cannot be brought out of India, include Rabindranath Tagore himself, plus Nandalal Bose, Benode Bihari Mukherjee, Manishi Dey, Sudhir Ranjan Khastagir, Sunayani Devi and Gaganendranath Tagore.         
	They are followed by contemporary masters  Somenath Hore, K.G. Subramanyan, Lalu Prasad Shaw, Krishna Reddy, Reba Hore, Jogen Chowdhury, Suhas Roy, Bipin Goswami and Ramananda Bandyopadhyay.         
	Relatively speaking, Jogendas paintings are expensive  20,000-25,000, (Rs 16.9-21.1 lakh) said Ahuja.         
	In her next category are the senior contemporaries  Nandadulal Mukherjee, Sibaprasad Karchaudhuri, Pinaki Barua, Falguni Mukherjee, Prasun Kanti Bhattacharya and Dr Sitansu Mukhopadhyay.         
	In Britain, ever since Charles Saatchi began vacuuming up collections by talented students from art colleges, it has become fashionable for spotters to look for work whose value may multiply rapidly.         
	Ahuja has over 30 artists, aged in their late twenties to early thirties, whose work is priced in the 1,000-4,000 (Rs 84,565-Rs 3.4 lakh) range.         
	Now is a very good time to buy, she commented.         
	Ahuja, who is flying to Calcutta on Saturday to finalise last minute administration and supervise printing of the catalogue, having visited Santiniketan three times earlier this year to organise her exhibition, said Jogen Chowdhury facilitated her contact with the university and its alumni but left the choice of artists to her.         
	Ideally, I wanted some of the students who graduated in 2008 but there were some issues here, she revealed.         
	She had even greater difficulty when she approached some well-known Bengali artists, whose response was: Talk to my gallery, talk to my agent. They were behaving like Bollywood stars.         
	Ahujas plea that their presence in the exhibition would have helped the younger artists did not persuade the seniors. They said, Why should we help them? Let them struggle like we did. I am not saying young artists should charge one lakh rupees when they come out of college but it would have meant a lot to them to have some of the big names there. I must say Jogenbabu was the exception  he does so much to help the young.         
	Politics and petty jealousy aside, she hopes the Santiniketan School will bring something fresh to London. Among the younger artists worth watching (and possibly buying), she included Chandrima Bhattacharyya, Mithu Sen and Farhad Hussain.

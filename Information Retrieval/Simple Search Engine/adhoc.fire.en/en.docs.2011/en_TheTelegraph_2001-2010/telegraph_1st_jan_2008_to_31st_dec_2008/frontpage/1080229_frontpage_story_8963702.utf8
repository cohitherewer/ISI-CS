	Feb. 28: The legislation that put Darjeeling on the boil appears to be headed to the cold storage, sending Subash Ghisingh on an apparent last-ditch mission to Delhi, spreading cautious cheer among his rivals and gifting a breather to the Bengal government.        
	A parliamentary panel today cautioned and advised the Centre to make a fresh assessment before proceeding with two pieces of legislation that would have granted the Sixth Schedule status to Darjeeling.        
	The committee would like to caution and advise the ministry of home affairs to make a fresh assessment of the ground realities before proceeding with the bills in the two Houses of Parliament, the panel said in its 45-page report submitted to the Rajya Sabha today.        
	The panel said an overwhelming majority had repeatedly asserted that there would be bloodshed in the region if the bills were passed.        
	The panels report is not binding but, given the choice of words and the volatile situation in the hills, the Centre will find it difficult to ignore the warning and push ahead with the bills that seem to have few takers except Ghisingh.        
	The Bengal government, originally a champion of the Sixth Schedule legislation, has also started having second thoughts, sensing the growing unrest in the hills.        
	The schedule, so far applicable only in some areas of the Northeast, would have given additional legislative, financial and administrative powers to a new council meant to run the hills. But as the schedule was originally meant for predominantly tribal areas  though an exception had been made in Assam  there have been apprehensions that the special status would create a split in the Gorkha community.        
	Critics of Ghisingh, such as the breakaway Gorkha Janmukti Morcha that has been spearheading an ongoing indefinite bandh in the hills against the legislation, also fear that the special status would sound the death knell for the drive for a separate Gorkhaland state.        
	The Morcha also wants Ghisingh to be removed as caretaker administrator of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), which would have been replaced by the Gorkha Hill Council, Darjeeling, had the bills been passed.        
	Ghisingh, who has been shying away from elections to the DGHC though they are due since 1999, has been pinning hopes on the new status and set-up to bail him out if the state government refuses a seventh extension this month.        
	But, so far, the Morcha, which has opened direct lines of communication with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has also been refusing to take part in elections. If the stand-off persists, the government may have to appoint a bureaucrat as administrator when Ghisinghs extended term lapses on March 24.        
	The Sixth Schedule to the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2007, and the Constitution (107th Amendment) Bill, 2007, were introduced in the fag end of the winter session but were sent to the standing committee following an intervention by the BJP.        
	The Parliament standing committee on home affairs is headed by BJP leader Sushma Swaraj. Since the Constitution has to be amended, which requires two-thirds majority, the government cannot do without the support of the BJP.        
	The panel also indirectly referred to the dramatic developments in the hills over the past few weeks when Ghisingh was virtually shut out and forced to hop from Delhi to Siliguri to Calcutta and back to Delhi now.         
	The committee said had the bills been passed immediately after a memorandum of settlement was signed in December 2005, the situation would have been different as Ghisingh was the undisputed leader at that time.         
	The panel warned that extending the schedule beyond the Northeast would set a new precedent, opening a Pandoras box. Tribal areas in Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar could start clamouring for the status.         
	An upbeat Morcha said the panel report would definitely damage the Sixth Schedule legislation.        
	Ghisingh today met chief minister Bhattacharjee  the second time in five days. The chief minister is learnt to have spoken to the home minister during the day.        
	After the meeting, Ghisingh said the chief minister had not asked him to step down as administrator of the hill council. I am not resigning and the chief minister did not instruct me to put in my papers, he said.        
	Ghisingh later left for Delhi. Sources in the capital said he was trying to meet leaders who can help get the bills passed.         
	Morcha president Bimal Gurung is expected to meet the chief minister tomorrow. If the bills are shelved, the state government can now tell the Morcha that one of their key demands has been met.

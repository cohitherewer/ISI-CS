          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Speed                                  
	April 25: Faced with the sack, India-baiter Malcolm Speed, the International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive, has chosen to go on leave from April 30 till the end of his seven-year contract, July 4.         
	According to sources, the ICCs president-elect, Englands David Morgan, negotiated a deal after outgoing president Ray Mali and key members decided to remove the Australian within the next 10 days.        
	Its rarely that the ICC gets candid about internal matters, but a statement released from Dubai this evening didnt conceal much.        
	The statement included the following: The ICC president, Mr Ray Mali, and the CEO, Mr Malcolm Speed, have agreed that Malcolm Speed will be on paid leave from 30 April until the end of his contract term, on 4 July.        
	This change of plan is the result of a fundamental breakdown in the relationship between the CEO and a number of (Executive) Board members, over a variety of issues, that include Zimbabwe.        
	Sources have pointed out that South Africas Mali initiated the move to sack Speed during an informal meeting in Bangalore exactly a week ago.        
	Mali and many others on the Executive Board had assembled there for the highly impressive launch of the Indian Premier League (IPL).        
	Significantly, among those present was Zimbabwe strongman Peter Chingoka, known to be close to Mali. Also known to be at loggerheads with Speed.        
	(An agency report has mentioned that Speed opposed Malis decision not to act against officials in Zimbabwe after an independent audit report. Hed gone to the extent of not attending a press conference, last month, where that issue wouldve come up.)        
	The last straw for the highly influential Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), at least, was Speeds comment in Mumbai, just days before the IPL took off, that a request from the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) for recognition on the lines of the IPL had been referred to the world bodys lawyers.        
	The IPL has the blessings of the BCCI.         
	Specifically, Speed had said: About 10 days ago, the ICL lawyers contacted us and sought recognition from the ICC. We are awaiting advice from our lawyers. Its a fairly complicated legal issue.        
	That violated an Executive Board decision denying recognition to the ICL, which is headed by Indias sole World Cup-winning captain, Kapil Dev.        
	Speed had no business saying what he did, somebody very powerful in the BCCI, still quite angry with what was said in Mumbai, told The Telegraph.        
	Last December, it may be recalled, Speed had ticked off match referee Mike Procter for going soft on Yuvraj Singh in the MCG Test.        
	Then, days later, many felt Speed put pressure on Procter when the Harbhajan Singh-Andrew Symonds row at the SCG threatened to prematurely end Team Indias tour of Australia.        
	Sources have also pointed out that Speed was most unhappy when the BCCI and Cricket Australia struck a deal in the lead-up to the hearing of Harbhajans appeal in Adelaide.        
	Eventually, the three-Test ban was overturned and Harbhajan got away with less than a rap on his knuckles. It couldnt have pleased Speed.         
	Speed, by the way, is a former chief executive of the Australian body. In his time, it was the Australian Cricket Board.         
	More recently, Speed had been gunning for the ICCs cricket committee chairman, Sunil Gavaskar. The latter, in fact, has been asked to choose between being chairman of a prestigious committee and continuing as a TV commentator and columnist.        
	Its to be seen whether Speeds exit takes some of the heat off Gavaskar and the controversy-generating conflict of interest issue.        
	While Speeds full-time successor, South Africas Haroon Lorgat, takes over in July, the ICCs general manager (cricket), Dave Richardson, will function as the acting chief executive.        
	Richardson is a former South African wicketkeeper.         
	These, clearly, are awkward times for the ICC. Not many weeks ago, for example, Imtiaz Patel turned down its offer to be Speeds successor.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Imphal, May 3: Civil society organisations in Manipur have reacted sharply to the state cabinets decision to raise village forces as part of the governments plan to restrict militant activities.        
	Responding to demands from Heirok in Thoubal district and Chajing in Imphal West, the Ibobi Singh cabinet yesterday decided to arm villagers in these two areas.        
	The government today sent director-general of police Yumnam Joykumar Singh to Heirok to identify land to construct barracks for the force. Joykumar Singh met the villagers of Heirok to explain the governments plan and to decide a location to construct the barracks.         
	Under the plan, the state would recruit 300 special police officers from among the youths of Heirok and another 200 from Chajing, to defend their villages against militants.         
	The government will pay a remuneration of Rs 300 each and also arm them with 303 rifles. The decision to constitute such a force came after the villagers demanded weapons for self-protection.        
	The villagers have welcomed the move, while political parties remained mum on the development.        
	However, the Apunba Lup and the United Committee Manipur (UCM) slammed the cabinets decision. They termed the move as an attempt to trigger bloodshed among the Manipuri people.         
	The Apunba Lup is spearheading the campaign against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, while the UCM is heading the campaign to protect Manipurs territorial integrity.        
	The UCM said in a statement, however, that the demand for weapons by the two villages was a warning to armed groups which committed anti-people activities.        
	This is an attempt to cause more bloodshed. The cabinet decision should be withdrawn. The armed groups should also refrain from committing anti-people activities, Ph. Devan, one of the co-ordinators of the Apunba Lup, said.         
	The Apunba Lup will hold a rally in Imphal on May 11 to demand the withdrawal of the cabinet decision and also to appeal to armed groups to shun anti-people activities.         
	Prof. Amar Yumnam, an economist in Manipur University, hailed the bold decision of the cabinet but questioned its wisdom.         
	However, former chief minister and Opposition leader Radhabinod Koijam told The Telegraph that the government should work on finding a political solution to militancy, instead of arming the people.         
	The Manipur Peoples Party said it would discuss the matter before reacting.

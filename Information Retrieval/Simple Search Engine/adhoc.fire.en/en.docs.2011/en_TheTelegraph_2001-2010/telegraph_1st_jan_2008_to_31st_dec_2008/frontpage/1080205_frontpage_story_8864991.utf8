 - Citing frequent controversies, Sania refuses to play in India this year 
    OUR BUREAU
                          
	Feb. 4: Sania Mirza, whose attitude, attire and aggression came to symbolise the emergence of a new India, will not play in her country this year because of recurring controversies off the court.
    
	People are criticising me for either the length of my skirt or appearance in ads or for insulting the national flag. Do I have to prove my patriotism again and again? the 21-year-old tennis player asked in Hyderabad.
    
	The first casualty of the announcement is next months Bangalore Open. The Williams sisters  Sania won a billion hearts after losing to Serena in an Australian Open match full of verve in 2005  are slated to play in Bangalore.
    
	Ranked 29th in the world, Sania said she was pulling out of the tournament as she was tired of being dragged from one controversy to another whenever she played in India.
    
	Not all controversies broke when Sania was playing in the country (see chart), but her question in distress was addressed as much to her critics as the growing PIL guerrilla culture in the country where courts are being approached on the flimsiest of grounds.
    
	The other tournament Sania takes part in the country is the Sunfeast Open in Calcutta, usually held in September. She had withdrawn from the event last year because of injury. If she sticks to her vow, Calcutta will miss her this year as well.
    
	Sania said she had been advised by her managers to stay away from tennis courts in India. I will only address mandatory media conferences, she said.
    
	Her career is managed by Globosport, an event and sports management company owned by Mahesh Bhupathi, her current mixed doubles partner. Bhupathi, who said Sania had consulted him, blamed one person for the well-orchestrated campaign against her but refused to give a name.
    
	Sania said she was the subject of too many controversies and faced a lot of public criticism whenever she did something in India. It is unfair that I am subject to such minute scrutiny both by the public and the media, she said.
    
	The expression of anguish was a far cry from the sure-footed manner in which Sania conducted herself when she burst upon Indian tennis and became a youth icon, flashing trend-setter nose-rings and sporting T-shirts that declared well-behaved women rarely make history.
    
	Is it a case of a young mind buckling under intense pressure? Shes been mired in controversy for long and she does not appear to have the support that is required to help young people cope with scrutiny and the stress it brings, said Rajat Mitra, a consultant psychologist in New Delhi. She perhaps perceives that a foreign audience might be at best supportive and at worst indifferent, but not hostile as an audience in India could be.
    
	Sania had said she considered quitting following the flag fracas. Im not superhuman. So, it does affect me a little bit no matter how much I try to block it out, its still at the back of your mind, she had said. 
    
	However, today she said that retirement was no longer an option. My earlier lingering thoughts of quitting tennis altogether following various controversies have vanished and I look forward to a great year, including the Olympics, which will be my first.
    
	Sania said the right-knee ligament injury she suffered in Australia was also a reason for pulling out. It is not a serious problem but I will consult doctors tomorrow. She was operated on the knee in 2007.
    
	Those who made the racket against Sania did not appear to be remorseful. Sania is blaming us for her avarice and cheap stunts for publicity. We wish her success in tennis but she must play in proper dress, said Sheikh Mahboob Ali, the president of an outfit that warned her against wearing short skirts on court.
    
	Prakash Kumar Thakur, a serial petitioner who filed the flag case against Sania in Bhopal, asked: Why is she indulging in emotional blackmail?
    
	Asked about the pending flag case, Thakur shot back: Which case of national flag violation are you referring to? I have filed 7-8 cases on the national flag alone.
    
	Sania is in exalted company: Thakurs list includes Sachin Tendulkar. (See Sport)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Police chalk out red flushout plan
                                                                                                           Police chalk out red flushout plan
          RANJAN DASGUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Feb. 15: Emboldened by yesterdays Dumaria encounter in which a wanted Naxalite was killed and buoyed by the addition of five companies of paramilitary forces in the states forces, police headquarters here has come up with a comprehensive plan to launch a major offensive against CPI (Maoist) strongholds.        
	Prepared by director-general of police Vishnu Dayal Ram, the blueprint envisages segregating Naxalite-hit areas across the state into eight zones and then tackling each zone to flush out rebels.         
	The zones include Jhumra Pahar (Bokaro), Parasnath (Giridih), Saranda (West Singhbhum), Ghatshila (East Singhbhum), Chatra-Hazaribagh, Garhwa-Palamau, Giridih and Ranchi-Khunti-Gumla.         
	The DGP refused to elaborate his anti-Maoist plan. Its an internal matter and cannot be discussed, said Ram.         
	But we are determined to give the rebels a run for their money. The state police would not allow them to carry on with their illegal activities, Ram added.         
	Highly plcaced sources, however, said the operations to flush out rebels would be launched soon.         
	The police would concentrate on one zone at a time to flush out the Maoists and destroy all their infrastructure.        
	The logic of this eight-way bifurcation comes from the polices understanding that all Naxalite activities are carried out from these zones, which are also used as safe havens.         
	Police officers privately concede that in all these eight vulnerable areas, the rebels are well-entrenched.         
	For instance, they have created bunkers for shelter and have stockpiled arms and ammunition. In some areas, training camps are being organised for new recruits.        
	The flushing out operation cannot be undertaken in a sporadic manner, said a senior police officer.         
	There has to be a concrete plan and this blueprint has been prepared after a lot of deliberations within the police top brass, he added.         
	What has undoubtedly acted as a morale booster is the Centres decision to send additional five companies of para military forces to be used along with the existing 30 CRPF companies and the special task force.        
	Rebels raid village        
	The Maoists swooped over Janigora village in Dumaria under Ghatshila sub-division late on Friday night. The rebels, reportedly more than 100, surrounded the house of Dhanai Kisku, the secretary of anti-Naxalite outfit, Nagarik Suraksha Samiti.        
	Kishku had taken a lead role in the operation against the rebels on Wednesday night. Sources said Kishku was at Musaboni when the rebels surrounded the place. His elderly mother and some relatives are, however, trapped inside, with heavily armed rebels surrounding it.        
	East Singhbhum superintendent of police Naveen Kumar Singh rushed to Dumaria.

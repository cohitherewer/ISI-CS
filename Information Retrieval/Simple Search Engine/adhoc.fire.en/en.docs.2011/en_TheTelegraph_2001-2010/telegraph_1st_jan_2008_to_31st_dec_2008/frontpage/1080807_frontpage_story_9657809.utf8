The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Conspiracy, cries Manipur
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Conspiracy, cries Manipur
  - Friends, family, CM rally around axed weightlifter          ROBERT SAPAM                                          
	Imphal, Aug. 6: The sports-loving people of Manipur reacted in disbelief to the shock exit of weightlifter Laishram Monika Devi from the Beijing Olympic squad after she tested positive for a banned substance yesterday.         
	Though most people did not get the news of Monika failing the dope test because of the strike in both the print and electronic media today, many whom The Telegraph contacted, including her family members, smelt a rat.        
	Monika Devi, who is from Potsangbam Nachou in Bishnupur district, was to compete in the 69kg category at the Beijing Olympics beginning Friday.        
	The Manipur government today took serious note of Monikas disqualification. Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh said this evening: We are taking the matter seriously. It is difficult to believe that any sportsperson from Manipur could use steroids to enhance his or her performance. If necessary, we will send youth affairs and sports minister N. Biren Singh to New Delhi to sort out the matter.                     
	Monika was a silver medallist at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in 2006.         
	Monikas father L. Nabachandra Singh, while defending her daughter said: We have heard the news but could not believe it. This is very unfortunate. Whatever the findings may be, the World Anti-Doping Agency must confirm it. He said he would like the test to be repeated at the Beijing doping test facility for the Games. We are ready to face any penalty if further tests are positive.        
	A vocal L. Surmila Devi, Monikas elder sister, felt that grave injustice has been meted out to her sister. She said some persons in the Indian Weightlifting Federation had been trying to sideline her. The people of Manipur must fight this injustice and discrimination.         
	A tearful Monika, at a news conference in New Delhi today, proclaimed her innocence saying she was being framed and somebody was trying to ruin her chances in the Olympics.        
	Manipur Olympic Association president Elangbam Binoykumar Singh said the news has left him shocked. We are trying to contact the IOA to ask for a through investigation.         
	Manipurs first Olympian hockey goalkeeper P. Nilakomol Singh said he felt sad for Monika. Coaches do have a role in her diet and she might not have intentionally taken the substances. I believe she is innocent.        
	United Committee, Manipur vice-president Y. Chittaranjan, smelt a conspiracy behind the fracas.         
	He felt that this was not merely a sad episode for Monika alone but a challenge for the sports-loving people of Manipur.

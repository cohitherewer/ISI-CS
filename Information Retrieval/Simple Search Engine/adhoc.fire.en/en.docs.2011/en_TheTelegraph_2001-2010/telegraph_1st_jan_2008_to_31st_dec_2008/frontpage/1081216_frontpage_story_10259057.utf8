...but moment to treasure in terrible times          INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                              
	Chennai, Dec. 15: Cricket cannot lessen the pain of what happened in Mumbai. But Sachin Tendulkars finest hour as a batsman will forever remain yoked to the darkest days of his beloved home, and will be all the more unforgettable for it.        
	I would like to dedicate this hundred to all those people who have gone through such terrible times, Tendulkar said moments after his first match-winning fourth-innings Test century that filled the biggest hole in his CV.        
	Cricket cannot lessen whatever happened. I hope this hundred will give some happiness to the people.        
	He added: What happened in Mumbai was extremely unfortunate and I dont think by India winning or me scoring hundreds people who have lost their dear ones and loved ones would feel better. Its a terrible loss for all of them. All I can say is that well make the effort to make them feel better in whatever way we can contribute.        
	Never before is Tendulkar likely to have felt the ultimate triviality of sport so deeply as on the day he came close to achieving everything a sportsman can.        
	His fans, though, will cherish the way the master brought up the triumphant finale to one of the most emotionally charged Tests in history.        
	As he paddle-swept the winning boundary, at once achieving his 41st Test hundred too, the normally serene batsman broke into uncharacteristic celebrations  a leap into the air, arm raised, fists clenched, a roar from the depths of the heart. Then his partner Yuvraj Singh hoisted him by his waist.        
	I play for India, now more than ever, Tendulkar has been telling the country in a commercial since the tragedy. But there must have been something personal too.        
	Wheres that career-defining knock, some critics had been sniggering at him, pointing to at-the-death heroics by the Brian Laras and Inzamam-ul Haqs. This is something that I wanted to do  score a hundred in the fourth innings and win a match for India, Tendulkar said.        
	Ive scored a hundred in the second innings, but to actually win a match, play the winning shot, that was something I wanted to do. This makes it really, really special. Its something every batsman dreams of. I would rate this hundred as one of the best.        
	When he spoke about November 26, there was again a touch of the personal: From my daughters school there were a couple of parents who lost their lives unfortunately. I hadnt met them but I knew them. Otherwise there was no one I knew.        
	I look at it as an attack on India, not on Mumbai. It should hurt every Indian, he added.        
	He remembered how the shadow of terror hung over the series, nearly derailing it. Id like to thank England for coming back to play Test cricket, he said. Its been a great gesture.        
	The vanquished captain, the man behind his teams return to India, was equally moved. The way both teams came out and played and put on a performance like this, after what happened in Mumbai a few weeks ago, I think they can be really proud of themselves, Kevin Pietersen said.        
	Who can write Sachin Tendulkars script any better? The man from Mumbai came in and scored a sensational hundred. He batted like a superstar.        
	Yet there were ghosts of the past to exorcise on the way. A decade ago, Tendulkar had scored a heroic fourth-innings hundred on this ground before everything fell apart at the last step.        
	It was on his mind today. I told Yuvi when he played a shot that landed between short mid-wicket and long-on: Wait till the last run is scored. Better to finish the job ourselves.        
	They did. England tried to needle the under-pressure Yuvraj but the young man remained composed. He even slowed down as the finish line approached to make sure Tendulkar got his hundred.        
	The score: India 387-4 after the fourth-biggest successful run chase in history; Tendulkar not out 103, Yuvraj unbeaten 85.

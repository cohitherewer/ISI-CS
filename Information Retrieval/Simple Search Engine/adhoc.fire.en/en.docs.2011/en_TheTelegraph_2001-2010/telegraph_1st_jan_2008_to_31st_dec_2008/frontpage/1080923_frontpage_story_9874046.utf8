          K.P. NAYAR                               
	Washington, Sept. 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will arrive in the US on Tuesday afternoon for a four-and-a-half-day stay that is dogged by uncertainties in his agenda unlike any other visit by an Indian head of government in recent years.        
	Intense consultations are under way in the offices of the two chambers of the US legislature, and at the time of writing, it appears likely that the nuclear deal package will be tagged on to a quot;continuing resolution quot; on Capitol Hill that must be adopted by the US Congress before it breaks up for the November elections.        
	But because of the economic crisis of Himalayan proportions here, nothing is any more certain on Capitol Hill: not even the date for adjournment of Congress, which had earlier been fixed for September 26, a day after the Prime Minister meets President George W. Bush and is hosted later to a working dinner at the White House.        
	On the eve of Singhs arrival in New York, the most plausible scenario is as follows. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is to meet on Tuesday around the same time that Singhs plane will be touching down at John F. Kennedy airport and the committees agenda, as of now, includes consideration of two treaties, six new laws and seven ambassadorial nominations.        
	But committee sources do not rule out the possibility that Democratic senator Chris Dodd may get the panel to approve the nuclear deal package at this meeting and send it to the senate floor.         
	Dodd will be presiding on Tuesday in the absence of Joe Biden, who is campaigning for his vice-presidency.        
	In the House of Representatives, there may be quot;floor action quot; tomorrow in the form of a simple resolution to approve the nuclear deal package, which was transmitted to Congress by Bush on September 10.         
	The resolution is most likely to be attached to a quot;continuing resolution quot;, a legislative term here that is used to describe the mechanism that will fund the federal governments budget until the November elections or slightly longer.        
	The nearest equivalent in India to a quot;continuing resolution quot; is the vote on account when a government is unable or unwilling to present a full budget. The US governments fiscal year ends on September 30 and a continuing resolution is mandatory to prevent government agencies from grinding to a halt on October 1 for lack of funds.        
	The hope among enthusiasts for the nuclear deal here is that if it is attached to a quot;continuing resolution quot;, it may quickly get adopted in time for Bush and Singh to operationalise it when they meet on Thursday.        
	There are also suggestions that a stand-alone resolution should be moved in both legislative chambers here on Tuesday or Wednesday and have it quickly passed by the time Singh flies into Washington from New York on Thursday.        
	But both these courses are fraught with risks because they entail doing away with the quot;expedited process quot; that was agreed to when the Hyde Act was adopted by the US Congress as the enabling legislation for the nuclear deal.        
	Doing away with the quot;expedited process quot; will mean that the 30-day mandatory requirement for consultations before floor action on Capitol Hill can be waived and the deal can be passed right away.        
	But such a course also runs the risk of the stand-alone legislation getting tied up in knots in committees in both the senate and the House of Representatives.        
	While midnight oil is being burned on Capitol Hill on procedure, Indian sources are sanguine that the process is well under way. They are hopeful that even if the deal is not operationalised during Singhs visit to the White House, it will be done before Bush demits office on January 20 next year.

	Ranchi, July 18: Nobody has a definite clue to what Shibu Soren is eyeing before the trust vote  the Jharkhand chief ministers crown or a berth in the Union ministry.         
	Even his son Hemant Soren is in the dark about his fathers wish. So are low-rung JMM leaders.         
	But his silence has sent the Jharkhand ministers, including chief minister Madhu Koda, in a tizzy  to such an extent that Koda has offered Soren the chief ministers chair to keep him on the UPA board. Koda told a news channel that he was ready to vacate the chief ministers chair for Soren in order to maintain the UPA unity.         
	Insiders, however, said that Koda was luring Soren to accept a berth in the Union cabinet.        
	According to the BJP leaders negotiating with the JMM, Sorens decision on trust vote would depend on which way the fence sitters like Ajit Singh, Deve Gowda et al go. Soren would keep the options open till he was convinced of the stand of other smaller parties, whose support is crucial for the survival of the UPA government.        
	Soren will not dump the UPA if he is convinced that the Manmohan Singh government will survive even without the support of his five MPs, said a senior BJP leader.         
	Alternatively, if he is sure that the UPA government will not survive even with the JMM support, he will jump to the NDA bandwagon to get the Jharkhand crown, said sources.        
	The NDA has already offered him the chief ministers chair, which Soren had to leave in 2005 after the Supreme Courts intervention on the NDA petition.        
	But when Soren was busy weighing his options, JMM MP Teklal Mahto said four of his colleagues would vote for the UPA.         
	I have exercised secular politics so far. So, there is no question to join the NDA fold, Mahto said after coming out of the parliamentary consultative committee meeting on power here.        
	Mahto, in fact, asserted that the Congress, too, has offered him the chief ministers chair. So, there is no need to jump to the NDA bandwagon, he maintained.        
	According to a PTI report, a decision on voting on July 22 trust vote would be taken tomorrow, deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto said. All our five MPs are united. The party will take a decision tomorrow in Delhi, Mahto told PTI.

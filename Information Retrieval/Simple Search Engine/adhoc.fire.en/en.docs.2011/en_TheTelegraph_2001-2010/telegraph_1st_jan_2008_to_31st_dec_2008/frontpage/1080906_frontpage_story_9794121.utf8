          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 5: A day after the Orissa government assured the Supreme Court that it would not allow VHPs proposed kalash yatra, the Kandhamal administration today issued a formal order prohibiting such programmes in the district.        
	Though taking out a procession or rally in the district has been banned, a special programme to commemorate the VHP leader, Swami Laxmananda Saraswati, was conducted at Shankaracharya Kanyashram in Jalespeta, where the swamiji and four of his associates were gunned down on the night of August 23.         
	The programme, however, was carried out amid tight security and all entry points to Kandhamal were sealed. A days curfew was imposed at Baliguda, Tumudibandh and Kotgarh, close to the ashram. Also, entry into the ashram was restricted to selected people only.        
	Senior VHP leader Bipin Bihari Rath attended the special prayer meeting at the ashram where a yagna was also held.        
	Rapid Action Force and CRPF personnel were deployed at the meeting venue and the situation was overseen by senior IAS officer M.S. Padhi, who was deputed from Bhubaneswar to supervise law and order arrangements.        
	Additional security forces have also been deployed in the district keeping in mind the proposed Shodashi Puja on the occasion of the 16th day of the swamijis death, to be held at Chakapada ashram where the slain seer was given bhu samadhi or a burial sometime next week.

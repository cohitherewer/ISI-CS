  - IAEA text sparks debate over nuke freedom         OUR BUREAU                            Anil Kakodkar (right) with Homi Sethna, former chairman of the atomic energy department, during a discussion on the deal in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, July 10: Indias demand for uninterrupted foreign nuclear fuel in exchange for greater international scrutiny of its nuclear programme is reflected in the 23-page safeguards pact with the UNs atomic watchdog.         
	But ambiguity in the text of the draft agreement between India and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has prompted some critics to say India is giving away too much while others say Delhi has secured escape clauses.         
	The draft sets down the rules for accounting  or policing  of nuclear materials in Indias civilian nuclear facilities by IAEA inspectors aimed at guarding against the withdrawal of safeguarded material from civilian use at any time.        
	In a departure from similar documents the IAEA has signed with other countries, the India-specific agreement acknowledges the existence of a non-civilian component of Indias nuclear programme.        
	It recognises the existence of activities that India can carry out free from safeguards, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Anil Kakodkar, said. And a non-hindrance clause says the safeguards will not hamper or interfere with activities involving the use of any nuclear material or technology produced, acquired or developed by India independent of the agreement.         
	The issues of assured fuel supply, a stockpile of nuclear fuel (to last the lifetime of reactors) and Indias option to take corrective measures to ensure uninterrupted operation of its reactors are reflected in the preamble, Kakodkar said.         
	But domestic critics of the India-US nuclear deal said the atomic energy department had not spelt out possible corrective measures. It is not clear what India would do if fuel supplies are disrupted, said Padmanabha Iyengar, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.         
	The preamble is like a books preface. It doesnt bind the IAEA to anything. The rest of the agreement is similar to IAEA agreements with other countries, said Adinarayana Gopalakrishnan, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board.        
	However, a US-based security analyst said the clause on corrective measures could serve as a loophole that might blunt any IAEA effort to keep Indias civilian nuclear programme from being used to augment its atomic arsenal, a Reuters report said.         
	The clause raises a key red flag, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a US-based private think tank.         
	Does that mean that India intends to withdraw from what are supposed to be permanent safeguards if it tests and other states decide to terminate fuel supplies? Kimball asked.         
	If so, that is a big problem and the Indian government has not clarified what that means, he said.         
	Some analysts believe the architects of the deal are hedging their bets on the assumption that fuel supplies will not be disrupted in the future.         
	Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a former Bush administration official and proponent of the deal, said fears of another Indian nuclear weapons test were theoretical and India had too much to risk by testing.         
	With the investments they have made in the deal, the incentives not to test actually grow, Tellis said. If India tests in the future, it will not be the first to test. It will test most likely in response to somebody else testing, Tellis said.

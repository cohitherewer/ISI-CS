	New Delhi, Jan. 9: A combination of moderate alcohol drinking and leisure-time physical activity protects the heart better than physical activity alone, researchers reported today. 
    
	Those who neither drink alcohol nor exercise are at much higher risk of heart disease than those who only exercise, only drink, or do both, doctors in Denmark said after tracking people for 20 years. 
    
	Doctors have known for years that both exercise and a small amount of alcohol have protective effects on the heart. But this is the first study to examine the effect of combining exercise and alcohol. 
    
	We found that its not enough to be physically active. Moderate alcohol consumption has an extra protective effect, said Morten Gronbaek, principal investigator of the study at the National Institute of Public Health, Copenhagen, Denmark. 
    
	People who drank at least once a week and were physically active were at nearly half the risk of developing heart disease compared to physically inactive non-drinkers, according to the study published today in the European Heart Journal . 
    
	The lowest risk of death was observed among the physically active moderate drinkers, and the highest risk among the physically inactive non-drinkers and heavy drinkers, said Jane Ostergaard Pedersen, a member of the research team. 
    
	The study was based on following up the health, exercise habits and alcohol consumption patterns of more than 11,900 people since 1983. It addressed the issue of whether alcohol alone or exercise alone would compensate for the absence of the other. 
    
	Physical activity can reverse some adverse health effects associated with abstinence from alcohol, the study found. So people who do not take alcohol for whatever reason may gain some benefit from exercise. 
    
	But neither physical activity alone nor alcohol can completely reverse the increased risk associated with lack of physical activity and abstinence from alcohol, Ostergaard-Pedersen said. 
    
	The researchers classified a bottle of beer or a glass of wine as a single drink, and people who had between one and 14 drinks a week as moderate drinkers. 
    
	At least four hours a week of brisk walking, fast cycling or sports that cause perspiration or exhaustion would make up moderate to vigorous physical activity. 
    
	The researchers caution that these findings cannot be used to issue public health advisories on the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption. 
    
	We cannot use this as a public health measure, Gronbaek told The Telegraph in an interview. Not everyone can be advised to take alcohol. There are also concerns about excess alcohol use, he said. 
    
	There are certain health conditions in which alcohol should not be prescribed, Gronbaek said. 
    
	The study showed that moderate alcohol and physical activity had a protective effect against not just heart disease but against death from all causes.

	Ranchi/Giridih, Nov. 9: HRD minister Bandhu Tirkey today threatened to invoke the Essential Services Maintenance Act (Esma) in the state from November 11 as the strike of the 80,000-odd para-teachers since November 1 has been jeopardising the primary and middle-level education.        
	Ruling out talks with the para-teachers on the strike isse, Tirkey said: I will write to the state home department to invoke Esma from November 11 if the para-teachers do not return to work by then, said Tirkey.         
	Vikrant Jyoti, the spokesperson of Jharkhand Pradesh Para-Sikshak Sangh said the minister was behaving like an autocrat and was least interested in knowing our problems through talks.        
	Esma cannot be invoked on us as we are neither central nor state government employees, said Jyoti.         
	About 80,000 para-teachers, recruited under the Central government-sponsored Sarva Shiksha Aviyan, are on strike since November 1 demanding better service conditions and salary.         
	Alleging that the para-teachers were giving their strike a political colour in the wake of impending Assembly elections, Tirkey said: The government has enacted Samudayik Sikshak Seva Sart Niymawali, 2008. It promises a maximum monthly remuneration of Rs 5,100 to the para-teachers after they cleared a test. The increase in remuneration would be effective from August 21, 2008 and the deputy commissioners concerned have been asked to ensure that the test be conducted soon after November 15.         
	The state HRD department has also convened a meeting of district superintendents of education on November 11 in the state capital to find alternative arrangements if the para-teachers on strike did not return to work despite the threat of Esma.         
	Sources said the government was contemplating to recruit the rural aspirants placed second in the village education committees list during the selection of serving para-teachers.

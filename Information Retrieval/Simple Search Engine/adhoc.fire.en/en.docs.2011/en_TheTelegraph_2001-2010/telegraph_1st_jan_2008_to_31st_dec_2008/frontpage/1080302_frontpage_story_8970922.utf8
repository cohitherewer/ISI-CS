          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                               
	New Delhi, March 1: Finance minister P. Chidambarams momentary, but absolute, lapse of cool during a live television interview this afternoon made jarring contrast with a man whose budget is being lauded even by critics as a deft heads-I-win-tails-you-lose act.         
	Pressed to spell out how he planned to provide for the Rs 60,000-crore farmers loan-waiver, he tore away his microphone wires and stomped off the conversation before agreeing to return, pacified.         
	His image-managers later explained that what blew Chidambarams fuse was the medias refusal to understand he is under parliamentary obligation not to reveal details at this stage. But most believe the finance minister should have little cause to feel pressured or irritable.         
	On the contrary, the growing sense in political and economic circles is that Chidambaram has managed a budget that cant possibly go wrong for him: if his open-handed generosities fetch a poll windfall for the Congress, he can claim more than just a little credit, if the growth story is impeded in any fashion, he can always swivel around and say, it wasnt entirely his doing.         
	This, after all, may be election year and the finance ministers party has promises to keep.         
	Purely from the viewpoint of our manifesto, the last few budgets left much to be desired, said a senior Congress leader. There was too much happening for too few and the dire need this time was to change that. We are glad that has been reflected.        
	Nobody in the party or the government will spell it out, but it is known all too well that the Congress pushed its wish list harder with the government this time than it did in previous years.         
	So much so, it may have extracted concessions the finance minister hadnt planned on granting. Senior economists who advise the UPA government on policy have indicated, for instance, that the centrepiece of poll-eve largesse  the massive financial sop to farmers  was not Chidambarams idea. It was the Congress, worried about adverse impact of the rural crisis on its vote share, that lobbied hard and got it.         
	But Congress seniors are keen to refute suggestions of any party-government rift on the making of the budget.         
	It is wrong to say this is the Congresss budget and not the finance ministers, AICC general secretary Veerappa Moily told The Telegraph. Chidambaram, after all, is a member of the Congress and will naturally reflect the views of his party as well. If the voice of the Congress president is ringing through the finance ministers proposals, it is only natural, they both belong to the same party.         
	Moily conceded, albeit indirectly, that the party did make specific demands on the finance minister this year. There is dynamic growth in the economy but some course correction was required, growth should mean growth for all, shining India should mean all of India shining, not just little bits. That is what this budget has reflected, inclusive growth, well-being for all sections.         
	The Congress has been whooping with joy since Chidambaram closed his budget presentation yesterday. For the second day running, 10 Janpath and the partys 24 Akbar Road headquarters bore signs of a campaign gearing up in earnest  a steady mill of re-energised ranks waving posters and placards, rejoicing the return of the aam aadmi at the top of the agenda.         
	Business and industry havent been put into a sulk at the altar of political exigency. Id call this an extremely smart act, said economist and former Planning Commission member S.P. Gupta. Indeed, even a very clever bluff. Chidambaram has succeeded in giving the impression of a very pro-poor budget but in truth he has remained true to reformist objectives. He has played with phoney figures but he has kept both constituencies happy.         
	Amit Mitra, secretary general of Ficci, was in awe of Chidambarams achievement without being as cutting. Hes done a very effective job of walking the tightrope of political economy, the stimulation to growth continues, and at the same time, there could be a handsome political outcome for the Congress, Mitra said. Undoubtedly, the finance minister has released instruments which will ensure continued economic momentum, and, cleverly, he has also been able to address political requirements in the run-up to election year.         
	Should his effort not bear political fruit of desired proportions, the finance minister will probably be able to turn to the party and say he doled the right message out, its they who couldnt take it forward.

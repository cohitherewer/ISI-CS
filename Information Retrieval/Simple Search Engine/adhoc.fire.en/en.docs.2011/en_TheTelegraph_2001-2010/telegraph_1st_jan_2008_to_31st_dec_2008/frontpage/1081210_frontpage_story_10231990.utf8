          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Singh                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is learnt to have conveyed to Congress president Sonia Gandhi that he was keen to shed at least three portfolios, including finance.        
	The suggestion has raised the possibility of a rejig of the Union council of ministers soon. Congress sources said the shuffle could take place when Parliament, which resumes its winter session on Wednesday, takes a two-day weekend break. Changes to the council are not usually made when a House sitting is in progress.        
	Besides finance, the Prime Minister now looks after environment and forests, information and broadcasting and coal.        
	Although the Congress leadership would have preferred a political person to fill the finance vacancy created when P. Chidambaram was shifted to home, the sources said, the Prime Ministers first  and perhaps only  choice remains Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission.        
	The Prime Minister had assigned Ahluwalia to unveil the stimulus package on Sunday  which the Congress is seeing as a sure sign of how his mind is working.        
	Ahluwalia is not exactly a stranger to the Congress. He has tried to straddle the bureaucratic-political gap with periodic meetings with Sonia and other party leaders whenever he was asked to brief them on hot-button economic issues.        
	Among the Congress names doing the rounds are those of the former Karnataka chief minister, S.M. Krishna, and Union ministers Kapil Sibal and Sushil Kumar Shinde.        
	Krishnas detractors have already started a whisper campaign, saying a person responsible for the Congresss defeat in the Karnataka Assembly polls should not be rewarded.        
	After Ahluwalia, the Prime Minister is supposed to have the greatest comfort level with Sibal, the science and technology minister. Sibal was among the first to publicly defend the nuclear deal when most Congress leaders were waiting for a signal from 10 Janpath.        
	But Congress sources feel that Sibal would most probably be given environment and forest.        
	The Prime Minister is expected to retain coal, while information and broadcasting may be given to Ambika Soni, the culture and tourism minister.

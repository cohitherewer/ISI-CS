                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Model with no belly button starts a buzz
          JOHN BINGHAM                            Model Karolina Kurkova at a Victorias Secret fashion show in Miami Beach, Florida. (AP)                                  
	London, Nov. 22: It might not be the first time that a top model has appeared to defy the laws of nature but even experienced fashion-watchers were baffled when Karolina Kurkova was photographed apparently without a belly button.         
	Observers noticed that something was missing when the 24-year-old Czech appeared at a shoot for the underwear line Victorias Secret in Miami Beach, Florida, at the weekend.         
	Confounding the perennial debate about the relative merits of having an innie or outie belly button, the photograph showed that she had what appeared to be more of a smooth dimple.         
	But the suggestion that the image had been doctored was quickly discarded as she was part of a line-up of several dozen models  all sporting standard buttons.         
	As one of the worlds highest paid models, Kurkova is a regular on the pages of glossy magazines but the unusual abdominal feature had gone unnoticed hitherto.         
	The photograph has prompted speculation that in the past  unlike rival models who are anxious to cover up their belly button  she has had one airbrushed in.         
	Kurkova is no stranger to curiosity.         
	Last month, she was photographed wearing a bra studded with more than 2,000 diamonds, worth an estimated 3.5million in a promotional shoot for Victorias Secret.         
	Last year, Forbes magazine ranked her as the eighth highest paid model in the world with estimated annual earnings of 2.3million.         
	Perhaps that is why she is reported to feed her shih tzu dog, Bella, with caviar.         
	According to designer Marc Jacobs: Karolina has an angelic look with a dark side, shes sweet and fun but looks like she could be an evil bewitching child.        
	Vogue editor Anna Wintour called her the next supermodel.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Out of heat, caught in chill
                                                                                                        Out of heat, caught in chill
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Amitabh and Aishwarya at Jaipur airport. (PTI)                                  
	Jaipur, Feb. 5: Amitabh Bachchan may have skipped Mumbais frying pan for some peace of mind but now chill seems to have caught up with the ageing hero in freezing Jaipur.        
	Family friend and constant companion Amar Singh said the 65-year-old superstar, who reached the Rajasthan capital yesterday, was running a mild temperature and had a sore throat.        
	So son Abhisheks 32nd birthday today would be a low-key affair. He (Amitabh) has cold, mild fever and some throat infection as well. There will be no birthday function, the Samajwadi Party leader told reporters at the Rambagh Palace hotel here.        
	Moreover, as Amitabhs mother Teji Bachchan had passed away recently, the family had already decided not to celebrate Abhisheks birthday.        
	It will take Amitabh two more days to recover. We are in touch with his family doctors (in Mumbai) and even a local doctor is being consulted, Amar added.        
	As icy winds blew across Rajasthan, and the state capital shivered at 5C, the Bachchans huddled inside the five-star hotel, away from media eyes.        
	Security had been tightened at the hotel since Amitabh, wife Jaya and daughter-in-law Aishwarya arrived yesterday.        
	Birthday boy Abhishek has been shooting in Nagaur district, about 60km west of Jaipur, for the past one month for Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehras Dilli 6.        
	Aishwarya had been flying in and out of the desert capital to be with him during the shoots.         
	The couple, who married last year, have a close association with Jaipur as they are supposed to have begun dating each other while shooting for J.P. Duttas Umrao Jaan here.        
	Rumours, however, swirled that Abhisheks birthday bash would be held at a resort some distance away and Amitabhs fever was just a ploy to keep the media away.

  Cops brave enough to fine CPM man          A STAFF REPORTER                            Sudip Kumar Maity controls traffic at the Shyambazar five-point crossing on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Calcutta, June 3: Backed by his boss and egged on by local people, a traffic sergeant today booked six-time MP Tarit Topdars driver for a series of traffic violations and refusing to hand over the licence.        
	The police, however, did not seize the vehicle, an action the rules call for when a driver fails to produce the licence.        
	The CPM and Citu leader, known as the strongman of North 24-Parganas, sat in his beacon-fitted Scorpio next to the driver as the car violated the central line on BT Road and jumped the red light at the Shyambazar five-point crossing before being stopped by Sudip Kumar Maity.        
	Aapni janen eta kar gari (Do you know whose car this is)? This is an MPs car, the security guard travelling with Topdar told the sergeant from the Shyambazar traffic guard.        
	Maity had already received the green light from K. Harirajan, assistant commissioner (III) who is in charge of traffic, to intercept WB24C 9760 and by that time a crowd had gathered around the car, exhorting him not to be bullied.                
	We asked the sergeant to prosecute the driver. We told him to carry out his job no matter who was in the vehicle, said Arun Kumar, a fruit seller, who was present.        
	Topdar, who admitted his vehicle had jumped the red signal, later said: Dont make a mountain out of a molehill. Is it so important?        
	Harirajan had first noticed Topdars car, heading from his Barrackpore house to the Citu office in Alimuddin Street, getting on the wrong side of the dividing line on BT Road at 11.45am and messaged the sergeant on duty at the five-point crossing.        
	When Topdars guard pulled rank, Maity informed his boss. Harirajan told him: I am not concerned about who is in the vehicle, which has flouted rules. Go ahead and prosecute. Nobody is above the law.        
	Topdar, who could hear the conversation, was getting annoyed. Armed with the sanction of the traffic chief, the sergeant asked the driver for the vehicles papers and his licence. Tarun Kumar Maity, the officer-in-charge of Shyambazar traffic guard, had also arrived at the spot.        
	The MP stepped in to tell the cops that the driver would not hand over the licence but that he was willing to give the registration papers.        
	Sir, you are not driving the car and we need the licence from him, Maity told Topdar.         
	The argument continued for nearly 10 minutes. It ended when Topdar, whos one of the CPMs wholetimers who have no sources of income other than the Rs 3,000-4,000 paid by the party, brought out the over Rs 7-lakh Scorpios registration certificate that is in his name and handed it over.        
	Topdar told The Telegraph: He (the driver) had the licence but I asked him not to show it to the police. Its a blatant lie that he had no licence.         
	The police fined Topdars driver Rs 300 but the MP declined to pay on the spot. He said he would go to court. We seized the registration certificate and let him go, an officer said.         
	Other than the MP, his driver and security guard, there was also a four-year-old boy in the car.

	Jamshedpur, May 24: A squad of Maoists killed a Nagarik Suraksha Samity (NSS) activist, Sushen Murmu, at Mucchrisole village in Ghatshila sub-division early this morning, reports our correspondent. Around 2am, about 70 rebels came to Muchhrisole village and raided Murmus house. The rebels took Murmus father hostage as he was sleeping outside. Subsequently, armed rebels entered the house and dragged the 26-year-old youth to an open field and slit his throat.         
	In Dhanbad, suspected Maoists hacked to death a resident of Gorga village in Dhanbad, Ramashankar Mahto (42), on Friday night.

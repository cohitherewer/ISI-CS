  - Mosque supported by Pataudi fills a vacuum in nawabi history          RASHEED KIDWAI                            The Masjid Sajida Sultan in Bhopal. Picture by Saeed Faruqui                                        
	Bhopal, June 24: A tribute to mom, from Tiger.        
	Indias youngest Test captain has set another record  but not on the cricket field.        
	A mosque named after Sajida Sultan, Bhopals last begum, has come up on land donated by her son Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, who is associated more with glamour than matters of faith.        
	You could even say Pataudi, also known as Tiger, has set the record straight: the city had several mosques but none had been built or sponsored by a male regent.        
	The Taj-ul-Masjid, Moti Masjid and the Jama Masjid in the former princely state, ruled by three generations of begums for a century from 1829, were all built by its women rulers.        
	It had remained one of the biggest ironies of nawabi rule in Bhopal spread over 240 years that none of the male regents built a mosque, said Arif Aziz, author of several books on mosques in the Madhya Pradesh capital.        
	Tiger may not have directly built Masjid Sajida Sultan but his contribution has been immense.        
	The current market price of the land, which forms part of Pataudis personal fortune, is said to be around Rs 5 crore.        
	Masjid Sajida Sultan managing committee member Nafees-ur-Rahman Khan said the mosque project began in 2003 and was now in the process of being completed.        
	It proved a daunting task to build a house of God. Nawab Pataudi readily donated the land but some illegal settlers refused to vacate the plot without compensation. Getting permission from various departments and government agencies was another difficulty, Nafees, who claimed to have played for some prominent Calcutta football clubs in the 1970s, added.        
	But the name of Begum Sajida Sultan did help tide over these intricacies.        
	Spread over 19,600sqft and overlooking the serene Bada Talab (big lake), the mosque has a separate enclosure for women that can accommodate around 150.        
	We have started namaz and taravi (recitation of the Quran) for women during Ramazan, the month of fasting, Nafees said. We are also constructing a modern-age madarsa for boys inside the mosque where computers, mathematics and science will be taught along with traditional courses such as Hifz.        
	During his last trip to the city, Pataudi had visited the mosque along with elder daughter Saba, who is tipped to take over from her father as head of the family trusts.        
	His sister Saheha Sultan, too, has visited the mosque and prayed inside the specially constructed enclosure for women.        
	Aziz says the faithful believe God rewards those who build, furnish or donate land for mosques. It is a kind of sadaqah jaariyah (ongoing/lasting charity) which continues to bring reward after one dies. The Prophets saying is that whoever builds a mosque, Allah will build for him something like it in Paradise.

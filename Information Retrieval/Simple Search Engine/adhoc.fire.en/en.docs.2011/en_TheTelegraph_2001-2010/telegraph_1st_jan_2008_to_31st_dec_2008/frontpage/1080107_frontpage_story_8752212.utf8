     G.S. RADHAKRISHNA AND MOHUA DAS
              Amar Singh
                
	Hyderabad/Calcutta, Jan. 6: Amar Singh does not call himself Amitabh Bachchans younger brother for nothing.
    
	The Samajwadi Party leader has stepped into film acting, embracing the glamour world he so loves, but will virtually be playing himself in Ashoke Viswanathans Shesh Sanghat (final conflict).
    
	For the past three days he has been shooting in Hyderabad for the Bengali film, in a reversal of the trend of actors turning politicians.
    
	Amar makes a guest appearance, playing a character role as a retired state government minister.
    
	His character is a genial, amiable gentleman, a father figure to the principal male character (Jackie Shroff playing an IPS officer), Viswanathan said.
    
	The director added that the portly Amar, a regular at celebrity parties and known for his connections in the business and film world, looked the part and suited the role.
    
	It may not be a coincidence that Amars party colleague and actress Jaya Prada is producing the film as well as playing the female lead.
    
	Amar, who has spent a part of his life in Calcutta, is very fluent in Bengali and speaks a few lines of Hindi dialogue, too, Viswanathan said.
    
	The Samajwadi leader mostly shares screen space with Shroff, advising his character how to cope with pressure from politicians.
    
	Amar apparently knows little about these dark sides of politics. Viswanathan said that since the film was political, Amar had to be explained the nuances of his role in detail.
    
	Its an interesting role and I am happy to be acting with Jaya Prada, the politician said.
    
	Jaya said the shooting would be complete in a week and the film would release by April 15, the Bengali New Year. She plays a woman who avenges her humiliation at the hands of powerful men.
    
	Bappi Lahiri has set the music and a part of the film was shot in Santiniketan.

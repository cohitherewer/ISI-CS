          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 10: Singur is a problem, but Bengal is not Singur, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said today in remarks that sounded like preparation for life after the small car in case the Tatas exit.        
	Singur is a problem. It has raised some apprehensions and spread to some nook and corner. I am sincerely trying to solve Singur for once and for all. Bengal is not Singur, the chief minister said at the inauguration of an animation campus on Sector V.        
	Bhattacharjee said he had been trying to address concerns among investors in the wake of Singur. Companies I met in the last few days, I have told them that Singur is an exception. Bengal is not Singur. There are foreign companies coming to invest, seven steel plants are being set up in the state. Videocon is making a huge electronic complex, the Japanese companies are expanding. This is Bengal. Some people may create problems in our path of industrialisation. But no one can stop it because the people want it, said Bhattacharjee.        
	He said IT minister Debesh Das was asked to speak to officials of Infosys that had said investors are terrified of entering Bengal, though the company had made it clear it had no plans to scrap its project in Rajarhat.        
	I have spoken to Infosys officials. They are concerned about the turn of events. But there are no plans of altering their investment agenda in Bengal, Das later said.

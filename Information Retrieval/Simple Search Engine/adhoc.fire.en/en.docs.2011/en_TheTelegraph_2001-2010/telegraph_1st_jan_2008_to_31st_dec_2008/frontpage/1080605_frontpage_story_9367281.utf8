          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, June 4: Sacked Assam education minister Ripun Bora and a co-accused were today remanded in three days custody by a Delhi court for allegedly offering a bribe of Rs 10 lakh to a CBI official to hush up a murder.         
	Granting custody to the CBI, the court said the investigating agencys plea was justified for it needed to interrogate Bora and Delhi-based businessman Ramesh Maheshwari, who allegedly provided him the money.         
	Since the fact and missing links of the circumstantial evidence are to be collected from Guwahati as well, I am of opinion that they be remanded in police custody till June 7, the judge said.         
	Sources in the CBI said Boras custody would also help them investigate the murder of student leader Daniel Topno in which the Assam minister was a suspect.         
	Topno, a leader of All Assam Tea Tribe Students Union, was Boras rival candidate in Gohpur constituency during the 1996 Assembly elections in Assam.        
	The agency had been trying to interrogate Bora for quite some time now but he was reportedly using evasive tactics.         
	CBI officials said the minister, in his bid to wriggle out of the ongoing probe against him, tried to bribe deputy superintendent of police A.B. Gupta, who was investigating the case.         
	According to the CBI, Bora, along with Pathak, had come to Delhi on June 2 and invited the officer to an inn at the posh Sunder Nagar area of New Delhi.         
	The minister reached the inn at the appointed time the next day with Maheshwari in his official car.         
	Once in front of the inn, he sent the car and his personal security officer away.         
	Bora went inside to meet the CBI official while Maheshwari waited in another car that he had arranged for before hand.        
	After a while, Bora reportedly asked Maheshwari to come into room number 213 with the bag containing Rs 10 lakh.         
	He had promised a total of Rs 17 lakh  the rest to be paid later. When they realised that it was a trap, Maheshwari threw the money and tried to flee but both were overpowered. Earlier in the day, contesting CBIs plea for custody, Bora had alleged that he had been framed by his political rivals who were not happy with his growing popularity as a leader.         
	The court, however, said the accusations, justifying their arrest, are well founded. Conspiracy is hatched in darkness and that is to be probed during the thorough interrogation. Any missing link may impede the investigation.         
	It added that the circumstances suggested that there was a conspiracy between Bora, Maheshwari and Mukul Pathak, a journalist, arrested at Guwahati airport, to bribe a CBI official who was probing the murder case.

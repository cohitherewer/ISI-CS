          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, June 18: The Centre has quietly upgraded the status of the current chairman of the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) to the rank of Union cabinet minister without amending a seniority list.        
	The UPA government is also considering a proposal to upgrade the status of the chairman of the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) to cabinet rank, officials said. The NCMEI was created in 2004 to supervise minority education.        
	The decision to upgrade the rank of the NCM chairman, Mohamed Shafi Qureshi, was taken in May after sustained pressure from human resource development minister Arjun Singh, sources said.        
	Unlike similar upgrades in the past, the change in Qureshis status has not been announced because the Centre does not want to jeopardise plans to elevate the status of the NCMEI chairman, they said.         
	Two such upgrades in quick succession may attract controversy. We do not want that, a senior official said.        
	The change in status applies only to the current NCM chairman and not to the post, the sources said, which might be cited as a defence against not amending the seniority list.        
	Upgrading the status of the post requires changes to the governments seniority list and Parliaments approval for an amendment to the NCM Act. These changes, the government fears, could draw flak from the opposition BJP.        
	At present, the post of NCM chairman is 17 on the Centres seniority list, 10 notches below that of Union cabinet minister at seven. When the rank goes up, perks and the way a person is treated will also change.        
	I have held posts that rank higher than that of a cabinet minister. I have never lobbied for this rank at the NCM, Qureshi said.        
	Qureshi is a veteran Congress leader from Kashmir, which goes to polls later this year. A former Union minister, Qureshi has also been governor of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and has held additional charge of Bengal.        
	M.S.A. Siddiqui, the chairman of the NCMEI, said he was not aware of any move to upgrade his rank.         
	Officials close to Arjun confirmed that it was the minister who pushed his cabinet colleagues to upgrade Qureshis rank, weathering opposition from the Prime Ministers Office.        
	A cabinet note signed by Arjun, seeking the upgrade, was circulated to all central ministries, but no one responded, a source said. Arjun then asked the PMO for its opinion. The PMO suggested wider discussions before granting the rank to Qureshi, the source said.         
	But with no concrete reasons for opposition cited, Arjun was successful in pushing through the change in status, the source said.

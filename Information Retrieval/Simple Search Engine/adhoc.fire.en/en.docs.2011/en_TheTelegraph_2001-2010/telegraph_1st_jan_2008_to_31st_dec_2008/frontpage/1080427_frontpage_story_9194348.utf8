          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Imphal, April 26: A high-level central team, led by cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekhar, today acknowledged that Manipur has a law and order problem that needs to be tackled effectively.        
	Manipur has a problem. We came here on a fact-finding mission. We discussed the matter with senior officials of state and central agencies to work out formulas for better co-ordination among them, Chandrashekhar told the media at the end of the law and order review meeting.        
	Chandrashekhar, accompanied by a host of officials from various ministries, including defence secretary Vijay Singh and home secretary Madhukar Gupta, arrived here yesterday to review the prevailing law and order situation and progress of development projects.        
	The 12-member team met Governor S.S. Sidhu and chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh separately yesterday to discuss the situation in the state.        
	Chief secretary Jarnail Singh, GOC 3 Corps Lt Gen. M.S. Dadwal, GOC 57 Mountain Division Maj. Gen. T.S. Handa, inspector-general (South) Assam Rifles Maj. Gen. B.K. Chengapa and director general of police Yumnam Joykumar Singh attended the meeting at the secretariat.        
	Senior officials from other paramilitary forces like the BSF and CRPF were also present. We talked about ways to improve the situation. It was an exercise to decide who will do what to bring a better environment in Manipur. We will submit a report to the Centre on the prevailing situation in the state, the cabinet secretary said.        
	State police officials, who attended the meeting, remained tight-lipped on the proceedings of the meeting.         
	The central teams visit is significant in view of the recent bomb attacks by militants in Imphal, including vital government installations.        
	The Kangleipak Communist Party (Military Council) on Thursday exploded an IED fitted to a scooter using a timer device inside heavily guarded Babupara VIP colony, which houses quarters of ministers and MLAs, injuring four bystanders.         
	The team returned to New Delhi this afternoon.        
	Moreh trade: Border trade through Moreh was disrupted for the second time in a month today, with a tribal womens organisation from Chandel blocking traffic along the Imphal-Moreh route of National Highway 39.         
	The All Tribal Womens Organisation has called an indefinite road blockade to protest the failure of the state to arrest the murderers of two persons. Unidentified persons had gunned down P.S. Angsung alias Julie and Esther Anal at Khegman in Thoubal district on March 21.                    
	If the government fails to arrest and punish the culprits by tomorrow, we will picket all government offices in the district from Monday, convenor T.K. Amita said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The day after, a friend asks:   What will I tell her mom?
   Fear unites, fate divides
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                        Chandra Prakash, along with his mother Laxmi, waits for the body of his father Chandra Bhan. (AFP)				                                             
	A young man who has been told a few minutes ago that his fiancee  a brilliant student  is dead, a bank employee who cannot forgive herself because a friend she was having ice cream with died, a mother who lost two sons and daughters-in-law, a driver who did not make it to work. Saturdays blasts touched the lives of many people you will run into on any given day.        
	Some survived. Some did not. Their story:              
	Gripping each others hands, Mamata and Laxmi had sobbed together on Saturday, strangers united in fear outside an emergency ward where their loved ones battled bomb injuries.        
	Twelve hours later, Laxmi was collecting husband Chandra Bhans body from Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, wiping her tears with the pallu of her sari. Fifteen feet away stood Mamata, smiling at a friend of her son Deepak, now declared out of danger and being treated for shrapnel injuries to his lower abdomen and left arm.        
	Between them stood a mortuary van.        
	The official death toll till this evening: 21 (15 men, 6 women). Patients still in hospitals: 72.         
	My sons safe, the doctors have said. He will need to remain in hospital for a few days, but he is out of danger. Thats all that counts, Mamata said.        
	Deepak, a SpiceJet employee, was returning home from his Connaught Place office last evening when a bomb went off in a garbage can at Central Park.        
	He had decided to cut across Central Park (in Connaught Place) on his way back home. Thats when he was hit by the force of the blast, said Rajesh, a colleague and friend whom the police had contacted after Deepak was brought to the hospital.                Bengal victims         The serial blasts in Delhi claimed two lives from Bengal. Subrata Mandal, a 23-year-old jewellery designer from Howrah, died in Karol Bagh as he was buying a cellphone for his mother.   Nepal Sardar, 22, from Fakirdanga in Nadia rsquo;s Nabadwip, was a cycle-rickshaw puller in Karol Bagh. n See Metro        
	Mamatas brother gently tugged at her arm and she climbed into a white Maruti 800 to visit a nearby temple. Bhagwan ne meri sun li (God has heard my prayers), she said, rolling down the window as they drove off.        
	Laxmi said her husband Chandra Bhan, 50, a Municipal Corporation of Delhi driver, had just left for work when he fell victim to the Gaffar Market blast.        
	What was his fault? He wouldnt hurt anyone, not even a terrorist. He was just doing his job, she sobbed. The couple and their six-and-a-half-year-old son Chandra Prakash lived in Karol Bagh, but Laxmi said she now wanted to move out as soon as she could.        
	Friends guilt        
	Nisha Gupta, 22, broke down as her sister Smita whispered into her ear. A worried doctor asked nurses to inject Nisha with a sedative to calm her down.         
	Nisha shook her head vehemently at the suggestion. Im fine, she said between sobs, her left hand reaching out to soothe a bandaged shrapnel wound below her right shoulder.         
	Her friend Babita, 20, with whom she was sharing an ice cream at Central Park when a bomb went off, was dead, ICICI bank employee Nisha had just learnt.         
	What am I going to tell Babitas mother? How am I even going to look at her mother again? Nisha wondered aloud.        
	Clutched in her left hand was the hospitals own memento to the bomb blast victims.         
	Nishas medical report does not describe her injuries, but underneath the hospital masthead, where the patients ailment is usually mentioned, it spelt out why she had been admitted.         
	Bomb blast victim. C/ P.S. Connaught Place.        
	Shanta Devi, 60, has lost four members of her family  two sons and their wives  in the blast at Karol Baghs Gaffar Market. I am not injured, but I will remain a victim for ever, she said.        
	Fiancee dead        
	Twenty-seven-year-old Kashyap Singhs battle for life at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital may have just become harder, doctors fear.         
	His 24-year-old fiancee Kamini (Harshabbhai Patel) is dead. They were sitting at Central Park when the bomb exploded. We consciously didnt tell Kashyap about Kaminis death, as it is harder for someone with survivors guilt to pull through. But one of their family members just told him, a resident doctor said.         
	Kamini, from Gujarat, had graduated in computer science and was a student of the faculty of technology and engineering at Barodas MS University. She was also working with TCS and had come to Delhi to appear for a bank test, her brother Rakesh Patel told PTI.         
	The pro-vice-chancellor of MS University, S.M.Joshi, said Kamini was a brilliant student.

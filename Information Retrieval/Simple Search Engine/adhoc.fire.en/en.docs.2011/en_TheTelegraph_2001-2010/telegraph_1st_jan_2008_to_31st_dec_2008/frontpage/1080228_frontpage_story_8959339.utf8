	Calcutta, Feb. 27: Liluah lad Sreevats Goswami knows hes on television.        
	The 18-year-old top-scored in Indias three-wicket win over New Zealand today that has earned it a place in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup final.        
	How different was it from being part of the tri-series winning team in South Africa last month?        
	There are a lot of TV cameras here and the matches are being shown live. I know you get to see what we are doing here on TV back home. Our tri-series win in South Africa was not telecast.        
	The final will begin at 11.30am IST on Sunday at Kuala Lumpurs Kinrara Academy Oval. STAR Cricket is showing the matches live.        
	If Pakistan beats South Africa in the second semi-final, to be played on Friday, it will be the second time the neighbours will clash in a junior final. In 2006 in Colombo, Pakistan had defeated India to win the World Cup.        
	The Indians, though, will be hoping for a repeat of another Colombo final  that of 2000 when they beat Sri Lanka to lift the Cup.        
	Are the Indians looking for revenge for 2006? Yes, said Sreevats.         
	For that, both teams will have to keep up their winning streak for one match more. The neighbours are unbeaten in the tournament so far.         
	Todays match was the first in which India lost more than five wickets. Despite a late burst by New Zealand, the team held its nerve and reached the target of 191 off 43 overs in the rain-interrupted match for the loss of seven wickets.         
	The teen, who scored 51 in an 84-run partnership with captain and man of the match Virat Kohli, has been too busy batting and wicketkeeping to join college. He passed the Higher Secondary examination with commerce from Liluahs Rose Bird Academy last year.        
	Parents Alka and Pratyush are hoping he will find the time in the next academic session. We hope to get him admitted to a college and he wants to study commerce. But you never know, said Pratyush, who runs a chemicals business.        
	Sreevats, who scored 104 against Bangladesh and 97 against South Africa in the tri-series, has other priorities.        
	I hope to play with Sourav (Ganguly) in the next season, said the teen who has represented Bengal at the under-19 level but is still to make the senior team.         
	With his own success and Manoj Tiwarys inclusion in the senior ODI squad, is Howrah the new Behala? No way I have miles to go before getting anywhere near Sourav, says the left-handed Sreevats.         
	The teen who has made the Bangalore-based National Cricket Academy his second home has an Australian as his idol. Im a die-hard fan of Adam Gilchrist. Like him, I thoroughly enjoy both keeping and batting. Coach Dav Whatmore and manager Gopal Bose have encouraged me and helped me finetune both.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Sonia                                  
	New Delhi, June 23: UPA allies have cautioned Sonia Gandhi that an early election would be politically suicidal.         
	The leaders of three parties met the Congress chief today and told her Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should bring down inflation before pursuing the nuclear deal.        
	Sharad Pawar, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan conveyed to Sonia in separate meetings that the deal was in national interest but it shouldnt be concluded over the Lefts head. Later, Pawar met CPM chief Prakash Karat.        
	No issue is so intractable that a solution cannot be found by engaging in talks. That is what the meeting (of the UPA-Left panel) on June 25 will do. But an early election will not suit the country, Lalu Prasad said.        
	As the Congress waited for Sonia and Singh to speak their minds, a leader said: We will not take a single step without getting our allies on board.        
	Singh had staked his prestige and authority on the deal to the extent that dilution or withdrawal could undermine his position, the leader said, but suggested the partners had to be taken along. Such crucial decisions are taken by them. The Prime Minister understands this.        
	Sonias dilemma is to choose between the Prime Minister and her political compulsions. Sonia has been extremely mindful of the Prime Ministers sensitivities in such matters. She also believes the deal is good for India. But if we came to power, it was because of the understanding with which she stitched up the coalition. She cannot give that up, another leader said.        
	Sources said both leaders would have to make up their minds by tomorrow so that when the UPA-Left panel meets on Wednesday, Pranab Mukherjee could place their cards on the table. Asked what the cards could be, a leader said: It depends on the PM.        
	Singh, who didnt attend office for the latter part of last week because of illness, went to South Block today. He is understood to have asked defence minister A.K. Antony to defer a scheduled visit to Japan. Antony is a member of the nuclear panel.        
	Another setback to the deal pushers has come from Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh, who was quoted by a channel as saying that any decision on supporting the government would be taken by the United National Progressive Alliance and not unilaterally.        
	Asked if the Samajwadis, who oppose the deal, had reviewed their stand, Amar Singh said: We are not in the loop. Unless we are convinced that our position on the deal is not substantiated by facts, there is no room for change.

	Calcutta, Jan. 12: If only the fire services department had acted on any of the 134 appeals from a tenant in Jamunalal Bajaj Street, between July 2004 and September 2005, todays fire at the Nandaram market complex may have been averted.
    
	There is a fire waiting to happen here Through The Telegraph we would like to appeal to all concerned to act before it is too late, wrote Suresh Somani on February 4, 2007.
    
	On behalf of the tenants of his building (35 Jamunalal Bajaj Street) and two other buildings in the area, the trader from Burrabazar had stated why the market-cum-residential area was a tinderbox  illegal constructions, live electric wires hanging loose, narrow lanes that kept out fire tenders and a huge stock of inflammable material.
    
	Somani had petitioned every senior official in the fire department. He had written to fire minister Pratim Chatterjee six times, emailed him 10 times, faxed him 20 times and visited him seven times to highlight the tragedy waiting to happen in Burrabazar. He had paid 50 visits to the director-general of fire services, besides writing him five letters and sending 20 faxes.
    
	In all, Somani had sent 77 letters, emails and faxes to officials in the fire services department and visited them 57 times, all within 14 months.
    
	The trader had also turned in vain to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), police, Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and the CESC for help before writing to The Telegraph.
    
	The high court had barred construction on the ground floor of the Burrabazar buildings in 2004. The illegal constructions, however, did not stop, thanks to the use of muscle power, money and political connections, as is the norm in the area, alleged Somani.
    
	The CMC had issued an order in 2005 to demolish illegal constructions in the three buildings  sharing a common entrance and exit passage narrowed to 4-foot width by illegal constructions  but no action was taken. And textiles, which are highly inflammable, continued to be stocked and sold from these fire hazards.
    
	The civic body had passed the buck to the local police station and the deputy commissioner (central), who, in turn, had directed Somani and Co. back to the CMC.
    
	We fear official help will only come to us after a disaster happens, Somani had written.
    
	That disaster happened early today, in the buildings adjoining Somanis.
    
	Hundreds of people have lost their only source of livelihood in the fire. If only the authorities had heard our pleas, lamented Somani.

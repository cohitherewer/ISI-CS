	Jaipur, Aug. 5: An infant born of a surrogate mother has been left in the lurch as her biological parents, a Japanese couple, divorced after conception.        
	The Japanese lady is unwilling to take responsibility for the baby. The father, Yukufusi Yamada, an orthopaedic surgeon, wants to take the 10-day-old girl to Japan, but is facing problems as Indian adoption laws prevent him from doing so.         
	The baby girl was born to a surrogate mother in Anand near Ahmedabad on July 25, a month after her biological parents divorced, said Dr Sanjay Arya who is looking after the baby in a Jaipur hospital.         
	Yamada, 48, and wife Yuki had reached Ahmedabad last year and entered into a nine-month contract with the surrogate mother for conceiving their child in her womb. The couple returned to Japan, but divorced in June.         
	Although the couple were informed of the babys birth, Yuki refused to accept her and stayed put in Japan. The father, accompanied by his septuagenarian mother, travelled to Ahmedabad and took custody of the child.         
	After the July 26 blasts, he decided to move out of the city and shifted to Jaipur where he has a friend who has had business links with Japan for the past 25 years.         
	Yamada is willing to take responsibility for the baby, but was told by the Japanese embassy in New Delhi that as the girl was born in India, she would need an Indian passport and no-objection certificate to leave the country.         
	Under Indian laws, an infants passport has to be linked to the mothers. Since her biological mother has refused to take custody of the baby, it would be difficult to get a passport made for her.         
	The option now for Yamada is to adopt the baby if he wants to take her to Japan. But Indian adoption laws restrict a single father from adopting a girl child.        
	Faced with the legal hurdles, Yamada returned to Japan on Sunday, leaving the infant in the care of his mother who doesnt understand or speak English. The 70-year-old lady is on a travel visa, which is set to expire soon.        
	The infant was brought to the Jaipur hospital on Sunday, suffering from dehydration and septicaemia. Although she is better now, she needs proper care, said Dr Arya. She is taking oral feed and is much better.         
	Legal expert Alka Bhatnagar said it was a first-of-its-kind case and since laws regarding surrogate motherhood were not pronounced in India, taking the baby to Japan could be a problem. She said the Japanese embassy would have to take the initiative to get her passport made. For this, her biological father would have to be identified and arrangements made for Yamadas DNA test.

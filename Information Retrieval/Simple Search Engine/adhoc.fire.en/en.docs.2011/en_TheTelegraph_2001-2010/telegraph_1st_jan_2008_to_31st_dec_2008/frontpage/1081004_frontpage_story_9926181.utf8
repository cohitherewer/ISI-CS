	Tenughat (Bokaro), Oct. 3: Jagannath Mahto appeared before magistrates at Tenughat today but the JMM MLA opened himself up to more trouble as the local jail superintendent claimed the Dumri leader was shifted out of Bokaro district within a few hours of his surrender last week without his permission.         
	Tenughat jail superintendent Ramesh Prasad has said that attending sub-divisional doctor Shashi Shankar Prasad may have felt the need to shift the politician to the Ranchi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS). But the doctor did not care to keep him informed. Mahto has five cases pending against him, including a murder case dating back to 1985. In fact, he has had a permanent arrest warrant issued against him in connection with the case since 2003.         
	Today, Mahto appeared in Tenughat before first class magistrate D.K.Mishra and sub-judicial magistrate A. K. Chaturvedi in connection with three of the five cases, but not in the murder case. As reported in The Telegraph, Mahtos case was revived after a Bokaro district judge ordered local SP Priya Dube to execute the arrest warrant of 2003. But even though the police looked the other way, pressure mounted on the MLA to give himself up.        
	Mahto surrendered on September 27 in Tenughat, but managed to get himself moved to RIMs on health grounds within hours of being sent to jail. Mishra took umbrage at that and sought a clarification from Prasad and attending physician A.K.Sinha, who is yet to reply.         
	But Prasad claimed he informed the magistrate soon after he got to know that the MLA had been sent to RIMs from newspaper reports appearing the day after he surrendered. In fact, he said, he even spoke to the MLA on his cell phone to confirm.         
	Mishra, in whose court Mahto had surrendered, issued a showcause to Prasad on Wednesday as he hadnt received the jail superintendents letter which he clamed he sent on September 28.

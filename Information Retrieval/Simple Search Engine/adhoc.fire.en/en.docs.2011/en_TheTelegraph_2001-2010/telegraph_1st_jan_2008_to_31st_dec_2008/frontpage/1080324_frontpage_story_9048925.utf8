The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Posco set to miss April 1 target
                                                                                                           Posco set to miss April 1 target
          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 23: From a war cry, the chief ministers Posco claims resemble more a whimper nowadays.         
	Naveen Patnaiks hope to begin construction of the $12-billion mega steel plant near Paradip with South Korean steel maker Posco, sometime close to April 1, seems dashed  despite socio-economic survey and land demarcation processes being complete.        
	Uncertainty persists over the ground-breaking and foundation stone-laying ceremonies of the plant, as was evident from the statements made by the chief minister while he was talking with the media today.        
	Naveen, who earlier told the media that the construction would begin according to schedule (April 1), today was less certain. Tomorrow is Monday. We will see what can be done, he replied.         
	Naveen parried questions as to whether he would review the law and order situation in the proposed Posco plant area tomorrow. Review of law and order situation is a routine process, he said.         
	In December, the chief minister had hoped that the construction would begin according to schedule. The target date for the construction has been given (April 1). And we hope that the foundation stone will be laid on the scheduled date, Naveen had said.        
	Now, even Posco officials dont seem sure of the date. We will take a final decision tomorrow and let you know, said Sasanka Patnaik, the Posco spokesperson. On October 19, 2007, Poscos chief executive officer Lee Ku-taek had announced that the project would start from April 1, 2008.         
	April 1, 2008, is the 40th anniversary of Posco and by then we will also be able to complete the ground-breaking ceremony for the Orissa project, he had said after a meeting with the chief minister.         
	April 1 is also the states foundation day and celebrated as Utkal Diwas. The state was obviously keen on the date and could have used the occasion to generate political mileage.         
	Sources said the government has been in a dilemma, as the nod from the Union environment and forest ministry for the diversion of around 3,000 acres of forestland is yet to be obtained. Besides, possibilities of a showdown by anti-Posco protesters on that day are also forcing the government to review the date.

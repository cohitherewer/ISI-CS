  - Aviation sector, train services, industry bear the brunt                                        
	Aug. 20: The all-India general strike called by Left-wing central trade unions against the UPA governments anti-people and neo-liberal policies today virtually brought life to a grinding halt in Left-ruled Tripura and affected life in Assam, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, and Meghalaya.         
	In Congress-ruled Assam, all flights between Guwahati and Calcutta were cancelled today, though flights to the other Northeast destinations, as well as Delhi and Mumbai, operated as usual, sources said.         
	Official sources said no untoward incident had been reported so far but hundreds of CPI, CPM, CPI (M-L) and AISF activists were picked up from several areas of the state for attempting to block the movement of trains and traffic on the national highways.         
	In the strike-hit areas, including Guwahati, markets, shops and banks downed shutters. Educational institutions remained closed and public transport stayed off the roads, sources said. Though government offices were open, attendance was thin.         
	Manipur, another Congress-ruled state that yesterday experienced a 24-hour general strike called in protest against the exclusion of weightlifter Laishram Monika Chanu from the Indian Olympic team in Beijing, was hard hit for the second consecutive day today for the trade bandh.         
	Markets, shops, business establishments remained closed. Attendance in government offices was thin as transport services were suspended, official sources said. Educational institutions, however, remained open. Major transporters said they had also cancelled their services between Manipur and the neighbouring states.         
	In Tripura, the Left bastion in the Northeast, the daylong strike paralysed life with schools, colleges, markets and financial institutions remaining closed. The streets were deserted and no attendance was recorded in government offices, banks and public sector undertakings like the ONGC and Gail India Ltd.        
	 However, no untoward incident was reported from any part of the state, police said.        
	In Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya, the impact of the bandh was limited.        
	Though central government establishments, banks, LIC and post offices remained closed in Arunachal Pradesh, life was not affected otherwise in the state. Shops and markets remained open and vehicles plied as usual, official sources said.         
	The strike affected parts of Meghalaya, particularly Shillong, with functioning in most government offices coming to a standstill. Work in the BSNL, postal department, the Geological Survey of India and other central offices was paralysed, while state government offices also witnessed thin attendance.         
	There was no untoward incident reported from anywhere in the state.                     WRITTEN WITH AGENCY REPORTS

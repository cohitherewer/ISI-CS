          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Shillong, April 19: Ulfa chief Paresh Barua is in Bangladesh, a senior cadre of the outfit has said, bringing under the scanner the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) recent claim that the outfits self-styled commander-in-chief has fled elsewhere.        
	Ranjit Kumar Roy, alias Bakul Roy, who surrendered before the BSF here today, claimed he had met Barua at the Bakakura training camp in Sherpur district of Bangladesh during the outfits Sainik Divas celebrations on March 16.         
	I am sure he is in Bangladesh, the surrendered Ulfa militant, who is also an explosives expert, claimed.         
	I have interacted with him (Barua) who travelled all the way from Dhaka and addressed the gathering of 34 Ulfa cadre on March 16 in the Bakakura camp. I am sure he is in Bangladesh, Roy said during the surrender ceremony in the presence of the inspector-general of the BSF, P.K. Misra, at the BSF headquarters here.         
	When asked to describe Barua, Roy said: Paresh Barua no longer sports a moustache and prefers to remain clean shaven. He has put on more weight.         
	Barua told the cadre in the camp to continue the fight for a separate homeland, the surrendered rebel said.        
	Roy was also the physical training instructor at the Ulfa camp in Bakakura bordering West Garo Hills of Meghalaya.         
	The camp is considered the storehouse of arms and ammunition.        
	Ulfa leaders, including senior captain Biju Deka, Pradyut Borgohain, Drishti Rajkhowa and Bharti Barua also attended the function, Roy said.        
	Last Saturday, the director-general of the BDR, Maj. Gen. Shakil Ahmed, told reporters that Barua had fled Bangladesh.         
	Ulfa today alleged that the Centre was not interested in a peaceful solution of the conflict situation.         
	Quoting its chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa in its monthly newsletter Freedom, the outfit said during a recent surrender ceremony in Dinjan, some army officers vowed to crush Ulfa and its national liberation struggle of Assam.        
	During the third round of talks with the PCG, a joint memorandum was published with the consent of both the parties that specifies that both India and Ulfa would try to create a congenial atmosphere for dialogue, but Government of India did not honour the commitment, Ulfa said.        
	AASU protest: The All Assam Students Union will observe Tuesday as a black day to protest the killing of Dulen Baruah by security forces at Himpora village in Sivasagar district.

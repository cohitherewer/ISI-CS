The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Charm offensive for quick Vienna vote 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Charm offensive for quick Vienna vote 
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, July 6: The UPA governments strategy in Vienna is to press for a quick vote among the Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the safeguards agreement in the race against time for operationalising the nuclear deal during the remainder of the Bush administration.        
	The board is likely to convene for a special session on Monday, although a formal announcement of the meeting is yet to be made in Vienna.        
	Indias permanent representative to international organisations in Vienna, Saurabh Kumar, has assessed that no one will vote against the safeguards agreement when it is brought before the IAEAs board of governors.        
	The Indian mission in Vienna is under a virtual gag order and has been told not to speak to the media about its ongoing dealings with the IAEA on the pact that will mark a milestone in New Delhis relations with the UNs nuclear watchdog.        
	But sources in New Delhi who have had access to the missions telegrams to South Block said Kumars worst-case scenario is that a few countries which have reservations about the safeguards agreement will abstain from the vote for its approval.        
	He is confident that Indias stellar record in nuclear controls and safety will be an asset that he can use to persuade even those who have doubts among members of the IAEAs board of governors not to vote against the agreement.        
	India is one of 11 countries which are permanent members of the board. In addition, India holds the chairmanship of the Middle East and South Asia (MESA) group on the board.        
	Thus Indias standing in the IAEA and its history of involvement in the evolution of the organisation will be factors that will persuade the board to treat New Delhi a world apart from other countries whose record in non-proliferation has recently been brought before the board.        
	The IAEA has 35 governors, who will consider the India-specific safeguards agreement.        
	Earlier this year, India quietly shored up its standing on the Board by sending president Pratibha Patil to Santiago on a state visit that endeared her immensely to another woman president, Chiles Michelle Bachelet.        
	The goodwill significance of Patils April visit to Santiago in the context of the nuclear deal was that Chiles permanent representative to UN organisations in Vienna, Milenko Skoknic, is the current chairman of the IAEAs board of governors.        
	Sources in Vienna assert that President Bachelets foreign ministry has given detailed and specific instructions to Skoknic to ensure the smooth approval of the safeguards pact when it is tabled before the board.        
	The chairman has the whip hand in the procedural maze in UN organisations: in this case, Skoknics rulings during the deliberations by IAEA governors are expected to be more important to India than the support by the organisations director-general Mohamed ElBaradei.        
	Skoknic will determine, to a very large extent, the speed with which the safeguards agreement is cleared by the board.        
	Although Indias ambassador to Chile, Susmita Gongulee Thomas, was posted to San Francisco as consul general several months ago, she is leaving her post on July 11 only after a final round of lobbying in Santiago.        
	Thomas lives bang opposite Bachelet in a Santiago suburb. She has such a special rapport with Chiles President as her neighbour that she sends chicken curry across the road and Bachelet responds with similar gestures.        
	The current IAEA boards vice-chairman is Frank Cogan, who represents Ireland. Kumar moved recently to the Indian mission in Vienna from Ireland, where he was ambassador for three years.        
	Considering Irelands vice presidency of the IAEA board, Kumar has intensely lobbied with Cogan in recent months for the safeguards agreement and tirelessly used his contacts in Dublin to sway Ireland on procedural matters on the board.        
	He is said to have been more successful in this effort than in persuading Ireland to shed its doubts about New Delhis nuclear deal with Washington.

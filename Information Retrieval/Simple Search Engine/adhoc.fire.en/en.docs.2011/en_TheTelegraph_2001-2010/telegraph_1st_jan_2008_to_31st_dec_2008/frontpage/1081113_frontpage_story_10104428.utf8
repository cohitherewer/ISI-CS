          G.S. MUDUR                            Strategy shift                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: An advisory panel has asked the health ministry to consider introducing an injectible polio vaccine next year in nine districts of Uttar Pradesh, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said today.         
	The India Expert Advisory Group, which helps the government devise strategies against polio, has recommended the use of the injectible vaccine in the nine districts as an additional tool along with the standard oral polio drops, Ramadoss said.         
	Its being recommended, but we still have to look into logistics, he said.         
	The wild polio virus has persisted in these nine districts, which include Badaun, Moradabad and Rampur, despite repeated immunisation with the oral vaccine.         
	Sources said though some members of the advisory group had argued for the introduction of the injectible vaccine, there was sharp disagreement among the members over the dose schedule being proposed in the draft recommendations.         
	The schedule proposed at the groups meeting is not in line with the standard three-dose schedule recommended by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, the sources said. How can we use a vaccine on children in an unprecedented manner? a source asked.         
	The sources said some panel members wanted the government to prepare for injectible vaccine introduction only as a contingency measure if polio continued to spread next year despite the next few rounds of immunisation by oral drops.         
	Weve asked for clarifications on this issue. And were waiting for the final recommendations, a senior health ministry official, who requested not to be named, said.         
	India has always used the oral vaccine in its polio eradication programme, but a number of studies have questioned its efficacy. This year, at least 315 of 499 children paralysed by polio had received more than 10 doses of the vaccine.         
	Some paediatricians have argued for several years for the introduction of the injectible vaccine, which they say is safer and more effective in protecting individual children. But it is also far more expensive than the oral drops.         
	There is uncertainty over the funding for the injectible vaccine. For the nine districts of Uttar Pradesh, about 3 to 4 million doses could be required. This would translate into a bill of $15-20 million (Rs 72-96 crore), an official said.

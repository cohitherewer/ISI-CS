	Srinagar, Dec. 24: A grey, shivered and mostly desolate day  but its Christmas Eve and Srinagar has got its much-awaited gift: the polls are finally over, people are rid of eight weeks of recurrent curfews, an unprecedented security bandobast and, most of all, of an enactment most saw as an imposition.        
	Its true Srinagar voted as it never has in the last three decades  a 20 per cent turnout which makes a four-fold improvement on the five per cent vote of 2002. But it was equally determined to carve a dark contrast to the high turnout in the Valleys rural heartland.        
	Srinagars hesitant emergence from its self-imposed electoral freeze was enacted mainly on the suburban peripheries; the core itself remained angry and averse.        
	All of the seats in downtown areas returned single-digit poll figures, the electorate staying loyal to the boycott call and staying indoors. What did you expect? asked National Conference veteran and candidate from Khanyar in the old city. This area has never voted, I think it is an improvement that we have gone beyond five per cent. And that has happened because you have parties competing hard this time, they are bringing out their loyalists, but here even they are difficult to convince.        
	The Jamia Masjid, seat of the Hurriyats Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and high platform of the boycott call, lay deserted at noon, save for stray dogs and jawans who had nobody to mind, save for a handful of boys whod made a cricket strip of the street. The radial lanes that run off the masjid square into downtown neighbourhoods stood empty, the bazaars shuttered, the homes as if nobody lived there any more.        
	Koi nahin nikla, shanti hai (Nobody has come out, all is quiet), said a CRPF jawan, relief reeking from his tone.        
	Where they did come out, as in Shia pockets of Zadibal, they approached polling booths in furtive trickles and vanished quickly back into the alleys, having had their secret tryst with the voting machine. People are voting more than they did the last time, said Basheer Ahmed, a local teacher and polling officer. But nothing compared to the voting in other areas. Srinagar is still siding with the boycott.        
	The scene at Habak, a semi-rural pocket north of Srinagar, was a far cry from downtown areas. Men and women jostled in queues, polling agents of competing parties ran about harried, the jawans were hard put to control the throng. At one point, a couple of hours into the vote, a group of boycotters gathered around the Habak chowk and began raising shrill anti-poll and anti-India slogans, calling those in the queue gaddars (traitors).        
	A melee erupted suddenly, stones were pelted, a jawan fired a couple of shots in the air and the queues melted away. The disruption wasnt to last, though. Jawans swooped on the anti-poll protesters and scattered them; within half an hour, the queues were back at the polling booth.                    
	This is our right, voting, and we are here to elect our representatives, said Mobeen Khan, a tailor. This is not about the final resolution of the Kashmir issue, this is about having our own representatives. If a government is going to be formed anyway, why should we not have a government of our own choice?        
	At Batapora, on the other end of town, the turnout was equally robust and the reasons people gave for being at the polling stations much the same. Why should I let a person or party I do not like get a walkover? After all, Kashmiri parties and Kashmiri candidates are contesting, I have to make a choice and I am here to make that, says Shamima Kachru, a retired government servant. The resolution of the Kashmir problem is on the high tables in New Delhi and Islamabad, this election is about our day-to-day problems.        
	Competition between local parties  the National Conference and the PDP, in the main  has been one of the chief reasons for upscaled turnouts across the Valley. If the National Conference has mobilised voters, its rivals have too. And they arent the only ones in the fray. The average number of candidates per seat in the Valley has been a dozen, far more than last time. Competitive mobilisation has pushed polling day numbers up.        
	Todays 20 per cent turnout in Srinagar is unprecedented in the memory of an entire new generation of voters. Even so, Srinagar has shown its angry intransigence wont be neutralised by the trend in rural areas. The city remains a naysayer. For the moment, though, it is merely happy the election and all its restrictive arrangements are a thing of the past.

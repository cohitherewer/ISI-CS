          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                            Trauma knows no politics Nazia Khatun, whose house in Nandigram was gutted by alleged Trinamul supporters because her son switched loyalties from the Congress to the CPI. (Pradip Sanyal) 				                                       
	Nandigram, May 7: The block divisional officer of Nandigram 1 has sent a report to the state election commission, criticising the role of police and saying they have failed to instil confidence among 600 people who have taken shelter near his office.        
	Shantiram Gorais report does not mention the affiliation of the 600, but these villagers are all supporters of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee. The villagers have said they were hounded out of their homes by armed CPM cadres in the run-up to the panchayat poll here on May 11.        
	In the report, Gorai has mentioned a meeting with the police on Tuesday where the officer in charge of Nandigram police station, Debashis Chakraborty, promised security to ensure the return of the displaced to their villages before the poll. But the police could not do so today.        
	I sent a report to the observer today about the prevailing situation here. People could not return to their houses today as the police failed to ensure their safety and security. Besides, reports of people getting assaulted are still trickling in, Gorai told The Telegraph.        
	In the report, the officer said: The displaced people are insisting that they will return to their homes only if normality is restored. They are living in fear and thats why CRPF personnel have been asked to stage flag marches in the trouble-prone villages of Nandigram block I.        
	The BDO and other officials this afternoon toured Gokulnagar village where they came across a makeshift wooden bridge allegedly built by CPM activists for easy access from their stronghold in Khejuri at night to terrorise BUPC supporters.        
	We dismantled the wooden bridge today as people from the Khejuri side allegedly use it to cross the canal and attack villagers. I have mentioned this in the report, Gorai said.         
	However, in his report, the BDO has not mentioned the names of any political parties.        
	S.S. Panda, the superintendent of police (East Midnapore), said arrangements were being made to ensure that the homeless could return. There are so many things to be taken care of before they can go and live in peace. I had a meeting with the BDO tonight, he said.        
	Gorai said late tonight that a battalion of the Border Security Force would be deployed in Nandigram from tomorrow.         
	It has been decided that from tomorrow, the villagers who fled their homes will be escorted back to their homes. The CRPF has been entrusted with the task of providing safety and security to the villagers at night, the BDO said.        
	Strip probe        
	A senior CID officer said tonight that a preliminary inquiry has indicated the possibility of a woman being stripped and beaten up in Nandigram.        
	But further investigation is required to establish the allegations, the officer said.        
	Eyewitnesses had said the woman ran naked half a kilometre on Monday, pursued by alleged CPM supporters.

  - Saif, Kareena, Kajol, Deepika fill up seats as lights go out          SHRADHA AGARWAL                            Saif drags Kareena to the front row at the Manish Malhotra show. (Pabitra Das)                                        
	Mumbai, March 28: If you think the front bench belongs to the Dilton Doileys, take a look at this one and go Duh.        
	Saif Ali Khan-Kareena Kapoor (inseparable), Kajol, Deepika Padukone, Padma Lakshmi, Urmila Matondkar, Sunita Menon, Ameesha Patel, Amrita Rao, Farah Khan, Gauri Khan.        
	The front row at the Manish Malhotra show on Evening One of the Lakme Fashion Week was as glamorous as it gets.        
	And to think that it was going empty  strategically, of course  till the last minute.        
	Bollywoods favourite designers Lux Temptation was scheduled for 7pm, but the guests kept pouring in till 7.45pm.        
	As the lights dimmed, the row closest to the beginning of the ramp at the NCPA remained ominously empty. The lull before the starry storm.        
	The dimming of the lights was the cue for the special guests to start pouring in.        
	First to be spotted: Padma Lakshmi, gorgeous in an aquamarine (one of Manishs favourite colours) chiffon gown.        
	Before you could say wow, Deepika Padukone made a quick dash for her seat. Dressed in skinny jeans and a graphic top, she looked every inch (5 ft-9inches to be precise) the supermodel-turned-Bollywood queen bee.        
	Then, Urmila Matondkar, Kajol and Ameesha Patel.        
	And finally, at the stroke of 8pm, the biggest draw of all: Saifeena.        
	Saif in his Tashan look, moustache and all, hurrying in with Kareena in an orange slinky number.        
	He holding her hand tight, she all smiles. Both headed straight for their corner seats.        
	Saifeena seated, the show began.        
	This redefines first-row frenzy  high Bollywood drama married to fashion flamboyance. Trust Manish to pull it off and raise the bar. After this, the talking point for the rest of the fashion week, and at other fashion weeks to come, will be the front row star profile, laughed a model walking for Manish.        
	As Manish unveiled pastels, satin and a dash of sparkle on the likes of Jesse, Candice, Nina and Carol, the beautiful people in the front row applauded, smiled and chatted. Yes, Kareena and Saif did whisper into each others ears.        
	For 10 years my friends from Bollywood who have believed in me and my brand have walked the ramp for me. It was very sweet of them all to watch my show tonight. Kareena was shooting in Film City and Kajol was shooting in Versova but they made it for my show. Tusshar Kapoor and Raima Sen are still on their way from Madh Island! Manish told The Telegraph just after the show.        
	By then, the fashionable front row had slipped out to party all night.

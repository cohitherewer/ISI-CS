          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Feb. 17: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today renewed its fast-unto-death programme and started an economic blockade across the Darjeeling hills to pressure the Bengal government into removing Subash Ghisingh as the caretaker of the DGHC.        
	Banks, which had been left out of the strikes purview, will be affected from now on. Private banks will be allowed to remain open as usual but nationalised banks will be allowed to function only on Tuesdays and Fridays, said Morcha president Bimal Gurung.         
	The post offices, which have been closed for the past seven days, would remain open on the same days as the nationalised banks.        
	No hydroelectric plant in the hills, too, will be allowed to generate power for an indefinite period.        
	Under the economic blockade programme, we will also stop the movement of timber to the plains. We will dry up the states revenue from the hills without inconveniencing local people, said Gurung.         
	The Morcha had on Wednesday called off its hunger strike after a meeting with government representatives at Writers Buildings. It was then reported that the government had agreed to take a decision on the Morcha demand by February 16.         
	On Friday, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya clarified that there was no way the government could announce Ghisinghs removal immediately. Since his term as caretaker comes to an end on March 24, the government could take a decision only after that.         
	The Morcha decision to restart its agitation followed Bhattacharyas statement.         
	The government seems to be encouraging undemocratic processes. The hunger strike will be our final battle. Doctors and paramedics have been warned not to come near those who are on fast. We are ready to bear lathi charge, but will not allow the doctors to enter the campus, said Gurung.         
	Educational institutions have not been covered by the strike, but the Darjeeling Municipality, like other government offices, will be shut down for an indefinite period.

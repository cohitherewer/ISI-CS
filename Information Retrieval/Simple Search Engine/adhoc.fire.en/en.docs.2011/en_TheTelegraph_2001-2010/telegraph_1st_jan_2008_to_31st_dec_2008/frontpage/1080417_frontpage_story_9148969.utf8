          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, April 16: The Naga talks resumed after six months today, with both the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) and the government agreeing to help each other.         
	Besides discussing the issue of a separate constitution for Nagalim, the two sides discussed ways of dealing with local developments in Nagaland since October.         
	The help from the Centre will most likely be on the issue of the new faction  National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Unification)  formed in November. The last round of talks was in October.         
	The NSCN (U) is made up of cadres, many of whom are from the Sema tribe and who defected from the NSCN (I-M). A deputy kilonser (minister) for home of the NSCN (I-M), Azeto Chophy, got together with the NSCN (K) and formed the outfit to counter the Isak-Muivah faction.         
	It created more problems for the NSCN (I-M) as members of the new outfit moved around with arms and clashed with their former comrades.         
	This was one of the topics of discussion between the outfits general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah with the head of the group of ministers, Oscar Fernandez and chief interlocutor K. Padmanabhaiah, sources said.         
	The government of India has problems, but we are also not completely free of problems, said the special emissary of the outfit, V.S. Atem. While Atem did not specify the outfits problems, sources attending the meeting said both sides tried to come to terms with the delay in the negotiations.        
	Contrary to reports yesterday that the outfit will not discuss the issue, the NSCN (U) did indirectly figure in the negotiations today.         
	A government source said the government might take strong action against the new outfit. The NSCN (U), which is not in ceasefire with the Centre, is accused of moving around with arms in civilian areas and indulging in anti-social activity. More than 85 abductions for extortion allegedly took place late last year as the state prepared to go to the hustings.

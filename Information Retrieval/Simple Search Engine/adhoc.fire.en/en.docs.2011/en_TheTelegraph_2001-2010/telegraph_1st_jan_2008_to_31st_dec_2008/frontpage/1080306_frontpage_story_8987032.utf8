          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, March 5: Parliament today witnessed the unusual spectacle of the gentle Prime Minister showing off the strength of his arms, praising Atal Bihari Vajpayee and pillorying L.K. Advani in a combative speech.        
	If Manmohan Singh called his predecessor the Bhishma Pitamah of Indian politics, the Prime Minister heaped scorn on his successor-in-waiting.         
	I am aware that some members have been wishing that this government falls. To their misfortune and to the good fortune of the nation, this has not happened. But such fond dreams do not die easily and, therefore, they continue to see visions where none exists, Singh told the Lok Sabha in his reply to the debate on the motion of thanks to the Presidents address.        
	The scent of elections in the air after the please-all budget, Singh did not shy away from naming Advani.         
	Advaniji said this government is faceless and directionless. I do not understand the context in which our government is being decorated with such colourful adjectives. Advaniji also predicted that our government will not complete its full term. He has been proved wrong.        
	The Prime Minister then recited an Urdu couplet, displaying a combative trait rarely seen before in public. I would like to say Na khanjar uthega, na talwar chalegi, ye bajoo mere aazmaye huye hain (neither a dagger will be drawn, nor the sword taken out, I know the strength of my arms).        
	Singh quickly moved on to salute Vajpayee and express the hope that the former Prime Minister would listen to his conscience and let national interest prevail upon narrow politics in the context of the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	He said the government was continuing to seek the broadest possible consensus within the country to enable the next step on the nuclear deal. Singh also lauded former national security adviser Brajesh Mishra for coming out in support of the deal.        
	The references to Vajpayee and Mishra were viewed in political circles as part of a subtle attempt to undermine Advanis position and suggest that others opinion counted more than that of the BJPs prime ministerial candidate in matters of vital national importance.        
	Singh, however, was careful enough to condemn the Vajpayee-led NDA government on other fronts. He blamed the previous government for the agrarian distress and described the farm-loan waiver as a historic initiative to meet the unpaid distress bill left behind by the NDA.        
	Seething BJP members kept interrupting the speech, and Advani eventually led the Opposition in a walkout.        
	But the Prime Minister said he was not apologising for the waiver. Neither was he apologetic about empowering weaker sections, including minorities.

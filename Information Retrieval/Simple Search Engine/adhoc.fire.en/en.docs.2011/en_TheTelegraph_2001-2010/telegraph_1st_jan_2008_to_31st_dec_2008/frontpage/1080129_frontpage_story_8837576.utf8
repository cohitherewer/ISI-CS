	New Delhi, Jan. 28: The US has offered the Bengal government special help to contain the bird flu virus but it is yet to hear from the state and the Centre nearly a week after the gesture.        
	US embassy officials in Delhi are relieved that the Book Fair in Calcutta has been called off. Ambassador David Mulford, senior diplomats and officials and a business delegation that was supposed to visit Calcutta for the Book Fair will now reschedule their visit to the city.        
	The court order on the Book Fair has come as a stroke of luck for the officials who have been reluctant to visit Bengal when the bird flu has been detected in districts in Calcuttas neighbourhood.         
	The US was the theme country for the Book Fair that was due to be inaugurated tomorrow. The ambassador, officials and publishers were expected to be in Calcutta for events surrounding the Book Fair between January 30 and February 10. Those visits are now not on because of fears  not put on record by embassy officials  that the Bengal government has been under-reporting the extent of the bird flu.        
	Recent history of US advisories against visiting China issued in 2003 when SARS was detected in the communist-ruled country has made American officials and diplomats measured in their comments and observations about the flu in Bengal.        
	Mulford said here today that the offer of help in containing the bird flu in Bengal was made last week. We are yet to hear from them, he said.         
	A US embassy spokesperson told The Telegraph: On January 23, the US offered the following assistance to the Government of Indias ministry of health and ministry of agriculture through the ministry of external affairs: a) to check the availability of Tamiflu syrup for children from worldwide stocks; b) to provide technical support for human surveillance, diagnosis and preparedness; c) to provide technical support for animal surveillance, diagnosis and culling; and d) to provide personnel protection equipment for rapid response teams in West Bengal.         
	In March-April 2004, shortly after the invasion of Iraq by US-led forces, the SARS virus was reported from Hong Kong and other parts of China. Western officials said in the weeks that followed that Beijing was playing down the extent of SARS, a viral infection that caused high fever and shortness of breath. China denied that it was covering up the extent of the infection but later sought the help of the WHO to check the disease.         
	In Bengal, the rapid spread of the disease after it was detected earlier this month has led to deep suspicion that the state governments public health administration system has been deficient.         
	The embassy spokesperson said the offer of help to check bird flu in Bengal was made because the US and India are global partners, working together on influenza surveillance. By working together, we share information and ideas and learn from each other about best practices to fight avian influenza and contain a possible pandemic.         
	It is the fear that the H5N1 (the bird flu virus) will infect humans that concerns the US government most, not least because its own citizens will feel threatened.        
	The US has large numbers of troops and officials  apart from American citizens engaged in private enterprise  across the world. Its Center for Disease Control Atlanta was tasked to monitor the origin of and report on diseases worldwide.        
	A US official said one of the desks in the embassy was now monitoring the bird flu in Bengal closely. We are wanting to stop it from becoming a pandemic, he said.         
	The official noted that it was frustrating offers of medical help  such as the one made to check bird flu in Bengal  had to go through the bureaucratic process of reaching the state government through the Centre.

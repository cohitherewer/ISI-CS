          HAREN KALITA AND P.B. CHOUDHURY                              
	Mangaldoi/Kokrajhar, Oct. 10: Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi today ordered the district administration of clash-hit Udalguri and Darrang districts to formulate an action plan to prevent any flare-ups in future.         
	Dispur has been strongly criticised by various organisations, including the womens wing of the Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF), the coalition partner in the state, for its indifferent attitude towards the indigenous people.        
	The organisations also demanded a CBI inquiry into the violence, which left 51 dead and over a hundred injured.        
	Gogois directive to formulate the action plan came at the end of a two-day tour to the clash-hit areas in the twin districts where he met inmates of relief camps.        
	The situation was returning to normal with no reports of violence in the past two days. The Udalguri administration tonight decided to relax curfew, in force in the entire district, from 8am to 4pm tomorrow.        
	The chief minister visited several relief camps in both the districts in the past two days where he assured the affected people full security in the future.The chief minister also announced ex gratia of Rs 3 lakh each to the next of the kin of the persons killed and Rs 50,000 each to the injured. He has also assured the victims that the government would rebuild all the houses damaged in mob violence.        
	Gogoi said the government would also bear the education expenses of riot-affected students.        
	While ordering a judicial inquiry into the incidents, Gogoi said guilty parties involved in the series of violence would be dealt with a strong hand.        
	The chief minister said the village defence parties would be strengthened so that such violence could be checked in the future and that genuine citizens had nothing to fear.        
	At a meeting held at the Darrang district circuit house yesterday, the chief minister directed the district administration and police officers to take all necessary steps to instil confidence and sense of security among the villagers. Top police and district administration officials attended the meeting.        
	Mustafa Hussain, an inmate at the relief camp at Besimari in Darrang district, told the chief minister that they wanted to return to their villages but were not feeling secure enough. We have to return soon to till our fields or we will have nothing to eat, Hussain said.         
	The Besimari relief camp has the highest concentration of minority population  over 18,000.        
	In Kokrajhar, the BPF womens wing today accused the Congress spokesperson and health minister Himanta Biswa Sharma of trying to isolate Bodo groups from the Assamese community.        
	How can the minister term the violence as one between Bodos and non-Bodos? Cant he see the people atthe relief camps where the Bodos, Assamese, Bengalis, Nepalis, Adivasis, Rabhas and Garos are taking shelter together on one side and the one community on the other? the president of BPF womens wing, Malati Rani Narzary, asked.

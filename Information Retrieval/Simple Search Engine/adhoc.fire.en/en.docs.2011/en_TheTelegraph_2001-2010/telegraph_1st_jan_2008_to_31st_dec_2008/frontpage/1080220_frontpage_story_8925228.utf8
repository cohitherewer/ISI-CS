	New Delhi, Feb. 19: Writer Sunil Gangopadhyay will lock horns tomorrow with Keralas M.T. Vasudevan Nair in a politics-peppered friendly battle of authors for the countrys most prestigious literary post.        
	The long-time friends face off for the presidents chair at the Sahitya Akademi, the body that coordinates literary activities in the country, after a consensus eluded the 89-member general council.        
	Gangopadhyay is said to be close to outgoing president Gopi Chand Narang, who defeated Mahasweta Devi five years ago.        
	Narang, who was backed by the then ruling BJP-led NDA, was keen on a second term. But he had to make way after writers from 12 languages wrote to the culture ministry, saying the tradition of the president changing every five years should continue.        
	Nairs supporters say that after Narang was forced to bow out, his camp chose Gangopadhyay for president of the Akademi, which has an annual budget of Rs 8 crore.        
	But sources said the general council could not reach a consensus on Gangopadhyay as president and Nair as vice-president.        
	Gangopadhyay today told The Telegraph he and Nair were long-time friends and would remain so.        
	Its a friendly fight, the 73-year-old added.        
	Nair, 74, one of the most popular authors in Kerala, said he would comment after the election, but poet K. Satchidanandan, who anchored his campaign, said there would be a strong fight.        
	Sanskrit scholar and writer Satyavrat Shastri is the third candidate in the fray for the presidents post, which is all about prestige. The perks include a house and travel expenses. According to a government resolution, the Akademi, inaugurated in March 1954, is responsible for coordinating literary activities in all Indian languages and promoting the countrys cultural unity.        
	There are many oral languages that dont have a script, Gangopadhyay said. We need to promote them.

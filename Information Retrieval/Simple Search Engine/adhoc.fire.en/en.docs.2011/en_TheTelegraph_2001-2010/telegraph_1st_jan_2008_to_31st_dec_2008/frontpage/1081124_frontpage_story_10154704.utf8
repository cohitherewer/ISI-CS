          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Nov. 23: Para-teachers remained divided today, as one of the two striking groups chose to call off its 23-day cease work, while another stuck to its stand.        
	Senior office-bearers of Jharkhand Pradesh Para Shikshak Sangh confirmed that they have called off their 23-day strike after successful talks with chief minister Shibu Soren and human resource development minister Bandhu Tirkey at the chief ministers Kanke residence.         
	He (Shibu Soren) promised to form a committee for the rectification of Samudayik Shikshak Seva Sart Niymawali, 2008, (community teacher service condition rules). He has pledged to include three para-teachers in the panel that would reconsider the rules.         
	The CM has also agreed to clear all payments due, and has assured (us) there will be no retrenchment, said Binod Bihari Mahto, the general secretary of the Jharkhand sangh that called off their strike.         
	On the other hand, members of Jharkhand Rajya Sahyogi Shikshya Mitra Para Sikshak Sangh have decided to continue. Its president Binod Tiwary, said: Some of us might take the path of self-immolation in front of Bandhu Tirkeys house on December 1, if our ministry does not raise the retirement age (of para-teachers) to 60 years.         
	We will continue with the fight as our group has the support of most teachers and is a registered one, said Tiwary.        
	Todays disagreement has taken a political colour with the opposing group alleging that Binod Bihari Mahto opted out because he was a former JMM activist who sided with the government.        
	Most of the 80,000 teachers who were protesting in the strike belong to the 2002-03 batch recruited under the Centre-sponsored Sarva Siksha Aviyan to universalise primary education.         
	The teachers were protesting rules governing Samudayik Sikshak Seva Sart Niyamavali, 2008, that state only 38,000 posts would be created to serve in primary schools in rural hinterlands at a monthly remuneration of Rs 5,100, provided they clear a test.         
	Currently there are 80,000 para-teachers working in government-run schools across the state.         
	Moreover, they were also demanding regularisation of services, like in Orissa, where services of temporary teachers working under District Primary Education Programme were regularised.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Vincent and Marie Claire Talleu at a news conference in Mumbai on Friday. (AFP)                                  
	Mumbai, May 9: The family of a French cyclist who disappeared in Mumbai during a world cycling tour has announced a reward of Rs 2 lakh for information about him.         
	A graphic designer, 26-year-old Jean Baptiste Talleus presence in Mumbai was confirmed by an ATM transaction in Goregaon in the western suburbs in December 2007.         
	He then vanished without a trace. The police failed to find his bicycle or other belongings.         
	The cyclists mother, Marie Claire Talleu, and younger brother Vincent are in Mumbai. They announced the cash reward to renew attempts to find him.         
	Speaking to reporters, Marie Claire said Jean began his world cycling tour in July 2007 and travelled through Italy, Croatia, Albania, Greece, Turkey and Iran before arriving in India from Dubai.         
	He disappeared after an ATM transaction of Rs 10,000 on December 5.         
	Marie Claire said her son had no history of alcohol, drugs or smoking.         
	He had last communicated with the family, based in Nancy in eastern France, on December 2 on the Internet from Dubai, she added.         
	She said she asked Jean if he wanted to return home for Christmas, but the cyclist, excited after his journey through Iran, replied he was having lots of fun and would not like to break his tour.         
	Jean was to travel to China, where his sister is based, before going to the US.         
	His brother Vincent said: I have accompanied him on short cycling expeditions, but this one was going to be a long one, at least a couple of years.         
	He said Jean carried a portable tent, cooking appliances and other camping equipment.         
	The French consulate in India and the Alliance Francaise de Bombay are helping the family in their search.

  - Cut sends water rushing in, India inaction blamed           NALIN VERMA                         The breach on the Kusaha highway. Picture by Deepak Kumar				                                       
	Kusaha (Nepal), Sept. 1: Twelve days after the Kosi breached its embankment here on August 18, Nepal police cut a 15-metre chasm across a highway to send the floodwaters surging southwards into Bihar.        
	People and police here blame the dyke breach on inaction by India, which owns the Kosi barrage and embankment, and say they were forced to dig up the Kusaha-Laukahi-Inaruwa-Biratnagar highway to save themselves.        
	We had no way out. We cut the highway to save our villages in the northern Terai region, said Vishnu Kharka, a sub-inspector who is guarding the spot with 20 other policemen so that nobody can plug the hole, which the fuming waters have widened to 20 metres.        
	The result is that only three panchayats in Nepal are flooded now while the situation has worsened dramatically in 14 Bihar districts, where 100 have died and at least two million are marooned or homeless. Unofficial figures say thousands are dead and 5 million have been affected. The worst hit are Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa, Araria and Katihar districts.        
	Indian engineers and officials posted at Kusaha to monitor the embankment were driven away by angry residents within hours of the August 18 breach.                
	We saw the river banging on the embankment from August 5-6. But these lazy and luxury-loving Indian officials did not even inspect the rivers pressure, said S.N. Mandal of nearby Laukahi as he turned his gaze towards the vast expanse of water to the north and south of the highway.        
	These officials suddenly vanished the day the embankment was breached, flooding large parts of Nepal and Bihar. You see, there is no Indian official around the breached embankment.        
	We chased them out, admitted a Kusaha resident, Dilip Gupta. They were just partying with liquor and women in the dhabas and their guesthouse. We never saw them patrol the embankment. They had no business staying here when they were not doing their job. The embankment would not have given way had they monitored it.        
	Nepal foreign minister Upendra Yadav, however, said on Saturday during his Delhi visit that immediately after the embankment breach, the Indians had tried to repair it but were prevented by local people.        
	Officials in Patna and Delhi have claimed that an Indian team is trying to plug the breach with an assurance of security from Nepal Prime Minister Prachanda. But this correspondent did not see a single Indian official or worker in the area. The guesthouse too has vanished under water.        
	We cant go there now. We can begin work to repair the breaches only under protection from the Indian Army. The Nepalese are after our lives, a water resources official in Araria said. Jaan mujhe pyari hai (I love my life).        
	The Araria-Forbesganj-Jogbani highway in Bihar went under water yesterday, cutting the states road link with Kusaha.        
	The Nepal foreign minister has suggested that the terms of the 1954 Kosi agreement be amended to give Kathmandu the right to carry out essential repairs on the barrage and embankment.        
	We cannot even put a stone into the Kosis waters. We detected the crack in the embankment but the Indian technical team had an argument with the local people and could not do the work, Yadav said on Saturday.        
	He added that this is not the time to enter into a blame game but alleged that India had not repaired the barrage or the embankment in the last five years.        
	People from the three flooded Nepal panchayats -- Shripur, Haripur and Kushwa  have taken shelter on the truncated highway, swimming all the way from their villages.         
	The only sounds here are the roar of the river and the chants of women praying to the water god in the rain. Yadav has suggested that under the Kosi agreement, India is bound to compensate the flood-hit Nepalese.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has released Rs 1,000 crore and 1.2 million tonnes of foodgrain in aid for Bihars flood victims. Local people are helping with relief operations.        
	With inputs from Jayanth Jacob in New Delhi

          STEPHEN ADAMS                      lsquo;DISASTROUS rsquo; CUTS                                
	London, July 16: Prof. Stephen Hawking is mulling over an invitation to quit Britain because government policy is making the country the home of dull science, colleagues have said.        
	Last month, the 66-year-old scientist accused the government of making disastrous 80 million cuts to research funding. Now he is said to be seriously considering an offer to join a fellow academic, who is leaving Cambridge University this autumn to head up a well-funded Canadian science institute.        
	Prof. Neil Turok, a leading authority on mathematical physics, said the door is open for Prof. Hawking to join him permanently at the Perimeter Institute in Ontario, which has received 300 million in funding.        
	The physicist decided to leave Cambridge after failing to persuade university authorities, research councils and sponsors to give 20 million to expand the universitys Centre for Theoretical Cosmology  which he currently heads  into a Hawking Institute.        
	By comparison, the Perimeter Institute, set up seven years ago by Mike Lazaridis, creator of the BlackBerry hand-held device, has garnered private donations of 150 million.

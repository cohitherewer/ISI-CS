The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tata to Bengal, with anguish
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tata to Bengal, with anguish
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 22: Unwanted, unwanted, unwanted.        
	If a deep sense of hurt hung heavy over Ratan Tatas statement today, the catchword was unwanted.         
	That is the feeling investment-anaemic, job-starved Bengal is threatening to trigger in one of the most respected  and trusted  business leaders of the country.         
	Unwanted  Tata uttered the word thrice. The fourth time, he chose not wanted.         
	The last thing I want is a feeling that Tatas are unwanted, for whatever reasons, in Bengal, Tata said at one point.         
	Tata referred to Mamata Banerjee only once  Ms Banerjee  but Bengal was on his lips as many as 32 times. I have, unknown to most of you, lived in Jamshedpur for six years. I know West Bengal well; I have spent a lot of time in West Bengal. I have always had a very soft corner for West Bengal.        
	Polite words, perhaps, expected of any well-mannered guest. But those who have been tracking Tata over the years know that the deeply private industrialist rarely makes personal references.        
	Another occasion he allowed himself the concession of making a wisecrack in public also had a Bengal link. When the Nano was unveiled in January, Tata had said in jest that among the names considered for the Rs 1-lakh car were Buddho, Mamata and Despite Mamata.         
	Today, the deadpan delivery  the usually genial Tata smiled only once  was far more devastating than the humour that brought the house down then.         
	If there was a joke today, it was on Bengal. Minutes into Tatas Singur shocker, the Tata Motors stock price was climbing the charts on the Bombay Stock Exchange, making some wonder whether the market was celebrating the Nanos chance to liberate itself from Bengal.        
	Analysts later cited a prosaic reason: the price rose probably because of a tweak in plans to raise funds for the Jaguar Land Rover buyout.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Chopper fails police in fight against Naxalites
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Chopper fails police in fight against Naxalites
          AMIT GUPTA                             Dhruv: Will it ever help in rescue operations?                                  
	Ranchi, May 12: CRPF jawan Prashant Patil and Charhi police station officer-in-charge Vijay Thakur may not have bled to the death while fighting Naxalites yesterday if the state governments chopper reached the hills of Hazaribagh on time to evacuate them.         
	The states Dhruv helicopter, meant to be used in relief and rescue missions and anti-Naxalite surveillance operations, couldnt even take-off from here as it had developed a malfunction.        
	Deputy inspector-general (Hazaribagh) Ajay Kumar Singh said that they had indeed made several requisitions for a helicopter to expedite rescue operations soon after yesterdays encounter.         
	But we were informed the helicopter had developed some mechanical snag and it couldnt be sent. I cannot comment whether the lives of both the policemen could have been saved or not. But it is for sure that it would have helped a lot, he said.         
	But eyewitness and CRPF constable Ramanand Kumar Singh believed a chopper would have definitely saved them. Carrying a wounded colleague behind his back, Singh was lucky to have missed the bullets that zipped passed his shoulder not once but many times.        
	Fellow constable Patil of the CRPFs 190 battalion and Thakur werent that lucky. Both started bleeding profusely near me one of the bullets fired by the Maoists hit Patil on the head and his cap fell off, said Singh, now at the ICU of Abdur Razzaque Memorial Apollo Hospital being treated for brachial plexes injury. They were writhing in pain without much help for the next three to four hours. If police reinforcements in form of a helicopter reached the spot, the lives of Patil and the police officer could have been saved, added Singh, who has been with the CRPF since 1995.         
	This wasnt the first time that the Dhruv helicopter has failed the police who need it most. According to sources in the state aviation department, it was at the hangar throughout the day as roter blades which werent functioning were under repair.        
	The sources added the copter had flown for over 160 hours in last the two months and on most occasions chief minister Madhu Koda, his ministerial colleagues and senior police officers were on board.         
	Home secretary Sudhir Tripathy conceded that since Dhruv had developed a snag they could have used the services of an Air Force helicopter.         
	However, he doubted whether the two could have been saved as Patil had a fatal head injury and Thakur was shot in the chest.         
	Ironically, Tripathy said they would be using the Dhruv chopper tomorrow at 8.30am for a review meeting of the pilot project for intensive security and development action for rebel-ravaged Chatra and Palamau districts.         
	I will be accompanying senior police officers to Chatra and Palamau, he said.         
	Members of the Jharkhand Police Association, who visited Hazaribagh today, blamed senior police officers for failing to arrange a helicopter for an operation that involved the police of three districts: Chatra, Hazaribagh and Ramgarh.        
	This is abject failure on the part of the state government. Why is Dhruv being used for everything else other than anti-Naxalite surveillance and rescue operations? The helicopter belongs to us but it is managed either by the home department or the chief minister;s secretariat, said Ashok Pathak, vice-president of the association.         
	We demand an immediate stop to this practice whereby ministers and senior officers are using the helicopter for minor things, he added.        
	Referring to Singh, he said it was shameful on part of the state that he could be brought to Ranchi after six hours of the encounter.        
	Dhruv, the twin-engine chopper, is manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Limiteds Bangalore unit. It touched down at the state hangar in 2007.        
	The spacious flying machine has capacity for nine passengers, apart from the pilot and co-pilot.

	New Delhi, Dec. 29: Incredible Indias sagging appeal has found its viagra  in a female Womanizer.        
	Pop diva Britney Spears plans to celebrate New Years Eve in India, sending tourism officials into paroxysms of delight at a time many foreigners have cancelled trips to the terror-hit country.

	She will also shoot a new video for her latest hit album, Womanizer.        
	A tourism ministry official couldnt hide his excitement. It would be a golden opportunity to re-energise the Incredible India campaign, the official said, alluding to the endless cancellations in the wake of the November 26 terror strike that killed several western tourists.         
	The very fact that Britney is travelling to India and that, too, to Mumbai at this point of time itself is a big boost to Indian tourism. It will convey the message across the world that India is as safe as ever, the official added.        
	If ministry officials are tingling in anticipation, Britney has added to the titillation. She has been quoted by the western media as saying that she would do everything possible to boost Indian tourism and her album would include everything that is great about the country.        
	I really would like to tell the people of the world that India and its people are indeed very beautiful, so they must not stop coming here. What happened in India can happen in any part of the world, it was just unfortunate. I am here and so can you be, she has been quoted as saying.        
	Britneys trip is making headlines in the British media. Britneys mission to help tragic India, ran a story in tabloid Daily Star.        
	It said the big-hearted pop princess plans a mercy mission to help terror hit India.        
	I love India, the paper quoted the pop star. Its culture is so rich and colourful. Id like to thank my Indian fans for loving my music. I will do everything I can to help.        
	The tourism official said the ministry would help Britney do her shoots. The media will follow her entire Indian trip which means free publicity for Incredible India, he said.        
	In India, Britney will be guided by choreographer Sandip Soparrkar, whom she met through close friend Madonna. He will also do the choreography for her album Womanizer.        
	The tourism official said the ministry also had plans to cast her in one of its ad campaigns.        
	Case of Gimme More, is it?

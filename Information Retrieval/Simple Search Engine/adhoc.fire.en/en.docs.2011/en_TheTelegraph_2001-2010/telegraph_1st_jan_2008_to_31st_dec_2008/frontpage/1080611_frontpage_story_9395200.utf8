          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, June 10: The renovation of a 700-year-old Ganesh temple has become the cause of a rift between Kashmiri Pandits who migrated from the Valley and those who stayed back.         
	The temple in the old city of Srinagar has suffered damage because of inclement weather. Militants vandalised the temple in 1992.         
	The Kashmir Pandit Sangharsh Samiti, which represents over 4,000 people who stayed back, wants to renovate the shrine. Sanjay Tickoo, its president, said: We want to restore it to its pristine glory.        
	The Samiti, he said, had approached the former office-bearers  all are in Jammu  to discuss the renovation plans. We had approached them to start the renovation but they refused to do so, saying the situation is not conducive in Kashmir, he said.        
	The Samiti also alleged that the erstwhile Ganesh Mandir Prabandhak Committee had Rs 21 lakh of temple funds, which it was reluctant to give.

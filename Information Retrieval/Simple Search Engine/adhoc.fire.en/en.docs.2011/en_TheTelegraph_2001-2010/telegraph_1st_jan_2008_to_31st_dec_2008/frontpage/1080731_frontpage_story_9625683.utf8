          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, July 30: Three years after he dodged police bullets and disappeared behind the trees, Gopal Boro, the most dreaded rhino poacher in Orang National Park, was arrested from a rented house in Morigaon yesterday.        
	The divisional forest officer of Mangaldoi, S. Momin, today said Boro, 35, was picked up during a joint operation with the army, led by Lt Col Kapil Bakshi.        
	An unlicensed factory-made .303 rifle fitted with sound filter and 17 rounds of live ammunition were found on him.        
	In 2005, Boro had managed to find his way out of the park following a fierce encounter, while one of his accomplices, Rameshwar Basumatary, succumbed to bullet injuries.        
	Chandan Basumatary, who was part of the three-member poachers gang, was arrested.        
	The park authorities have been looking for Boro since.        
	 We had some information and then took the armys help, Momin said.         
	The 78.81 square km national park has 68 rhinos, according to 2007 census.        
	There were 46 in 1999.         
	Four rhinos have been poached in Orang this year and Dispur has also deployed home guards to assist the park authorities in day-to-day management.         
	Boro had been a menace and his arrest will bring us some relief, Momin said.         
	Of late, the park authorities have tasted some success in aborting poaching attempts.        
	On June 24, the national park staff arrested three poachers, Baburam Longfar, Tuluram Boro and Hakuram Boro.         
	We have managed to retain the horn on three occasions, though the rhinos were killed, Momin said. With unprecedented security at Kaziranga National Park, Orang became a soft target for poachers. Six rhinos had fallen prey to poachers bullets at Kaziranga till April this year, forcing the government to step up vigil.         
	Orang has also been identified as a wildlife zone where rhinos will be translocated under the India Rhino Vision 2020 next year.         
	The programme envisages that Orang will be able to achieve its target population of 100 rhinos through improved protection.

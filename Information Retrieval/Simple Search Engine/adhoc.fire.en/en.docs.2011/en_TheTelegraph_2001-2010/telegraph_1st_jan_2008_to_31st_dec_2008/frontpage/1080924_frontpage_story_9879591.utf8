          INDRANIL GHOSH                            Nirupam Sen                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 23: From deadlock to despondency.        
	The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government today signalled that it was running out of hope on the Singur project, though some incurable optimists are awaiting the outcome of a meeting between Mamata Banerjee and the governor tomorrow.        
	The prospect for the project is getting bleaker by the day, industries minister Nirupam Sen said in Delhi. We (the government) have no other option, we can only watch.        
	The Tatas will have to take the final call, NDTV quoted the minister as saying.        
	Referring to last nights attack on guards in Singur, Sen told the channel: It is very unfortunate that they have started this all over again. We have already announced a good compensation package. Majority of the people in Singur want this project. Majority of the people in the state also want this project. But the Opposition is making very unreasonable demands.        
	At Writers Buildings, the mood was equally grim. It looks like curtains have begun to come down on the Nano project, said a senior bureaucrat.        
	Referring to the attack on the guards, the official said the Tatas have conveyed their sentiments in strong terms. Executives of Tata Motors were in touch with top officials of the state industries department during the day, sources said.        
	If a solution does not emanate from tomorrows meeting between the governor and Mamata Banerjee, I dont think we in the government can do anything at all to retain the project in Bengal, the official added.        
	But Trinamul Congress functionaries said Mamata was unlikely to soften her stand tomorrow, lending credence to an assessment in the CPM that she was keen to let the issue fester at least until the Lok Sabha elections.        
	Some of you may think that the opposition to the Tata project will cost us in terms of votes, an aide quoted Mamata as saying. But I am not bothered.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sourav: Batting remains the key for us
                                                                                                           Sourav: Batting remains the key for us
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Sourav Ganguly                                  
	Sydney: Sourav Gangulys omission from the Team India line-up for the ongoing tri-series came as a shock. Much has happened since then and, on Saturday morning, the former India captain (one of the legends of limited-overs cricket) spoke to The Telegraph about the best-of-three finals.              
	The following are excerpts        
	Whether hes still disappointed at having been dropped        
	Ive got over that... More than a month has gone... Today, Im neither disappointed nor... That phase is over.        
	On the finals versus Australia        
	I expect it to be competitive, provided we bat well... Our bowlers have done well, but batting remains the key for us.        
	Australia as an opposition        
	Theyre the world champions... Moreover, they seem to play even better at home.        
	Whether much of the work will actually have to be done by the openers  Sachin Tendulkar and Robin Uthappa, in all probability        
	Not just the openers... The top six have to contribute big... One or two batters alone cant be expected to make the difference.        
	If hed field five specialist bowlers        
	As Im not the captain, it may not be proper to offer a comment... Different captains think differently... Im sure (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni will assess very carefully before making that call. Whatever the combination, we need to stay focused.        
	The one Indian who could make a difference        
	I wouldnt like to name one player...        
	The one Australian who could make a difference        
	Brett Lee, perhaps... Could also be Mitchell Johnson, who has done well against us.        
	On his most memorable India versus Australia ODI        
	The one we won in Nairobi (ICC KnockOut, 2000)... That win took us to the semis and, eventually, we reached the final...The Australians were the world champions then too        
	The most disappointing India-Australia ODI        
	(A tad emotionally) The 2003 World Cup final...         
	Finally, his message for Dhoni and Co.        
	No message, just good wishes... Obviously, Ill be watching the finals.

  - Rs 2 per kg on offer from Aug 1 in 21 districts          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Naveen Patnaik (right) at the meeting. Pix: Sanjib Mukherjee                                        
	Bhubaneswar, July 14: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik at the district collectors conference today warned district administrations of exemplary action if a single person was overlooked by the BJD governments populist rice scheme.        
	No person should go without his entitlement under any circumstances, were the stern words spoken by Naveen at the collectors conference.        
	Taking a cue from the spectacular success of the scheme when it was lauched by the NTR government in Andhra Pradesh in the early eighties, the chief minister introducing a similar scheme a week ago. The state government would be providing 25 kg of rice every month to all BPL families and APL families residing in backward KBK region at a subsidised price of Rs 2 per kg.         
	Official sources said the chief minister was laying stress on the successful implementation, hoping to influence an estimated 55.5-lakh families across Orissa expected to benefit from this scheme.         
	However, the apprehension that failure of the official machinery in providing benefits to all families may prove to be counter-productive, prompted the chief minister to convene the conference.         
	The schemes success greatly depends upon its effective implementation, Naveen repeated, warning exemplary action against any dealer or official who fails to implement the scheme.         
	At the conference it was decided that the scheme would be launched in 21 districts from August 1 and in the rest of the nine districts from the following day.         
	Subsidised rice will be distributed on two particular dates  the fifth and 20th of every month. Steps will be taken to ensure that the subsidised rice reaches inaccessible pockets and the government will bear additional cost of transportation, said a senior official of the food supplies and consumer welfare department.         
	Stressing on the need for utmost transparency in the entire transaction, Naveen said: There should be no pilferage or diversion of the rice and there should be no malpractice when the rice is being weighed.                                
	Naveen sought watchdog bodies for every dealer and storage agent to prevent diversion or pilferage. Stating instances of agents keeping BPL cards with them, the chief minister condemned such practice and said it should be stopped with immediate effect.         
	The state and district machinery should be mobilised for this important programme so that there is no room for any complaint, he instructed collectors.         
	Emphasising on the need for a robust grievance redressal mechanism at the district, sub-division and block and tehsil levels, Patnaik said there should be a system to record complaints and ensure prompt action.         
	The chief minister asked the collectors to keep a close watch on the new agriculture policy, announced by him recently.         
	Implementation of schemes such as National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme, Biju Gram Jyoti Yojana, construction of irrigation tanks at every village, piped water scheme, health measures during the monsoons and providing bicycles to SC and ST girl students was also reviewed at the conference.

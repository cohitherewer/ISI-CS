          DAVID HARRISON                             Cornered                                  
	London, June 7: Animal parks in China are turning tiger bones into an alcoholic health tonic, defying international laws aimed at protecting one of the worlds most endangered species, The Daily Telegraph can reveal.         
	Staff at two safari parks a few hours from the capital Beijing offered to sell undercover investigators wine made from the crushed bones of tigers that died in captivity at the sanctuaries.        
	The wine, which it is claimed, helps to cure conditions including arthritis and rheumatism, is advertised openly and sold at the parks.        
	The revelations that the parks are breaking the law are embarrassing for the Chinese government which is trying to promote a positive image of the country in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics in August.        
	International trade in tiger body parts and derivatives is banned under UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Domestic trade is prohibited under national law and reinforced by a special State Council order in 1993. Conservationists said lifting the ban would increase demand and lead to a surge in poaching that could push the highly endangered tiger into extinction.        
	Poaching has reduced the number of tigers in the wild to around 5,000 to 7,000, compared to 100,000 in the early 1900s. Investigators from the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency found tiger bone wine advertised for sale at the Qinhuangdao wildlife rescue centre, near the beach resort of Beidaihe in Hebei Province, four hours drive from Beijing where the Olympic Games will be held in August.        
	The price was $240.00 for 500ml, with a minimum order of 1500 ml. Staff at the centre showed investigators what they claimed was a permit from the state forestry administration allowing them to sell the wine on the premises but the researchers were unable to confirm its authenticity. The wine was on sale at the neighbouring Qinhuangdao wild animal park. Prices were $186.00 for 500ml bottles and $83.00 for 250ml.        
	At the park, which is open to the public and includes a circus of performing tigers, lions bears and primates, investigators found posters and packaging for Beidacang Tiger Wine, stating clearly that it contained tiger bone.

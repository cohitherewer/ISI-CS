                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Pitt hints at additions to Brangelina brood
  - STAR BRINGS GLAMOUR TO VENICE          ANITA SINGH                            Pitt with his children Maddox (left) and Pax in Venice. (AP)                                        
	Brad Pitt has hinted there could be more additions to the Brangelina brood during an appearance at the Venice Film Festival.         
	The actor, 44, recently became the father of twins by partner Angelina Jolie, adding to the four children they already have. But, asked if the couple would be stopping at six, Pitt, said: Ill have two more by next year.        
	His co-stars, including George Clooney and Tilda Swinton, were left unsure as to whether or not he was being serious.        
	Pitt looked as if his hectic parenting schedule and early morning feeds were taking their toll as he arrived for the first day of the festival, where his new film Burn After Reading is kicking off proceedings.        
	Clooney was asked if spending time with the Pitt-Jolie clan had convinced him it was time to settle down and become a father.        
	Hollywoods most eligible bachelor joked that the question was well-timed because he would be getting married and having children today, while Pitt added: Until then, I will be sharing mine with him.        
	Pitt and Clooney provided some welcome glamour to the festival, which this year is short on Hollywood films and A-list stars.        
	Burn After Reading is the latest offering from brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, the writers and directors of last years multiple Oscar winner, No Country For Old Men.        
	The black comedy features Pitt and actress Frances McDormand as a pair of gym employees who stumble across a computer disc containing the memoirs of a CIA agent (John Malkovich).         
	Clooney plays a federal marshall who becomes embroiled in the plot.        
	Both Clooney and Pitt are figures of fun in the film. McDormand quipped: Whats interesting about this movie is that it is all about middle-aged losers. George Clooney and Brad Pitt as losers  thats novel.        
	The costume designers were tasked with making the pair look like dorks, but that proved something of a challenge. Costumier Mary Zophres explained: Im the luckiest costume designer in Hollywood, for sure. But getting George and Brad to look like ordinary guys? Even cheap suits look better on Brad.

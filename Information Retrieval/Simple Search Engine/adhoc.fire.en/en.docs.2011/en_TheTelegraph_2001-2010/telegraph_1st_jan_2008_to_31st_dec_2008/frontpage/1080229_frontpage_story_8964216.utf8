										      FLASHBACK                                  (From top) Inside Murassa Manzil; the front portion of Shah Manzil, known as Sultan Khana; Shah Manzil. Photographs belong to Meerza Kaukub, great grandson of Wajid Ali Shah. Pictures by Pabitra Das                    
	Most people are fond of building castles in the air. Only kings and princes once enjoyed the privilege of actually building castles and palaces constructed on solid ground.         
	Wajid Ali Shah, the deposed ruler of Awadh, was one of those rare personages who could, metaphorically speaking, conjure up palaces and pleasances out of thin air  or so it seems. When he arrived in Calcutta for an aborted journey to London, he was hardly received with open arms by the British. He was incarcerated in Fort William for some time, and even after his release the allowance that he received was by no means princely.        
	Yet what has baffled many is that he continued to live in an extravagant fashion and actually managed to build a beautiful township in the Metiabruz area that has often been described as a Second Lucknow.        
	One of the most popular and widely-known accounts of Wajid Ali Shahs last days in the Garden Reach area, where the Europeans had already constructed bungalows for themselves, is that of Abdul Halim Sharar in his book Lucknow: The Last Phase of an Oriental Culture.        
	That these are not just tall tales has been proved by photographs still in existence of the imperial splendour of Metiabruz. These fast-fading photographs are in all probability albumen prints and they clearly show the mansions built in a curious mix of the prevailing European and Lucknow styles of architecture.        
	But surprises never cease. There is another portfolio of photographs of the township created by Wajid Ali Shah in the possession of Meerza Kaukub, 77, his great grandson. He was born and raised in an area close to Park Street where Anglo-Indians and upper-class Muslim families, including the Suhrawardys, once lived.        
	Meerza Kaukubs doctoral thesis in 1970 was on the literary and cultural contributions of Wajid Ali Shah. He has also done a comparative study of Md Quli Qutb Shah, founder of Hyderabad and an Urdu poet, and Wajid Ali Shah, who belonged to the same dynasty, and were originally from Western Iran. Manuscripts of Wajids poetry both religious and secular are in museums abroad, says Meerza.         
	The Nawab translated Persian religious verse into Urdu poetry running into several volumes, some describing the lives of prophets beginning with Adam and ending with Mohammad. He died while writing Sabatul-Quloob about the birth of the Prophet. The Nawab also experimented and innovated with Urdu calligraphy.        
	Kaukub Meerza has compiled the most important dates in the life of the Nawab. He was born on July 19, 1822, became a crown prince on May 21, 1842, and was crowned king of Awadh on February 13, 1847. He was dethroned on February 4, 1856. He left Lucknow on the way to London on March 13, 1856.        
	He reached Calcutta by palanquin and on foot via Allahabad and Varanasi, which were part of Awadh up to 1801. From Varanasi he travelled by the steamer named McLeod and reached Calcutta. It is not recorded where he landed, but presumably at Bichalighat on May 13, 1856. He fell ill and could not travel to London.        
	He was kept under nazarbandi at Fort William. Throughout his journey he was given a gun salute at every military cantonment, but he was deprived of that honour in Calcutta, as he had travelled there to register his protest. But when the Nawab brought this to the notice of the British, canons were fired in his honour. He was released from Fort William on July 9, 1859.         
	Before he reached Calcutta, his retinue of 500 persons had arrived by the land route and rented a house belonging to the Maharaja of Burdwan close to Bichalighat for Rs 500 a month. Initially, the Nawab lived in that house. Later, he rented other houses in the vicinity for his retinue.         
	He made extensions of this along the riverbank up to Babubazar in Hastings. The Kidderpore docks did not exist in those days and there was direct access to Metiabruz. Part of the Awadh family burial ground has been leased out to Hindustan Lever. The Nawab lived here for 32 years.        
	The photographs in Kaukub Meerzas possession were taken by F. Kapp amp; Company, Calcutta; it is clearly stated in these mounted sepia prints.         
	Kaukub Meerza says Iron Gate Road in Metiabruz borrowed its name from the palace and the wrought iron railings and portico with a deep verandah, all of which belonged to the Maharaja of Burdwan. The photographs also show Shahi Manzil with canals from the Hooghly around it and Murassa Manzil as well. The snake pits and the open-air zoo are also visible.         
	I have played in the compound of Sultan Khana in Metiabruz. It existed up to World War II but it was already in ruins. The silent film Toorki Hoor was shot there in the 1930s and perhaps a copy of it exists in the Pune film archives. The Shahi Mosque, which still exists, was in that compound, says Kaukub Meerza.        
	All the properties were auctioned and purchased by Meerza Jahan Qudr, son-in-law and nephew of the Nawab, says Kaukub Meerza.         
	Later, the Burdwan building became Ispahani jute mill. The pond where the Nawabs body was washed is still there. It changed hands and became Calcutta Jute Mill and now it is a warehouse.         
	The property was sold part by part by the Nawabs descendants for litigation and to maintain a luxurious lifestyle. Now only the places of worship such as Sibtainabad Imambara, Baitul Najat (Chhota Imambara) and the ladies imambara, Quasrul Baiza, have survived.

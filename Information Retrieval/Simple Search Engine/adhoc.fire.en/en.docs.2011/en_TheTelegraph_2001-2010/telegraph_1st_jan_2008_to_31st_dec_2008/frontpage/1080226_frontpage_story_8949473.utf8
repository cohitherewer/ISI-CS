The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | And the Oscars go to... outsiders

	Los Angeles, Feb. 25: Hollywood took on a new role at the Oscars: bit player.         
	Almost all of the top Oscars were handed to foreigners and iconoclastic show business outsiders.        
	Every one of the evenings winning actors came from beyond American borders, and the ceremonys dominant film  best picture winner No Country for Old Men  was created by a pair of filmmaking brothers from Minnesota who have never made a mainstream movie in their three-decade career.        
	In an era when overseas revenue accounts for more than half of a movies income, the percentages were tilted far more heavily towards foreigners throughout the awards show, with an especially strong showing from Europe.        
	Best actor Daniel Day-Lewis (There Will Be Blood) lives in Ireland, while La Vie en Rose surprise best actress Marion Cotillard makes her home in Paris. Spains Javier Bardem was named best supporting actor for No Country and Scotlands Tilda Swinton won best supporting actress for Michael Clayton.        
	Many of the evenings lower-profile awards  for art direction, makeup, costume design (Alexandra Byrne for Shekhar Kapurs Elizabeth: The Golden Age) and animated short among them  went to non-American filmmakers and designers.        
	Hollywood is built on Europeans! Go back and look, Swinton said backstage. Im really sad I couldnt give a speech in Gaelic.        
	After he won his supporting actor Oscar, Canary Islands-born Bardem gave a shout-out to his actress mother  in Spanish. Backstage, he fielded questions in Spanish for eight minutes.        
	It wasnt just foreign accents, and foreign-language acceptance speeches, that set many of the evenings winners apart: the big winners all have distinctive creative voices, too.         
	Although quite a few of the victors were hardly household names, almost all of the Oscar recipients are known by film lovers for their fierce determination to invent singular work not typically embraced by the studios. Day-Lewis, who won a best actor Oscar for My Left Foot in 1989, is very selective about his acting jobs. In fact, he once took a hiatus from acting to study shoemaking.        
	Joel and Ethan Coen won not only the best picture honour for co-producing No Country with Scott Rudin, but also took home Oscars for directing the film and adapting Cormac McCarthys gothic crime novel.        
	In what perhaps captured the tenor of the night most fittingly, Falling Slowly was honoured as best original song. The tiny love ballad comes from the equally small Irish film Once, and defeated three flashy songs from the Disney musical Enchanted.        
	This is such a big deal, not only for us, but for all other independent musicians and artists that spend most of their time struggling, said the songs co-writer and the films co-star, the Czech Republics Marketa Irglova, after returning to the stage of the Kodak Theatre because she was inadvertently played off by the orchestra before she had a chance to speak.

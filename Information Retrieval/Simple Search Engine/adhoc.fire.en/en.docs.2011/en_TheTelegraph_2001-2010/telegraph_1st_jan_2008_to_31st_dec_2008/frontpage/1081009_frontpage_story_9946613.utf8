	Calcutta, Oct. 8: I will not take the road to Santiniketan on Dashami.         
	I have been taking that road for the past 20 years. Back then, it was a long and arduous drive through villages in slumber and comatose townships. The 200 kilometres took over six hours to traverse as the roads were mostly narrow and often cobbled.         
	Then two things happened. First, the highway that halved the travel time. Next, Singur.         
	Ever since the Tatas announced that the worlds cheapest car would roll out from a place 41km from Calcutta, taking the road to Santiniketan was not the same.         
	It began with the spot-Singur contest. Where exactly is it its to the left, no right? Must be this.        
	In the true traditions of the argumentative Indian that Santiniketans second most famous son has highlighted, the debate in the car would start from where exactly Singur was and where precisely the Tata plant would be.         
	It would then soar (or sink) to the larger question of Bengals industrial backwardness, the Left Fronts transition from red flags to red carpet for industry.         
	A few months later, at least one argument was resolved. There was no missing the markings on the Tata plot. All eyes would turn left (nothing political about it).         
	With the location puzzle resolved, the talk turned to compensation packages for farmers, the impact this project would have on Bengal, co-existence of industry and agriculture.        
	Weeks rolled by. Work at Singur picked up pace and the small car that meant big things for Bengal got a name. The sense of optimism grew on the drive to Tagoreland. Now it was all about Singur aschhe , Singur aschhe while approaching the Nano site and then the craning of necks and straining of eyes to try and spot where the main plant would be, where the ancillary industries would be, where.         
	The next time, after a long gap, was very different. A large factory edifice rose from amidst the lush green. Like they do in other states where factories flourish bordering fields of cultivation.         
	The factory site was bustling with activity. Many acres, many people. There was something happening in a tiny slice of Bengal. Finally.         
	A hush descended in the car. The argumentative Indian had been silenced by a sight unseen for decades. The road to Santiniketan had become the highway of hope.        
	Then, so many things happened.         
	Now, I will not take the road to Santiniketan. I do not have the heart to look left at Singur. Soon, there will be nothing left to look at.         
	I will take the train to Santiniketan on the day of immersion.

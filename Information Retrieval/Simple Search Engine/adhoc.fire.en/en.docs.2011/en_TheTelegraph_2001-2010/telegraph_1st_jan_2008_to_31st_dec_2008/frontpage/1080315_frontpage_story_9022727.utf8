The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lapang opts for early test
                                                                                                           Lapang opts for early test
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            D.D. Lapang                                  
	Shillong, March 14: Meghalaya chief minister D.D. Lapang sprang a surprise this evening by proposing to hold the trial of strength on Wednesday, a day ahead of the deadline set by Governor S.S. Sidhu to prove his majority in the Assembly.         
	Lapangs proposal was unanimously endorsed by a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party.        
	According to party sources, holding of the trial of strength next Thursday would have delayed the budget session as there will be a four-day holiday, beginning Friday. The government wants the business advisory committee to meet on Thursday to fix the date for the budget session.         
	On Wednesday, the Supreme Court turned down the Purno A. Sangma-led Meghalaya Progressive Alliances plea to reduce the 10-day period granted by Sidhu to Lapang to prove his majority in the Assembly.        
	Lapangs decision to prove his strength 24 hours ahead of the expiry of the deadline has sparked speculation about what the veteran politician may have up his sleeve.         
	To a question, Lapang said that the Meghalaya United Alliance (MUA) was in touch with like-minded friends to get more members to the fold. He also said that it was not appropriate to divulge the exact number of legislators the MUA has at present.        
	Our efforts will continue till Wednesday morning and we will not tell everything to the press, Lapang said.        
	Asked whether the MUA was in touch with the UDP, the NCP and other regional parties, Lapang said: Like-minded people are everywhere. We will keep our cards close to our chest.        
	Lapang said that the CLP meeting also proposed Charles Pyngropes name as Congress nominee to the Speakers post.                           
	The Assembly secretariat is yet to fix the date for the Speakers election but the Congress, from all available indications, wants it the same day as the outcome could influence the result of the trial of strength.        
	The MPA had earlier asked the government to hold the Speakers election at least on March 18.        
	As the MPA has 31 legislators, the combine is certain that their nominee Bindo Lanong will be elected Speaker.

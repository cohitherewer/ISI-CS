The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rio is ready with his flock
                                                                                                           Rio is ready with his flock
  - DAN leader parades 33 before Nagaland governor         SAMIR K. PURKAYASTHA                                           
	Kohima, March 9: Neiphiu Rio today staked claim to a second successive term as the head of a coalition government in Nagaland with the committed and unconditional support of 34 legislators.         
	As he emerged from a meeting with governor K. Sankaranarayan at Raj Bhavan in Kohima, Rios smile spoke of a triumph that must have tasted sweeter after the embarrassment of being dismissed just two months before the completion of his first term.        
	I requested the governor to invite us to form the government on Tuesday, he told the media.        
	A Raj Bhavan source said the governor would have to recommend revocation of Presidents rule and dissolution of the previous Assembly, in suspended animation since January 3, before inviting the leader of the single largest party to form the next government.        
	Rios Nagaland Peoples Front has 26 legislators in the 60-member Assembly and the partys allies in the Democratic Alliance of Nagaland  the BJP and the Nationalist Congress Party  have two each. Four of the six elected Independents have extended support to the coalition.        
	The NPFs and the Congresss tally today increased by one each. G. Kaito of Rios party was declared elected from Satakha and Congress candidate Tokheo Yepthomi from Aghunato.         
	One result is pending because repoll in some booths of that constituency, Suruhoto, is slated for tomorrow.        
	The Congress, which had hoped to become the single-largest party if not get the majority, ended up with 23 seats. Congress leader I. Imkong said the party honoured the peoples verdict but had not given up hope of forming the next government with the support of like-minded groups and Independent legislators.        
	On who these people were, Imkong said he would reveal their identities only when time was ripe for it.        
	The AICC general secretary in charge of Nagaland, Margaret Alva, and her colleague Siddharth Patel are scheduled to arrive here tomorrow morning to oversee the election of the Congress Legislature Party leader.         
	Earlier in the day, the DAN legislators gathered in a tourist resort on the outskirts of the state capital to finalise their strategy and elect their leader.         
	 Rios leadership was undisputed. The DAN legislators did not bother to go into the formalities of an election by proposing his name. They simply reaffirmed their faith in him, NPF secretary-general Chubatemjen Ao said.         
	Former minister M.C. Konyak, the legislator from Wakching, was elected the BJP Legislature Party leader and Chumben Murry, the Wokha MLA, as the NCP leader        
	State NCP chief Y. Sulanthung said his party had asked for two berths in the ministry.

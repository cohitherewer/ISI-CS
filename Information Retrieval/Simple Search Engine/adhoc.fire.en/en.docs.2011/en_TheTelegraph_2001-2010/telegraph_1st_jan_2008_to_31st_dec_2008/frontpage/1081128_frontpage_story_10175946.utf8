	New Delhi, Nov. 27: US President-elect Barack Obama today called Indian ambassador Ronen Sen in Washington to grieve the loss of lives in Mumbai, joining a host of world leaders in condemning the attacks and offering support.        
	Obama said he fully backed the George Bush administrations offer of help to India.        
	The White House said: The US government stands ready to assist and support the Indian government. President Bush offers his condolences to the Indian people.        
	It added that the White House National Security Council had convened officials from counter-terrorism and intelligence agencies as well as the state department and Pentagon to discuss the Mumbai attacks.        
	Obama told Sen his thoughts and prayers were with the people of India and that he was personally monitoring the situation, the US media reported.        
	These co-ordinated attacks on innocent civilians demonstrate the grave and urgent threat of terrorism, Brooke Anderson, Obamas spokesperson on national security, said.        
	US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice called up Sen and foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee to offer support for Indias terror fight, sources in Delhi said.        
	Islamabad condemned the terror strikes, offered complete co-operation and stressed the need to strengthen the bilateral joint anti-terror mechanism.        
	I am shocked and horrified. No civilised society can tolerate such incidents, said Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, here on a four-day visit. I assure the Indian government of our complete co-operation and support.        
	Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said: Terrorist attacks, similar to those in Mumbai, challenge the humanity and the existing world order.        
	British Prime Minister Gordon Brown sent a message to Manmohan Singh saying the UK stood solidly with his government and offered all necessary help. He also said urgent action was under way to offer protection to British citizens in the region.        
	German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote to Singh and her office phoned the Prime Minister to pass on Merkels sympathies and offer help.        
	In a statement, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said: I strongly condemn the indiscriminate violence. In this sad moment, I wish to give my sincerest condolences to the families of the innocent victims and express my sympathy and my wish to the injured for rapid recovery.

	 Oct. 10:There is blood on the streets today (Friday) as stocks continue to plummet in practically every market around the world, from Japan to Europe. The Japanese stock market collapsed, dropping 9.6%, after the failure of an Insurance company triggered a selling spree. Meanwhile, the European markets opened weak, with the London, Paris and Frankfurt exchanges opening significantly lower. All three exchanges were down nearly 10%. In Asia, the Korean and Hong Kong stock exchanges showed steep drops as well. In India, the Sensex is down 800 points so far.
    None of the steps taken by Central bankers and regulators have done anything to prevent the carnage. The coordinated rate cuts, first in Europe and then in Asia, has failed to lift sentiment as has the CRR cut by the Reserve Bank of India. The UK government's steps to partly nationalise the banks has done nothing to stem the panic. In fact, market analysts point out that there is widespread panic in the markets and that nothing like this has been seen before.

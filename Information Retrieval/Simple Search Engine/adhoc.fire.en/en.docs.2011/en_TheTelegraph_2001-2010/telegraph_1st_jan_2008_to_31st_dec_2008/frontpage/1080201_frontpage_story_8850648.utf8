	Alipurduar, Jan. 31: Little Niki Thapa paused to pick flowers and almost got plucked away by a fighter plane.
    
	A MiG-27 today crashed to the ground within 35 metres of the 6-year-old girl in Jalpaiguri, making her possibly one of the youngest Indians to watch such a disaster at so close a quarter.
    
	Happily, she lived to tell the tale, though the waves of shock and the ear-splitting sound have affected her hearing.
    
	I had gone to collect flowers (in a betel nut field) and heard a big sound. When I looked up, a plane was crashing in front of me, she told The Telegraph from a hospital bed. 
    
	I almost fainted. Even now, I am afraid, the Class II student said in the evening, still straining her ears hours after the noon-time accident to catch the questions.
    
	The yawning crater at the crash site  Bhatpara Tea Garden, 35km from Alipurduar town  bears testimony to how close a shave the girl had. The pilot, Wing Commander Jasbir Singh, bailed out and landed with minor injuries 3km away. The plane had taken off from the nearby Hasimara airbase.
    
	Doctors said it did not appear that her hearing had suffered permanent damage. The girls father, Himel, teaches in a school.
    
	Niki now has a life-long story that can rival the best anecdotes of boastful frequent fliers but had she been on a plane? I play with a toy plane in my house but from such a close distance I had never seen a real plane before, she said.
    
	The crash binds Niki with Robin McPherson, who witnessed a similar crash 54 years ago in Canada.
    
	The parallels are uncanny  and chilling. Robin, too, was 6 then. That crash  of a US Air Force F-86 Sabre  also happened around noon at 12.15, 13 minutes before todays accident. No prizes for guessing what Robin was doing then: she was returning home from school as Niki was today. And the Vancouver crash happened on February 15, not far from Nikis unforgettable January 31.
    
	But there were two differences. One, pilot Lamar Barlow was not as lucky as Jasbir Singh  the American died in the crash.
    
	Two, Robin was the sole eyewitness to the accident more than half a century ago.
    
	But todays crash had another witness, 19-year-old Binolata Toppo, who saw the crash from her house which, 25 metres away, was closer to the crash site than where Niki was standing.
    
	Binolata, who was washing utensils in the backyard, said: What I saw today I will never forget. Just before the plane crashed, a basket (possibly the pilots ejection seat) fell from the plane.
    
	She then ran inside, still clutching a steel plate. I was so shocked that for at least half an hour, I could not speak clearly. My mothers hearing has suffered. But we are lucky because the plane did not land on our house.
    
	Not all were lucky, though. Six goats and four pigs in Binolatas house died.

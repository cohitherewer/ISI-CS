          OUR BUREAU                            Floodlights on the tower on the right go off at the Eden Gardens on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                  
	Calcutta, April 22: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today made a dramatic intervention to announce a probe into the Eden fiasco, broadbasing the committee to ensure the inquiry does not become a witch-hunt.        
	The committee is now expected to have five to six members, not three as announced yesterday by sports minister Subhas Chakraborty, a bitter critic of Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Prasun Mukherjee.        
	Chakrabortys announcement of his intention to form the committee and strong condemnation of those at the helm of the CAB had raised fears in the government that any panel handpicked by him could be under pressure to deliver a fait accompli.        
	However, the chief minister today said at Writers Buildings: A committee is being formed to settle the issue. The transport minister will send me the proposal with the names of its members.        
	The announcement was preceded by an unusual intervention by Bhattacharjee, cutting short power minister Mrinal Banerjee who was clarifying that CESC was not involved in the floodlight failure.         
	Aapnake bolte hobe na, ja bolar aami bolchi (You dont have to speak. Whatever has to be said, I will say), the chief minister told his colleague.                  
	The alacrity with which Bhattacharjee has taken charge of the issue is in sharp contrast with the feet-dragging that took place when the Rizwanur Rahman case snowballed after controversial remarks by Mukherjee, the then police commissioner. By the time the chief minister removed Mukherjee, the government was seen as acting under pressure after running out of options.        
	Similar hesitation on the Eden debacle could have further tarnished the image of the government.        
	The chief minister also appears keen to ensure that Chakraborty is not given a blank cheque that can reduce the probe into a score-settling spectacle. Mukherjee was once propped up by Bhattacharjee to take on Jagmohan Dalmiya.        
	CPM leaders said they did not intervene. But Bhattacharjee apparently conveyed to Chakraborty that he should wait for his approval before announcing the names of the committee members.        
	Chakraborty today confirmed that he had sent a list of names to the chief minister. The committee will be formed once the chief minister approves the proposal. Attempts will be made to form the committee before April 29. However, if that does not happen, the match might have to be cancelled, he said.        
	The government will issue a notification to form the committee after the chief secretary returns from Delhi tomorrow, an official in the chief ministers secretariat said.        
	According to sources, the committee is expected to be headed by sports secretary A.K. Patnaik. Five officials are on the members shortlist: special secretary (sports) M.L. Saha; the chief engineer (civil); the chief engineer (electrical); and a representative each from police and CESC.         
	 So far as I know, I will head the committee, while Saha will act as its convener, Patnaik later said. Asked if he would question the CAB president, Patnaik said: Everybody associated with the fiasco will come under the purview. But I will decide after speaking to the chief secretary.        
	Lights go off        
	A tower of floodlights failed at the Eden Gardens on Tuesday, less than 48 hours after the shame on Sunday.        
	The Kolkata Knight Riders were practising when the floodlights on the tower near the high court end went on the blink around 6pm. As the other three towers were unaffected, the practice continued.        
	Ironically, around the same time, a group of officials, including CAB president Mukherjee, was brainstorming at Lalbazar on how to avoid a repeat of Sunday.        
	However, after an inspection and discussion for 45 minutes, the officials could not pinpoint the cause. Officials from Philips India, the electronics company, are expected to investigate the matter.

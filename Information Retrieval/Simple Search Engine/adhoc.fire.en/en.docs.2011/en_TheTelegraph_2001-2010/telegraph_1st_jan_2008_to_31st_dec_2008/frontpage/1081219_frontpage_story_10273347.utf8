          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Dec. 18: Kolebira (Simdega) MLA Anosh Ekka and Jarmundi (Deoghar) legislator Harinarayan Rai have enjoyed the special status of being Independents in the past three governments.        
	They held important portfolios in the former NDA regime, led by Arjun Munda, followed by UPA nominee Madhu Koda and incumbent Shibu Soren.         
	The fortune of winning the 2005 Assembly polls from their respective seats as Independents provided both a bargaining power in successive governments running on razor-thin margins. And the two used the power to the fullest, as was apparent in the birthday parties that Ekka threw for his son every year from his Simdega home and in the 100-animal-capacity cowshed that Rai has built at Sonaraidih in Jarmundi.        
	Rai never cared for Soren. When the latter was in the Dumka jail and Rai was a part of the UPA-led government, he never paid a courtesy visit. He is associated with BJP bigwigs in Santhal Pargana and he knows how to win the Jarmundi seat through caste politics, said an observer based in Santhal Pargana.         
	Rai belongs to the Ghatwal (SC) community that has a sizeable presence in the area. He contested from Jarmundi in 2005 as an Independent after being denied a JMM ticket and was associated with Bahujan Samaj Party, which lacked political base in Jharkhand. He proved to be a dark horse and won by a wide margin.         
	On the other hand, Ekka, a former Congressman, learnt his politics with Congresss Simdega MLA Niel Tirkey  an Ekkas bete noire.         
	Being denied a party ticket to contest from the neighbouring Kolebira seat, he decided to be in the fray as a candidate of then N.E. Horo-led Jharkhand Party. He won by a thin margin of 30 votes and it turned out to be a fortune for the Simdega strongman, earlier a petty contractor.        
	Although relations with Tileshwar Sahu, a close companion, later soured, it was Sahu who introduced Ekka to the NDA camp in 2005 helping Munda to form the government with Kamlesh Kumar Singh, Sudesh Kumar Mahto and Chandra Prakash Choudhary, and also Ekka. NDA higher-ups took the ministers to Jaipur and New Delhi.         
	This invited the wrath of N.E. Horo who filed an anti-defection case against Ekka in the House. It was during Ekkas tenure that engineers of the rural development department received immense financial powers, block agriculture officers were made BDOs and transport department proved to be a lucrative posting for home department officials  all for wrong reasons.

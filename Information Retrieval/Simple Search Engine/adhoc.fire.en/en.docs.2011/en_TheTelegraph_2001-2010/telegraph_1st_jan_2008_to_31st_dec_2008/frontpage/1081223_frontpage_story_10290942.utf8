The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Fighters fly low over Pak cities
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Fighters fly low over Pak cities

	Islamabad/New Delhi, Dec. 22: Pakistani fighter jets flew low over Lahore, Islamabad and Rawalpindi, alarming some residents and bringing forth a word of assurance from the Indian deputy high commissioner.        
	People came out on the streets as the jets scrambled over the cities. The air force spokesperson said vigilance has been enhanced in view of the current environment. The apparent air exercise delayed two civilian flights in Lahore.        
	Asked if India had sought permission from Islamabad to conduct surgical strikes on militant sanctuaries, Indian deputy high commissioner Manpreet Vohra said in Islamabad: There is no plan to carry out strikes.        
	The plane scare coincided with the arrival of Admiral Mike Mullen, the US joint chiefs of staff chairman, in Pakistan for his second visit since the Mumbai attacks.        
	Indian intelligence agencies have reported heightened activity in the Pakistani military. A naval exercise Pakistan conducted in the high seas off Sir Creek on December 8 has stoked particular interest.         
	At least three ships of the Pakistan Marine Security Agency were engaged in the exercise, commanded by Tahir Jabrar. One warship has been identified as Kasir.        
	Exercises in the high seas by both countries are common in winter. But Indian officials were not expecting Pakistan to go ahead with an exercise so soon after the Mumbai attacks and that too on the western coast.

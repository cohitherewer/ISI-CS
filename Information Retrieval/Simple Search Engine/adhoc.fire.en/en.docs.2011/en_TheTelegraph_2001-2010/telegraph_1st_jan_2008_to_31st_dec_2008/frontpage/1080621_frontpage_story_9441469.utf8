          RUDRA BISWAS                              
	Ranchi, June 20: Eight wagons of a goods train were derailed and four severely damaged as rebels blew up about 5ft of railway tracks between two small stations in Ranchi division early this morning.        
	Police sources said the blast  between Pokla and Bakaspur stations  was carried out by Peoples Liberation Front of India, a rebel group, to mark the beginning of the 12-hour bandh called by them.        
	The sources added that the goods train was carrying iron ore to Bokaro when the Naxalites blew up the tracks  about 80km from Ranchi  with powerful explosives around 2.30am. The train, running at a medium speed, moved more than 50ft along the tracks before it came to a halt with derailment of eight wagons.        
	Following the derailment, the Hatia-Jharsuguda Passenger was cancelled, while three other trains were diverted.         
	Hatia-Lok Manya Tilak Terminus Express, Hatia-Yesvantpur Express and the Alleppey Express were diverted through Muri and Sini.         
	Departure schedules for Tapaswini Express, Dhanbad-Alleppey Express, Swarna Jayanti Express had to be rescheduled too.        
	The bandh today had a noticeable impact in Gumla, Simdega, Lohardaga, Chatra and Khunti districts where long-distance busses remained off the roads and markets closed.         
	State police spokesperson and deputy inspector-general of police Raj Kumar Mallik said that the rebel party had only a marginal presence in some parts of the state.         
	He added that the group had even joined hands with the Jharkhand Liberation Tigers to gain strength.        
	Several long-distance trains in the Chakradharpur division were also rescheduled and diverted due to the derailment and the Maoist bandh.         
	The Tata-Alleppey Express was rescheduled for five hours. The train was scheduled to leave Tatanagar at 4pm.         
	But the departure of the train was rescheduled to 9pm because of the derailment.         
	The Jammu Tawi Express and a few other long-distance trains went through the diverted route because of the Maoist bandh. The trains were diverted in order to avoid the Naxalite-hit areas.

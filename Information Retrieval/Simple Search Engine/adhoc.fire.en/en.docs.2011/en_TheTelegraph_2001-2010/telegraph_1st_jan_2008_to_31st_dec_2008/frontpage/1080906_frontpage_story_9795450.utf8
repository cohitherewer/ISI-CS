	Ranchi, Sept. 5: The Jharkhand government would dispatch a medical team comprising 15 doctors accompanied by two truck-load of medicines on Saturday to aid Bihar flood victims.        
	The team would be divided into three groups, each group responsible for a mobile health clinic, apart from medicines and paramedics. They would camp at parts of flood-hit region for a fortnight and move with the mobile clinic according to need.         
	Meanwhile, Mecon Limited today sent a medical team with medicines for Bihar victims. Rana Chakraborty, the Mecon spokesperson, said the team would camp there for 15 days.        
	We fear that water-borne diseases may spread in the region after the water level recedes. More than food, the victims would need medical care, said health minister Bhanu Pratap Sahi. Addressing reporters, Sahi said if the situation demanded the medical team would extend their stay in Bihar.        
	The health minister added that the state would be sending 50 quintal of medicines  all essential to treat water-borne diseases. The medicines include 40,000 pieces of ORS, 10,000 bottles of IV-fluid, 10,000 metronidazole and 1,000 ampicillin. Sahi said he has spoken to his Bihar counterpart and the medical officers there have charted out an action plan for the Jharkhand team.         
	Shibu Soren has already promised monetory help of Rs 10,000 crore for the Bihar victims. The ministers of Soren council have also promised to part with their salary for a month (Rs 40,000).         
	Meanwhile, the Cockrel Infantry Division based in the state capital also dispatched 15-tonnes of food. The food would reach Bihar by Sunday. The materials would be distributed in Madhepura and Supaul, where the troops of Ranchi Garrison are already engaged in relief operation, said Colonel R.K. Singh, the spokesperson.         
	Sahi said the Jharkhand government is in constant touch with Bihar, taking in every flood detail.         
	The Indian Railways also have offered free transport of relief materials and has started special counters at Hatia and Ranchi to book consignments addressed to Bihar relief commissioner.

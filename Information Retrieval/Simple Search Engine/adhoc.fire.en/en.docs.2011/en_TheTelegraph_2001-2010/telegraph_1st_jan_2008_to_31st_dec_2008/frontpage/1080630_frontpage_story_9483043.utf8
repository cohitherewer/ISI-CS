	June 29: Fernando Torres gifted Spain its first Euro cup in 44 years, smashing a goal in the 33rd minute against Germany in the final in Vienna today.        
	The goal rewarded an ever-improving Spanish side which set up several scoring opportunities once it braved early German domination.        
	Many had probably seen Germany in a final before but not Spain. Their lone European title was back in 1964 and they had not appeared in the final since their defeat by hosts France in 1984.        
	As the Spanish captain, Iker Casillas, had said beforehand, comparing club and country experience: With Real Madrid were used to playing big finals, at national team level, certainly not.         
	That much was made almost too clear in only the third minute when his Madrid club-mate Sergio Ramos, misjudged a defensive pass and let in Miroslav Klose. Fortunately, Carles Puyol stuck out a foot and the ball bounced back off Kloses legs and out for a goal-kick.        
	The final presented a intriguing clash of club-mates: Arsenals Jens Lehmann against Cesc Fabregas; Real Madrids Christoph Metzelder against Casillas and Sergio Ramos. But it was the Spanish branch who prospered, the longer the game went in.        
	Suddenly, Spain grew in confidence. Torres headed against Lehmanns right-hand post and, when Germany failed to clear effectively, Joan Capdevila pulled an angled drive wide across goal with Lehmann diving uncertainly  and in vain  after it.        
	Spain were now passing with far greater accuracy than the Germans. Their players were interchanging more effectively around the pitch and their command was underlined in 33 minutes when Torres shot them ahead.         
	Leftback Philipp Lahm was to blame, allowing the Liverpool striker to accelerate around behind him and slide a right-foot shot beyond the advancing Lehmann.         
	Late in the first half, Ballack went down with blood streaming down his face after an accidental clash.

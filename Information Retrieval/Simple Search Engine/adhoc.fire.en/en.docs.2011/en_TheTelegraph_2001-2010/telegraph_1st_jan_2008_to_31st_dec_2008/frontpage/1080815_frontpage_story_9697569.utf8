	Washington, Aug. 14: The US draft to amend the international guidelines for nuclear commerce with India seeks to facilitate Indias membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) through the backdoor.        
	The penultimate paragraph of the five-point draft running into two pages reviewed by The Telegraph says participation of India in the decisions regarding proposed amendments (to NSG guidelines) will facilitate their implementation by India.        
	It is clear now from the draft document that the successful effort a few days ago by the Bush administration to persuade Germany to seat India as a special guest at next weeks NSG meeting was part of this effort by Washington to get India into the group that controls global nuclear commerce through the backdoor.        
	So far, India has turned down the attempt to make it a junior member of the NSG though the government would not be averse to full membership of the group with all its rights, responsibilities and privileges, including a voice in taking decisions that govern international nuclear trade.        
	India and China sought NSG membership at the same time during the rule of the NDA government and China was quickly admitted to the group as a recognised nuclear weapons state.        
	An NSG mission from Vienna that included the groups then chair visited New Delhi in the first-ever formal contact between the NSG and India, but the matter has languished there.        
	Washington clearly believes that the process of bringing India into the nuclear mainstream is fraught with problems unless New Delhi can be a participant in the exercise.         
	But the Bush administration is also aware that pushing for Indias full membership of the NSG at this stage will further annoy its members who already resent change in rules for India without Indias adherence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and other yardsticks that the ayatollahs of non-proliferation in Vienna and Geneva consider sacrosanct.        
	The proposal seeking participation of India in the decisions by the NSG that concern New Delhi is a new element in the US draft that was missing in the Bush administrations original proposal to seek an exemption for India that was submitted in 2006.        
	A key difference between the original US proposal to the NSG and the current one, amended as demanded by New Delhi, is that the draft to be considered in Vienna next week underscores the point that whatever has been done by India regarding its nuclear programme has been done voluntarily as a contributing partner in the non-proliferation regime.        
	The voluntary nature of Indias unilateral moratorium on nuclear tests... its readiness to work with others towards conclusion of a multilateral Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty and its efforts to separate its civilian nuclear facilities in a phased manner and file a declaration regarding its civilian nuclear facilities with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in the latest draft make it possible, in principle, for any government in New Delhi to walk away from these commitments if necessary.        
	This will enable Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to claim in Parliament when it reconvenes next month that he has remained faithful to the commitments he made to MPs in all his statements to the legislature on the Indo-US nuclear deal in the last three years.         
	Another important change in the new draft relates to the provision in the 2006 proposal that called for a government selling nuclear equipment to India to be satisfied that India continues to fully meet... non-proliferation and safeguards commitments, and all other requirements of the NSG Guidelines.        
	This could have prompted any non-proliferationist US senator or member of the House of Representatives to initiate a move on Capitol Hill that required a cumbersome annual presidential certification that India was, indeed, meeting these commitments.        
	The new draft merely requires a seller state to maintain contact and consult through regular channels on matters connected with the implementation of the Guidelines, taking into account relevant international commitments and bilateral agreements with India.        
	The bilateral agreements, in the case of the US, constitutes a reference to its nuclear deal with India and, in the case of France and Russia, any bilateral agreements they may sign with New Delhi. These bilateral agreements will override everything else to Indias advantage.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 6: Toeing the lines of several other states, the state government today reduced 10 per cent tax on petroleum products to cushion the effects of the price hike effected by the Union government.        
	The government was levying 20 per cent value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel. With the reduction of VAT by 10 per cent, the tax rate on petroleum products will be 18 per cent.        
	In Orissa, the petrol price had also gone up from Rs 46.62 per litre to Rs 51.68 per litre. Now it will come down to Rs 50.82 (down by 86 paise) after todays tax revision. Similarly, the diesel price, which had risen from Rs 34.66 per litre to Rs 37.89 per litre after the hike, will come down to Rs 37.25 (a reduction of 64 paise) per litre following the tax revision.        
	The decision was announced by chief minister Naveen Patnaik this evening after approving the proposal submitted by the finance department.        
	An official release issued by the chief ministers secretariat said the price hike of petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 3 per litre, respectively, had imposed a huge burden on common people, which had triggered a lot of public resentment. With inflation rate touching 8` per cent, this price hike was feared to worsen the situation. The state government had, therefore, decided to slash the tax on petrol and diesel by 10 per cent.        
	However, the existing tax rate (4 per cent) on LPG will remain unchanged.        
	The revised tax rate on petrol and diesel would be effective from tomorrow, said the release.        
	A senior finance department official said the state government would incur slight loss by this tax reduction.         
	The state was getting a revenue of Rs 950 crore per annum from tax on petrol and diesel (Rs 190 crore from petrol and Rs 760 crore from diesel).         
	It was estimated that the state would get an additional revenue to the tune of Rs 100 crore after the petroleum price hike.         
	But after the reduction of tax by 10 per cent, it would be virtually no gain, no loss for the state, said the official.

          RESHAM MUKHERJEE                              
	Dhanbad, May 5: With steel maker ArcelorMittal expressing its willingness to opt for a joint venture with Coal India Limited to revive abandoned mines, Dhanbads coal giant has commissioned a fact-finding mission to map the extent of underground resources under its purview.        
	Jharia alone is estimated to host nearly 5 billion tonnes of coal reserves and CILs move is significant in that it first wishes to understand the extent of coal reserves it is sitting on before deciding on future tie-ups with visiting industry houses.        
	Lakshmi Mittal, in a proposal to the coal ministry, had put forth ArcelorMittals interest in mining in the coal belt using new technology to take out coal worthy of use left over by the company.        
	CIL chairman Parthasarathi Bhattacharjee said he had already informed the ministry about the survey after it was okayed by their board. As per company rules, after the survey we are going to float an expression of interest in which all companies interested in mining ventures are welcome to apply, he told The Telegraph from Calcutta.         
	CIL has 468 mines of which 283 are underground, 149 are open cast and 36 are mixed. Before nationalisation, many mines had to be abandoned due to unscientific mining. Now these sites have become hubs of illegal coal mining.         
	CIL sources said exploiting new resources was a matter of time and investment, but right now, the fact-finding survey  backed by CILs R amp;D wing  held the key to any future decision. To begin with, the survey  itll be handled by CIL subsidiary Central Mine Planning and Design Institute Limited  has identified about half-a-dozen closed mines once under Bharat Coking Coal Limited in Jharia.         
	The very mention of ArcelorMittal has, however, alarmed trade unions. Rashtriya Colliery Mazdoor Sangh president .P. Lal said his union was opposed to any move to de-nationalise and privatise CIL.        
	CIL officers, he said, are specialised in coal mining. At least 20 people from CIL go abroad every year for training. Moreover, ISM here produces hundreds of mining experts. How can a steel company have better knowledge than people here?         
	The issue, Lal insisted, had to be discussed with the over 5 lakh CIL workers as it was a question of their future.        
	Bhattacharjee, however, dismissed the unions opposition as uninformed criticism. If mining starts in Jharia it would be beneficial for the industry and the people. CIL is sitting on a threshold of growth and captive blocks are set to increase production more than five times.

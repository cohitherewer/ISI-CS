                                                                                                           First strike threat to Haldia
          OUR BUREAU                              
	March 31: The long arm of labour strike is threatening to reach where it could not till now: Haldia Petrochemicals.        
	Citu, the ruling CPMs labour arm, has called a 24-hour strike in the company the state government showcases as its investment jewel.        
	If the trade union goes ahead with the April 8 strike  amicable solutions are still not ruled out  it will be the first such industrial action in Haldia Petro since the venture started production in 2001.         
	Citu has called the strike demanding permanent employment of 183 casual workers.        
	As a last resort, we have called the strike to press the demand for permanent employment of 183 casual workers out of a total of 1,500 casual workers. So far, our repeated pleas to the management have fallen on deaf ears, said Ashok Patnaik, a member of the Citu state committee and the secretary of the trade unions Haldia zonal committee.        
	Justifying the demand for permanent employment for the 183, Patnaik said: We have been asking the management for permanent employment of only those who are associated with day-to-day office work like carrying files, letters and some other odd jobs.         
	The strike announcement came in the middle of the CPM congress in Coimbatore, where the party is discussing the industrialisation drive in Bengal.        
	Does industrialisation mean sacrificing the workers interest? Lakshman Seth, a CPM member of Parliament and the chairman of the Haldia Development Authority, asked in Coimbatore. Seth, too, accused the management of adopting a rigid position.        
	None of the top officials of Haldia Petro could be contacted till late tonight. However, a company statement said: The HPL management is confident of reaching amicable solutions through discussion.        
	Patnaik, too, hinted that the strike could be called off if the management met the demand. We have still a week to go for the strike. Let the management take a decision by then, he added.         
	According to Patnaik, all 875 permanent employees and 1,500 casual workers will join the strike from 6 am on April 8 to 6 am the next day. However, the emergency boiler unit will be exempted from the strike.        
	Posters and leaflets were pasted on the Haldia Petro gate today in support of the strike.

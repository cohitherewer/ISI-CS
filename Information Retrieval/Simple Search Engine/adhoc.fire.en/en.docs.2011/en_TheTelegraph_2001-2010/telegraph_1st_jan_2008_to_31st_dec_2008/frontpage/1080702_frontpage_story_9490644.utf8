  - Ambulance failed, chopper not used        RAJ KUMAR AMP; AMIT GUPTA                                    
	Ranchi, July 1: At least two of the five policemen killed in yesterdays landmine blast at Tamar could have been saved.         
	The ambulance taking them to Ranchi, 65km away, broke down mid way losing precious time, while the states chopper  the best option to conduct rescue operations in a difficult terrain, was busy ferrying the DGP to Dhanbad for a strategy session on combating red terror.        
	Bundu sub-divisional police officer Pramod Kumar and four of his colleagues died after their vehicle was forced to drive on landmines after Maoists hiding in the forests opened fire on them at Pundidri village. While constables Kanhai Singh and Kanchan Bhagat died on the spot, Ignatius Toppo and Arun Singh succumbed to their wounds on way to hospital.         
	Almost 24 hours later, constables Ravi Kumar Yadav and Bhagwat Singh are recovering at the high dependency unit of the Apollo Hospital here with serious wounds on their legs and faces. Their pain numbed with medicines, they can now recall vividly last evenings events. I remember seeing Arun and Ignatius talk for more than two hours after we were hit by the blast, said Yadav. Actually, the ambulance that had been sent for our rescue was too slow and stopped after a sometime. We were shifted to another ambulance and all this wasted precious time.        
	Yadav remembers not being able to move due to the impact of the blast. I found myself lying on the ground helplessly. The others were fighting back at the Maoists.         
	Constable Neeranjan Cheri was one of them. At the hospital today to check on his wounded colleagues, he agreed with Yadav that the two could have been saved had they reached the hospital earlier. The firing went on for 20 minutes. We then informed the Tamar police station and asked them to send an ambulance, Cheri said. But it took more than an hour to reach us  only 8km on a mud road.        
	But why didnt they take an alternate route while returning from the Longtu after a routine combing operation? It was always difficult finding the way through the forests, explained havildar Dang, who was part of the team.         
	As for the government chopper, the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited-made Dhruv returned from Dhanbad around 4pm on Monday after ferrying DGP V.D. Ram and three other IG-ranked police officials for a review meeting.         
	Home secretary Sudhir Tripathi explained the issue just like a bureaucrat would. No requisition was made by Ranchi police for Dhruv, he said, discounting the possibility of the chopper being kept on standby.

          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, May 23: While all eyes were on chief minister Raman Singh and BJPs prime ministerial candidate L.K. Advani, who flagged off a vikas rath from Dantewada this afternoon, Central Reserve Police Force jawans allegedly opened fire at a relief camp in neighbouring Bijapur killing a child and a woman late last night.         
	Raju (2) and Rambai (25) were killed on the spot, while a six-year-old boy and a woman were critically injured when 100-odd jawans of the 188 battalion, posted at a Cherpal village relief camp, opened fire on the villagers  mostly tribals.        
	The woman and the boy have been admitted to Bijapur district hospital. Their condition is said to be critical.        
	With Advani in the neighbouring district, the Bijapur district administration and police swung into action and took Tirupati Rao, a CRPF constable, into custody.         
	According to police sources, the jawans received information of a hardcore rebel leader, who had entered the camp in civil dress. The jawans allegedly mobilised villagers at a place and were verifying the identity when one person tried to flee the spot, forcing the jawans to open fire  the woman and the infant came in the line of fire accidentally.         
	Bijapur superintendent of police Ankit Garg said a magisterial enquiry had been ordered that would look into all aspects of the incident.         
	About 1,200 villagers had taken shelter in the government-run camp, about 450km south of Raipur, following rebel attacks.         
	The villagers were in the target list of Naxalites for allegedly backing Salwa Judum, the civil militia movement launched in June 2005.         
	Villagers on the other hand have alleged that jawans asked them to come out from the camp for an urgent meeting past midnight and asked the men and women to sit in separate rows.         
	According to preliminary information, after a while jawans started beating the villagers and then opened fire on them. Tension mounted in the area in the morning after villagers staged protests and thronged the district hospital. A blame game ensued, where residents alleged that the force had trapped them in a crossfire while jawans blamed Maoists.        
	The administration has announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh for the victims family and Rs 5,000 each for the injured.        
	District officials refues to say much stating the magisterial inquiry would reveal all. However, villagers alleged that the trouble began when a few CRPF men tried to molest the camps women.         
	 The vice-president of the All India Adivasi Mahasabha, Chitranjan Bakshi, has demanded a high-level probe by an independent agency to bring out the facts of the incident. Bakshi said the state-backed Salwa Judum should be immediately stopped and the villagers should be sent back to their homes to avoid such atrocities on them.

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                      
	New Delhi, April 15: The Congress has snuffed out the attempt by Arjun Singh and Pranab Mukherjee to pitch Rahul Gandhi as the partys candidate for Prime Minister in 2009.        
	A stiff message vetted by Sonia Gandhi praised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his magnificent record of performance  the subtext was that nobody shall destabilise him.        
	Arjun, who was summoned by Sonia in the evening, later sang the same tune. I have said nothing against the Prime Minister, he said after the 15-minute meeting at 10 Janpath. The human resource development minister added he was ready to respect the conventions of the cabinet system and work under Singh.        
	Congress spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan had earlier told reporters: The All India Congress Committee would like to put an end to all such speculation. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have always kept away from an environment of sycophancy.         
	But she refused to say if Arjun and Mukherjee were sycophants. I will not add or subtract from the statement, Natarajan said.         
	The statement was prepared by M. Veerappa Moily, who heads the media department.        
	The party is afraid that the alleged covert moves to undermine Manmohan Singhs position could hurt its fortunes in the coming elections, starting with Karnataka, and negate any positive fallout from issues like the OBC quota so dear to Arjun Singh.         
	In response to questions from journalists, the HRD minister had said yesterday this was the right time to project Rahul.         
	Asked to comment on Arjuns statement, Mukherjee told reporters in Parliament: Everywhere, new leadership is emerging and if he has suggested, there is nothing wrong in it. There is no controversy as such. When the occasion arises, it (Rahuls takeover) will be discussed. Everyone is giving his views, so Arjun Singh is also entitled to give his views.        
	Mukherjee added that it was a universal truth that the leadership baton was handed to young people. When the occasion arises, the party will certainly respond. Let the elections come. If it will happen, it will happen, he said.        
	Amid speculation that he had been ticked off, Arjun claimed he had met Sonia today only to ask her to send a message for the inauguration of the Indira Gandhi University at Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh. What is wrong if he (Rahul) is given the charge? He has the required capabilities, he added.        
	Party sources admitted to being seriously worried not so much by Mukherjee as Arjun. Once Mukherjee gets the high commands message, he lies low. Not (Arjun) Singh. Hes feeling so rejuvenated by the OBC issue that he may be unstoppable. Hes sniffed a chance to disconcert the PM, a source said.        
	The Congress is worried its plank of giving a stable coalition would be weakened if the leadership debate goes unchecked.         
	Manmohan Singh fought hard to stave off the perception that he was a caretaker PM. We dont want the problem to haunt him again, especially when we are fighting a whole lot of elections, a functionary said.        
	Sources close to Singh said he had not spoken to Sonia on the statements by his colleagues.

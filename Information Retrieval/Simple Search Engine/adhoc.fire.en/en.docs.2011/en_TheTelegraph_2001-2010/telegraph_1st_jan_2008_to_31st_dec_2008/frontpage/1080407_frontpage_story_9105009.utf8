          OUR BUREAU                                                
	Calcutta, April 6: The driver of the bus in which 20 people drowned off VIP Road had lost his job on another route three years ago because of frequent traffic violations, relatives and acquaintances have said.        
	Swapan Sarkar, who was at the wheel but fled after the bus on route 217B fell into a canal along the road, used to drive on route 3C/1 in 2005.        
	The owner of the 3C/1 bus had asked my father to leave as his way of driving resulted in a number of cases related to traffic violations. He was being pulled up by traffic sergeants regularly, said Ajoy Sarkar, 18, son of Swapan Sarkar, who lives with mother Basanti and grandmother Minati in a shanty in Mullickpara Lane in Shyamnagar, near Dum Dum.         
	The family said Swapan, separated from his wife, had not visited them for over two years. But they learnt from police and media reports that he had been held responsible for Fridays accident.         
	I feel sad. I dont know how it could have happened, said Minati Sarkar, Swapans mother.        
	At the Babughat bus terminus, Swapans fellow drivers, too, spoke of a tendency to step on the gas.         
	Speeding was his habit and he used to be slapped with cases for his way of driving, said a bus driver with whom Swapan used to hang around between shifts.         
	Although none of the 30-odd 217B buses hit the roads on Sunday  fearing a backlash from passengers  Fridays accident and the future of Swapan remained the main topic of discussion at the bus stop.         
	It will be difficult for us to drive through that stretch on VIP Road, said a driver who had reported for work on Sunday.         
	Police have learnt that Swapan, also a resident of Mullickpara Lane off Jessore Road, has been part of the public transport human chain for over 20 years.        
	Earlier he used to work as a helper in private buses. But seven years ago, he got himself a driving licence from the Regional Transport Office in Barasat and started driving buses, an official of Baguiati police station said.         
	During interrogation at airport police station last night, Swapan, arrested from a hideout in Dum Dum yesterday and remanded in jail for 14 days today, told investigators that he did not take any formal driving lesson and learnt the skills from fellow drivers.         
	This is the biggest problem we face while tackling bus drivers. They are technically weak and are not aware of how to be sensitive to others while driving on the roads, said Manoj Verma, deputy commissioner (traffic), Calcutta Police.         
	If drivers are blamed for lack of sensitivity, the police can also be accused of looking the other way more often than not. Till late this evening, the police could not gather data on Swapans conduct as a driver or confirm whether they have any proof of the disclosures made by his son and his colleagues.         
	Traffic violation cases take place in various areas. We are trying to get more details and see if he has a record of traffic violations, said Supratim Sarkar, the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.         
	The accident took place as the brakes failed and the tie-rod was jammed. No driver would want an accident, Swapan shouted today while he was being escorted to the court.         
	According to police sources, a preliminary examination of the vehicle, carried out by motor vehicles department experts, has ruled out the possibility of mechanical failure.         
	Brake failure and tie-rod, which connects the steering wheel to axle, problems do not happen suddenly. These things give enough signals to enable the driver to take appropriate measures, said Partha Sadhan Bose, an auto expert.         
	If Swapans claim of mechanical fault is established, the homicide charge will be lifted and he will be tried for rash driving, which carries a maximum punishment of six months in jail and a fine of up to Rs 1,000.

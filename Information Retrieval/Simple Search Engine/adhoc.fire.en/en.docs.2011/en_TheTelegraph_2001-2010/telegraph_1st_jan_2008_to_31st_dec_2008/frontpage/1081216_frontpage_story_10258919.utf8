          RASHEED KIDWAI                            Chauhan (top), Patil: Portfolio pain                          
	Bhopal, Dec. 15: Call it the Shivraj Patil effect: home is no longer hot in Madhya Pradesh.        
	The home portfolio has few takers among the newly elected BJP lawmakers despite being traditionally seen as the number two ministry in any government.        
	But it isnt just that the ministry is too hot to handle in an age of terror attacks, as Patil found out to his cost at the Centre. The ministry also seems jinxed at the hustings.        
	Outgoing home minister Himmat Kothari lost this election although most of his cabinet colleagues returned comfortably. Former home ministers Kailash Chawla, Gauri Shankar Shejwar (both BJP), Bharat Singh, Jaipal Singh, Satyadev Katare and Mahendra Bodh (all Congress) also lost in last months polls.        
	So, most senior MLAs are showing greater interest in revenue, public works, power, commercial tax, education, irrigation and other departments ahead of this weeks swearing-in. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan took oath of office alone on December 12.        
	Several ministers from the previous government, who did not want to be named, explained the reasons for their lack of interest in the home department.        
	One, they said, the subject of internal security is such that it can never show tangible improvement. Two, in a state like Madhya Pradesh, crimes against women, Dalits and tribals are always high.        
	Three, in matters of senior-level appointments and postings, the chief minister takes the final call and the home minister gets no credit. Four, the department is not wet enough, allowing the minister little opportunity to extend patronage to party workers.        
	Picking his ministers is proving a headache for Chauhan for other reasons too. Most of the 143 MLAs have staked claim but Chauhan can have just 35-odd ministers. Indications are that first-timers will be excluded but that still leaves 122 hopefuls.        
	Also, over a dozen ex-ministers face corruption charges and if Chauhan picks one, he cant ignore the rest. He cant leave all of them out since theres a case against the chief minister before the lokayukta.

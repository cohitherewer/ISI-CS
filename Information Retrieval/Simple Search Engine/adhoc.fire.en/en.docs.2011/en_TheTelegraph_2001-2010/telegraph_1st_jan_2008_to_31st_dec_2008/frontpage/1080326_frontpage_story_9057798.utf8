The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | JMM left to duck Cong bouncer
                                                                                                           JMM left to duck Cong bouncer
  - Maken says party will back Independent Anand, asks Soren to drop Lal          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                    
	Ranchi, March 25: With four candidates in the fray for two seats, tomorrows cliffhanger of a Rajya Sabha election was always set for a photofinish. Now, the Congress has added to the intrigue by deciding to back an Independent and not the JMM-supported UPA nominee.        
	The upper House seats, vacated after Ajay Maroo and Devdas Apte completed their tenure, will now be occupied by two of these four:         
	Parimal Nathwani, president (corporate affairs) of Mukesh Ambani-headed Reliance Industries who is the surprise candidate contesting as an Independent, much like lawyer R.K. Anand, who jumped into the race at the last moment; JMM-backed former South Delhi MP Kishori Lal and NDAs J.P.N. Singh.        
	According to rules, the winner will be declared first by identifying the one with the highest number of votes. Thereafter, the candidate getting the lowest number of votes will be eliminated.         
	Second preference votes received by the first and the eliminated candidate will be added to the rest to decide the second winner.         
	The Congress, which had remained silent on its preferences, today declared its support for Independent nominee R K Anand. The high command has asked all nine party MLAs to support Anand.         
	It has also asked JMM chief Shibu Soren to withdraw his nominee, Kishori Lal, and support Anand in the interest of UPA unity.         
	Senior leaders are talking to Soren and Lalu Prasad for their support for Anand, Congress leader in charge of party affairs in Jharkhand Ajay Maken told The Telegraph over telephone from New Delhi.         
	For Soren, who sprang a surprise by not fielding Durga as the UPA candidate, the Congresss logic should not be hard to follow  since the JMM chief went back on his promise to the UPA by nominating Lal, he should back out.                           
	But with Soren refusing to withdraw his candidate, JMM sources admitted party MLAs could indulge in cross-voting now that Lals position had been apparently weakened.         
	 quot;Now, they will be free to vote, quot; said a source close to Soren. That line of thinking doesnt seem out of place given that 11 among 17 JMM MLAs had proposed Nathwanis candidature.         
	Soren did try to pre-empt the local Congress by holding a meeting of UPA MLAs and writing to Sonia Gandhi in the hope that party MLAs backed his candidate. I have nominated an able person (Kishore Lal) according to your instructions, he said.         
	But the Congress stayed away from his meeting. Its now clear why.         
	Amid the climate of uncertainty _ MLAs have even planned a friendly cricket match to finalise voting plans _ Independent candidates, particularly Nathwani, have been banking on second preference votes of those who werent in a position to flout party discipline. In fact, Nathwani has written an open letter to the states 81 MLAs, outlining several promises, including his desire to market the potential of Jharkhand.         
	On the eve of the elections, Nathwani seemed confident. quot;I am banking on first preference votes and not the seconds, quot; he claimed.         
	The BJP is on guard too. We have asked our MLAs not to cast the second preference votes, said Opposition leader Arjun Munda after the partys central observer, Vijay Goel, held a meeting with their MLAs.        
	In a bid to prevent cross-voting, the BJP and JD (U) have asked MLAs to show their choice to the polling agent before casting their votes.         
	RJD supremo Lalu Prasad hasnt revealed his mind even though several party MLAs met him in Patna with some like Gautam Sagar Rana urging him to boycott the elections. But indications are that RJD MLAs are likely to support Anand given that five of the seven had proposed Anands candidature.         
	No wonder Anand spoke out. JMM MLAs are not with Soren, the lawyer declared.

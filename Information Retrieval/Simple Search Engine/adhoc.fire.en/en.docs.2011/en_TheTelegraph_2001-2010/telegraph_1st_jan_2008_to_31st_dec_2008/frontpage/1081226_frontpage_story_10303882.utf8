	Srinagar, Dec. 25: The soaring turnout in Kashmir may have left the Hurriyat shaken, but it hasnt stirred them from separatist moorings.         
	Its true we may have read the sentiment wrong in asking people to boycott the elections, says Peoples Conference and Hurriyat leader Sajjad Lone, but it will be suicidal for New Delhi to read this as a pro-India vote. If thats the case, if India feels so confident, lets have a plebiscite right now and settle the Kashmir issue once and for all. This vote was about people wanting their own representatives in the government, it was not about rejecting the cause of freedom.        
	Lone was speaking to The Telegraph at his bungalow in north Srinagars posh Baghaat neighbourhood, where he has been under house arrest for close to two months now.         
	I am not saying people did not come out to vote on their own but if the government was so confident of popular sentiment, why did we have to be put under house arrest? My right to campaign against polls, too, is a democratic right, but not allowing Hurriyat leaders to be free, the government has resorted to invisible coercion, we have not been allowed to have our say. There were no militants around this time, no violence, why could we not have been given the right to oppose these polls peacefully?        
	Access to Lone is restricted and, at least officially, journalists arent permitted to meet him. Dont come as a pressman, Lone warned on the phone, adding good-humouredly, they will allow you to see me only if you are a friend or an enemy, you can choose what you want to meet me as.        
	Jawans posted at the high metal gates of the Lone residence duly strip you of your wares  pen, notebook, camera  and one of them politely tells you no political statements are to be recorded. This is like a jail, please bear with us, no politics.         
	There are two more metal gates to pass through before you reach Lone in his exquisitely wood-panelled study; hes in track bottoms and a Tee, wearing an oddly relaxed visage for a man incarcerated in this lonesome palace, with nobody for company but a couple of attendants and security guards.         
	Lones family  he is married to Pakistan-based JKLF chief Amanullah Khans daughter  has been in Rawalpindi for close to two years now. He has not seen his four-year-old twin sons, Amad and Adnan, for all that time because he has not been able to secure visas for them. But Ive got used to it now, its been a long time, he says, smiling. Theyve kept us gagged and bound and they call this a free and fair place.        
	Unlike a few among his Hurriyat colleagues, Lone isnt prepared to damn the Valley for spurning the boycott call but he isnt ready to accept New Delhis interpretation of the high turnout either.         
	I would gladly have taken this turnout as a slap in my face if I had been left free to have my say, you cannot proscribe me from public life and then claim victory against me, how is that free and fair?        
	Although he would not admit it openly, Lone is among those Hurriyat leaders who were beginning to lean towards participating in the election before the Amarnath land row led to this summers aazadi eruption.         
	That agitation petered out and Lone now finds himself confronted by dilemmas he cannot resolve. Should he have taken the plunge and participated? Has estranged sister Shabnam Lone, who contested as an Independent from the familys Kupwara homestead, stolen a march over him? Is he wasting himself and his time in the Hurriyat, a flexible dove suffocating among the hawks?         
	Lone isnt offering any answers, and that could be because he himself does not know.         
	He inhabits all the discomfitures of no-mans land  the Hurriyat thinks he is too much of a softie and could join the mainstream any moment, the government keeps him blackballed as an untrustworthy secessionist. His own ranks, he senses, may be slowly deserting him  Kupwara defied his boycott call to post a 62 per cent vote.        
	I wont talk too far into the future, he says, skirting questions he isnt able to countenance yet. What I can tell you is that there is a problem here and it will stay beyond these elections. The Kashmir issue needs a resolution, India, Pakistan and Kashmir will have to work a way out.        
	Is joint sovereignty, proposed by the PDP, an option? Lone reacts with angry rejection. We Kashmiris are human beings, not animals, to be monitored by India and Pakistan, we can take care of our own destiny. I have already given a proposal document to the Prime Minister which envisages self-rule on all issues but a few, I think it is a workable idea, but people have to sit down and discuss it, both India and Pakistan have to be statesmanlike about it, they have to grant us our dignity, but are they prepared?         
	His arms are splayed in helplessness; he makes, in that gesture, an apt picture of himself.

                                                                                                           Cops scramble for hijack puzzle clues
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Feb. 13: Police have cast their net wide in search of Ulfa members, hideouts and clues to piece together the hijack puzzle thrown at them by an arrested militant.         
	Raids are being simultaneously conducted in Kamrup, Baksa, Barpeta, Nalbari and Dhubri districts, a senior police official said today.         
	He also revealed that investigators got wind of a possible hijack conspiracy even before Manoj Tamuli made the sensational disclosure about a Deccan staffers alleged involvement in the plan.         
	One of Ulfas arms and bomb carriers, Pingle Deka, told Barpeta police after his arrest early this month that he had been asked to rent a house near the Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport.         
	Dekas arrest on February 5  he was caught while handing 10kg of explosives to an Ulfa member, Dipwan Barman, at Simlaguri in Barpeta  and his confession led the city police to Tamuly on Saturday.         
	Based on Tamulys statements, the police picked up Deccan customer care executive Sumanta Dutta and Peoples Consultative Group member Lachit Bordoloi on Monday.         
	The official said Dekas confessions tallied with what Tamuly told interrogators later. He said his Ulfa bosses asked him to stay near the airport masquerading as an auto driver. He was given Rs 40,000 to purchase a used autorickshaw.         
	Tamuli would visit Deka often in the house he rented near the airport, but the arms carrier was unaware why he had been asked to stay near the airport.         
	Deka also told the police that an Ulfa member handed him a huge quantity of explosives in January. The consignment was delivered to him in three instalments in the span of 10 days. Their meeting place was Anuradha cinema, the official said.        
	The police are now on the trail of the Ulfa member who handed the explosives to Deka and everyone else in touch with him during that period.         
	The official said Deka was in contact with the commander of Ulfas 709 Battalion, Hira Sarania, till his arrest.        
	Another member of the investigation team admitted that there were grey areas in Tamulis statements that needed to be corroborated through other sources.         
	One of the unsubstantiated disclosures that Tamuli made was that he, Sumanta and another Ulfa member visited New Delhi in November for a meeting with militant leader Sashadhar Choudhury. On being asked exactly when, the militant said he could not recall the date.        
	The Peoples Committee for Peace Initiatives in Assam today staged a demonstration in the city, demanding Bordolois unconditional release.

        PTI                            Gautam Gambhir (PTI)				                                             
	Oct. 31: Indian batsman Gautam Gambhir has been banned for one Test for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the third Test against Australia in New Delhi.  
	Gambhir could have been charged under a stronger code according to the rules, a lighter sentence was decided upon as umpires Billy Bowden and Aleem Dar had highlighted the provocation by Watson. Gambhir's punishment was decided after taking into account his past disciplinary record.  
	 quot;The ICC has repeatedly told the players that deliberate physical contact between players will not be tolerated. I have also taken into account the previous offences of Gambhir and therefore, I am satisfied that the penalty imposed is an appropriate outcome in the circumstances of this matter. I hope Mr Gambhir will learn from this, rdquo; match referee Chris Broad said.  
								 Present at the hearing was Gambhir himself, Broad, umpires Bowden and Dar, third umpire Suresh Shastri and fourth umpire Sameer Bandekar, India coach Gary Kirsten and captain Anil Kumble.  
	 The penalty for a Level 2 offence is a fine of between 50 and 100 per cent of the player's match fee or a maximum ban of one Test match or two ODIs.  
	 For Level 2 offences players have the right to appeal against an adjudicator's decision within 24 hours of notification of that decision.  
	The ban, if not overturned, rules the Indian opener out of the fourth and the final Test match of the series, to be played in Nagpur on 6th November.

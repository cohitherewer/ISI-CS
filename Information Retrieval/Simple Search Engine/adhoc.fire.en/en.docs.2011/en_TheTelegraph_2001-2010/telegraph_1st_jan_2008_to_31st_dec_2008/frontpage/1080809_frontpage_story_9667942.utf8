	Giridih/Bokaro, Aug. 8: Naxalites killed two CRPF jawans of the 26th battalion in an ambush at Nimiaghat in Giridih around midnight yesterday.        
	The rebels, who were observing a 24-hour north Chhotanagpur bandh yesterday to protest the death of their comrades in police action, fired upon a police patrol team that had been tipped about Maoist activities in the area.        
	The deceased, Vijendra Singh (31) from Haryana and Ram Singh Dhani (43) from Uttarakhand, were given a martyrs salute today at the 26th CRPF headquarters in Chas, Bokaro, by inspector-general of police (coalbelt) B.B. Pradhan.        
	Sources said after getting information that more than 60 Maoists in military outfits would cross the GT Road (NH-2) at Laxman More from the north, two CRPF teams had been formed at 11.40pm to challenge the rebels.        
	But to their surprise, the Maoists arrived around 10.30pm from the south of Laxman More and attacked the policemen, killing two. While Ram died on the spot, Vijendra succumbed to his injuries on way to Dhanbad.        
	Though the policemen retaliated in kind during the over 45-minute encounter, the rebels escaped leaving behind walkie-talkies, medicines, Maoist literature and other equipment.        
	Nimiaghat police have registered cases against 56 Maoists  16 named and 40 unnamed. Those accused also includes Navin Manjhi, one of the self-styled Maoist area commanders. Giridih superintendent of police Murari Lal Meena confirmed the death of two policemen but refused to say more.        
	CRPF DIG Alok Raj, however, said they would not be beaten. This was a desperate move of the Maoists who will have to pay a heavy price for their misdeeds in the coming days, he said.

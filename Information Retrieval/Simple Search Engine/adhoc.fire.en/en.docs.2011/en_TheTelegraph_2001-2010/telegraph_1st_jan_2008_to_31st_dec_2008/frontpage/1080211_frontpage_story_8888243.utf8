                                                                                                        Teen jumps to death
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 10: A teenaged college student today jumped to his death off one of the citys tallest points  the terrace of the 21-storey Hiland Park building where he lived.        
	Debarpan Guha, 19, had been scolded by his father for refusing to break off his relationship with a girl, police said hours after the tragedy on the citys southeastern fringes.        
	There had been altercations between father and son over the past few days on the subject. He was scolded today, and this seems to have driven him to suicide, South 24-Parganas police chief Praveen Kumar said.        
	Officers said Debarpans father was a senior official with a Calcutta-based paint company. Neither he nor his wife had had any premonition when the first-year student stormed out of the flat after the afternoon showdown and headed for the terrace.        
	The terrace was a favourite spot with Debarpan, and the parents thought he had gone there to cool off.        
	Around 4.30pm, the security guards heard a thud from the buildings rear. They found the body on a patch of land overgrown with weeds and shrubs.        
	Debarpan was taken to Peerless Nursing Home, off the E.M. Bypass, where he was declared dead on arrival. The body has been sent for post-mortem.        
	The parents were too traumatised to speak and the police waited late into the night to get their statements.

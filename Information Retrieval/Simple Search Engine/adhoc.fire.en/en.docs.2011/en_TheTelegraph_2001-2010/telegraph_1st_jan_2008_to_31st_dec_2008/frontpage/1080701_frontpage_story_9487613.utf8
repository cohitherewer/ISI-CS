   - Fearing Mulayam-UPA pact, CPM draws G8 line to pull trigger           MANINI CHATTERJEE                                                    
	New Delhi, June 30: A day after threatening withdrawal of support if the Manmohan Singh government goes ahead with the next steps of the Indo-US nuclear agreement, Left leaders today informally discussed the timing of the withdrawal and hinted that the final break could come within a matter of days rather than weeks.        
	If the Prime Minister decides to attend the G8 summit, it will be a clear signal that the government is going ahead with the deal and we will then work out our own timetable, top CPM sources told The Telegraph today, indicating that the Left was no longer willing to just wait and watch but was out to exert pressure to force the government to take a decision quickly either way.        
	The link between the G8 summit  being held in Japan from July 7 to 9  and the Indo-US nuclear deal may seem a little stretched but the Left holds the Prime Minister responsible for the linkage in the first place.        
	According to Left sources, it was the Prime Minister who precipitated the latest round of crisis over the nuclear deal because he wanted a clear assurance from his party leadership that the government would be allowed to go ahead with the nuclear deal before he left for Japan.        
	The Prime Minister, they say, argued that he could not face the world (or meet President George W. Bush with whom he is scheduled to have a one-on-one on the sidelines of the summit) without getting a green signal that India would go ahead to the IAEA regardless of the Lefts veto.        
	Therefore, if he goes to the G8 summit, it will mean the government has decided to proceed with the deal and we will then have to ensure how to time our withdrawal accordingly, the sources said.        
	The latest pressure tactic reflects the bitterness and acrimony that is rapidly creeping into the Congress-Left discourse ahead of their formal divorce, insiders in both camps concede. After the June 25 meeting, there has been no talks between the two sides and there is no trust left between us either, a senior CPM leader said.        
	The Prime Minister, on his part, broke his silence on the looming crisis today but made it worse by claiming there was no crisis at all.         
	In a soft-spoken snub to the Left, Singh told a group of senior journalists at his residence this morning that there is nothing new in what the Left parties have said. I have not given up hope still.         
	Given that the CPM politburo had formally talked of withdrawal of support for the first time since the nuclear deal face-off began last July, the Prime Ministers dismissive attitude to their threat was all the more galling to the CPM top brass.        
	Seemingly unmoved by the possibility of losing his government for the sake of the deal, the Prime Minister iterated his oft-stated position that all he wanted was to complete the process of negotiations through all the stages like the IAEA and NSG and then come to Parliament before I proceed to operationalise (the deal).        
	His comments showed that there had not been an iota of change in the stands of the Left and the government despite nine rounds of talks at the joint committee set up last August to iron out differences of perceptions over the deal.        
	As far as the government is concerned, operationalisation takes place only after all stages of the deal  the IAEA safeguards agreement, NSG waiver, and the US Congress ratification of the 123 Agreement  are clinched and it comes back to India for a formal signature.        
	For the Left, operationalisation begins not at the end of the process but at the beginning. The Left has consistently argued that once India signs a safeguards agreement with the IAEA, it will have no active role to play.         
	The US will then shepherd the deal to secure a clean exemption from the Nuclear Suppliers Group and once that is secured, it will come up before the US Congress.        
	The Prime Ministers nonchalant response to the Lefts withdrawal threat and insistence on going ahead with the next steps, therefore, have only widened the chasm between his government and its Left allies.        
	One reason for the Prime Ministers nonchalance (echoed by Congress party managers of late), Left leaders feel, is the growing confidence that the government would survive a trust vote with the help of the Samajwadi Party and smaller outfits, including even some NDA allies such as the Shiv Sena which has openly backed the nuclear deal.        
	In that case, Manmohan would be the clear winner in the protracted battle with the Left by managing to save his government as well as the deal.        
	The biggest challenge for the Left today is to prevent such a scenario. The Lefts primary purpose, sources say, was not to bring down the government but to sabotage the deal. Bringing down the government was necessary only in so far as it stopped the deal.        
	The threat to initiate the process of withdrawal if the Prime Minister goes to the G8 summit exactly a week from now is, therefore, a way of squeezing the time frame and reducing the Congresss chances of sewing up difficult political deals with the Samajwadi Party and other assorted forces which is essential for the government to survive and secure the nuclear deal.

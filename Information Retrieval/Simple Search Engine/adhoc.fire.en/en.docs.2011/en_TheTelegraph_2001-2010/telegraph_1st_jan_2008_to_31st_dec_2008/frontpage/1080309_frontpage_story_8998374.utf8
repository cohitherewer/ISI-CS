  - Homeopath dedicates 100 poems to master blaster          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                            Sharma with his book. Telegraph picture                                        
	New Delhi, March 8: As Sachin Tendulkar flicked Lankan pacer Chaminda Vaas for a single to become Test crickets most prolific centurion, another young man decided in the fading light of the Kotla to script his own hundred.        
	That was late in the afternoon of December 10, 2005.         
	Within a month, homeopath Madan Mohan Sharma had crafted his ton. If Sunil Gavaskar had a calypso penned after him, Sharmas ode to Sachin had a hundred poems dedicated to the master blaster whose 35th century broke the original little masters record of 34.        
	All, without ever meeting the champion.         
	Googly ho ya swing, cutter; bahut tej aapki nazar; maarte chauka gap dekh kar... (whether the ball is a googly, swinging or a cutter, you follow the ball sharply and strike it away for a boundary through the gap), says one of the poems.        
	Its my ode to Sachin Tendulkar. What he has given to the country is incomparable, says Sharma, 33, a year younger than his hero, their birthdays separated by a day.         
	From Sachins debut tour of Pakistan (1989-90) through his successes and injuries to the records he now holds, Sharmas hundred poems are full of details that mark the passion of an ardent Indian cricket fan.         
	In another poem, Sharma refers to Sir Donald Bradmans comment that Sachin had a batting style similar to his own.         
	1998 mein Sachin ko ghar bulaya, 90 ke ho chuke Bradman ne unhe gale lagaya (In 1998, he called Sachin home and the 90-year-old Bradman hugged him), Sharma writes.         
	But Sharma claims it is Sachins humility and simplicity that have touched him the most.         
	When you see him with his wife Anjali or daughter Sara, you can immediately recognise the love in his eyes, he says, explaining Honhaar Pati (dutiful husband) and Beti Sara (daughter Sara).         
	Although an entire poem talks of the controversy that engulfed Sachin when he reportedly sought import duty exemption for a Ferrari, Sharma maintains his hero is without blemish.        
	How many cricketers can play for India for 18 years without any black mark against their name? he asks.         
	The association between cricket and poetry goes back to at least the 19th century, when Francis Thompson wrote At Lords in celebration of the historic British ground.         
	But it is the Gavaskar Calypso that remains entrenched in the minds of Indian cricket followers.        
	Written in 1970-71 by Lord Relator (born William Harris), the Calypso describes Gavaskar, on his debut tour of the then fearsome West Indies, as a wall standing up to the onslaught of the host teams pace battery.        
	It was Gavaskar, the real master; just like a wall, you couldnt get Gavaskar out at all, the words go.        
	Some cricket historians say the title of little master, often used to refer to Gavaskar, originates from this Calypso.        
	Sharma says he stayed up nights  his clinic in east Delhi took all his time during the day  to pen the 100 poems.        
	But though he finished writing the poems within a month, he couldnt find a publisher.        
	He finally did after a long struggle and the book  Sachin Tujhe Salaam (Sachin, a salute to you)  was published late last year by the Delhi-based Bal Sahitya Prakashan, run by another die-hard Sachin fan.        
	I was not sure whether this book would succeed. But Sharmas passion convinced me. Besides, I too believe such a book on Sachin was needed, says 70-year-old Narayan Dutt Mishra, who runs the 50-year-old publishing house.        
	Two years after he had finished writing the poems, Sharma was back at the Kotla on Thursday to welcome a victorious Team India back from Australia, anxious to finally meet his hero.         
	Ever since I wrote the book, I wanted to meet Sachin, just to give a copy to him. But it has proved impossible for me, he says. But Im still optimistic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Deal on simmer, Rice cold 
                                                                                                           Deal on simmer, Rice cold 
  - US security adviser cancels meet in snub to Pranab           K.P. NAYAR                            Rice with US national security adviser Stephen Hadley who cancelled his meeting with Mukherjee                                        
	Washington, March 26: The Manmohan Singh government is reconciled to leaving the operationalisation of the controversial nuclear deal to the next government in India and a new US administration that will assume office next year.        
	This became clear at the end of foreign minister Pranab Mukherjees visit to Washington which concluded yesterday.        
	Although Mukherjee was in the US from Sunday morning till Tuesday night, he made no effort to contact a single member of Americas House of Representatives or the Senate during his stay. Officially, he gave the excuse that neither chamber of the US legislature was in session.         
	The House and the Senate  not the lame-duck Bush administration  hold the key to operationalising the deal since they have to ratify the 123 Agreement concluded by India and the US last year.        
	New Delhis inability to go forward with the nuclear agreement at the moment, conveyed by the visiting minister to President George W. Bush and his secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, was received by them with a sense of anticipated resignation.        
	According to sources familiar with the atmospherics at the high-level talks, Bush took the news in his usual stride, but Rice responded with a mixture of icy cool and correct warmth.        
	Known for her steely will and Kremlinesque manipulations, Rice was both hot and cold on Mukherjee as part of an effort to show disdain towards a set up in New Delhi that America views as looking a gift horse in the mouth, and at the same time calculated to retain and expand Washingtons stake in Indias economy and strategy.         
	In what is seen as the most pointed sign of US displeasure towards the UPA government for its procrastination on the nuclear deal, national security adviser Stephen Hadley cancelled his meeting with Mukherjee after the Indian minister arrived in his office. The meeting with Mukherjee was slotted on Hadleys calendar from 3.05pm to 3.25pm on Tuesday and when Mukherjee arrived with three Indian officials, the US national security adviser very graciously received them.        
	But instead of sitting down in his chamber for the formal meeting, Hadley escorted the four men to their surprise to meet Bush. The session with Bush was to follow the talks with Hadley, according to the ministers itinerary worked out between the two governments.         
	All of Tuesday morning, until reporters showed up for a scheduled end-visit news conference, Mukherjee sat in his hotel suite with nothing to do.         
	The previous night, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon abruptly cut short his stay in Washington and returned to India. Originally, he was to stay beyond Mukherjees visit and return on Wednesday.         
	As a result, a string of appointments for Indian officials was cancelled. These included a breakfast with Dan Freid, the successor pro tem to R. Nicholas Burns as undersecretary of state for political affairs, a lunch with Paula J. Dobriansky, undersecretary of state for global affairs, and two meetings which would have had a crucial bearing on the Indo-US strategic agenda.        
	Of the last two cancelled meetings, one was to have been with Mario Mancuso, undersecretary of commerce and head of the bureau of industry and security, which controls Americas trade in technology and material for dual civilian and military use. The other cancelled meeting was with Bud Albright, the undersecretary in the energy department, which has a say in issues of nuclear energy.         
	The overall impression as a result of all this snafu was eerily reminiscent of Mukherjees recent visit to Russia when appointments were cancelled and the minister was frisked at Moscow airport.         
	Of all the cancellations, the most glaring was an aborted dinner on Tuesday that Menon was scheduled to have with Burns, who is acknowledged as the architect of the structural details of the nuclear deal. Burns left the state department a few weeks ago, but was asked by Rice to continue to handle the deal with India. The absence of a meeting between Burns and the Indians was emblematic of state of the star-crossed nuclear deal.

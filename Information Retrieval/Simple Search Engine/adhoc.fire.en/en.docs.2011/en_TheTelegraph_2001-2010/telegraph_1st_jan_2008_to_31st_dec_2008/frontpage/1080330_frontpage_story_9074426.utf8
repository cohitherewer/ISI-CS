The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Torch in hand, Tibet on lips
                                                                                                           Torch in hand, Tibet on lips
          AMIT ROY                             Konnie Huq                                  
	London, March 29: Britains best known Bangladeshi television presenter-cum-celebrity, Konnie Huq, has decided to be a torch bearer for the Olympic flame in London on April 6, after all, although she condemned the Chinese repression of Tibetan protestors as despicable.         
	She had earlier indicated she was considering boycotting the event.         
	Konnie will be one of a host of celebrities among the 80 torch bearers in London.         
	The Free Tibet Campaign is, meanwhile, urging celebrities the world over to pull out, as it has done, for example, with Aamir Khan in India.         
	Anne Holmes, from the Free Tibet Campaign (UK), said: The fact that Konnie Huq is speaking out about Tibet makes the point that China cant use the Olympics as an excuse for a big coming-out party when whats going on in Tibet is beyond the pale. We hope she will say something about the Chinese torch passing through Tibet, which is now frankly obscene.         
	Holmes, who said she had heard of Aamir, preferred the Bollywood star to participate, so long as he protests by wearing a Free Tibet T-shirt or something to promote the spirit of openness or universality of man because once the torch gets to China, no protest will be allowed.         
	After wrestling with her conscience, Konnie announced today: After much consideration, I have decided to take part in this ceremony because I am committed to the Olympic ideals which reach out to people across the globe.         
	Thirtytwo-year-old Konnie has been the longest serving female presenter of Blue Peter, a popular BBC childrens television programme, having fronted it from 1997 until she stepped down earlier this year.         
	She is now trying to launch herself as a more heavyweight presenter with a corresponding grown up image  she turned up for a film premiere last year in a revealing outfit.         
	When the News of the World claimed that Playboy had offered her half a million dollars to be its centrefold, the Bangladeshi babe showed a sense of humour by claiming it was her generous proportions which were holding her back.         
	Her agent protested that she came from a conservative Muslim family but she joked (at least, people thought she was joking): Ive had offers from lads mags. I wouldnt mind, as long as it was classy and sexy. The problem is, when you have big boobs like mine, a topless photo shoot looks tacky, whereas with someone like Kate Moss, who has a flatter chest, it looks arty. Im not going to rule anything out. Id love to be a sex symbol. If youve got it, you have to use it.         
	Born Kanak Asha Huq in Britain to parents who arrived from Bangladesh, Konnie and her elder sister, Rupa, a Labour party activist, have successfully confounded the stereotype that all Bangladeshis originate from Sylhet and work long hours in Indian restaurants  both girls are academic high flyers who were educated at Cambridge.         
	As a Blue Peter presenter, she was filmed meeting her numerous relatives in Bangladesh, while in India she has danced on the set of a Bollywood film.         
	In her personal life, she was the long-time girlfriend of fellow Blue Peter presenter Richard Bacon but he announced in August, 2006, that they had split up. Konnie also has green admirers because she tends to use her cycle in London.         
	Konnie today explained her change of heart over the boycott: I am also carrying the torch for London 2012 which I believe will be an event which will enhance the lives of everyone in the capital as well as encapsulating all the true Olympian values.         
	She added: My participation does not in any way indicate support for the harsh and oppressive manner in which the Chinese regime continues to treat the people of Tibet and which I find despicable.         
	Earlier she had said she would consider wearing a Free Tibet T-shirt if she ran.         
	She had hinted at a possible boycott: China has a lot to answer for and Ive been struggling with it. Obviously I condemn what theyre doing. Im definitely wavering.         
	She had said: I think the situation is terrible, and I think that anyone who is doing the relay should speak out on their views. It would be embarrassing for China if anyone taking part took a stand but still ran.         
	Tibet has now become a big issue, especially among the young.         
	Earlier this week Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, declared he would attend the Olympics, but the visiting French president, Nicholas Sarkozy, said he was keeping his options open.

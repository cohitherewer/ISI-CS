                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Shibu Soren has his task cut out

	Political crisis isnt new to Jharkhand. The Telegraph answers some of the questions the impasse has thrown up.              
	Now that Madhu Koda has resigned before facing the August 25 trust vote, what happens next?        
	The governor will now begin the process of exploring possibilities of forming an alternative but stable government in the state. As per convention set by former President Shankar Dayal Sharma in 1996, the largest party, in this case the BJP with 29 MLAs, should be invited to form the government. But, the BJP-led coalition has gone on record saying it isnt interested in forming an alternative government.        
	How many MLAs are needed to form a majority government in Jharkhand?         
	The effective strength of the House is 81 and any ruling combine would need 42 MLAs.         
	Can the governor invite the JMM to form a government?        
	Nothing stops the governor from inviting the second largest party in the House, in this case the JMM with 17 MLAs, to form the next government. But he needs to be convinced that the JMM and its supporters can provide a stable government.        
	What if the JMM stakes claim to form the government?         
	The governor would assess its strength to form a stable government on the basis of letters of support from the JMMs UPA allies like the Congress, RJD and the two BJP rebels and Independents if they agree to back it. If he is convinced, the leader of the combine may be invited to form a government, but he will have to face a trust vote in the House.         
	Could the two BJP rebels pose a problem for the UPA?        
	Yes. One hitch for the UPA could be the governor refusing to accept the support of the two BJP rebels. For, although the Constitution is silent on this, the governor is expected to abide by the law, which says legislators cannot switch sides at will. There are at least two examples of the governor questioning the Speakers action under the Xth Schedule of the Constitution (anti-defection law).         
	First, the governor did not accept the decision of the Nagaland Speaker in 1988 when he recognised the split in the NPCC (I). Second, in Mizoram the governor asked the Speaker to clarify the constitutional points behind his action of issuing showcause notices to nine members of the Mizo National Front and suspending them from the House.        
	If the UPA, that is the JMM and its supporters, elect Shibu Soren as their leader, can he become chief minister given that he is not a member of the Assembly?         
	Yes, he can. Under Article 164 (4), he has six months time to be elected to the state Assembly.         
	Will Soren then have to face a trust vote?        
	Yes.         
	What if the governor feels that Soren would not be able to provide a stable government?         
	Since the term of the Assembly is till February 2010, the governor may recommend suspension of the House and imposition of Presidents Rule for, say, four months. During that period, there could be political realignments and Soren or anyone else may then be in a position to form a stable government.         
	For how long can Jharkhand remain under Presidents Rule?        
	Six months. If by then, a government cannot be formed, the Centre will then recommend fresh elections in the state.

	Calcutta/Delhi, Jan. 29: Bengals bird-flu warriors have rolled out the red carpet for the galloping virus.
    
	Not to welcome but to weed out.
    
	Travellers on the Salt Lake bypass were today greeted with a foot bath  a carpet of jute treated with 90 per cent lime and 10 per cent bleaching power  said to be an effective disinfectant.
    
	It is considered one of the most widely used tools to prevent spread of infection among poultry, said an officer with the animal resource department.
    
	The idea of a foot bath welcome for vehicles plying through North 24-Parganas came up at a meeting last Sunday at district headquarters Barasat. District magistrate Prabhat Mishra chaired the meeting, attended by civic chiefs of all municipalities.
    
	We have seen trucks from South 24-Parganas take this road to enter our district. They go to Barasat via the Salt Lake bypass and enter Rajarhat New Town. Tyres will roll over the carpets and be disinfected, said sub-divisional officer Tapas Chowdhury.
    
	Other areas where foot baths have been placed are Rajberia on National Highway 34 under Amdanga police station, Belghoria Expressway, Ghujadanga at Bongaon and Joinpur near Kalyani Highway.
    
	Microbiologists, however, said just a carpet of bleach wasnt enough as the deadly H5N1 virus, which has wreaked havoc in over a dozen districts, might still sneak in.
    
	Satish Batra, a veterinary microbiologist at Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, said a foot bath would inactivate any virus that might be on the tyres. But all parts of the vehicle should be cleaned with bleach.
    
	Studies on the H5N1 strain have shown that the virus can survive for up to six days in faecal samples of poultry at 37 degrees Celsius. The lower the temperature, the longer it survives.
    
	Experts said even the shoes of people visiting bird flu-hit areas needed to be disinfected.

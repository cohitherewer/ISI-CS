          K.P. NAYAR                             Bush: Job not over                                  
	Washington, Oct. 18: The Indo-US nuclear deal will not be operationalised until the White House formally certifies to the US Congress that the 123 Agreement signed this month is consistent with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which India has rejected.        
	Before the 123 Agreement can enter into force, President George W. Bush will also have to commit on Capitol Hill that it is the policy of his administration to work with Nuclear Suppliers Group members to further restrict transfers of equipment and technology related to uranium enrichment and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.        
	Evan Feigenbaum, deputy assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, yesterday told Indian journalists here that it is basically a bureaucratic process that was expected to be completed pretty soon.        
	But that may not be how opponents of the nuclear deal in India will view Washingtons position. They will insist that the Americans are attempting to tighten the noose on Indias nuclear programme and carrying out their consistent position that the deal is an effort to strengthen global non-proliferation and bring India more into its ambit.        
	Feigenbaum said: There are two certifications in the bill. You can read them in the bill. Those are now at the White House.        
	There will be several more steps down the bureaucratic path, however, before any actual nuclear commerce between India and the US can begin, according to the road map that Feigenbaum laid on the table yesterday.        
	For instance, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission will issue licences to nuclear power companies to export to India only after another certification that Delhis safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency has entered into force.        
	Yet another certification will require a declaration by India to the IAEA that its safeguards agreement is materially consistent with the separation plan that was announced following the nuclear deal in 2005.        
	That plan distinguishes Indias nuclear weapons programme from its civilian effort in terms of the existing nuclear reactors and the ones that are planned for the future.        
	The Indian government will also be required to sign the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, without which no US company will export to India.        
	There appears to be confidence in Washington that India and the US will exchange diplomatic notes to enter the 123 Agreement into force soon and that all other requirements to begin nuclear commerce will follow because a US commerce department-sponsored nuclear trade mission to New Delhi is being put together for December.

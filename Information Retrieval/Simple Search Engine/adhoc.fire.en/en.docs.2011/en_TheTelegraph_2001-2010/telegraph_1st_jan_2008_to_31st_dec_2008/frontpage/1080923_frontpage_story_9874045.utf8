	Calcutta, Sept. 22: A chill appears to be creeping into the relationship between governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi and Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee.        
	The governor got us to withdraw our agitation (siege of Nano factory) on false promises. He is now unable to see things our way, a Trinamul functionary today quoted Mamata as telling a few party colleagues on Sunday.        
	He (Gandhi) is a nice man but it looks like he is not in a position to appreciate the Singur issue in its entirety, the aide quoted Mamata as saying.        
	The Trinamul leaders disenchantment with Gandhi began on September 19 when she called on the governor to brief him on the Singur developments, especially on the compensation package announced by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	Although the governor, who was in Delhi, had kept himself abreast of the events related to Singur, he chose to hear her out and promised to apprise the chief minister of her concerns. What sort of disturbed her was the fact that the governor would not get judgmental on the package, a Trinamul source said.        
	Mamatas oft-professed faith in the governor was dented when in the course of another interaction, Gandhi asked her to try and find merits in the chief ministers initiative, one of the sources said. The source claimed that Gandhi conveyed to Mamata that she would not find it difficult to support the package as it was truly beneficial to the farmers.        
	In subsequent meetings or interactions over the phone with Mamata or her representatives, the governor promised to request the chief minister to improve the package as far as possible to make it easier for her to accept it.         
	If you have the right sankalp (resolve), you will see there is no dearth of bikalp (alternatives), the governor reportedly told Mamata and her aides.        
	Such suggestions have apparently not gone down well with Mamata. Ei bhadralok aamader aandolan bhenge dilo (this gentleman broke up our movement), she told a few party faithful.        
	Despite the frost, Mamata has scheduled a meeting with the governor on Wednesday to inform him of her seven-day deadline for the government to implement the agreement reached at Raj Bhavan.        
	The state government is watching the clock with growing trepidation as several states  the latest is said to be Gujarat  are wooing the Tatas. The industry minister of Karnataka, which had offered land for the Nano project, today said he was trying to arrange a meeting with Ratan Tata.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                            Sonia, Laura                                 
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: Sonia Gandhi has turned down Laura Bushs invitation to a literacy conference that is days ahead of the Prime Ministers September-end visit to the US.        
	Sources said the UPA chairperson had cited domestic reasons for her inability to attend the Symposium for Advancing Global Literacy, organised by the White House to coincide with the UN General Assembly.        
	The literacy conference will be held in New Yorks Metropolitan Museum of Art on September 21 and 22. Prime Minister Singh is expected to sign the 123 Agreement for Civil Nuclear Cooperation between India and the US on September 26.        
	The Centre has decided to send junior HRD minister D. Purandeswari in place of Sonia. Purandeswari, invited by the US First Lady after Sonias refusal, is leaving for the US tomorrow.        
	Sources said Sonia may have turned down the invite to balance perceptions of critics about the governments growing proximity to the US.        
	Indo-US relations are at a critical juncture. Sometimes, maintaining some distance helps in building long-term friendship, a source said.        
	Or Sonia may have been concerned that a visit by her would rub some of the sheen off the Prime Ministers visit, the source said.        
	This will be the second edition of the literacy symposium, initiated by Laura in 2006. President George W. Bush had attended the first edition. Laura is an honorary ambassador for the UN Literacy Decade 2003 to 2012.         
	In 2006, the White House had stated that the initiative was a result of Lauras travels across the world, which had given her an insight into education and literacy programmes.         
	Last November, India had invited Laura to a Unicef regional conference in New Delhi. Laura did not come, but sent a recorded video message that was played at the meet, where Sonia was chief guest.         
	Sources hinted Purandeswari may similarly carry a message from Sonia.

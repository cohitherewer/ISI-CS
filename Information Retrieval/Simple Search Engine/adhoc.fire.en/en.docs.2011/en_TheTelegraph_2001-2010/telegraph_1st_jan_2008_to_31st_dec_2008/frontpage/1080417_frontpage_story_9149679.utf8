The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Torch draws the line for PMO staff
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Torch draws the line for PMO staff
  - Security blanket cast wide over seat of power before Olympic relay          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                                    
	New Delhi, April 16: Security for the Olympic torch relay tomorrow will not spare even Indias seat of power: the Prime Ministers Office.        
	All windows and doors of all buildings opening towards Rajpath must be closed between 1pm and 6pm, a home ministry circular issued today said.         
	Staff from South Block, which houses the PMO and the defence ministry, and North Block, which houses the finance and home ministries, will not be allowed to cross the road during that time. The two blocks are on either side of Rajpath. I have never heard such a thing before, said an employee of North Block.         
	Others were shocked at instructions like this one: It must be ensured that no smoke is allowed to emanate from these buildings on 17.4.2008. Incinerators for destruction of waste paper will not be allowed to operate on Thursday.         
	The torch landed in Delhi late tonight but Tibetan protesters blocked a road in a bid to prevent its entry into the city.        
	Under intense pressure from China to shield the torch from Tibetan protesters, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has even refused to announce the schedule for the relay, which suffered another blow today when Sachin Tendulkar dropped out. (See Sport)         
	IOA president Suresh Kalmadi told reporters he did not know when the torch would arrive in India or where it would be kept, and did not take questions on the schedule.         
	However, the internal home ministry circular revealed the relay would be held between 3pm and 6pm from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.         
	Some 15,000 policemen  including personnel of the ITBP, the CRPF, the CISF and the Sikkim IRB  will be deployed in what appears to be one of the most elaborate security exercises the capital has seen in Independent India. Delhi police have divided the 2.3km stretch, including Rajghat, into 14 wards. Each ward will be in the charge of a deputy commissioner of police. The policemen will be deployed in an organised command structure to prevent any intrusion on the path of the torch, sources said.         
	A helicopter will provide air support. On the ground, anti-riot vehicles and water cannons will be at hand.        
	But Tibetan protesters, who again managed to reach the Chinese embassy this morning, have promised surprises.        
	The police have allowed a parallel Olympic run organised by the Tibetan Solidarity Committee tomorrow but have told the protesters not to carry a torch. Sources said they will manage to carry one.         
	We will have some surprises tomorrow, so watch out, a senior Tibetan Youth Congress leader said, as the activists readied for a night-long siege at the Indira Gandhi international airport where the torch is expected to arrive from Islamabad around midnight.        
	Given the security and the secrecy, it is unlikely there will be many spectators to cheer the celebrities as they run. But Kalmadi insisted: We have taken only normal security measures. People can watch from the lawns.        
	Bollywood will be represented by Aamir Khan and Saif Ali Khan at the relay. Sports minister M.S. Gill had said he would rather that actors and politicians leave the run to sportspersons, a suggestion Amitabh Bachchan did not take kindly to. He is the sports minister. Who will dare to argue with him? They are the government.

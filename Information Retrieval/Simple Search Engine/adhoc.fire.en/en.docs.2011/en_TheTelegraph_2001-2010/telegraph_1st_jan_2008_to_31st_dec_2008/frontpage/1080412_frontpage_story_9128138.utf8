	Ranchi, April 11: The Congress deployed two of its tribal ministers in the Union Cabinet  P.R. Kyndiah and his deputy Rameshwar Oraon in Jharkhand to counter the furious outbursts of JMM chief Shibu Soren upset at being denied a berth at the Centre.        
	Though Oraon tried to underplay the fissures in the UPA coalition, Kyndiah went on the offensive against the Madhu Koda government for neglecting tribal welfare as evident from the poor utilisation of funds.        
	Being projected as the Congresss face in Jharkhand, Oraon said he would not confine his activities to the welfare of tribals. I am there for every section of society and not for tribals alone, he said.         
	Denying that the high command had sent them to counter Soren, Oraon said no one had questioned his status as a tribal leader of Jharkhand. Inclusion in the Cabinet is the Prime Ministers prerogative. He said coalition politics had come to stay. I have not been sent to counter Soren. The Congress leadership has never declared that it wanted to go it alone. Soren has been our long-time partner. It is not a new friendship, Oraon told The Telegraph.         
	But if Oraon tried to underplay the tension within the UPA, Balmuchu didnt mince his words. It was after a long spell that the Congress has appointed a tribal as a minister at the Centre. Now, we will not beg for a reply when we go to the electorate, he insisted.         
	Kyndiah castigated the state government for the poor utilisation of tribal development funds and detailed his partys contribution to the development of tribals  he cited the recent Tribal Forests Act.        
	Amid the offensive from the visitors, the JMM-Congress spat continued locally. The Congress issued a point-by-point rebuttal to JMMs posers to Ajay Maken questioning his authority to interfere in the state UPA.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 29: Former inspector-general of police (IG) Anadi Sahu today demanded a CBI probe into the Biranchi Das murder alleging that the Orissa police were delaying action and were being shackled by the presence of top bureaucrats in the case.         
	The manner in which IAS officer Priyabrata Patnaik was let off by the police commissionerate points an accusing finger at the agency, said Sahu, a former Lok Sabha MP from Cuttack and an NCP leader.         
	In his media statement today, the former IG also demanded that the workings of the Buddhia Singh Trust and Bhubaneswar Club be brought under the CBI probe purview.         
	For now, an investigating team of Orissa police, headed by additional-commissioner of police Y.B. Khurania, is probing into the murder.         
	Yesterday, senior IAS officer Priyabrata Patnaik was interrogated for two hours at the police commissionerate.         
	Previously, he (Priyabrata Patnaik) had denied meeting Raja Acharya. But, in his police statements yesterday, as indicated in the media, he has conceded that he had met Raja through Biranchi for the Leslie Tripathy affair, said the former IG.        
	The government today divested the official responsibilities of Patnaik in the wake of allegations that he was involved in the Biranchi murder.        
	The officer had conceded that he met the gangster on one or two occasions at Bhubaneswar Club and admitted that he had intervened in the Leslie Tripathy affair. Why was an IAS officer so concerned about an album actress? This is for the police to investigate, he added.         
	Previously, while Raja Acharya, in a television interview, had alleged that Patnaik had threatened him, his close aide, Chagala, had named the IAS officer as a conspirator.         
	Patnaik, who is the president of the judo association set up by Biranchi Das, is also a part of the trust meant for wunderkid Buddhia Singh.         
	Biranchi Das, as secretary of the association, was the managing trustee. In December 2007, Buddhias mother, Sukanti Singh, had filed an FIR against Biranchi Das at Bargarh police station (Bhubaneswar) accusing him of misappropriation of trust Funds.         
	She had alleged that Biranchi had embezzled funds meant for Buddhia. The trust fund reportedly runs into crores of rupees.

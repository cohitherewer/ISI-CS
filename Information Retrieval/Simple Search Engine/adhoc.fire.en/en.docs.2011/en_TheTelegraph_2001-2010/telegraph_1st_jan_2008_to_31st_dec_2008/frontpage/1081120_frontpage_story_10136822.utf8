The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maidens out, music in at ODI
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Maidens out, music in at ODI
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                            Cheerleaders during an IPL match at Eden Gardens in Calcutta                                   
	Cuttack, Nov. 19: Cricket fans in Orissa wont get to dance to the tune of cheerleaders, but Freddie Flintoff and his band had better prepare to face the music.        
	Not chin music, as the Aussies say, or spin music, which is more up Indias street, but real music.        
	The Orissa Cricket Association has dropped plans of bringing in cheerleaders for the fifth India-England ODI at Barabati Stadium next Wednesday and instead decided to play popular local numbers for the entertainment of spectators.        
	A state-of-the-art music system will be used for additional entertainment of the spectators during cheering moments, such as hitting of fours and sixes or falling of wickets, OCA secretary Ashirvad Behera said.        
	The association had initially planned to bring Twenty-20 flavour to the 50:50 format of the game by introducing cheerleaders.        
	Behera said the association had arranged for local Odissi dancers and folk dancers to appear as cheerleaders in traditional costumes, not skimpy skirts, which had outraged sensitivities of several politicians during the Indian Premier League earlier this year.        
	The IPL girls were later told to cover up, lest the bawdy debate dealt a body blow to the league.         
	We dropped the plan after getting indications that cheering girls would not be allowed by the match referee, Behera said today.        
	The plan had been taken up with the Indian cricket board and, sources said, the BCCI, apparently, had no objections.         
	But it also indicated that nothing could be said for sure as it all depended on Sri Lankan match referee Roshan Mahanamas point of view, Behera said.         
	In fact, the BCCI advised us to wait for the match referees permission. Since the match referee would not be available before November 25, we thought it would be wise to drop the plan, he added.         
	After all the preparations, a no from the match referee on the penultimate day would have amounted to loss of face.        
	Even if the match referee had given his nod, some fans feel cheerleaders may not have drawn crowds.        
	Scantily clad cheerleaders would be in bad taste. There is nothing unacceptable about sari-clad cheering girls. But it may not be a sure formula to woo spectators, said Saumendra Mishra, a cricket enthusiast.         
	So, play it by the ear.        
	Behera said the music would have a regional touch. It will be restricted to popular Oriya numbers.        
	The list, he added, had not been finalised. But we will have 10 popular Oriya numbers. They will include Sambalpuri folk numbers like Rangabati Rangabati and Oriya film songs, and a few hits of popular singer Akhaya Mohanty.        
	The cricket association, however, seemed out of tune with fans. Music may be the food of love but in cricket, its nothing but a distraction, members said.        
	Its a pointless exercise, said former Utkal University player Sanjeev Das. It is nothing but trying to entertain spectators at the cost of distracting the concentration of players.

  - Aarushis father wants to be left alone        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Aarushi                                        
	New Delhi, July 12: Rajesh Talwar stepped out of jail this morning looking haggard, hugged his tearful wife Nupur and thanked God and the CBI for vindicating him.        
	After a few words to the media whom they asked to please leave us alone, the dentist couple headed straight to the Sai Baba temple near their home in Noida.        
	Asked if he was thinking of legal action against Noida police, who had accused him of murdering his daughter Aarushi, or any section of the media, Rajesh only said: There is nothing going on in my mind.        
	This is a time of pain and suffering for us. We request all of you to leave us alone, Nupur told the media.        
	This entire episode is the biggest grief of my life. Allow me to share the grief with my family because for the last 50 days, we have not been together, Rajesh, 49, said with folded hands.        
	Rajesh, dressed in a white T-shirt, was out of the jail premises within two minutes of the gates opening at 8.30am. The formalities for his release had been completed by Nupur, Rajeshs brother Dinesh and other relatives last night after the CBI told a court it had no evidence against him.        
	Among those at the gates to receive Rajesh were another dentist couple, Anita and Praful Durrani, the Talwars friends and partners in their dental clinic. Noida police had hinted at an affair between Rajesh and Anita, citing it as a cause of bad blood between father and daughter.        
	Officers had insinuated that Rajesh had slit the throats of Aarushi, 15, and servant Hemraj, 45, on the night of May 15 after finding them in an objectionable position at their home. After his arrest on May 23, Nupur gave several TV interviews proclaiming her husbands innocence.        
	The CBI, to whom the case was handed over on May 31, yesterday said the killers were Talwars compounder Krishna, the Durranis domestic help Rajkumar, and a neighbours servant, Vijay Mandal.        
	The trio had held a binge in Hemrajs room, attacked Aarushi with intent of sexual assault and killed her, the CBI said, adding that Hemraj was murdered after a quarrel with the killers.        
	Nupur said: I thank God that finally justice has prevailed. We will go home and face the situation.

	Los Angeles, June 6: Nasas Phoenix Mars lander has captured the highest-resolution images ever taken of dust and sand on another planet.         
	The minuscule specks were collected during Phoenixs dramatic touchdown on the Red Planet over a week ago and photographed by one of the landers powerful onboard microscopes. The resolution of the images is 10 times that of previous pictures of the surface taken by Nasas Mars rovers, scientists said. We think we indeed have the first pictures showing the diversity of mineralogy on Mars at a scale that is unprecedented in planetary exploration, said Michael Hecht, of the US space agencys Jet Propulsion Laboratory.         
	Some of the tiny grains, which are not visible to the naked eye, were like the classic reddish brown Martian particle, said Prof. Tom Pike, of Imperial College London, Phoenixs geology team leader, while others were paler and pink and some translucent. Together the samples represented a wide variety of particles both in colouration and size and showed an unprecedented diversity of geology, he added.         
	Scientists, however, want to do further tests on particles they are certain come from the planets surface to rule out contamination from the lander before drawing conclusions about the Martian soil.

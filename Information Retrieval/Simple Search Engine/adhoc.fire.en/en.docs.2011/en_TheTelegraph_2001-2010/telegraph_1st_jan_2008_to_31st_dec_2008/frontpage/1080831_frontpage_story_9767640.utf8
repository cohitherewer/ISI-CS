          RIPUNJOY DAS                                     
	Dibrugarh, Aug. 30: The pro-peace group of Ulfa today indicated that a separate and small group would be set up soon to negotiate with government agencies to take the peace process initiated by it to the next level.         
	Jiten Dutta, the self-styled commander of the Alfa and Charlie companies of Ulfas 28 battalion said this to The Telegraph on the conclusion of another massive public meeting at the Chowkidingee playground in Dibrugarh.         
	The idea to form a separate core group has been mooted recently to ensure that official discussions are not hampered while the leaders of the pro-peace group remain busy with meetings and interacting with the masses.         
	It will be a small core group, of say four to five people, selected from within Ulfa that will hold discussions with various government agencies to see that the peace process moves forward at a good pace, Dutta said.         
	The pro-peace group has been organising public meetings, mostly in Upper Assam, to mobilise support for holding direct talks with the government to resolve what the outfit calls the Indo-Assam conflict.         
	Dutta said for securing a lasting peace, it was equally necessary to continue diplomatic discussions with various government agencies and, at the same time, keep informing the people directly about the progress through open meetings.         
	When asked about the threats being issued by the Ulfa leadership alleging that his group was playing dirty tactics to create division in the organisation, Dutta, once a big headache for security forces, said the group was not at all worried over this aspect.         
	We still have direct communication with our leadership, which primarily includes Ulfa president Arabinda Rajkhowa and its commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah. It seems that they are also slightly getting convinced of whatever we are doing. There will be differences of opinion, but that does not mean that we have parted ways, Dutta said.        
	The meeting was organised by, among others, the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad, All Assam Muttock Yuba Chatra Sanmelan, All Tai Ahom Students Union, All Assam Chutia Students Union and the All Assam Tea Tribe Students Association.        
	 It was presided over by Lakhi Gogoi, a senior citizen.         
	Braving inclement weather and a downpour, more than 5,000 people from various parts of the district turned up at todays meeting.         
	Dibakar Moran, another prominent leader of the outfits 28 battalion released recently from Dibrugarh Central Jail, was present at todays meeting, along with Mrinal Hazarika and Prabal Neog  former commanding officers of the 28 battalion.         
	Dutta said problems of infiltration and illegal migration needs to be dealt with logically rather than emotionally.        
	Migration, be it from Bangladesh or any other part of India, is a complex and major issue for the people of Assam; there would be no end to this issue if we keep on viewing it emotionally. We need to find concrete solutions, Dutta said.

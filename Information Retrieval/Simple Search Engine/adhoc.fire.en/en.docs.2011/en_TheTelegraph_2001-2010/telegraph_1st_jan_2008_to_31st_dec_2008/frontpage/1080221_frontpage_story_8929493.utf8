The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Protest reveals twin abductions
                                                                                                           Protest reveals twin abductions
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Imphal, Feb. 20: A couple who hold senior positions in the Manipur works and irrigation departments were abducted for ransom two days ago but, continuing a befuddling trend, their relatives chose to organise a belated protest rather than go directly to police.        
	The militant group that whisked away Ngnangbam Manglemjao Singh, an executive engineer in the works department, and his wife Shanti Devi, a section officer in the irrigation and flood control department, on their way to office on Monday has demanded Rs 1 crore in ransom.        
	The twin abductions officially came to light only when relatives and the couples neighbours at Kangla Sangomsang held a sit-in in front of the gate to the office complex where they work. The police promptly registered a suo motu case.         
	Sources said the militants, suspected to be from the Kuki Liberation Army (KLA), probably intended to abduct only Manglemjao but took Shanti hostage as well when they found her accompanying her husband to office in their personal car.        
	The KLA is one of several Kuki outfits that has an informal ceasefire agreement with security forces. Delhi and the state government are contemplating formalising the truce.        
	Manglemjaos elder sister, Priyosakhi Devi, said the sit-in this morning was meant to pressure the administration into rescuing her sibling and his wife. She did not explain why the family did not report the abductions to the police.        
	 They were going to office in their car on February 18 when the militants seized them from a place not very far from their home in Imphal East. We are holding this demonstration to demand that the works department initiate measures to secure their release, Priyosakhi Devi said.        
	It did not surprise the police that even the works department did not report the executive engineers abduction. Neither government departments nor the families of abducted officials seem keen to come to the police. I guess fear of retaliation from the abductors prevents them from approaching us.         
	He said relaying information very late meant allowing the abductors to cover their flanks. Manglemjaos family said they had yet to hear from the abductors. They received information about the twin abductions from the works department.         
	Members of the family met the chief engineer of the works department, Ng. Rastrapati, to enquire about rescue efforts. Nearly 100 protesters squatted at the main gate to the Imphal office complex where the couple work.                          
	Whatever demands have been made by the kidnappers is for the works department to fulfil. The couple is innocent. The department should make all out efforts to secure their release, one of the protesters shouted.        
	The demonstrators did not allow anyone to enter or to come out of the office complex for several hours.        
	Militants of the Umar Farooq faction of the Peoples United Liberation Front abducted Sorokhaibam Menjor, an assistant engineer of the works department, on January 28. The engineer was released unharmed a few days later.

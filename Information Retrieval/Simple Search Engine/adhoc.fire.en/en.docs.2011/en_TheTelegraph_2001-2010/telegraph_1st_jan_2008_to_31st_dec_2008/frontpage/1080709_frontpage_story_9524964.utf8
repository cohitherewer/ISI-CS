                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Clooneys ex speaks about life after George
          ANITA SINGH                            Sarah Larson and George Clooney                                  
	London, July 8: Actor George Clooney certainly knows how to stay on good terms with his exes, if a new interview with Sarah Larson is anything to go by.         
	Clooney split with the former cocktail waitress in May after a year together. But if anyone expected her to be bitter about losing her grip on Hollywoods most eligible bachelor, think again.         
	George is a great guy, a wonderful person. I dont regret spending time with him and hes a great person to get to know. We still remain friends and have kept in touch. In fact, we spoke over the phone a couple of days ago. Hes fun to be around, down to earth, laid back, funny and smart, she gushed to Hello! magazine.         
	And the Oceans Eleven star is apparently a man of hidden talents. Most people know George has a great sense of humour and is an adept storyteller, but I will always miss his extraordinary dance moves, Larson said.         
	The 29-year-old met Clooney while she worked as a waitress in a Las Vegas cocktail bar. Thanks to their relationship, however, she is now moving on to bigger and better things. I have a lot of great opportunities, doors that have opened, and I have no complaints. I make good money. I have a house. I have all the things Ive always wanted. Im in a good place, she said.         
	Ive had some amazing offers come in, including one modelling campaign that may bring me to England soon.         
	I cant talk about it yet because its not a done deal. I hope it happens because Ive never been to England and Id love to spend some time there.         
	If I do end up there I could find a nice British boy. Id be open to the idea. I hear they have a good sense of humour.         
	The full interview is in this weeks Hello! magazine.                           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

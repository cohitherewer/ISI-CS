	Colombo, Dec. 1 (AP): Sri Lankan soldiers have recaptured a key northern town near the headquarters of Tamil Tiger rebels 18 years after the area was seized by the insurgents, the military said today.        
	Troops seized Kokavil town, about 20km south of the insurgents de facto capital of Kilinochchi, yesterday, military spokesman Brig. Udaya Nanayakkara said.        
	The capture was the latest sign of the governments recent dominance in the islands decades-old civil war since it promised to defeat the insurgency by the end of the year. The rebels have been forced to abandon vast areas of land and retreat to territory in the northeast during months of heavy battles.        
	The Tamil Tigers have controlled Kokavil since they overran a military camp there in 1990, Nanayakkara said. The military has been closing in on Kilinochchi for weeks and continued its march today.         
	Air force jets bombed a village from which the Tamil Tigers have launched counterattacks on government forces attempting to break through to the rebel stronghold, the military said. It said three targets were successfully hit but did not provide casualty details.        
	Separately, army snipers killed three rebels in the northern Jaffna peninsula yesterday and today, a defence ministry statement said. Rebel officials could not be contacted for comment. It is difficult to verify battlefield reports because most journalists are barred from the war zone.

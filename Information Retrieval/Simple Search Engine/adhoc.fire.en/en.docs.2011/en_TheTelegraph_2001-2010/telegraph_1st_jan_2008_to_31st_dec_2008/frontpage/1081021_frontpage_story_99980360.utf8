About 150 protesters were detained by police and taken away from the court in western suburb of the city.  Media personnel and MNS supporters were barred from the court premises and in the process some senior journalists were allegedly manhandled by police.  rdquo;Raj Thackeray is a special man and this is a special case, rdquo; said DCP Nisar Tamboli who was heading the force movement in the area.  Raj was arrested at Ratnagiri early today in the wake of a brutal attack by MNS activists on north Indian candidates appearing in a railway recruitment exam.  A case was registered in this connection against Thackeray and his supporters at north-west suburban police station of Kharwadi.  MNS workers had attacked 13 railway board examination centres in suburban Mumbai on Sunday to protest against ldquo;inadequate representation rdquo; to locals.

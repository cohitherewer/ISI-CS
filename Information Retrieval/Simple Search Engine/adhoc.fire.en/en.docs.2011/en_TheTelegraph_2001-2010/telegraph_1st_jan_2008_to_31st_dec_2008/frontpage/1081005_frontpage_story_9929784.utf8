	Agartala, Oct. 4: Perturbed by the serial blasts that rocked the Tripura capital on Wednesday, the Union home ministry has asked the state government to check customs and immigration records of 15 suspected Bangladeshi nationals who had come to the state.         
	These Bangladeshis, suspected to be members of the terror outfit Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami (Huji), have not yet returned to their home country.We have received an urgent communiqu from the home ministry to check immigration records at Akhaura and Srimantapur checkposts in western Tripura for the suspected Bangladeshis, a police official said.         
	The official said the youths  all suspected jihadi elements had come to the state during May to September en route to other parts of the country. He said the period was taken into account as the first major blast this year took place at Jaipur on May 13. Thereafter, successive blasts occurred in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad on July 25 and 26. Two more blasts rocked Delhi on September 13 and 27. Then Agartala met with a similar fate on Wednesday.         
	Our job is to check records and furnish information to the Union home ministry. At the moment there is no other information, said the official.         
	Nabin Verma, the joint secretary in the ministry, will visit the state capital soon to take stock of the situation.        
	 Police sources said that the two NSG and two forensic officials deputed by the home ministry will furnish their reports on the blasts soon. The additional director of the Intelligence Bureau, Ajit Lal, today said the biggest challenge before the country was to tackle the issue of militants sheltered in Bangladesh, including those from the Northeast, adds our Shillong correspondent.        
	 Speaking after the inauguration of an office of subsidiary intelligence bureau (SIB) at Tura in West Garo Hills, Lal said Bangladesh had become a haven for various militant groups.The Centre is paying focal attention to the Northeast to check these disturbing trends, he added.

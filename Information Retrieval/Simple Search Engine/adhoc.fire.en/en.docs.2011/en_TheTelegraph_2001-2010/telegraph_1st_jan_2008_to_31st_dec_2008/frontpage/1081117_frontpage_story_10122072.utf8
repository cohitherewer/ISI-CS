The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | India too big for aid boots 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   India too big for aid boots 
          AMIT ROY                       Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski                          
	London, Nov. 16: India no longer merits UK government aid totalling hundreds of millions of pounds because the country should now be considered a developed nation, MPs have said during an important debate in the Commons.         
	Time was when prickly people in India complained that the BBC and others in the British media projected a distorted picture of India as an impoverished country whereas, in reality, it was making remarkable progress in science, technology and many others fields, whilst consolidating its position as the biggest democracy in the world.         
	The India Shining and Incredible India campaigns may have succeeded too well for MPs are now arguing that at a time when their own constituents are suffering because of the current economic crisis, India is no longer a priority.         
	The case against aid for India has just been summed up in the Commons by Daniel Kawczynski, the Tory MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham, who gave India a back-handed compliment: India has the largest number of billionaires in the world. It has nuclear weapons, and is experiencing huge economic expansion. Moreover, many Indian companies are currently buying up United Kingdom companies.         
	During the debate, other MPs spoke about why aid should not be given to Russia, China and Zimbabwe but the reasons here were to do either with human rights infringements or corruption. But with India, the case was made more on economic grounds.         
	The government, however, wants to continue with aid because it feels it then has more influence over the recipients.         
	The International Development Secretary, Douglas Alexander, said it was important to be able to influence such countries and have a dialogue with them.         
	In a debate on international aid transparency, Alexander defended the government and insisted that the international community must keep its promises to deliver the millennium development goals during the downturn.         
	We must keep our pledges on the quantity and quality of aid we deliver to the developing world and ensure policies to stabilise the global economy are effective in helping developing countries to tackle short-term crises and meet long-term development needs, he said.         
	But could India still be classed as a developing nation or was it now on a par with the donors and no longer strictly deserving of the money that should more properly go to much poorer societies?         
	Philip Hollobone, Tory MP for Kettering, said that while his constituents were supportive of development aid, they were concerned about hundreds of millions of pounds worth of aid going to countries which had nuclear weapons and international space programmes  like India and China.         
	Why is this country giving 72 million this year to China and 370 million to India when they are spending billions on nuclear weapons and international space research? he demanded.         
	Stephen Crabb, the Tory MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire, said: Other members may not share my experience, but I am no longer receiving any letters or emails from constituents urging me to do more to tackle global poverty. When I was elected three and a half years ago, I was flooded with postcards, campaign letters and emails as part of the Make Poverty History campaign.         
	He acknowledged: There is still a cross-party consensus on this issue, but the mood of the public has changed discernibly and understandably, at a time when many of my constituents are fearful of losing their jobs, when many jobs are being lost up and down the country and when people are having their homes repossessed. There remains a huge amount of public good will and residual support for doing more to tackle global poverty, but it is understandable that peoples immediate concerns have moved on.         
	The Indian authorities have not produced counter-arguments against cancellation or scaling down of aid to India.         
	Crabb said: I do not agree that we should cut our aid programme to India because the country still has the worlds largest concentration of poor people, and a third of the poorest. We will need a substantial programme in India for some time to come. We can still ask about the nature of our programme and whether enough goes to support judicial or police effectiveness, for example, which might do more to reduce the propensity towards communal violence that we saw this summer when the Christian community was attacked in Orissa state.         
	He added: Those sort of measures might help to further Indias trajectory of growth and rising prosperity, but I do not think that large-scale poverty reduction programmes funded by ourselves will be what does it for a country the size of India.

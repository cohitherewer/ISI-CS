	Srinagar, July 20: Militants lobbed a grenade at a group of tourists in the hill resort of Gulmarg today, killing a man from Uttar Pradesh and a 14-year-old local ponywallah.        
	The resort was packed with people enjoying a weekend when the militants struck, police said. Four persons were injured in the blast.         
	This was the first attack on tourists this year and it happened at a time when the tourism industry has taken a beating after the agitation over the Amarnath land dispute.         
	The grenade landed on a group standing near a telephone exchange in Gulmarg. B. Srinivas, the north Kashmir police chief, said the tourists were waiting outside their hotel gate. We have launched an operation to nab the militants, he said.         
	Ashok Kumar from Uttar Pradesh, who was injured in the attack, succumbed on the way to a local hospital. The ponywallah from Gulmarg, identified as Mohammad Yusuf, was taken to Srinagar for treatment where he died.        
	After the blast, panicky tourists began leaving the resort.         
	The attack came a day after an IED blast blew to bits unarmed soldiers in an army convoy on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad highway.        
	Today, an army major and a Jammu and Kashmir policeman were killed in a gun battle with militants in Rajouri.        
	Major Bhanu Pratab, 29, from the 43 Rashtriya Rifles, and policeman Sanjeev Raina died in the gunfight in the Kunda Pangai forests in Rajouri, 190km from Jammu.        
	Defence spokesperson Lt Colonel S.D. Goswami said two jawans, Sepoy Ravinder Singh and Lance Naik Gyan Prakash, were injured.         
	The army and the police had launched a joint operation in the forest in Rajouri after a tip-off about the presence of a Lashkar-e-Toiba commander and other militants when they came under heavy firing. A search is on to catch the militants, the spokesperson said.         
	The army today revised the death toll in yesterdays IED blast from nine to eight. One of the jawans presumed dead was later saved, defence spokesperson Lt Colonel A.K. Mathur said.         
	The incidents of violence after a lull last year has dented official claims about normality in Jammu and Kashmir.         
	Girl spies tonsured        
	Two girls in Doda district were allegedly tonsured by Lashkar-e-Toiba militants suspecting them of being army spies, reports PTI.

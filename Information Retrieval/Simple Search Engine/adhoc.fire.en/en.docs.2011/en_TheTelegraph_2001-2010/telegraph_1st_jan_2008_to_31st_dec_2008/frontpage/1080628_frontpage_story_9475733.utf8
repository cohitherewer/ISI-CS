	Ranchi, June 27: Jharkhand High Court castigated the state government today for not being able to provide electricity in the hinterlands.         
	The court also pulled up the Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB) and the Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited (TVNL) and summoned its top brass for failing to keep its promise of supplying power to the village of Barki Punnu under Bokaro district.        
	In response to a PIL filed by villagers, a division bench comprising acting Chief Justice M.Y. Eqbal and Justice D.K. Sinha directed JSEB chairman, TVNL managing director, general manager and Hazaribagh (supply) general manager to appear before it on July 2 to explain why power had not been supplied as yet to the remote village in the outskirts of the steel city. The court also directed energy secretary Aditya Swarup to be present at the next hearing.         
	The bench observed: It is unfortunate for the government to be unable to provide electricity to the villages in the state. It is a very sorry state of affairs for the two government undertakings responsible for providing electricity.         
	The residents of Barki Punnu village had moved court after JSEB failed to supply power even though it had collected connection fees. As many as 354 residents had opted for the electrification programme in 2001.        
	JSEB had collected a token amount as fees from villagers. Sales of application forms alone yielded Rs 20 lakh.         
	Though transformers and electricity poles were put up and the villages wired, there was never any power.         
	The court was also peeved at the JSEB and TVNL for the affidavits it filed by way of explanation. Appropriate action would be taken against them if they were found guilty, the court added. The board told the court power could not be supplied because TVNL refused provide 1 KVA power which would be used for electrification of the entire village. TVNL contended it was a power generation company and had nothing to do with distribution of power.         
	The court observed that both the companies werent doing satisfactory work and lamented that the government was not taking adequate steps to improve the power scenario.

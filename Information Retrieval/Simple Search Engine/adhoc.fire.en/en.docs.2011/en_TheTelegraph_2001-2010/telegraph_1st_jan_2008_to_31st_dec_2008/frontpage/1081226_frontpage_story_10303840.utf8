The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Message to Pak, via China   Stick to core issue: Delhi 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Message to Pak, via China     Stick to core issue: Delhi

The eight-day Jewish festival of lights, also called Chanukkah, began on December 21 this year. It is observed by kindling a special, eight-branched (excluding the helper candle in the middle) candelabrum, one light on each night. The Rosenbergs were accompanied to Mumbai by the parents of Gavriel, Nachman Holtzberg and Frida. (AFP picture)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 25: India today conveyed to both China and the US that Pakistan had not taken any concrete steps to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure on its soil even a month after the Mumbai terror strikes and Islamabads war rhetoric should not divert the worlds attention from this central fact, highly placed sources indicated to The Telegraph today.        
	The message was delivered by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee in a 30-minute-long conversation with Chinas foreign minister Yang Jeichi this afternoon  the first high-level exchange between the two countries since the Mumbai assault on November 26.         
	Mukherjee also spoke to US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice this evening. This, sources said, was more in the nature of a courtesy Christmas call but the escalating tension between India and Pakistan did figure in the brief conversation.        
	Beijings call, sources said, may have been prompted by the heightened war hysteria in Islamabad. The Pakistan National Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution yesterday stating that the country was united and stands ready to defend its honour and dignity as well as its territorial integrity and that the nation and the armed forces shall together defend the countrys security at all costs.         
	This resolution and other war-mongering statements by Pakistans military and political leadership have been made despite Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs categorical assertion on Tuesday that nobody wants war. Manmohan had further said: My request to friends in Pakistan is to address the issue that is terrorism and not create war hysteria. They should act against those responsible for the Mumbai terrorist attacks.        
	This point is believed to have been stressed by Mukherjee in his conversation with the Chinese foreign minister. According to sources, Indias position is unambiguous  the issue, a source said, is not the defence of Pakistan, every country has the right and duty to defend itself. The issue is of Pakistan taking steps to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure that everyone knows exists in the country.        
	In other words, India is keen that the central point at stake  terrorism  is not lost sight of despite Pakistans diversionary attempts with talks of war.        
	If Pakistan were to cooperate with India in handing over terrorist masterminds such as Masood Azhar, help the countrys investigative agencies track down the leads provided by the Mumbai terrorists and crack down on the terror camps in the country, there will be no cause for any tension between the two neighbours.        
	But till date, Pakistan has made no moves in that direction. Barring a half-hearted attempt to close down the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (the front organisation of the Lashkar-e Toiba) under the directives of the UN Security Council, Islamabad has gone back entirely on its initial promises of cooperation with India after the Mumbai strikes.        
	Over the last few days, Pakistan, in fact, has gone on the offensive and repeatedly threatened to move its troops from the Afghan to the Indian border in anticipation of an imminent war. That threat, sources conceded, seems to have worked in major capitals of the world. The US (and other Nato allies), which is focused on the Afghan situation, does not want Pakistans forces to be diverted to the eastern border. China, too, is concerned about any outbreak of hostilities between its two southern neighbours.        
	In the light of these developments, there is increasing frustration in New Delhi both over Pakistans belligerent attitude and the worlds inability to press Islamabad to meet Indias demands. World powers, in fact, are urging India to exercise restraint even though India is a victim and not the culprit responsible for the current hostile environment in the subcontinent, the sources pointed out.        
	The Prime Minister has already underlined that India does not want war but many in the diplomatic and military establishment feel that it is an option New Delhi cannot entirely rule out in case Pakistan does not, voluntarily or under international pressure, deliver on dismantling the terrorist infrastructure.         
	The Indian establishment has not set any deadlines so far, sources said, revealing that the most frequently used phrase in South Block these days was What is to be done? Whether it is a plaintive cry or reflects Leninist resoluteness remains, for the moment, unclear.

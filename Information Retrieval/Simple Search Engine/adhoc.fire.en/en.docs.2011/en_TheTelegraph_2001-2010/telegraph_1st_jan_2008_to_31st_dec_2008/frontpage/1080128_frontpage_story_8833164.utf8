          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Aishwarya and Amitabh Bachchan in Daulatpur on Sunday. Picture by Naeem Ansari                                  
	Daulatpur, Jan. 27: The Bachchans arrived in Daulatpur  the village 52km from Lucknow where Amitabh was involved in a land dispute  today to open a school for girls in the name of their bahu.        
	Turned out in a pink silk sari, Aishwarya Bachchan took the dais immediately after husband Abhishek sent a ripple of laughter through the audience when he addressed her as Aishwaryaji in a three-line speech.        
	It was my dream to open a school here but I was briefly not open to having it named after me. There are big names in my family  my grandfather-in-law Harivansh Rai Bachchan, grandmother-in-law Teji Bachchan. But when I was explained the reasons for using my name, I agreed, she said, having amused the crowd earlier by addressing her husband as Abhishekji.         
	Mother-in-law Jaya Bachchan explained why the school had been named Aishwarya Bachchan Kanya Mahavidalaya.         
	When the idea of starting a school first occurred to us last year, we thought of your name because you are a bahu of Uttar Pradesh. We want beautiful, educated women like you to walk in as brides in all homes of Uttar Pradesh, she said, to cheers from the crowd.        
	Amitabh, keen to mend his image sullied by the embarrassing court battle over the farmland, laid the foundation stone.         
	I am often asked what relation I have with UP when I dont stay here. But dont forget I was born here. Seven generations of my family were born and have died here. It is true I lived in Calcutta and now live in Mumbai but wherever I stay, I will always belong to UP. Whatever I can I will do for this state, he said.         
	Family friend Amar Singh, who celebrated his birthday today, and several other politicians, including Mulayam Singh Yadav, Chandrababu Naidu, Farooq Abdullah and Om Prakash Chautala, were there to congratulate the Bachchans.        
	The Bachchans are now a part of us. We are touched by their dedication and commitment to improve our lot, said Dhaniram Singh, one of 12 farmers from Daulatpur who had moved court to reclaim gram panchayat land that Amitabh had bought.         
	Shashi Yadav, a 10-year-old girl, was happy the village would get a school. We cycle at least 3km from here to go to a school in Sitapur, she said.         
	The school will be run by actress-turned-MP Jaya Pradas Nishtha Foundation. She will be helped by Amar Singh.

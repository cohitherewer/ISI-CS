          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          Those days: Lali and Sunita		    
	Patna, April 30: A sexual harassment case, bearing striking resemblance to the Michael Crichton novel and Barry Levinsons 1994 film Disclosure, has managed to cause quite a flurry in Bihars political scene.        
	The former bodyguard of Korha (Katihar) Congress MLA Sunita Devi, Bal Yogeshwar Sharma alias Lali, has accused Sunita of sexually exploiting him for over two years and of threatening to kill him when he protested.        
	Lali, a strapping man of nearly six feet, worked as the bodyguard for the Congress MLA between November 2005 and March 2008 and is also a police constable (no: 187). At present, Lali works for the vigilance wing of the state electricity department.        
	After two days of allegations and counter-allegations, the former bodyguard walked into the Kotwali police station last evening to lodge an FIR.         
	In response to the sexual slur, a livid Sunita, in her early 30s, also the president of the state womens cell of the Congress, countered the allegations as politically motivated. She has threatened to drag Lali to the Harijan court.         
	However, before further action, Sunita said that she wishes to take up the matter with chief minister Nitish Kumar and director-general of police.        
	Lali is a resident of Phadaura village of Bhojpur and is in his mid-30s. He was appointed Sunitas bodyguard after she won the 2005 election. When the Assembly dissolved after a few months and fresh elections were held in November 2005 he was re-appointed.        
	Lali alleged that he stayed in a flat adjacent to the MLAs at Daroga Roy Path here. Later, he added, he was persuaded by Sunita to move in to her residence.         
	Lali said he did not pursue the matter with the police as he feared for his life. He fell out with the MLA this March after their relationship strained.         
	Confirming the FIR, Kotwali police station officer-in-charge Abhay Narayan said: We are verifying the veracity of the allegations before we question the MLA.        
	Lali has claimed that he has a few photographs and letters, purportedly written by Sunita, to prove the connection between them. I had to speak out after receiving persistent threats from Sunita.         
	Sunita said Lali had been blackmailing her seeking Rs 10 lakh as hush money. State Congress president Sadanand Singh has sought an explanation from Sunita.

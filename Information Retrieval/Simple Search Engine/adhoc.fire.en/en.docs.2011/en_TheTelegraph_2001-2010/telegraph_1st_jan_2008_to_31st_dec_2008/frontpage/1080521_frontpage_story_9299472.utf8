	Ranchi, May 20: Several renowned social activists are converging in Palamau on May 26 to protest the murder of Lalit Kumar Mehta, a close aide of Jean Drze, the architect of the UPA governments flagship programme  National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.        
	Lalit, 32, the secretary of an NGO, Vikas Sahyog Kendra, was fighting for the right to food and also involved in the social audit of the scheme in Chatarpur block of Naxalite-hit Palamau district. He had come to Daltonganj, the district headquarters, on May 17 to receive Drze. But Drze had some urgent job at a cyber caf so he could not accompany Lalit back home.         
	Lalit, returning alone, was killed and his bruised body was found and identified in the Kandra forest, some 20km from Daltonganj, on May 18.        
	The economist, along with his team from Delhi University and activists involved in the social audit from Jharkhand, has been on a tour to Palamau to conduct the audit.        
	Drze told The Telegraph over phone that Lalits killing was a ghastly murder by vested interests whom he had always fought against. I am not a detective. But the whole context and circumstances in which Lalit was killed could be enough indications that he had been killed by people with vested interests.        
	Ramesh Sharan and Balram, both appointed by the Supreme Court commissioners to monitor the implementation of the Right to Food campaign in Jharkhand, too maintained that it was the handiwork of contractors and a section of government officials.        
	Lalit was leading a campaign against the leak in the public distribution system in the home district of food and civil supplies minister Kamlesh Singh.        
	We want social activists from other states to show solidarity with the cause espoused by Lalit, Drze said. Around 100 activists, including Aruna Roy, N.E. Raja, former Planning Commission member B.N. Yugandhar, Sandeep Pandey, are expected to come.        
	The public hearing was pre-scheduled on May 26. But we turned it into a national event after Lalit was killed, Balram said.        
	Palamau superintendent of police Deepak Verma said: We are on the job to crack the case soon.

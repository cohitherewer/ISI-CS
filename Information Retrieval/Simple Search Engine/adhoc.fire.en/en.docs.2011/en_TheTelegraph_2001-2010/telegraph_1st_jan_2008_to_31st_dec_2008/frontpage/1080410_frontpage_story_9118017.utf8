The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rahul visit D-Day for Koda
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Rahul visit D-Day for Koda
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, April 9: The state Congress is gearing up for a visit by Rahul Gandhi during the end of the month by which time it would have finalised a decision on when to dissociate itself from the Madhu Koda government.        
	According to sources in the party, during his trip, Rahul would also travel to Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.        
	So, in a way, Kodas fate now hinges on the visit of the young Gandhi.         
	Surprisingly, Jharkhand Congress in-charge Ajay Maken wouldnt comment on Rahuls visit. Just wait some more time before we pull the rug (from) under Kodas feet. Theres a consensus on our stand, was all he would tell The Telegraph from Delhi.         
	After months of dithering over its oft-repeated claim to dislodge the Koda government, the state Congress now seems upbeat  more so after the appointment of Rameshwar Oraon as Union minister of state for tribal affairs.        
	It is now clear that Oraon will be the face of the party in Jharkhand. Oraon happens to be the tallest tribal leader in the Congress with an impeccable record as an IPS officer, said Maken.        
	Maken also tried to underp lay possible reprisals from tribals, no doubt encouraged by JMM chief Shibu Soren who was mighty upset with the Congress at being denied a ministerial berth at the Centre.         
	The people of Jharkhand should be thankful to the Congress for appointing a tribal MP and putting him in charge of the tribal development department, he maintained.        
	The Congress, for once, seems to have played its card right. It has already placated Lalu Prasad by inducting his nominee, Raghunath Jha, into the cabinet.         
	In return, the Congress hopes to get his support once it decides to topple Koda. Its a game of give-and-take, said a senior party leader.         
	For the Congress, Lalus backing means it no longer has to depend on Soren, who has meanwhile, managed to anger Lalu no end by dubbing the RJD chief as tainted.         
	In the context of his missing the berth due to court cases against him, Soren is understood to have said: If Lalu can be a minister, why should the Congress discriminate against me?         
	But Lalu, true to style, simply remarked, Soren apne karan se dhakka kha rahein hain (Sorens fate is linked to his own deeds).        
	But JMM was no mood to give in. We will take a final decision at the partys central committee meeting during April 29-30, said JMM legislature party leader Champai Soren in the absence of Shibu Soren who is in Chhattisgarh to address a public meeting.

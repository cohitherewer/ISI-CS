	New Delhi, Jan. 16: Animal husbandry officials in Bengal delayed reporting unusual deaths of poultry by four days, possibly giving the bird flu virus the chance to spread to new areas during that period, officials revealed today. 
    
	The delay was felt on the ground, too. In Birbhum, only 15,000 of the 3.5 lakh targeted for culling could be killed today, mainly because of lack of communication and villagers reluctance.
    
	Murshidabad today became the third district in Bengal after Birbhum and South Dinajpur to report unusual mortality in poultry with three villages in Khargram reporting the deaths of 1,000 birds. 
    
	Tissue samples of dead birds from Khargram have been sent to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, Bhopal, to determine the cause death, government officials in New Delhi said. 
    
	State officials appeared to have recognised unusual mortality in Birbhum on Monday, January 7. But the animal husbandry department in Delhi received a letter  sent via fax  highlighting the deaths only at 5pm on Friday, January 11, department officials said. 
    
	The delay violates international practices and national advisories sent to all states to notify central authorities within 24 hours whenever poultry birds die in unusually high numbers. 
    
	A communication from the state to the Centre is crucial to set into motion the chain of events  diagnosis, investigations at ground zero and preparatory action ahead of the possibility of an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 virus. 
    
	We have been emphasising to all state governments that surveillance and alertness are the key, said Pradeep Kumar, the secretary of the animal husbandry department. In Bengal, the deaths appear to have been occurring from January 4, he said. 
    
	A state official conceded there was a delay in reporting. There was a delay, but were now busy combating the infection. Well look into this later, Dilip Chakraborty, the principal secretary in the state animal resources development department, told The Telegraph. 
    
	Animal disease experts said backyard poultry made it difficult to carry out rapid assessments of outbreaks. But information available suggests that state officials knew about unusual mortality by January 7, said Shantanu Bandopadhyay, the animal husbandry commissioner. 
    
	A delay in preventive action provides the H5N1 virus the opportunity to move away from its index zone  the farm where chickens might have first become infected  to neighbouring farms in the same district or even beyond. 
    
	The ban on movement of poultry from the affected districts was announced only on Sunday. 
    
	Central officials recalled that during Indias first outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in Navapur, Maharashtra, during February 2006, attempts by poultry farmers to deal with the infection on their own had caused a delay of 12 days. 
    
	The H5N1 virus had then also surfaced in subsequent weeks in Ucchal, Gujarat, and Jalgaon, Maharashtra, forcing authorities to expand culling and surveillance operations to those districts. 
    
	However, despite the addition of a district in Bengal today, central officials said, the outbreak is localised to five blocks in Birbhum, a single state farm in South Dinajpur, and three villages in Khargram block of Murshidabad. 
    
	There is no need for a scare, Kumar said. It is a small area, and all preventive measures are in place, he said. 
    
	Kumar said 5,000 units of protective equipment, including masks as well as stocks of anti-viral drug, have been sent for the culling operations. An additional 5,000 units will be sent in to be kept in reserve. 
    
	He said central and state officials have held meetings with farmers and villagers in the districts, advising them not to handle sick or dead birds.

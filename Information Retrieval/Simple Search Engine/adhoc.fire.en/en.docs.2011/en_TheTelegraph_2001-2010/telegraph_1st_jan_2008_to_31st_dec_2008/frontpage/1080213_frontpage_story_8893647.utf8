                                                                                                           Tender-fixing slur holds up stadium makeover 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Barabati stadium                                  
	Cuttack, Feb. 12: The Orissa Cricket Associations (OCA) proposed makeover of the Barabati stadium has hit a roadblock. For, the association will first probe alleged anomalies in the bidding process for the stadiums facelift before awarding the tender.        
	The decision on awarding the contract would be taken after a report on the alleged malpractices is submitted at the special general body meeting of the association on February 24.        
	An official communication indicated that OCA had taken cognisance of a media report accusing the infrastruc- ture and development committee of resorting to unfair means during the contract awarding process for the Rs 52 crore project.        
	We want to make the entire process transparent. So, we have convened a special general body meeting on February 24 to examine the contract process and take the final decision, Orissa Cricket Associations secretary Ashirbad Behera told The Telegraph today.        
	OCA had drawn up a major infrastructure development plan for Barabati stadium envisaging extension of the pavilion, galleries and the players dressing room.         
	The plan included an indoor hall to hold practice sessions during inclement weather, a swimming pool for players and a perma- nent cricket academy.        
	OCAs general body had authorised a Rs 25 crore budget last October for the development of the stadiums infrastructure over a period of two years following an assurance from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) regarding 50 per cent funding.        
	Subsequently, OCA invited tenders for the Rs 52 crore contract on December 7, 2007. While 14 parties bou- ght the tender papers, only eight applied with the required technical and price bids along with Rs 1 crore as security deposit.         
	Sources said the tender process came under cloud when the price bid of the Cuttack-based East Coast Private Ltd was opened on the plea that the technical bids of the other applicants were disqualified. The tender process turned murkier on February 6 when the single eligible bidder allegedly lobbied for increasing the tender amount to Rs 56.20 crore.        
	The Orissa Cricket Association secretary, however, claimed that there was no room for tender fixing, as the norm of double sealed cover for submission of bids was enforced and the price bid was opened immediately after a decision on the technical bids was taken.        
	Besides, the price bid was opened in the presence of a retired judge and a notary, Behera said.

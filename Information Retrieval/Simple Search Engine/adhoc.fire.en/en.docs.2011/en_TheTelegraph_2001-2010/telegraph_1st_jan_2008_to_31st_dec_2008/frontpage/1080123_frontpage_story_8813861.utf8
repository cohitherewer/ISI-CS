	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 22: Guppy, Molly, Swordtail, Palty, Koi, Barns and Cyprinidae  these are not the new seven dwarves of Snow White, but fishes that have become household names in Bhubaneswar. 
    
	Round tailed, sphere tailed, fan tailed, veil tailed and pin tailed. Then there is the Cobra Guppy and the Singapore Guppy, there are so many varieties, explains an enthusiastic Padmaja Jena, a middle-aged woman and a breeder from Kausalyaganga on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar. Jena, a school-dropout and now a member of a self-help group, breeds a variety of indigenous and exotic species of ornamental fishes in her backyard, earning a steady Rs 3,000 every month. She is not the only one to benefit from the new trade of ornamental fishes that is sweeping across the state.
    
	The annual turnover from the aquarium trade has reached Rs 4 crore in Orissa with currently more than 30 entrepreneurs involved in the business. The fishy business reportedly brings in Rs 15 lakh (per month) in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.
    
	At least 20 species of ornamental fishes are bred at farms across the state, reports a survey by the Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture (Cifa). 
    
	Orissa has 100-odd retailed outlets of which 50 do a brisk business, the report further states. Cifa remains the only centre in the country where training on breeding ornamental fishes is imparted. These species can be produced easily and are commercially viable, said Saroj K. Swain, a senior scientist at the ornamental fish breeding and culture unit at Cifa. Orissa is lucky too as the state is home to 100 varieties, of which 50 are definitely popular. Rasbora, Puntius and Baddis, then fresh water Cupper Catfish, Dwarf Anchor Catfish, Devil Catfish and Puffer  all these are very popular, said Swain. 
             
	As of now, these fishes are supplied to Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai. An international airport here could have made trade better, said the senior scientist believes.
    
	Villagers of Balianta and pockets near Nandan Kanan have adopted pisciculture earning up to Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 every month. The seven day training at Cifa helped us to learn more, admits Laxmidhar Jena of Balianta, who thinks his career took a turn with the new trade. 
    
	The encouraging impact has made Gramsat, UNDP and Cifa decide to shoot the training procedure and air it via satellite for farmers. At least 200 people in Orissa have already taken up the professional training. While the majority opting for the training is farmers, students, entrepreneurs and government officials havent been left behind either. 
    
	As many as 100 SHG members, mostly women, have been trained on the basics of breeding and culture. Cifa scientists have been conducting a battery of research on how to improve the colour of the fishes to make them more attractive. From freelancers to entrepreneurs, ornamental fish breeding continues to give pleasure as well as money. And its only going to improve, said Niranjan Sarangi, the director of Cifa.

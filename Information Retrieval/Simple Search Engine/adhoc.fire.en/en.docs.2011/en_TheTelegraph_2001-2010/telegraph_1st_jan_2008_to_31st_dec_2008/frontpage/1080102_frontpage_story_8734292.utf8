	New Delhi, Jan. 1: Congress president Sonia Gandhi was recovering today from a chest infection at a Delhi hospital where she was admitted on Monday night with cough and mild breathing difficulty, doctors said.
 
	Sonia has a history of asthma, the symptoms of which can also be aggravated by intense stress. Last month, the 61-year-old Congress chief had been through a gruelling campaign in Gujarat, where her party failed to prevent a spectacular victory of Narendra Modi.
 
	Authorities at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) said Sonia was responding well to treatment but declined to provide further details. However, Congress sources said they expected her to be discharged tomorrow.
 
	She has been diagnosed to have a chest infection, she has been started on treatment, and she is much better now, said B.K. Rao, the chairman of the SGRH board of management.
 
	Outside the hospital, some well-wishers of Sonia organised a yagna for her speedy recovery.
 
	The Congress sources said she had been unwell with suspected viral infection for the past three or four days. Her children Priyanka and Rahul were at Kasauni near Almora to celebrate the New Year but they returned this evening to be with their mother, the sources said.
 
	Doctors said chest infections could exacerbate the symptoms of asthma mdash; cough and difficulty in breathing.
 
	Chest infections are typically caused by viruses or bacteria. They need treatment with antibiotics only when there are indications of bacterial infection, according to chest medicine specialists. 
 
	Stress, too, takes a toll sometimes. Sonia had reportedly suffered a severe asthma attack when she had heard about Rajiv Gandhis assassination. During that attack, Priyanka had to hunt for her asthma medications.

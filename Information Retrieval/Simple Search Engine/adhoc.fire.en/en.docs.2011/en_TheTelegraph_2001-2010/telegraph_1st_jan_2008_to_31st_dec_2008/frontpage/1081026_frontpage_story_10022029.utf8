          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Calcutta, Oct. 25: The out-of-season rain could worsen the microbial siege of Calcutta, experts warned today as undiagnosed fever killed a woman and a double dengue-malaria strike left a child seriously ill.        
	Sujata Ghosh, 33, of Behala is probably the 10th Calcuttan killed by mosquito-borne infections in October (see chart). She had shown symptoms of dengue but test results on her blood sample, drawn this morning before her death, are awaited.        
	The city is facing a simultaneous outbreak of malaria, dengue, encephalitis and chikungunya  although civic and state health officials could not provide incidence figures  and must brace for worse.        
	The rainfall will cause fresh water to accumulate, helping the breeding of mosquito larvae. This can lead to further spread of diseases, said Amitabha Nandi, director, Centre for Tropical Medicine and Parasitology.        
	Met officials forecast heavy rain till Monday and possibly on Tuesday too. ( ).         
	We have asked our vector-control teams to work overtime, said Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay, chief municipal health officer.        
	The city reported three more patients today, with Isha Ghosh, 7, of Mominpur testing positive for dengue and malaria. Biswarup Dutta, in his 20s, of Behala has dengue and Biren Singh, 60, a shanty-dweller from near the FB block market, became Salt Lakes first confirmed chikungunya patient.        
	Sujata, employee of a finance company, had been down since Wednesday night with high fever, shivering, body- ache and rashes. She was declared dead on arrival at Behalas Vidyasagar Hospital, which will do a post-mortem. Her family said Sujata suffered from kidney and thyroid diseases too and had high blood sugar.        
	The civic body hardly ever sprays mosquito repellents here, said a neighbour in Behala. The outbreaks have highlighted several lapses by civic and state health officials:        
	Spraying of repellents irregular in large city areas        
	No surveillance of any type of fever        
	Deaf ear to World Health Organisation warning of mosquito-borne diseases because of late onset of monsoon        
	Hardly any awareness drive against water accumulation        
	Dengue test-kit shortage in state-run hospitals        
	A health official passed the buck: The civic authorities should have acted faster.

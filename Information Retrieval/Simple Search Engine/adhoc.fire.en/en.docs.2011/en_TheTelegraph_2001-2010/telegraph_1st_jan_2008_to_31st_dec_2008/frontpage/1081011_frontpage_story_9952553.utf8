                                Ahtisaari: Pleased                            
	Oslo, Oct. 10 (Reuters): Finlands former President Martti Ahtisaari won the Nobel Peace Prize today for a decades-long career of peacemaking around the world from Namibia to Kosovo.        
	The Norwegian Nobel Committee chose Ahtisaari to receive the $1.4 million prize from a field of 197 candidates for his important efforts, on several continents and over more than three decades, to resolve international conflicts.        
	These efforts have contributed to a more peaceful world and to fraternity between nations in Alfred Nobels spirit, the award committee said in its citation, adding that it hoped the prize would inspire other peacemakers around the world.        
	Ahtisaari, 71, who was Finlands President from 1994 to 2000, has for years been a favourite to win what many deem the worlds top accolade. No one better than he could win the Nobel Peace Prize, said former UN secretary-heneral Kofi Annan.         
	He is only man I know who has made peace on three continents, Africa, Asia and Europe, and I always found him ready to answer the call to make this world a better place.        
	In 2005, Ahtisaari brokered peace between Indonesia and rebels in Aceh province to end 30 years of fighting.         
	Until March last year he led Serb-Albanian talks on Kosovo as UN envoy.        
	He was architect of an EU-backed plan for Kosovos independence from Serbia which guaranteed Serb minority rights and was implemented bloodlessly after the wars that tore apart Yugoslavia in the 1990s.         
	In 1989-90 he played a significant part in the establishment of Namibias independence, the committee said.        
	Naturally I am very pleased by the decision, Ahtisaari told Norwegian broadcaster NRK. Namibia was absolutely the most important because it took such a long time, he said, but said his work in Aceh and the Balkans were also among the most significant.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Death of an airport, hastened by saviours 
                                                                                                           Death of an airport, hastened by saviours 
  - Strike ends, not before Hyderabad burial          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                             The entrance to Begumpet airport                                        
	Hyderabad, March 13: The workers went on strike to save the airports life  they ended up making sure that it died an early death.        
	Half-shuttered gift shops, dead telephones, missing trolleys and an inert escalator told a tale of premature demise, two days before the scheduled hour of passing when Hyderabads Begumpet airport gives up its commercial breath to a newborn successor  the airport in Shamshabad 25km away.        
	At 00.00 hours on March 15, all commercial signals will cease at the 71-year-old Begumpet aerodrome that handled 250 flights every day.        
	The nation-wide airport employees strike, aimed at keeping open this airport and the one in Bangalore, was called off today after the Centre said it would talk to the private developers of the new airports to see if the old facilities could be made viable.         
	The new airport in Bangalore will be inaugurated only after May 10, instead of this month-end as scheduled, because of a delay in air traffic control services, offering the striking employees another reason to end the agitation.        
	The commercial and ground staff at Begumpet have been asked to report at the Shamshabad facility of the private GMR group from tomorrow itself, the day Congress chief Sonia Gandhi inaugurates it.        
	But nearly 48 hours before it officially dies, Begumpet was almost dead because of the strike. Employees union leader V.S. Gupta claimed that all 270 permanent staff took part in the ceasework.        
	Our fight is not just for our jobs. It is for the airport, which was making a profit of Rs 2.5 billion every year, said Bhumika Chatterji, a senior cargo section employee.        
	No uniformed commercial or ground employee was in sight as passengers struggled to make the best of a deteriorating mess. Scream as you like, you wont get the chance from tomorrow, said a receptionist.         
	Empty cups and plates littered tables at a coffee shop. Missing from the menu were Hyderabads specialities  masala mirchi and pakodas. We dont have people to clean up and so were advised to keep only dry items, said Satyanarayana Reddy, who operates the outlet.         
	The clock has begun to tick, said the owner of Paradise Bakeries that sells cakes, biscuits and pastries.         
	A cargo mix-up held up a Mumbai flight by over two hours and a delay in fuelling led to the cancellation of an Air Deccan flight. A stray animal on the runway put pilots on tenterhooks for nearly an hour.         
	A woman passenger from Dubai ran out shrieking from a toilet when she found a rat in the basin.        
	The airport, which started off with just two flights, will become history, sighed Mehdi Yar Jung of the Yar Jung family that promoted the airport, where British and American planes stopped to refuel during World War II.        
	Civil aviation sources, however, said the old airports in Hyderabad and Bangalore would continue to be used for private and chartered flights. Defence forces would also use them.        
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel said the government would try to expand operations at the existing airports, keeping in mind the interests of all sections. But no immediate solution is possible.        
	At Hyderabad airport, the last aircraft to land and leave  a KLM flight from London  will take off in a tearing hurry 30 minutes ahead of schedule on March 15 to avoid being stranded. Begumpet airport will close down at 00.00 hours sharp, said an air traffic controller.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Modi                                  
	New Delhi, June 12: Mention Narendra Modi and the BJP high command gets the jitters. Spokespersons seal their lips and senior leaders refuse to go on record. No chief minister evokes such awe among the partys central leaders.        
	It was no different a day after Modis I stop paying taxes, you stop aid challenge to the Centre from Vadodara.        
	Central assistance to Gujarat is about 2.5 per cent of the total tax collection of Rs 40,000 crore from the state to the Centre, Modi had said yesterday. Lets sign a year-long pact: you dont take any money from us and dont give us any aid. Then we will show the Centre how we run the state.        
	Today, BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar made a hasty exit from the party headquarters to avoid grilling on the subject, and his colleague Rajiv Pratap Rudy refused to discuss the matter. After unrelenting media pressure, Rudy only agreed to repeat what Modi had said.        
	I have nothing to say on behalf of the central leadership. I can only repeat what Modi said in Gujarat. But it must be clear that we are not saying anything on our own, Rudy said.        
	Senior leaders declined to explain this spectacle of helplessness on the central leaderships part. M. Venkaiah Naidu had said yesterday that Modi was only expressing his anguish at the stepmotherly treatment from the Centre.        
	Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari had said yesterday that Modis comments were an attack on the idea of a united India and wanted the charge of treason slapped on the chief minister.        
	Rudy said Modi had responded by daring the Centre to file the charge of treason against him. But he quickly added: This challenge has been given by Modi, not us.        
	After silently facing a further volley of questions, Rudy said: Modi was only expressing his anguish at the victimisation of BJP-ruled states by the Centre. Asked if the party would appreciate the chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir or the northeastern states speaking this language, he turned his face away.        
	BJP leaders admit in private that they do not approve of such statements since they are out of tune with the pan-Indian perspective the party nurtures.        
	Party sources said Modi may have made the remarks to distance himself from the inflation that is affecting even the state governments. He also wants another emotive issue for the Lok Sabha polls.        
	By promptly daring the Centre to try him for treason, Modi has again prepared the ground to play the Gujarati-pride card.

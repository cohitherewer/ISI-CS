                                Britney: Not a secret                            
	London, Sept. 23: An unfinished version of Britney Spearss new single Womaniser has been leaked on to the Internet.         
	The track, which record company bosses had been desperate to keep secret until the singers big re-launch in November, was discovered on YouTube by an LA radio station. The station played a 40 second clip of the song, which has now been picked up by thousands of fans.         
	The revelations follow reports of a fake leak which appeared last week when new website BritneySpearsCircusLeak claimed to have a leaked version of single Candy from Strangers, from the singers new album Circus. It was later proved to be a fake.         
	The record company are now trying to track down the insider who posted the version of Womanizer on the Internet, along with private footage of Spears rehearsing in an LA dance studio. They are considering legal action against the culprit. Security measures have been installed at the studio to protect the rest of the material.

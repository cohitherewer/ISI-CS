	Guwahati/Sonari, Feb. 16: Four Ulfa militants were killed in a joint operation by the police and army in Assams Sivasagar district in the wee hours today. The encounter took place at Naphuk Naharani village under Sonari police station at 2.30am.        
	The militants have been identified as self-styled sergeant major Ranju Hazarika, sergeant major Manik Likson alias Pathik Handique, Jitu Chutia and Hari Koch. Hazarika was a bomb expert responsible for several blasts in Sivasagar and other Upper Assam districts. They belonged to the outfits 28 battalion.        
	Handique, sources said, was an important link between Ulfa battalions and the Naga militants.         
	An AK-56 rifle, an Italian-made pistol, four grenades some ammunition and a mobile phone were recovered from them. Expenditure slips of the outfit in several envelopes, addressed to Ulfa leader Ram Singh, were also recovered from them.        
	The joint operation comes a day after the Unified Command meeting in Guwahati, chaired by the Union cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar. The meeting discussed the prevailing law and order situation in the state. A sustained crackdown this month against the outfit has already seen a few surrenders and arrests both in Upper and Lower Assam.        
	Army sources said they were tipped off about the four militants taking shelter in the house of one Kamala Bauri in Naphuk Naharani village. Accordingly, a raid was conducted at the village late last night. A gunbattle broke out in which all the four militants died.         
	Pramila, Kamalas 15-year-old daughter, said she was in the house with her younger brother and sister when four armed persons arrived around 5.30pm and demanded shelter. I went to my uncles place nearby and brought my cousin sister to stay with us since I was afraid, she said.         
	When Kamala arrived from work just after 8pm, the youths threatened him and said they would stay in his house till morning. Allowing the four youths to remain in the room, the family went to sleep.         
	We woke up in the night to the sound of heavy boots outside our house and suddenly, there was an exchange of fire, Kamala said.         
	The bodies were found strewn all around the Bauri household this morning, with one in the field, one in the kitchen and another in the room. The body of the fourth militant was found lying near the gate.Police sources said that the group had probably had come to participate in a shraddha ceremony of one of their comrades who had died few days back in a nearby village.         
	They could have also been planning subversive activities to avenge his death, an officer at Sonari police station said. He, however, could not provide the name of the dead militant whose shraddha ceremony the four may have come to attend.         
	A senior police official in Sivasagar district said that police had information about the militants taking shelter in the village. We sought the armys help as we were informed that eight heavily armed militants had entered the village that evening.         
	Army personnel from two units  the 316 and 66 Field Regiments, joined the police team to carry out the operation. We cordoned off the area and proceeded with our mission, an army official said.        
	The police officer at Sonari said that the documents recovered from the slain militants could provide vital clues about the whereabouts of Ram Singh, the dreaded militant of the 28th Battalion. We also found several phone numbers from a diary, he added.                                  
	The Opposition and PCG members has accused the state government of not being sincere about peace talks with the outfit. The ruling Congress in a statement issued by Congress spokesperson Rajesh Joshi, on behalf of PCC president Bhubaneswar Kalita, stated: The party reaffirms its commitment for negotiated settlement of the issue and called upon all sections to work for bringing lasting peace for development of the state.

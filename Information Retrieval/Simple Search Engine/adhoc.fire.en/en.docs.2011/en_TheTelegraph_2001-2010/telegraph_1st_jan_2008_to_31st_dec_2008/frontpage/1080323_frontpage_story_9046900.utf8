  - Two women from one family get ready for ballot battle in Godda           GAUTAM SARKAR                            Kamli Murmu and Mira Hembrom. Pictures by Shivash                                        
	Godda, March 22: Taking a cue perhaps from the famous K-serials on Indian television, never-ending saas-bahu sagas have now unfolded in the civic polls here being held after about 25 years.        
	At Ganta, a tribal dominated backward locality under the Godda nagar panchayat, located more than 4km from the district headquarters, saas (mother-in-law) Mira Hembrom (50) and bahu (daughter-in-law) Kamli Murmu (35) have jumped into the fray for ward councillor at ward no. 14.         
	They, interestingly, are the only two candidates fighting it out in the ward of 1,300 voters.        
	Mira Hembroms symbol is apt, too,  a gas stove. Everything is fair in love and war. My daughter-in-law is just trying her luck, lets see whom the people vote, she said.         
	The family, however, claims to have never had any traditional disputes of the saas-bahu kind as they live separately.         
	We may be fighting the polls but that every individual has the fundamental right to do so. Voters will choose one of us according to our merits, both said in unison.        
	Widow of a retired magistrate, Mira is matriculate and has two sons. She lives in a pukka house and enjoys a comparatively good life. Drinking water, electricity, garbage, bad roads are high on her poll agenda.        
	Kamli Murmu, wife of Miras cousin and who is contesting the polls on a cot symbol, lives in a mud house near the Hembroms. She is also a matric pass and her husband Arjun Soren works as a grille mechanic in Godda town. She has three sons.         
	Her poll plank is empowerment of women in the society, besides the usual civic amenities.

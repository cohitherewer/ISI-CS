          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Nov. 16: The Maoists firing on an IAF chopper in Chhattisgarh last Friday left more than 41 polling parties in the lurch, as pilots refused to fly helicopters. Result: several election workers had to spend two nights at red dens in Bijapur fighting fear.         
	On Friday, Naxalites had sprayed bullets on the IAF chopper ferrying a polling party and some jawans from Pedia polling station, killing Sergeant Mustafa Ali.         
	Pilots later blamed police and insisted that the incident could have been averted had the security personnel sanitised the helipad and the areas dotting it.        
	On Saturday morning, the state administration was taken aback when the IAF pilots refused to fly the choppers that were supposed to ferry the poll workers from the interior areas of Bijapur.         
	Elections were over by 3pm on Friday and it took another hour for election teams in the interiors of Bijapur to pack up the electronic voting machines. As the visibility faded soon, the choppers could not fly with the teams from most of the areas on Friday.        
	All polling parties were scheduled to reach the district headquarters of Bijapur and Dantewada by Saturday afternoon. But the strike-like situation forced them to pass the second night in the red zone.         
	The government had total 10 helicopters, including eight IAF, one private and one of the Chhattisgarh government, at its disposal for the elections.        
	Besides IAF choppers, private helicopters were also pressed into service.         
	While the IAF pilots refused to fly citing bad weather, private pilots gave technical reasons to ground the flying machines.         
	Director of the states aviation directorate Anil Tuteja said senior police officers began parleys with the pilots this morning and assured them of adequate security in and around the helipads.         
	Only after the police assurance did the pilots agree to fly, bringing a respite to the 41 polling parties comprising 250 employees, who had passed their every minute under the shadow of terror.         
	Members of 20 polling parties have reached the district headquarters, while another 21 are on their way, said Dantewada district superintendent of police Rahul Sharma.

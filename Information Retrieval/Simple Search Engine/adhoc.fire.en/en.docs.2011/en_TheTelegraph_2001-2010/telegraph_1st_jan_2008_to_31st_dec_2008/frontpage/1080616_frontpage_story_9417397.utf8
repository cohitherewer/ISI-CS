  - Mahanadi turtle study reveals dismal figure          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            A fresh-water turtle                                        
	Cuttack, June 15: Several species of fresh-water turtles are feared to have vanished from the Mahanadi, while other rare species are being driven to the brink of extinction owing to unchecked poaching.        
	Though 11 species of fresh-water turtles are found in the Mahanadi, a recent survey has revealed the presence of only six  two hard-shelled and four soft-shelled  species. Not a single fresh-water turtle of other species could be located during the survey. The rest have possibly become extinct from the Mahanadi system, the secretary of Wildlife Society of Orissa (WSO), B. Mohanty, told The Telegraph.        
	Fresh-water turtles, according to experts, are indicators of a healthy aquatic ecosystem and help keep the river clean, as they are carrion feeders.         
	The WSO survey, Mohanty said, had revealed that these rare species of fresh-water turtles for which deep-water pools, sand banks and mid-river islands provide an ideal home were being trapped and killed by poachers.        
	The six-month survey of major fishing villages along the Mahanadi had indicated that the fresh-water turtles were mostly caught at Kantilo, Padmabati, Mundali and Dhabaleswar on the river upstream of Cuttack.         
	Poachers were also reported to be catching them in the major tributaries like the Chitrotpala, Luna, Brahmani and Baitarani.        
	Eggs laid on the riverine islands are also regularly dug up by the fishermen apparently for their own consumption as we do not notice any trade in eggs, Mohanty said.        
	Sizeable number of fresh-water turtles, including soft-shelled ones, however, was killed and the meat was sold at Rs 30-40 per kg following incidental catches.                          
	A total of 324 turtles were counted among incidental catches during the survey period. The highest numbers were caught at Kakhadi village. Their weights varied between 2 kg and 30 kg.        
	All soft-shelled species are classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Killing or selling a fresh water turtle is punishable by a minimum jail term under wildlife protection laws.         
	Expressing concern over rampant poaching and trade in endangered fresh water turtles, the WSO secretary said: Organised gangs of Bangladeshi fishermen based at riverine islands of Mahanadi near Choudwar and Cuttack travel upstream to catch turtles on a massive scale.        
	Most of the poaching takes place in summer when low water levels make the turtles vulnerable. Nearly all the poached fresh water turtles find their way to West Bengal. Traders source these turtles from Orissa through these Bangladeshi fishermen to meet the strong demand for turtle meat in the neighbouring state, he alleged.        
	The WSO survey between 2007 and 2008 indicated dispatch of turtle consignments almost once in a week from Kujang and Rahama to Calcutta.

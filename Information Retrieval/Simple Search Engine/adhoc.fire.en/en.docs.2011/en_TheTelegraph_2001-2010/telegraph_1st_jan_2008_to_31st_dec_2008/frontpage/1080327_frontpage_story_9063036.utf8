          SAMYABRATA GOSWAMI AND SIMI KAMBOJ                                              
	Mumbai, March 26: The roll call of honour is impressive: Sachin Tendulkar, Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Juhi Chawla, and Salman and Saif Ali Khan.        
	The list of Land Rover owners goes beyond Bollywood: Anil Ambani, the worlds fifth richest man, takes pride in his Range Rover  the top-end model.        
	Although no one is ready to go public with their views, many on Mumbais celeb circuit are starting to turn up their noses as Tatas bring the Jaguar and the Land Rover into their stable.        
	It means a downgrading of the Jaguar and Land Rovers luxe image. Tata Motors was a bus- and truck-maker until a decade ago. Today, it is associated with cars aimed at the middle-class market. Why should the elite buy something that is even remotely connected to the mass market? asked a Bollywood personality who owns a Range Rover.        
	My car is of British make. We paid huge import duties on it and didnt mind it one bit as the brand gave us exclusivity. But now, with the Tatas owning the brand, I am sure there will be some changes in the import duty and the car would be within the reach of more people. If such a day comes when the Land Rover is as common on Mumbais streets as a Mercedes, I may sell off my car as it wont be exclusive anymore.        
	The same question arises with respect to Anil Ambani: will he continue to use the Range Rover now that it is a Tata brand? Ambani couldnt be reached for comment.        
	Pune-based industrialist and car enthusiast Yohan Poonawalla feels the brands will take a hard knock.         
	With due respect to Tata Motors, Jaguar and Land Rover will lose their charm and exclusivity once they are associated with the Indian brand. Internationally, customers view the Tatas as manufacturers of trucks and low-cost cars. From Nano to Jaguar  the Tata image has now become contradictory.        
	Poonawalla believes that you cant mix the mass market and the luxury segments.         
	Sarat Kachalia of Navneet Motors, the authorised Rolls-Royce dealer in Mumbai, said Jaguars and Land Rovers had ardent fans in India.        
	There are more than 100 Land Rovers in Mumbai alone; they are fancied mostly by top builders, industrialists and film stars, he said.         
	The Garwares were among the first in the city to get a Land Rover some decades back. Now Gautam Singhania owns a Jaguar XJ8, which his mother Ashabai uses. Both Shashi and Ravi Ruia have one Jaguar XJ8 each. Jeh Wadia had a Land Rover -- the 1998 model. But hes junked it now, opting for a Mercedes 600S instead, said a dealer.        
	But not everyone is dismayed by the development. Anand Mahindra, the managing director of Mahindra and Mahindra, who was among the bidders for the two brands, said: The acquisition of these two brands will make the world sit up and take notice of Indias growing prominence in the global automotive arena. I wish the Tatas every success for the future.         
	Automobile designer Dilip Chhabria felt the deal should work well for both companies.        
	If Tatas can locate the development and engineering projects in India, it will save them money, he said.         
	Asked whether the Tatas would succeed where Ford had failed, Chhabria said: Ford didnt take these acquisitions seriously. But these are very serious and precious assets for the Tatas. Theyll manage it much better than Ford.        
	Although many celebrities drive the two models, they dont actually own them. At least, not on paper.         
	To avoid high octroi rates, most procure it using a legal loophole that allows travel agencies to import top-end foreign cars at lower rates with the bogus aim of promoting tourism. Many of the so-called Bollywood celebs use false names to procure their cars through these travel agencies. Hopefully, this practice will stop in the case of Land Rovers and Jaguars, said Arun Tandon, the additional director-general in the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI).

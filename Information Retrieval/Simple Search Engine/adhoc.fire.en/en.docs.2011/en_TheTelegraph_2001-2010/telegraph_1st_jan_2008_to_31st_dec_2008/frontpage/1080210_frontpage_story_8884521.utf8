                                                                                                        6-day week set to return
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 9: In an effort to project a proactive image of his government, chief minister Madhu Koda adopted a tough line on officials shirking work due to the political uncertainty in the state and announced a return to six-day workweek for all government staff.         
	The state government will identify such shirkers and take action against them, Koda said on his return today from New Delhi after attending a meeting with the Planning Commission.        
	Addressing reporters, the chief minister said officers needed to work without a break irrespective of the political scenario in the state. He said the government would revert to six-day week.         
	Maintaining that his government was going to complete its tenure, Koda said he had the support of railway minister Lalu Prasad. I will also talk to Congress in-charge Ajay Maken and convince him to change his stance in order to foil the attempt of the BJP to form an alternative government, he said, ruling out a reshuffle in the state cabinet.         
	Yesterday, the Planning Commission okayed an outlay of Rs 8,015 cr for the next fiscal. Taking credit for the huge plan size despite the states poor spending record, Koda said the availability of more funds would give a huge impetus to development.         
	He maintained that agriculture, rural roads, national highways, tourism and mining would get the lions share in the annual budget. We have to implement the report of agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan to generate jobs in the agro-sector, he said. Besides, we have also pledged to bring down the dropout rate to zero during the next fiscal.        
	There are around 2.50 lakh dropouts in the state.        
	Funds allocated by the Planning Commission were 22 per cent more than the current year. Members of the commission appreciated Jharkhands requirements as it was a new and backward state and recommended enhanced outlays for agriculture and education.         
	While the working group on agriculture suggested a Rs 100-crore increase in the outlay (now at Rs 700 crore), the forest and education group recommended an increase of Rs 50 crore (from Rs 376 crore).

          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 25: Chief minister Shibu Soren would prefer one of his party legislators giving up his Assembly membership to pave way for him than contesting the bypoll from the Tamar seat for humanitarian reasons.         
	He feels that causing hindrances in the way of the widow of slain MLA Ramesh Singh Munda would be an inhuman act.         
	The Tamar Assembly seat fell vacant after JD(U) legislature party leader Ramesh Singh was killed by Naxalites. The slain legislators widow has expressed her willingness to contest the bypoll.        
	I will never come in the way of the poor lady. I have learnt that she is still in a state of shock and even reluctant to contest the bypoll.         
	But we must help her overcome the trauma. I am ready to contest from any other seat. In fact, several MLAs have already offered me their seats. But I have asked them to wait, Soren told The Telegraph.        
	On whether the UPA would field a candidate in Tamar, the chief minister said in a philosophical tone that power politics had its own compulsions and limitations.         
	But, his best wishes were with Ramesh Singhs widow.         
	JD(U) state unit chief Jaleshwar Mahto, too, admitted that though the slain MLAs widow was willing to contest the by-election, she was yet to begin the groundwork because of fear psychosis.         
	Expressing concern over the spurt in Naxalite violence, the chief minister said that unemployment and poor policing were responsible for the current state of affairs.         
	Even as he advised the police superintendents to treat people rationally, he felt that the criminals only understood the language of sticks.         
	I came to know the police from close quarters when I was in jail. They will be killed by the inmates if they dont use force. I also interacted with hardcore rebels. They know little about Mao Tse Tung. They are criminals and can be handled only with sticks, he added.         
	The chief minister said that though his government was ready to extend all possible help to industrialists, most of them were yet to come forward with their community development programmes. Steel giants like Mittals, Ruias and Jindals were yet to contact him.         
	I am not aware of the MoUs they have signed in the past. But neither L.N. Mittal nor Shashi Ruia has spoken to me even once over telephone after I became the chief minister, he said.        
	Soren has, therefore, decided to concentrate more on social welfare schemes started by his government.         
	He would soon be touring different parts of the state to monitor ground realities.         
	He will hold a review meeting in Dumka and, thereafter, proceed to Godda by road, where he will be appearing before a court on Saturday.

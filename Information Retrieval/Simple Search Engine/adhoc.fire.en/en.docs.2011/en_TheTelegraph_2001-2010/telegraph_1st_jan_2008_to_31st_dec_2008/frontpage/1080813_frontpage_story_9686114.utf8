          DAVID THOMAS                            Miller: Media frenzy                                  
	London, Aug. 12: Actress Sienna Miller has followed up a tearful plea for privacy to paparazzi photgraphers in Los Angeles with a complaint to local police.         
	Earlier, she had been spotted having lunch with Balthazar Getty at a Greek restaurant in Malibu.         
	The 26-year-old was being followed by a swarm of photographers keen to get a shot of the British actress, at the centre of a media frenzy concerning her relationship with married father of four Balthazar Getty.        
	She snapped at a petrol station, telling photographers: Can you leave me alone, Im trying to get gas and this is really harassment. Please leave me alone.        
	I cant live like this, please give me a little bit of respect.        
	After accusing photographers of harassing her, she drove to Beverley Hills Police Station, where she complained and was given a police escort to the Four Seasons Hotel.        
	Millers relationship with Getty, 33, an actor and multi-millionaire oil heir, has attracted a frenzy of attention since she was first photographed frolicking topless with him on a boat in July.        
	Two of her films, GI Joe: Rise of Cobra and Hippy Hippy Shake, have had their releases delayed.         
	But producers have denied reports that the delays are because the studios want to wait until the bad publicity surrounding her relationship has died down.                          THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

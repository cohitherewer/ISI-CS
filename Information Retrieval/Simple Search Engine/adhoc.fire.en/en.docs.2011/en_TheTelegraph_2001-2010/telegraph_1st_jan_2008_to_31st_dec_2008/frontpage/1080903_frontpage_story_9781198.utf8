  - Akon Bora handed social welfare amp; jail          A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, Sept. 2: Chief minister Tarun Gogoi this evening announced a minor reshuffle of his ministry, allotting social welfare and jail to Akon Bora, who was inducted into the ministry today.         
	Social welfare minister Ajanta Neog was given charge of the PWD department. Gogoi was holding the portfolio till now.         
	Water resources minister Bharat Chandra Narah, who was under fire from the Opposition for his alleged inept handling of the flood situation in the state, was divested of the portfolio.         
	He was allotted co-operative, sports and cultural departments.         
	Incumbent minister Gautam Bora was given complete charge of the elementary, secondary and higher education portfolio, barring technical education, which will be looked after by Gogoi himself.         
	Planning and development minister Prithibi Majhi was given the responsibility of water resources department, while the chief minister himself has taken over the planning and development department.         
	Guwahati East legislator Robin Bordoloi has been appointed the chief administrator of Guwahati Municipal Corporation.         
	After Akon Bora was sworn in at the Durbar Hall of the Raj Bhavan today, Gogoi said that the minister belonged to the Koch-Rajbongshi community had tilted the decision in his favour.         
	The community had no representation in the ministry till now.         
	Giving representation to all the communities has always been a priority. So it is definitely a criterion. Apart from that, he has also been rewarded for being a sincere and loyal Congress worker, Gogoi said.         
	Akon Bora was inducted after one ministerial berth fell vacant with the axing of former education minister Ripun Bora after he was arrested by the CBI for trying to bribe an official to influence the outcome of a murder case.        
	Thanking chief minister for showing immense faith in him, Bora said he would discharge his duties to the best of his abilities. I am grateful to the chief minister for inducting me in the ministry. I will be happy with whatever portfolio has given to me, he said.         
	Bora is known to be a close associate of the chief minister and is one of the longest serving general secretaries of the Assam PCC.               
	His elevation, Congress sources said, was now likely to trigger fresh competition among the second-ranking leaders in the cabinet.         
	He is very assertive and vocal and his closeness to the chief minister is also well known. This will definitely trigger some kind of tussle among the second rank leaders loyal to Gogoi, a PCC office-bearer said.

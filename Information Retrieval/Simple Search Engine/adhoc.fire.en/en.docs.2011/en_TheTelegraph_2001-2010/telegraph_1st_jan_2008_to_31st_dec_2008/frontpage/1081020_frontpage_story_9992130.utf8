          MATTHEW MOORE                        Madonna, Guy Ritchie(below) : Wedding woes				                                       
	London, Oct. 19: Guy Ritchie decided to end his marriage to Madonna after her gruelling gym routine disrupted their private life, it has been claimed.         
	The pop singers daily four-hour exercise regime meant that they went 18 months without making love, according to a friend of the couple.        
	The pair lived like brother and sister in the final years of their marriage, with Ritchie, a film director, increasingly put off by 50-year-old Madonnas muscled physique, it was claimed.        
	He got more and more frustrated as she spent nearly half the day working out. Afterwards shed be too tired to make love, the friend said.        
	And towards the end Guy wouldnt be there. Hed get fed up waiting for her and go down to the pub with his mates. He is the one behind the split.         
	The friend, who was quoted in the News of the World newspaper, also claims that Madonnas faith in Kabbalah contributed to the failure of their marriage, with Ritchie reportedly describing the mystic religion as mumbo jumbo after she insisted they receive marriage counselling from a rabbi.        
	Londons highest-profile divorce lawyers have been lining up to represent the couple since they announced their split last week but the newspaper claims that, contrary to earlier reports, they signed a pre-nuptial agreement that determines how their assets should be split.        
	The acrimony of their break-up has been highlighted by the insults exchanged by the two camps.         
	The singer labelled her husband emotionally retarded in front of thousands of fans at a Boston concert last week  an act described by Ritchies elderly father as beastly.        
	It is understood that Ritchie will seek to ensure their eight-year-old son Rocco will remain with him in London, arguing it would be a major upheaval for him to be away from his school and friends in Britain.         
	Madonna, however, is adamant that all three children, including her own daughter from a previous relationship, Lourdes, 12, and the couples adopted Malawian son David Banda, should grow up in New York.

	Calcutta: The poll panel has deferred the bypolls in Nandigram (East Midnapore) and Sujapur (Malda) to January 5 because of a shortage of central paramilitary forces.        
	The bypoll in Para (Puru-lia), however, will be held on schedule on December 27.        
	Elections in neighbouring Jharkhand were also put off because of the lack of forces.

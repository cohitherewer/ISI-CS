	Nandigram, May 23: A CPM supporter accused of leading attacks on Opposition houses was beaten and hacked to de- ath by nearly 100 triumphant Trinamul Congress supporters in a Nandigram village this morning.        
	Sheikh Khalek Mullick, 27, had set off for his workplace in Haldia around 8am.        
	Like other days, he was going on a cycle to the Kendamari ferry ghat, from where he took the boat to Haldia, said his cousin Shantu, 25.                 
	When he had travelled 3km to Hajrakata, the Trinamul supporters attacked him.         
	They first thrashed him and then hacked him. The ve- ins above his heels were severed, said Shantu.        
	According to witnesses, about 20 Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee supporters had surrounded Khalek initi-ally but the number swelled in no time as many women and other villagers joined them.          
	CPM supporters called police. They reached around 9am and took an unconscious Khalek to the block hospital. Khalek was then referred to the district hospital in Tamluk, where he died after admission.        
	This is the first death in clashes in Nandigram, about 165km from Calcutta, since the CPMs armed recapture of the area last November.        
	Khalek, a resident of Garchakraberia, worked as a security guard at a private company in Haldia.        
	The villagers were angry with him, said Abu Taher, a newly elected Trinamul panchayat samiti member.        
	He had led CPM cadres to Jadubarichar village on Wednesday. They looted houses of our supporters and beat them up. The villagers saw Khalek today and could not keep their calm, said Taher, also a Pratirodh Committee convener.        
	He also alleged that Khalek was armed.         
	The police recovered a pipe gun from the spot, but could not confirm if it belonged to Khalek.        
	Several CPM leaders, including local committee secretary Sheikh Shahidullah, reached Hajrakata around the time the police and the CRPF made it there. Nearly 500 Pratirodh Committee supporters surrounded them and set Shahidullahs motorcycle on fire.         
	The police looked on and Khaleks transfer to hospital got delayed.        
	Pratirodh Committee supporters also went on the rampage at Dakshin Kanchannagar village, a kilometre away, and ransacked and looted about a dozen houses belonging to CPM supporters. Two CPM supporters were beaten up and had to be admitted to the Reyapara block hospital.         
	We have decided to organise all-party peace meetings in Nandigram police station and at the village level, said East Midnapore superintendent of police S.S. Panda.        
	An all-party meeting was held at the police station this evening.         
	Trinamul, CPM and SUCI leaders attended but not anyone from the Congress.        
	That the tables had turned on the CPM became apparent when party district secretariat member Ashok Guria accused Trinamul of unleashing a reign of terror in the area.        
	The party called a 12-hour bandh in Nandigram blocks I and II on Monday in protest against the murder of Khalek.

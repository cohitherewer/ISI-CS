          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, March 22: Spurned by his girlfriend for not gifting her a cellphone with a camera, a 21-year-old shot himself with a pipe-gun early this morning.        
	Some night guards in the Jheel Paar area of New Barrackpore, on the northern fringes of the city, heard the shot. They found a bleeding Kamal Das beside a shrub.        
	Kamal was rushed to Panihati Hospital in Sodepur, where he died.        
	According to a preliminary inquiry, Kamal, a small-time businessman dealing in bed sheets and linen, had been in a relationship with Sangeeta Das for the past six months. Of late, the two had been bickering over a gift that Sangeeta wanted from Kamal  a mobile phone fitted with a camera. Last night, they had a heated exchange over this, said a senior officer of Ghola police station.         
	Kamals body has been sent for post-mortem. His father has not lodged a complaint, so the police havent started a case. The police are, however, trying to find out how he got the gun.

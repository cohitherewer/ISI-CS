The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM opts for tough talk
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CPM opts for tough talk
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 26: The CPM today accused the Trinamul Congress of planning bloodshed and asked cadres to show restrained resistance if attacked, shedding the conciliatory tone the party had adopted since the Singur siege began.        
	The perceived hardening of stand came a few hours after Mamata Banerjee announced a road blockade across the state on Friday and a day after the chief minister offered her direct talks on any issue.        
	Pulling up Mamata for rejecting the path of rational dialogue, CPM state secretary and Left Front chairman Biman Bose said: They (Trinamul Congress leaders) are looking for violence and bloodshed in any way.         
	He urged the supporters of the CPM and the other Left Front partners to avoid pro- vocation, but asked them to put up restrained resistance in case of any attack.         
	The statement, issued on behalf of the front, was apparently aimed at including the sceptical allies in the move to step up the political offensive against the Opposition and preparing ground for a blame game keeping an eventual conflict in mind.         
	The Left Front feels that the Trinamul-led alliance has decided to create anarchy across Bengal after rejecting the path of rational dialogue. It has done irreparable damage to the state and its interests, Bose said, indicating that the Left would harp on Mamatas anti-state, destructive politics in the Lok Sabha polls.

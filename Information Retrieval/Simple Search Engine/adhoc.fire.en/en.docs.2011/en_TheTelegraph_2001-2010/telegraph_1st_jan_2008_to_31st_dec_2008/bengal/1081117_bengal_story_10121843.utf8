          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Belpahari, Nov. 16: Sisir Das, the additional superintendent of police, headquarters, North 24-Parganas, has refused to take charge of a camp in Lalgarh that is on the list of police hubs the tribals want withdrawn.        
	Das was yesterday asked to move to the Kalaimuri police camp. Today, he informed SP Rajesh Kumar Singh he would not go there and, if necessary, would resign.         
	Das, who has gone on leave, is believed to have told the SP that he didnt want to do his job at the mercy of Maoists and protesters.        
	Praveen Kumar, DIG, Midnapore range, confirmed the development but declined comment.        
	The additional SP had been posted at Tirakata near Salboni, a favourite haunt of Maoists, eight days ago.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Aug. 19: A Gorkha Janmukti Morcha team left for Delhi today to prepare the groundwork for the proposed tripartite talks.         
	Binay Tamang, the media and publicity secretary of the party, said: We have learnt that UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi has asked Pranab Mukherjee to handle the Gorkhaland issue. The delegation will informally meet Mukherjee tomorrow.         
	Tamang also said the party would not support the hill strike on August 22 called by the CPRM to protest against the alleged betrayal of the Gorkhaland cause by the GNLF.         
	We have announced that we are not in favour of general strikes in the run-up to the festival season, Tamang said.        
	CPRM spokesperson D.S. Bomzom, however, said the strike had been called on issues also raised by the Morcha. We dont understand why they cant support us.        
	Tamang did not specify whether the Morcha would oppose the strike.         
	About the Delhi trip, he said: Apart from working out a possible date for the meeting, the nine-member delegation will press for a political dialogue.         
	Indications from the Centre and the state suggest the first round will be held at the secretary-level.         
	Morcha president Bimal Gurung yesterday said his party would walk out of the meeting if the demand for Gorkhaland was not discussed.

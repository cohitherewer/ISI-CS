                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Minister promises end to teacher row 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Nov. 16: School education minister Partha De today said the ongoing row over the states primary teachers training institutes would come to an end by next week.         
	I will go to Delhi within a week to meet foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and HRD minister Arjun Singh to find a solution to the deadlock. We are deeply concerned about the future of 75,000 candidates in the 140-odd institutes, De said on the sideline of a programme at a school in Hirapur, Asansol, about 265km from Calcutta.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, addressing the state conference of the West Bengal College and University Teachers Association in Malda, had yesterday conceded that certain faulty policies of the government were responsible for the impasse.        
	The careers of thousands were thrown into jeopardy after the National Council for Teachers Education refused to recognise nearly 140 primary teachers training institutes in the state.         
	Over 200 aspiring teachers had attacked Des car and shown him their sandals on November 7 in Bankuras Bishnupur in protest against the governments inaction.         
	The minister admitted that both primary and secondary schools had come up in an unplanned manner.         
	Some areas where the Hindi-speaking population is higher dont have Hindi medium schools nearby. Similarly, in areas dominated by Bengali-speakers, there are not enough Bengali medium schools, De said.         
	Now, we have planned to conduct a survey and set up schools according to the local demand, he added.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Dec. 20: The DVC has decided to shut down a power plant in Bankura after villagers continued to block trucks carrying fly ash out of the facility for over a month.        
	The residents near the plant have been blocking the trucks since November 14 and not letting the plant authorities empty the two ash ponds that are full.        
	The villagers said when the trucks took away the by-product ash, it polluted the air leading to respiratory problems among residents.         
	We have decided to shut all six units of the Mejia power plant one by one by this month. We are helpless as the villagers are still not allowing us to remove the ash from the ponds, said Amal Sarkar, the chief engineer.         
	Power generation would create more ash, which the DVC cannot dump in the ponds anymore. Yesterday, it got the approval from the Central Electricity Authority to stop work in all the units.        
	Officials said the shutdown would affect power sup- ply in coal and steel plants in Burdwan.        
	Power minister Mrinal Banerjee, however, ruled out the possibility of power scarcity elsewhere. We dont take power from the DVC regularly and there will be no shortage in supply in the state if the Mejia plant stops. It would hamper supply in the coal belt area, he said.         
	The DVC generates 1,340MW in Mejia, about 240km from Calcutta.         
	Officials today told the Central Electricity Authority that both its ponds, filled with fly ash to the maximum, were now damaging the devices installed to control pollution in the plant.         
	A team from the electrical authority visited the plant earlier this month.         
	The plant generates around 7,000 tones of ash daily that is dumped in the two 40ft-deep fly ash ponds spread over 700 acres.        
	The crisis has come at a time when the DVC was adding another 1,000MW  two 500MW units  to the plant under the 11th Five Year Plan. This would make the Mejia plant the biggest power generator (2,340 MW) in eastern India.

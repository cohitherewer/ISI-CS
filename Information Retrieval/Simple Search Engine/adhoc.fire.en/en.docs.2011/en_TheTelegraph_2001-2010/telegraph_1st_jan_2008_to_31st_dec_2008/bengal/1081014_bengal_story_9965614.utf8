The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Farmer suicide for stock crash
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Farmer suicide for stock crash
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Oct. 13: A Murshidabad farmer who had invested around Rs 7,000 in stocks killed himself last night allegedly after a friend told him he had lost most of it in the market meltdown.        
	Swapan Mondal, 49, had an altercation with his wife over the losses last evening.        
	The farmer, who owned an acre some 230km from Calcutta, apparently gave around Rs 7,000 to the friend in May to invest on his behalf.        
	My fathers friend had been telling him stories about how money gets doubled in a year or even sometimes in three months. My father sold paddy worth Rs 7,000 in May and bought three shares in a heavy engineering company. Over the past few days, he had been morose and told my mother that he had lost nearly Rs 4,500 in the stock market crash, Swapans eldest son Gobinda said.        
	At Bundaidanga village, the couple fought frequently since Swapan told wife Jamuna about his losses. After one such fight, he locked himself in a room and hanged himself. The family told us he committed suicide following a tiff over losing money in stocks. We are probing that, Lalbag subdivisional police officer Ashesh Roy said.        
	According to Gobinda, his father had given the money to Mantu Mondal because he did not have a demat account, essential to hold shares.         
	From Gobindas version, it appears Swapans friend had not been telling him the truth about the fate of his investment.         
	A share of the company Swapan apparently invested in sold at Rs 2,666 in May. Its price today is Rs 990.        
	However, Swapans friend never mentioned to him that the company had declared a 1:1 bonus, which meant that if Swapan had three shares, he would now own six. Even at Rs 990, he would have got nearly Rs 6,000 from them.        
	Gobinda said his mother had opposed buying shares all through. She told him not to gamble with money from paddy. Yesterday, my father again lamented his loss in front of my mother and the quarrel started. Neither me nor my brother was at home then. When we returned and called him, he did not respond. We saw him hanging through a window.        
	Swapans friend Mantu could not be contacted.

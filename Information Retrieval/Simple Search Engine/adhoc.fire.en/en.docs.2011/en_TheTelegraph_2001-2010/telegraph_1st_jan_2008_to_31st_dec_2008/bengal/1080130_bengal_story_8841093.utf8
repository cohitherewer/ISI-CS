     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Malda, Jan. 29: A door-to-door survey has revealed that 602 residents of Chanchol I and Harishchandrapur blocks are suffering from some of the symptoms of avian influenza. 
    
	We have detected 109 people within a 3km radius of Mahanandapur in Chanchol I and 493 within a radius of 3-10km with fever, chest pain, running noses and cough, said Radharaman Banik, the chief medical officer of health of Malda district.
    
	However, none has been detected with pneumonia, the key symptom of the H5N1 virus infection.
    
	Banik said all the 602 were under observation. 
    
	We are opening a special ward in the Chanchol subdivisional hospital, he said. It will also serve patients from neighbouring Harishchandrapur. 
    
	We will send their blood samples to the Bhopal laboratory, Banik said
    
	A team from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in Delhi and experts from the All-India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Calcutta, arrived here today to review the flu fight.
    
	The experts are believed to have expressed satisfaction with the district administrations performance. 
    
	However, the fear of a human pandemic still lurks. 
    
	The superintendent of the Malda railway hospital, D. Sarkar, said: We are getting patients with high fever and chest pain and we are not being able to detect the source of infection. We have sent several patients to B.R. Singh Hospital in Sealdah.

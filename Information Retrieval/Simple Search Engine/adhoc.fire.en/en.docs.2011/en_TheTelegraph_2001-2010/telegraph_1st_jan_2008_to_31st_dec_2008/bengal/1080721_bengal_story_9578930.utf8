	Calcutta: Mamata Banerjee will announce tomorrow her stand on Tuesdays trust vote in the Lok Sabha.         
	She has a plane ticket for Delhi tomorrow evening, but the Trinamul Congress leaders said she would decide whether to fly to the capital only after the Esplanade rally.        
	I shall make my stand clear at the rally, Mamata told a news conference today.

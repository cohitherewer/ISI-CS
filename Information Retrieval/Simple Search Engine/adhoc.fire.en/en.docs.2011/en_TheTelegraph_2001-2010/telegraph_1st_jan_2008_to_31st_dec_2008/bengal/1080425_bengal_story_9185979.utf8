	Krishnagar, April 24: A Nadia fast-track court today sentenced three men to life imprisonment for raping a 30-year-old two years ago. One of the accused died while the trial was on.    
	Public prosecutor Pradip Nandi said Sabatul Sheikh, Mohsin Sheikh and Atur Sheikh had slipped into the womans house in Karimpur, 180km from Calcutta, on the night of January 28, 2006, when she was alone. They dragged her out and raped her.         
	Suri: Relatives and neighbours of a 59-year-old woman ransacked the Suri Sadar Hospital in Birbhum hours after her death on Wednesday night. They also beat up the doctor on duty. Urmila Kahars son Ramesh alleged that the doctor had not attended to his mother, who was admitted with chest pain after a fall. Police later arrested two persons.        
	Calcutta: A 19-year-old boy was killed and his friend grievously injured when an oil tanker hit their motorcycle on Diamond Harbour Road around 10 tonight. Raj Singh died on the spot while a bleeding and unconscious Biplab Das, 19, was rushed to Vidyasagar Hospital. When his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to SSKM Hospital. The driver of the oil tanker fled.        
	Tamluk: Long power cuts in East Midnapore crippled services at the Tamluk district hospital on Thursday. The generator, too, was out of order. Hospital superintendent Sabitendra Patra said an emergency operation had to be carried out in candlelight and 10 surgeries were delayed.

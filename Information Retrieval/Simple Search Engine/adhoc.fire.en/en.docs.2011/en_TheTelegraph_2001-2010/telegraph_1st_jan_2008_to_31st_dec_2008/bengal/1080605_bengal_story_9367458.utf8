          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, June 4: A Class IX student here has been suspended after he was caught taking a lady teachers picture on his mobile phone.        
	The teacher spotted him taking her photograph on Saturday and seized the phone.         
	She then called us and we were shocked to see many obscene photographs saved in the phones memory. We immedi-ately called the boys parents and placed him under suspension, a senior teacher said.        
	The 15-year-old, teachers said, was a good student. He was always very attentive and scored well in his examinations. But this incident has left us devastated. It is a matter of concern, the teacher said.        
	The secretary of the school managing committee, lawyer Subir Bhowmik, is out of station. The decision on whether to expel the boy will be taken at a meeting of the managing committee to be held after the secretary returns, the headmaster said.        
	The school, which had opened last week after summer vacation, closed down again today with the arrival of a government circular saying the holidays were being extended because of the hot spell in the state.         
	The headmaster, however, has banned all students from carrying mobiles to school. If anyone is caught with one, he will be expelled immediately.        
	Parents should not allow the use of mobile phones among children as they were bound to be misused, he added.        
	We still remember how a Delhi boy had filmed his sexual encounter with a classmate on his phone and circulated the clips among friends. The MMS had been put on sale on the Net, said another teacher.        
	Police said their hands were tied. We still dont have laws to tackle such crimes, said Malda police chief Satyajit Bandyopadhyay.

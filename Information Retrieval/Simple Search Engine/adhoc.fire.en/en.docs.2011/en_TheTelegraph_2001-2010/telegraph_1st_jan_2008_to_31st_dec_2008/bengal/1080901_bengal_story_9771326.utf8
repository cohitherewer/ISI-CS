The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Unbiased umpire has CPM smirking
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Unbiased umpire has CPM smirking
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the rally. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 31: The CPM has found in Gopalkrishna Gandhis letter an opportunity to urge Mamata Banerjee to come to the negotiation table but the party frowned on the governors proposal to involve an unbiased intermediator.         
	The governor has sent her (Mamata) a letter urging (her) to solve the dispute through discussions. We have been requesting her for the same approach. She should join the dialogue without setting conditions and forward her proposals instead of sticking to the return of 400 acres, Left Front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose said.         
	The government plans to hold an all-party meeting on Singur on Tuesday or Wednesday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told allies at a front meeting today.        
	There is no love lost between the CPM and the governor since he expressed cold horror over the police action in Nandigram last year.         
	Gandhis suggestion of an independent scrutiny of the positions of both sides by an unbiased intermediator with no political or industrial affiliation has also not gone down well.         
	Who is apolitical? asked Bose. There is no apolitical side in this dispute.         
	Asked if the party would accept the governor as a mediator, he said: Let the proposal come from him.                 
	Both the CPM and the government have reasons not to be elated at Gandhis move.         
	His letter to Mamata proposes the status quo on the sites belonging to the owners unwilling to part with them (their plots) be maintained until the intermediators recommendation becomes available...         
	A CPM state secretariat member said: This would suit Mamata as it would defer the completion of the Nano project and make the fate of the ancillary units uncertain.         
	A section of the party welcomed any credible third-party mediation, including the governors, because of the necessity to persuade Mamata to come to the talks table, but others didnt conceal their disappointment.        
	 I am not sure about the governors intention. He essentially stood by the Opposition till the rural polls and still continues the power satyagraha in Raj Bhavan to embarrass the government, said Benoy Konar.         
	 The chief minister avoided mentioning the governors move while addressing a front gathering to remember the martyrs of the 1959 food movement this afternoon.         
	The governor has sent a copy of the letter to me. Let Mamata decide first on his proposals, a front leader quoted Bhattacharjee as telling todays front meeting.         
	Both at the closed-door front meeting and the public rally, he ruled out relocation of the ancillary units from the Tata Motors plant site and return of 400 acres to unwilling farmers.         
	The demand of the 600:400 divide of the project land is absurd. The car plant wont be possible if we shift the ancillary units. Dont make demands that are not realistic or legally untenable, he told the rally.        
	But the chief minister still wants a dialogue with Mamata. I have never written so many letters to anybody in my life. I am still ready for discussions on compensation and rehabilitation of the landlosers.

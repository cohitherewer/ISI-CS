	Midnapore, July 20: The CPM and CPI labour arms took out processions on the IIT Kharagpur campus today, demanding jobs for over 50 supporters with the caterers running hostel canteens.     
	This is the first time private firms have been engaged. Classes will resume tomorrow after the summer break and freshers will arrive. If this continues, 1,500 students will go without food, said dean of students affairs D.K. Tripathi.         
	Tamluk: Hundreds of people surrounded Nandigram police station on Sunday night after the force allegedly opened fire, injuring a Trinamul supporter. Police denied the firing, said to have taken place when they tried to make their way through a mob after a CPM-Trinamul clash. Some 10km away in Tekhali, a Trinamul mob attacked a police jeep and chased its occupants.

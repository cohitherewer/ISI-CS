	Darjeeling, Nov. 13: An army truck mowed down a 14-year-old student of St Josephs School (North Point) this afternoon, sparking protests that shut down the hill town for the rest of the day.        
	Harsh Agarawal, whose school was closed because of a students strike, was returning from his fathers garments shop in Chowk Bazar around 12.45pm when he came under the wheels of the truck on NC Goenka Road. The vehicle was part of a convoy of seven.        
	Sandip Lakhotia, a witness, said there were three children standing at the bend when the truck suddenly tried to reverse. Two children managed to duck but one of them fell and was killed.         
	The bend is narrow and always crowded, he added.         
	Harshs uncle Shiv Agarawal said: His skull was completely crushed and his face distorted beyond recognition.         
	Some officers of the Dogra Regiment, stationed at nearby Lebong, who came to the spot were almost lynched by a crowd. They were slapped and Colonel S.S. Danus identity card was snatched before police and the Gorkha Nari Morcha arrived. Around 100 members of the Morcha put up a human wall between the police and the protesters.        
	The mob threw stones at the killer truck and overturned the jeep that had brought Col Danu. The trucks driver, Arup Roy of the Army Service Corps, has been arrested.         
	The police said the convoy was coming from 17th Mile in Gangtok. The army said it was bringing ration.         
	The violence prompted shopkeepers to down shutters and most residents did not dare venture out of home.        
	Father Kinley Tshering, the rector of St Josephs School, said: I express my condolence to the bereaved family. Scheduled programmes like a social on Saturday and a fete on Sunday will be put off till further notice as a mark of respect to Agarawal.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 8: Calcutta High Court has said a separate commission should be set up to select candidates to be appointed as non-teaching staff in state-aided schools.        
	Hundreds of cases have been filed in the high court in the last five years accusing schools of discrimination in appointing non-teaching employees, a division bench of Justices A. Banerjee and T.K. Giri said yesterday. Only a separate commission can solve the problem.         
	The judges added that till the government sets up the panel, the School Service Commission, which selects candidates for teaching posts in schools, can be entrusted with the job.         
	We are sending the issue to the chief justice of the high court, requesting him to set up a five-judge special bench to amend the law so that the government can set up the panel.         
	School authorities currently pick candidates from lists sent by employment exchanges.

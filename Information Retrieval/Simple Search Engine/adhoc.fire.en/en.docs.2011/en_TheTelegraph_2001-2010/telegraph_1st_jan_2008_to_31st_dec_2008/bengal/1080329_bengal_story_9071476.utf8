The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM minority trio quit party
                                                                                                               CPM minority trio quit party
                            
	Behrampore, March 28: Three CPM members quit the party in Murshidabad last evening, accusing it of doing nothing for minorities.        
	The trio from Jalangi, about 260km from Calcutta, have joined the Congress. We read about the Sachar Committee report, which said Muslims in Bengal were lagging behind in all respects and that the CPM government had done nothing for their uplift. The report has opened our eyes, said Nurul Islam, 43, who has studied till Class X and owns a nursery.        
	Idris Ali, 55, and Jan Mohammad, 53, who dropped out of high school to till their land, echoed him.         
	In neighbouring Nadia, minister Abdus Sattar had yesterday admitted that Muslim women were treated as unequal citizens in Bengal.

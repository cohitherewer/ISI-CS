                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Farmers deny land claim
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Durgapur, Dec. 20: The power minister today asked Burdwan district officials to complete land acquisition formalities in Katwa for a power plant after being told that most farmers had agreed, but the land owners have denied the claim.        
	Minister Mrinal Banerjee today told a news conference: I have learnt from my party and the administration that those who had been unwilling to give up land have changed their minds after being told about the lucrative compensation. Most have now agreed.... I have asked the Burdwan district magistrate to expedite the land acquisition process.        
	Some unwilling farmers in Katwa, however, expressed surprise at the decision. We are not going to give up our land for the power project. The government will have to set up the plant on our dead bodies, said Rabi Roy, president of the Save Farm Land Committee.         
	A total of 1,033 acres is required from 4,600 farmers. The proposed power project will cost around Rs 8,000 crore.        
	Banerjee had earlier decided to shift the project to Sagardighi in Murshidabad following the farmers resistance.         
	But some in the CPM, it seems, told him at a meeting in Burdwan last week that there would be no problem of acquiring land urged him to start work soon. The CPMs Burdwan district secretary, Amal Halder, said: We told the minister that land acquisition would not be problem here. Farmers have realised that the project would help Katwa.        
	District magistrate Manish Jain claimed today hearings for the acquisition were done. We are getting a good response from the farmers, he said.         
	But landowner Roy said the minister had been misinformed.        
	Prashanta Ghosh, a farmer from Debkundu mouza, said the land was their mother. Does anybody sell his mother? It is better to die than sell our mother, said Ghosh,

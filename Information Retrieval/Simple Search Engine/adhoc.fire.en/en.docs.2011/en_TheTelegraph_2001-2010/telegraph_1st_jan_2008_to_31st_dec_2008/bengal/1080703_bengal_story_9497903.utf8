          OUR BUREAU                              
	July 2: The results in north Bengal have proved bitter for the CPM, with the Forward Bloc allegedly backing Independents in Cooch Behars Mekhliganj to wipe out the party from the civic body and the RSP leaving it a distant second in South Dinajpurs Balurghat.         
	Bloc nominees won five seats in Mekhliganj while the Independents, who fought the CPM, won the remaining four.        
	In 2003, when the CPM and the Bloc had won four seats apiece in the nine-seat municipality, it was decided that each party would run the board for two-and-half years. But the CPM, led by chairman Dilip Burman, continued for the whole term, an observer said.        
	The rift between the parties deepened this February, when police fired on Bloc supporters who had stormed the subdivisional office in Dinhata. Five of them were killed.         
	District Bloc secretary Udayan Guha was tight-lipped about the results today. The front has won, he said, denying any party backing for the Independents.        
	Guhas CPM counterpart Chandi Pal declined comment.        
	However, unlike in Mekhliganj, CPM councillors will find berths in the RSP-led board in Balurghat.

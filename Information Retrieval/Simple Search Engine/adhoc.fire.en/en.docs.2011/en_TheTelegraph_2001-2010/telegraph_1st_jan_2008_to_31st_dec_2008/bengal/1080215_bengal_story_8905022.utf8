The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPI fury on health team
                                                                                                               CPI fury on health team
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Feb. 14: CPI workers today gheraoed members of the Assembly standing committee on health at Chilkigarh, a tourist spot near Jhargram, accusing them of wasting government money on sightseeing instead of inspecting the local hospital.        
	Police officers escorting the team arrested local CPI leaders Sudip Mukherjee and Gurupada Mondal on the charge of heckling the visitors. But they were released later.         
	The standing committee members said they were waiting for a colleague and decided to visit Chilkigarh in the meantime.         
	We visited the hospital after our colleague arrived. We have done nothing illegal, chairperson Tapati Saha told reporters.        
	The MLAs team had gone to the sub-divisional hospital at Ghatal in West Midnapore yesterday and drove down to Jhargram, in the same district, last night.         
	This morning, the team was supposed to visit the Jhargram sub-divisional hospital but they went to Chilkigarh, 10km away, instead.        
	CPI leaders in Jhargram were waiting at the hospital with a memorandum highlighting the lack of doctors and ambulance facilities.        
	We were shocked to hear that the standing committee members had already met health officials at the tourist lodge last night and left for Chilkigarh this morning, said Asim Roy, secretary of the CPIs Jhargram local committee.        
	The CPI leaders then headed for Chilkigarh, led by Roy.        
	They found the team near the Kanak Durga temple. Our workers asked them what they were doing at the tourist spot when they were supposed to be at the hospital, said Roy.        
	A police officer escorting the team said a war of words led to some members being pushed around.         
	Some members told the CPI workers that they were not answerable to them. We will only give an explanation to the Speaker of the Assembly, they shouted, the officer said.

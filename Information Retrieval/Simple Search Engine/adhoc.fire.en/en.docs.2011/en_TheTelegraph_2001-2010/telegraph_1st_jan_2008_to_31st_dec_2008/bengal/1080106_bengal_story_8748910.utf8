The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rs 25-lakh dinner sets, wine glasses missing
                                                                                                            Rs 25-lakh dinner sets, wine glasses missing
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 5: Crockery, cutlery and glasses that could be worth Rs 25 lakh have allegedly been stolen from a Queens Park house.         
	Rajarshi Mohan Chatterjee lodged a complaint at Ballygunge police station today, accusing a real estate agency that had opened an office in his house of the theft.        
	Chatterjee, a businessman, said among the things stolen were wine glasses made of Belgian glass and dinner sets that were over a century old. They would be worth Rs 25 lakh.        
	Chatterjee realised the valuables were missing on December 15.         
	Employees of the real estate agency had apparently promised to return the articles when Chatterjee pointed out that they had gone missing from one of the rooms they were occupying.        
	Detective department deputy commissioner Jawed Shamim said: He got in touch with us when one of the employees of the agency told him that the articles could not be traced and it would not be possible to return them.        
	According to Chatterjee, the first floor of the two-storey house, a joint property of the Chatterjee family, was sold to a realtor by his uncle Rash Mohan last August. The articles were in a showcase on the first floor. We thought wed move them to the ground floor soon, he said.        
	Rajarshi Mohan Chatterjees family went to collect the valuables on December 15. Employees of the real estate company and guards of a private security agency were on the first floor. I raised a hue and cry after noticing that the articles were missing. The companys caretaker, Debasish Guha, and others told me that the articles must be somewhere on the first floor. They promised to return them in a couple of days, he said today.        
	In his complaint, Chatterjee said he suspected the employees of the real estate company had stolen the articles.         
	The sets of cutlery had been with us for over 100 years. My grandfather, the late Ratan Mohan Chatterjee, saw them in his childhood.        
	His family, Chatterjee said, had stopped going to the first floor after his uncle left the place.         
	Since no one else went up there and thieves had not broken in from outside, it is most likely that the real estate firms employees decamped with the articles, Chatterjee said.

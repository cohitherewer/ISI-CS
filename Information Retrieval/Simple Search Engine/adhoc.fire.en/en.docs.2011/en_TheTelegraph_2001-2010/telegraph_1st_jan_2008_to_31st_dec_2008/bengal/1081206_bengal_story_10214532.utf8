	Santiniketan, Dec. 5: The Prime Minister will land here tomorrow for the Visva-Bharati convocation amid complaints of security arrangements dampening its spirit.         
	The traditional event of the chancellor handing over saptaparnis (leaves from a chhatim tree) to graduates had been scrapped earlier. The customary chief guests speech has also been cancelled.         
	The spirit of the convocation is missing it is more to us than the degree, said Sudhasree Das, a student.        
	Ashramite Swapan Ghosh said never before had a Prime Ministers visit seen such arrangements.

          BISWAJIT ROY                               
	Calcutta, Aug. 29: If Mamata Banerjee comes to the talks table, the government will place before her a proposal to offer alternative plots to landlosers in all future acquisitions, CPM sources said.        
	The sources added that some CPM leaders were open to considering alternative plots for the unwilling landlosers in Singur, as Jyoti Basu had suggested when Mamata approached him earlier. Other leaders, however, had cited how Basu was later convinced that such a move would open a pandoras box.        
	According to the government proposal, those who lose an acre or more will receive 3-6 shataks (33 shataks equal one bigha) of land that they can exploit commercially. Those who give up less than an acre would receive 100 square feet of built-up space.        
	Besides, the compensation for the acquired land would be worked out so that it comes close to its prospective value. Landlosers will also receive an annuity, with the company that gets the land sharing the burden.        
	Although the sources said these proposals were not Singur-specific, CPM state secretary Biman Bose today renewed his appeal to Mamata to agree to talks and present her own alternative proposals.        
	He stressed the need to ensure sustainable livelihood for all landlosers in Singur so that compensation to them is not less than their income from agriculture.        
	The CPM has also sought proposals on alternative rehabilitation packages from its allies in the Left Front, which meets next week.        
	Although Bose denied the CPM would ask front partners to engage Mamata in track II communication, other state secretariat members said they would welcome any move by Trinamul to put forward its proposals to a third party if that helps break the deadlock.        
	Bose said Mamata could continue her satyagraha while talking to the government. He said: The government has shown commendable restraint despite the intimidation of workers and foreign engineers at the Tata Motors site. I appeal to the Trinamul chief to continue her satyagraha in Gandhian fashion as she had promised. She need not withdraw it to join the discussion with the government.

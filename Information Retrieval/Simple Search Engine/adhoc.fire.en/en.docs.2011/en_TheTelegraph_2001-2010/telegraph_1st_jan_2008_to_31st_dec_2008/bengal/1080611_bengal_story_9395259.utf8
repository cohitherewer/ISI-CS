	Purulia, June 10: Police today accused the owner of a 190-year-old gun shop in Purulia town of cooking up a story of robbery to sell arms to people without valid licences.         
	Shekhar Andia Mistri, 53, told the police seven men came in the guise of customers around 6.45am today. They allegedly woke him up for air guns and took away five double-barrel guns, two revolvers and 20 air guns after gagging him and tying him up at gun-point.        
	Purulia superintendent of police Ashok Prasad said the shops inventory did not match the claims of Mistri, about whom Jharkhand police had sent an alert earlier.         
	He added that Mistri could have sold two revolvers to people without valid licences.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | UGC wants evening classes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   UGC wants evening classes
          A STAFF REPORTER                                             
	Calcutta, Sept. 14: The University Grants Commission (UGC) wants the colleges in Bengal to start evening shifts.        
	At a meeting with university vice-chancellors here today, UGC chairman Sukhdeo Thorat asked the colleges to submit proposals to start evening classes.         
	The issue came up when many colleges complained about not being able to admit deserving students because of limited seats.         
	At the three-hour meeting with the university heads in the presence of higher education minister Sudarshan Raychaudhuri and higher education council chairman Subimal Sen, Thorat promised grants for the evening classes once he received the proposals.         
	In the 11th Plan period (2007-12), the UGC wants to attain an 8.79 per cent growth in enrolment in general degree courses and a 14 per cent growth in engineering colleges. The introduction of evening shifts will let us reach more students and help us meet the target we have set for ourselves, said Thorat.        
	Of the three universities coming up in Bengal, Gourbanga in Malda and West Bengal State University in Barasat have got the UGC recognition that makes their certificates valid.         
	Thorat said: UGC teams have visited these two universities and they will soon get the recognition that makes them eligible for grants.        
	Although Aliah University will be recognised within a few months, it will have to wait for the grants.         
	We are looking at the option of providing it grants under the uncovered universities scheme, Thorat said.         
	The UGC is also seriously considering autonomy proposals from several colleges in the state.         
	It has received proposals for autonomy from Ramakrishna Mission Siksha Mandir, Belur, and Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur.         
	A UGC team has already visited the Belur Math campus and its report is with us. A decision on its proposal will be taken shortly, said Thorat.         
	St Xaviers, Calcutta, is the now only autonomous college in Bengal.         
	The minister said the meeting also discussed financial aid and introduction of courses.        
	In the 11th plan period, Thorat said, our grants would double. The colleges and universities just have to send us specific plans to get the grants.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tussle amid talks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tussle amid talks
          INDRANIL GHOSH                              
	Calcutta Sept. 5: The Trinamul Congress delegation was on its feet and about to walk out at one point during todays talks at Raj Bhavan.        
	If you do not want to give us a hearing, there is no point hanging around, a Trinamul member told the government team. The governor defused the situation.        
	After a verbal duel with a government delegate, another Trinamul leader excused himself to use the rest room and called the makeshift party office in Singur to apprise Mamata of the heated exchange.        
	The government has offered the 47-acre package to Trinamul on the hope that the number of claimants will come down considerably when records are checked. The government is also pinning hopes on the possibility of some landlosers opting for shops in the market complex being planned on the 47-acre site.        
	Second, the government has offered to accommodate the demand for more land with a levelled-off site nearby, possibly across the road.         
	A rehabilitation and compensation package is also expected to be offered, based on the contents of a bill lying with a standing committee of Parliament. The bill offers jobs or business units or pension to the displaced.         
	If Mamata accepts the package, it is something she can show off and effectively shut up her critics, said an official.        
	In public, positive notes were struck. We had useful and constructive discussion, governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi said. Both sides exchanged views in a spirit of understanding.        
	Discussions are on, but one can say both sides are looking for a solution, said Trinamul team leader Partha Chatterjee. Our meeting today was constructive, but inconclusive, added industries minister Nirupam Sen.

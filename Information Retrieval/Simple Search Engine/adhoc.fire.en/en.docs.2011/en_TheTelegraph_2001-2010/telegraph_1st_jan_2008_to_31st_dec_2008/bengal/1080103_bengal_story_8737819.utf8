The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Friends and foe hurt CPM
                                                                                                            Friends and foe hurt CPM
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 2: The CPM today called its victory in Balagarh the best possible outcome in the post-Nandigram situation even as Mamata Banerjee claimed moral victory.        
	CPM spokesman Shyamal Chakraborty said: The outcome is a big success in view of the vilification campaign we faced from the Opposition as well as some of our friends.         
	However, he admitted that there was confusion among the voters over the course of development being followed by the government. We have to work hard to dispel all misgivings among the people.         
	Friends were not available at the time of need, Chakraborty said, referring to allies Forward Bloc, RSP and CPI who had held the CPM entirely responsible for the trouble in Nandigram.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose declined comment on the reduced margin before a detailed review in the party.         
	Though numbers suggest otherwise, Chakraborty said: Trinamul would have lost votes had it aligned with the BJP because 15 per cent of the voters were Muslims.         
	Mamata snubbed the Congress for betraying her and putting up its candidate and said: We got votes beyond our expectations. Its our moral victory.        
	The message, she said, was that Trinamul could take on the CPM on its own.         
	Does it mean an end to her call for a grand alliance? We have proved ourselves. Any alliance would have to be under our leadership, said Mamata.

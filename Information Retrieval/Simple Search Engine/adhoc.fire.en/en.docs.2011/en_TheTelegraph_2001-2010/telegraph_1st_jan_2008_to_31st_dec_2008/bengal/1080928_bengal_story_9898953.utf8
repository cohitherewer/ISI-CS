The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | More showers today 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   More showers today 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Shoppers may have beaten the rain hands down, but many schoolgoers had to be equally brave. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                   
	Calcutta, Sept. 27: If Saturday was wet, Sunday could be wetter, the Met office has said.         
	That, however, failed to hold back festival season shoppers, with mall footfall getting heavier through the day.        
	The weather office said a low pressure that formed in the north Bay of Bengal a couple of days ago is moving very slowly towards the Bangladesh coast, bringing the rain.         
	Today, the low pressure remained virtually stationary very close to the Bangladesh coast. Under its influence, we expect more rain tomorrow with some heavy showers in Calcutta and the south Bengal districts, an official said.        
	The low pressure, however, does not appear strong enough to immediately cause very heavy rain that might lead to a deluge. The pressure is weak and there is little chance of it intensifying and causing very heavy rain, the official added.        
	The city woke up to a dull and damp day with rain battering the roads at regular intervals. It rained continuously between 5am and 8am, leading to waterlogging in low-lying areas.         
	Shoppers beat the nagging rain and clogged roads that followed to make the most of the Mahalaya weekend. The malls have changed the way Calcutta shops for Puja. These one-stop destinations ensure easy parking and enough shopping options under one roof, said Sunil Gupta, a young businessman spending the afternoon at South City with his family.        
	Shoppers at New Market were far more at the mercy of the elements, but even that did not slow them down. It is not raining heavily, said Meghna Mukherjee, a college student. At this time of the year, only floods can keep us away, added her friend Pooja Agarwal.        
	Shopkeepers were relieved by the soaring spirits. Our small store in New Market is super-packed. If it rains in the morning, the crowd picks up later in the day, said Shiv Daswani, a partner at Little Shop.        
	When it rains, the crowd thins a bit, but it picks up again, echoed Rajesh Lachwani of Jai Lakshmi Sari House on Rashbehari Avenue.        
	Between 5.30pm yesterday and 5.30pm today, the Met office recorded 32.8mm of rain. It brought down the day temperature by nearly 2 degrees, the maximum being 27.6 degrees.         
	There was heavy rain in parts of Calcutta tonight.

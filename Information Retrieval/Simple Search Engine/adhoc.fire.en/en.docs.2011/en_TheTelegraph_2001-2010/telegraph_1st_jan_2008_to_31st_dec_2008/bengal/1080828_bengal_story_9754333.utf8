                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Truck? Mamata wont budge     -  Plea to clear road rejected
          OUR BUREAU                          Trucks stranded on the Durgapur Expressway on Wednesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	Aug. 27: The Trinamul Congress today turned down truck operators appeal to at least leave one flank of Durgapur Expressway open for a few hours so that goods carriers stran- ded since Sunday could make a move.        
	Mamata Banerjee said her party was not responsible for the impasse, adding that if the state was keen to end it, it would have returned 400 acres to the unwilling farmers.        
	The result: the line of stranded trucks kept getting longer and thousands of tonnes of fruits and vegetables continued to rot on the road.         
	In the afternoon, representatives of a truck operators association met leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee.         
	After a recce of the stranded vehicles down the road, they met the Trinamul leader again this evening with the same appeal, but in vain.         
	From Shaktigarh in Burdwan, the pile of trucks has almost reached Chirkunda on the Bengal-Jharkhand border. Some 20,000 trucks are stuck and vegetables and other essential supplies are rotting, said Satyajit Majumder of the Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators Association.         
	Unless some alternative is worked out, the situation will become unbearable for truck operators.        
	Some of the trucks could be diverted from Mogra, Hooghly, towards Delhi Road, but that would mean a detour of about 300km and the drivers are resisting it.        
	We have told the truck operators that if they are concerned about the decaying, they should also pause to think that we are fighting for a cause that would save land for vegetables to grow in the future, said Chatterjee.         
	The government wants to wait and watch and not apply force to lift the Trinamul blockade, apparently to create public opinion against Mamata Banerjee as prices of fish and vegetables keep rising.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee held a meeting with chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, director-general of police A.B. Vohra, inspector-general (law and order) Raj Kanojia and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen.        
	Sen said the stalemate had to be resolved through talks but added that people wouldnt like the blockade as it would hit them hard.         
	He said: It is known that the truckers will suffer huge losses as their goods will perish. But what about the common man? They will have to fork out more for essentials if the blockade continues and thats something they wont like. That will certainly mount pressure on the protesters and probably make them realise that normality has to be restored.        
	Persuasion, he added, was a better option for the government than using force.        
	IG Kanojia said the Hooghly administration was talking to the leaders of the Singur movement and trying to persuade them to lift the blockade. We are trying to open one flank of the expressway.

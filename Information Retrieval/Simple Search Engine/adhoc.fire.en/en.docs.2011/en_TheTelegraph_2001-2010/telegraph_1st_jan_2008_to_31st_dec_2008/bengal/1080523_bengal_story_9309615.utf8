          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 22: Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today said the Congress would move court against the loss of the Murshidabad zilla parishad by one seat. He alleged the CPM had rigged the result.        
	Of the 63 seats, the Left has won 32 and the Congress 31.        
	I have information that the Murshidabad district administration had acted at the chief ministers behest to ensure the defeat of the Congress candidates by resorting to irregularities during counting, the state Congress chief said. We are consulting legal experts about moving court.        
	Das Munshi said that after counting, the Congress candidate from Hariharpara was initially declared defeated. But he was later found to have won when more ballots stuffed in a box at the centre were taken out and counted.        
	He alleged that poll authorities ordered repolling in booths marked out by minister Anisur Rahman, but not in those demanded by us.

	Behrampore, June 2: A pack of dogs has terrorised people in six villages near Behrampore for over a month.        
	On May 22, eight-year-old Emdadur Rahman of Nabagram died after being bitten by one of the four.         
	Nearly 70 people have been bitten and 16 cows and 30 goats have died from dog bites.         
	Emdadurs father Sayeedur took him to the Gokarna-Kandi block hospital immediately. But I was unable to get him vaccinated. Doctors told me to get certificates from the panchayat pradhan or any other peoples representative. But I could not meet the pradhan as he was busy with the panchayat polls.         
	He then went to a quack. The quack told me to feed him a ripe banana. But my son died the following day.        
	The vaccine scarcity is as much a cause of alarm for the people of Nabagram, Dangapara, Gatla, Bahadurpur, Sholpara and Jamna as the dogs.         
	Block medical officer Bhaskar Baishnab admitted the vaccine crisis.        
	Panchayat pradhan Hafsed Hali said: Everyone was busy with the elections earlier. Now they have woken up.

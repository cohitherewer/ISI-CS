The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bhel engineer hangs
                                                                                                               Bhel engineer hangs
          OUR BUREAU                          Suranjan Roy                                  
	Bakreshwar/Calcutta, Feb. 28: A 25-year-old engineer of Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited was found hanging in his Bakreshwar quarters this morning.         
	Suranjan Roy, a resident of Thakurpukur in south Calcutta, was part of a Bhel team posted at the Bakreshwar Thermal Power Plant in Birbhum to set up two 210MW units.        
	A suicide note, in English, was found in a diary, which said no one was responsible for Suranjans death. But the police are yet to find out what drove the young man to death.        
	Suranjan, a site engineer, had been working at the plant since 2006.         
	Around 10am today, electrician Pradip Sarkar arrived at Suranjans ground-floor home to ask for money the engineer owed him.         
	When repeated knocks on the door did not yield a response, Sarkar went to the back of the house and forced a window open. He saw Suranjan hanging from the ceiling fan. His computer was switched on and his mobile phone was lying on the bed.         
	The police broke open the door of the flat after Suranjans elder brother Deepanjan, a lawyer, arrived.        
	Suranjans family cant fathom why he had killed himself. We find it difficult to believe and dont know how to react. I had a healthy chat with him on the phone at 10.30 last night. We spoke for almost half an hour, Deepanjan said.

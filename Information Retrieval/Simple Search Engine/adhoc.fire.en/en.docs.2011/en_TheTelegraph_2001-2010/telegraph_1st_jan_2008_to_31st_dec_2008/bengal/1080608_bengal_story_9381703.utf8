	Tamluk, June 7: Tension brewing in Nandigram since the lynching of a CPM supporter a fortnight ago erupted early this morning, leading to clashes that left many Trinamul Congress supporters homeless at Simulkundu village.        
	Although Trinamul has won all 10 gram panchayats in Nandigram, it lost a seat to the CPM in Simulkundu.         
	CRPF and police personnel started patrolling the village following stray clashes but the bigger trouble started after they left around 2am today.         
	CPM supporters surrounded Trinamul houses and fired in the air and hurled bombs to scare the residents. About 200 people fled their homes, said a police officer.

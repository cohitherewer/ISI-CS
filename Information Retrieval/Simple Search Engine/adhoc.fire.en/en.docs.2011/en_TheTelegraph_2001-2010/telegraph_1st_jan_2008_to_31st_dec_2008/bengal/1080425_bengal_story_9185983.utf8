          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 24: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today met agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan and sought his advice on how to make fallow land cultivable and increase productivity across the state.        
	Members of the state agriculture commission had met a week ago and decided to seek the opinion of the relevant government departments on how to improve land productivity and ensure proper use of high-quality fertilisers.        
	The chief minister sought some proposals from Swaminathan that can help make the agriculture commission report sound and effective, an official of the state secretariat said.

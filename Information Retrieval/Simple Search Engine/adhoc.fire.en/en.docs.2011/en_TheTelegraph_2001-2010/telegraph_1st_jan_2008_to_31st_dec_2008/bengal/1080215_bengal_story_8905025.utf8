                                                                                                               Solar plant pact signed
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 14: The Power Finance Corporation and the West Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation today signed an agreement to set up a 2MW solar power plant in Asansols Dishergarh.        
	The first phase of the project will be completed by June this year, while the government aims to finish the remaining work by the year-end. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 41.2 crore, of which Rs 30.9 crore will be provided by the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) as loan.         
	This is a very important project for us as our government has been stressing the importance of solar power for a long time. We are grateful to the PFC for extending a soft loan to set up the plant, power minister Mrinal Banerjee said.        
	The 8.3 acres required for the project will be provided by the Dishergarh Power Supply Company at a reasonable rate, he added.        
	S.P. Gon Chaudhuri, managing director of the green energy corporation, said the plant would produce 33 lakh units of power.         
	The cost per unit of power will work out to Rs 15, but consumers will be charged the existing electricity rates. The Centre will provide an incentive for every unit of power produced, which will work as a subsidy in reducing generation costs, Gon Chaudhuri, a signatory to the agreement, added.

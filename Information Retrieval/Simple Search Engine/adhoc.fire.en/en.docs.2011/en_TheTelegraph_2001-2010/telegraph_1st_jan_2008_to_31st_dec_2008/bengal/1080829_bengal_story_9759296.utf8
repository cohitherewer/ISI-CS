                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Singur stares at food crunch
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                              (Top) Amit Hambir, Keshab Hambir				                                 
	Singur, Aug. 28: The people of Singur are feeling the siege pinch with food supplies having stopped, leading to a price rise.         
	Already, the prices of pulses, mustard oil and soap have gone up. Although the rise is not steep now, it will shoot up in the next few days if the dharna continues, said 25-year-old Amit Hambir, a resident of Kismatjampukur.        
	Wholesale traders from Calcutta stopped sending goods to Singur shops after Mamata Banerjee began her dharna on August 24, causing thousands of trucks to get stranded on Durgapur Expressway.        
	We used to get masur dal at Rs 65 a kg at the local grocers. Now it costs Rs 74 a kg. The price of mustard oil has risen by Rs 8 a kg, said Amit, whose father was a bargadar. The familys 10-cottah plot was taken for the Tata Motors small-car project.        
	I do not support Mamatas way of protesting. She began an agitation for the people of Singur but they are the ones who are hit by this price rise, Amit said.         
	There is fear that if the siege continues for too long, Singurs shops may run out of essentials. What shall we eat then? asked octogenarian Ratan Das of Bajemelia.        
	Labourers who have lost work days at the plant and are paying more for food are doubly hit.         
	Keshab Hambir, who worked at the site but stopped going from August 24, said: I am landless and have to work every day to feed six mouths. Its difficult when the prices are rising and I am losing my wage of Rs 80 a day.

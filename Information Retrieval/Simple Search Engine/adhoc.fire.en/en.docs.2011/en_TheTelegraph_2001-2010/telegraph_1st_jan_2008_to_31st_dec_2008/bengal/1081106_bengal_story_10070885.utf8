	Nov. 5: Representatives of First Automobile Works, Chinas largest automobile company, today went to Singur scouting for land to set up a car plant.        
	The team reached Singur this evening and surveyed the project area that had been leased out for the Tata Nano project for 45 minutes.        
	This morning, the team visited Kharagpur. The officials were taken to see land near Jakpur and a plot near Guptamoni by officials of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation and Ural India. The company wants to set up the plant in collaboration with Ural India.         
	The team also surveyed a 230-acre plot belonging to the Haldia Development Authority adjacent to the Ural India factory that assembles dumpers. Ural India chairman J.K. Saraff said if land was not available in Haldia, the plant could come up in Kharagpur or Singur. Search for land is on.

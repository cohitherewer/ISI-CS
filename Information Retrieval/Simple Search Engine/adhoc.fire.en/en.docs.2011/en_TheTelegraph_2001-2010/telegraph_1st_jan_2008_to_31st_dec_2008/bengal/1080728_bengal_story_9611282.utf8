          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, July 27: A CPM youth wing member was app-arently caught in a crossfire and shot dead by supporters of a Somen Mitra loyalist in a Nadia bazaar this morning.        
	The Congress rebels led by Subal Kangshabanik started firing after CPM supporters allegedly hurled bombs in Nabadwip, 100km from Calcutta.         
	Kangshabanik, known to be close to Mitra who has now aligned with Mamata Baner- jee, was returning to his Mahindra Bolero after shopping when a bomb exploded near him around 8.30am.         
	His associates whipped out revolvers and started firing indiscriminately, sparking panic in the busy market. Gauranga Biswas, 30, was killed on the spot.        
	Gauranga fell victim to a gang war, said CPM local committee secretary Gour Das.        
	Police were not certain whether he was there to shop or among those who hurled bombs. A probe is on, said additional superintendent Subrata Mitra.        
	According to the police, it was the rebel Congress activists who took Gauranga and Kangshabanik, 60, to the district hospital. From there, the rebels disappeared.        
	Kangshabanik, who suffered splinter injuries in the head, abdomen and limbs, said from hospital that CPM cadres had attacked him. I can give their names to the police.

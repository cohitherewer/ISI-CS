The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Plan for clerk selection panel
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Plan for clerk selection panel
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 9: The government is considering setting up a staff selection commission to recruit lower-division clerks in the districts, instead of allowing departments to appoint personnel on their own.        
	The move follows allegations of irregularities by the Forward Bloc-run agriculture department during a recruitment drive in January.        
	Chief secretary A.K. Deb is studying the plan to set up the new panel and a draft to be prepared in this regard will be vetted by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, sources at Writers Buildings said.        
	A key finance department official said: Discussions have been held with the labour department on how to recruit staff who are not selected by the public service commission. This would apply mainly to clerks. The chief secretary is studying the file.         
	Later, recruitment of Group D staff can also be brought under the ambit of the proposed commission, he added.        
	Government employees union, Nabaparjay, had accused the agriculture department of gross irregularities during recruitment through employment exchanges.         
	The chief secretary had conducted an inquiry and the recruitment process was eventually stalled.        
	The need to set up a new commission arose because of certain controversies relating to departmental recruitment. We are working on the structure of the proposed commission so that recruitment for non-public service commission posts can be done at the earliest, chief secretary Deb said.        
	The state public service commission selects lower-division clerks for the state secretariat and directorate offices in the city. In the districts, the departments have the power to recruit their staff.        
	The objective of setting up a staff selection commission is to ensure the departments dont have a say in the selection of candidates, said a treasury department official.         
	The recent recruitments by the agriculture and food departments  both controlled by the Forward Bloc  had raised eyebrows and the government was highly embarrassed by allegations of malpractice and nepotism.        
	The CPM-backed employees co-ordination committee supports the move to ensure transparency in recruitment.

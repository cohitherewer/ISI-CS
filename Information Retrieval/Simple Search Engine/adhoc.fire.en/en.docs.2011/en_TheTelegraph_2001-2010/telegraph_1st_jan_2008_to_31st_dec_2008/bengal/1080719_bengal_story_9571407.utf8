          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, July 18: A section of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters, especially cab drivers and owners who are feeling the pinch of potholed roads with government work grinding to a halt because of bandhs, has decided to protest against it with another strike.         
	They have called a called for a 12-hour transport shutdown on July 24 to protest bad roads, a nightmare in the hills in monsoon.         
	Many might be inconvenienced, but they must realise that if we keep mum, things will remain the same for a long time, said Sunchin Rai, the secretary of the Darjeeling-Pul Block-level Transport Owners and Drivers Association, backed by the Morcha.        
	Since the government appointed a new administrator to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council in March, it has hardly functioned. The council has Rs 121 crore, but home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said it had not been possible to utilise the funds.        
	Morcha chief Bimal Gurung is not bothered. Our agitation is for Gorkhaland and not for development and sops the government wants to offer, he said.        
	With the Morcha indifferent and the council administration missing, residents are taking it upon themselves to salvage the situation in some places. In Takdah-Glenburn, 25km from here, they are repairing a road that serves as a lifeline to over 1,000 people with their own funds. How long can we wait? said Naresh Subba, a representative of the drivers and owners body.         
	People are worried that bad roads will severely hit the economy when the time comes to sell local oranges, ginger and broomsticks. Our transport costs will eat into our profits, a farmer said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hooghly high tide frees ship
                                                                                                               Hooghly high tide frees ship
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 23: The ship from Colombo that got stuck in the Hooghly riverbed near Diamond Harbour yesterday was released automatically with the advent of high tide late last night.        
	The container vessel with 20 crew members reached Calcutta, 60km away, today.         
	The steering had got jammed while the master of CS Signe was trying to negotiate a sharp bend near Nurpur and the vessel rammed into a jetty owned by the Calcutta Port Trust.        
	Port officials said there are two sharp bends near Diamond Harbour. The vessel sailed through the first bend but faltered when it came to the second  between Diamond Harbour and Falta  which is sharper.        
	The vessel, anchored at Diamond Harbour at night, started for Kidderpore today.         
	A tug had been kept on standby to push the vessel into deep water but it was not required, a port trust official said. The ship was not damaged and is unloading containers at the dock.        
	The 140m-long vessel carrying 384 containers weighing 6,370 tonnes had pierced the Hooghly Point jetty. Part of it went up on the bank.         
	Port trust vessels on survey missions use the jetty.

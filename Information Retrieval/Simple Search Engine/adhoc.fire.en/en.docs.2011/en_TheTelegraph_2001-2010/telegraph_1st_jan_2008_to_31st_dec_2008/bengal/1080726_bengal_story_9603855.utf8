	Darjeeling, July 25: Czech scientist Petr Svacha and his associate Emil Kucera were today granted interim bail after they spent more than a month in jail since being held on charges of collecting insects from a national park here.         
	During the bail period, the two will not be allowed to go outside Darjeeling subdivision without the courts permission. They will also have to report to the investigating officer twice a week.

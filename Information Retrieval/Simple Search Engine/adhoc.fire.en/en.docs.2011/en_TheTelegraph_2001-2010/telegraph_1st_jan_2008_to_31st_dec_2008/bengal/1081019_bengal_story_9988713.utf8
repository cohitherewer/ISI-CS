                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   City dengue alert
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 18: A survey by the National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases has detected nearly 40 cases of dengue in north Calcuttas Narkeldanga and Phoolbagan areas in the last 20 days.        
	We received the copy of the latest report yesterday and it will be sent to the CMC, a senior health department official said today.         
	The civic authorities said they had already started an awareness drive in the areas.         
	The institute, implementing the Paediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative programme under which it does tests for the disease, said in a report to the health department that 55 cases were found in ward 30. This report, covering Narkeldanga and Phoolbagan, was filed in September.         
	After that, 40 more cases were found positive in the last 20 days. The CMC, however, said that since January 1, only 51 cases were detected in the city.        
	The civic body slapped a notice on NRS Medical College and Hospital today after mosquito larvae were found in accumulated water inside the hospital campus.

	Singur, Aug. 24: The message crackled around 2pm: Mamata Banerjee is past the Dankuni crossing.        
	A shuffling of feet followed by a flurry of activity greeted the news at the police control tower outside the Santi Ceramics factory, off the supply gate of the Tata Motors plant.         
	Some officers scurried to inform their superiors while others waited for orders. They were glued to their hand-held Manpacks  portable radio sets  for the final command before taking position.         
	Some were posted inside the Tata Motors plant, others around the boundary wall, near podium No. 7 from where Mamata launched her indefinite siege.         
	The police have set up 12 towers around vital installa- tions on the factory premises. They are also keeping watch from 16 points along the gates that are already shielded by the Rapid Action Force and layers of bamboo fences and iron railings.         
	Planning and information are our biggest weapons today, a senior district police officer said as he sifted through a pile of papers.         
	The printouts  containing details of police postings  had been taken from a computer at the control tower a few minutes ago.         
	After going through them, the officer began making calls to check whether the men were at their allotted spots.         
	With the chief minister making it clear that Singur should not snowball into another Nandigram, the police cannot afford a mistake.         
	We had a briefing session yesterday, where it was announced that our main job would be to protect the assets of the Tata project and maintain law and order. It was made clear that there should not be any confrontation with political parties and their supporters, said a deputy superintendent from an adjoining district.         
	Around 25 deputy superintendents from across the state are now on duty in Singur.         
	In keeping with their brief, the police refrained from rushing into action when news reached them this morning that some local youths had tried to strike at the Tata Motors wall in Gopalnagar.         
	There was no damage to the wall and with the police staying away, the incident did not attract much attention.         
	The Trinamul Congress has declared that it will hold a peaceful agitation and we are going by their leaders word. We are here only to maintain law and order, said Kuldiep Singh, inspector-general, western range.         
	Of the 40,000 people who had assembled since early this morning, only about 2,000 stayed back for the night. Most of them squatted around the Trinamul podiums while some lay down on the Durgapur Expressway. But the police did not make any attempt to clear the road.         
	A 4km stretch of the road is likely to be closed to traffic tomorrow as well. Vehicles are having to make a detour via GT Road to escape Singur.        
	We dont know how long the agitation will continue. If this road is closed for days, we may have to intervene. But we dont know how we will do that, an officer said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, July 14: A bus conductor recognised the 18-year-old who had molested a schoolgirl yesterday among passengers and caught him in Nabadwip today.        
	Bubai Banerjees bid to flee failed as other passengers pounced on him as well.         
	After a nights hiding at a friends house, he was scooting from the Nadia town. But the journey was cut short.         
	The conductor recognised him from the description circulated by the local bus operators union. We all knew about the incident and that police were looking for him. As soon as I saw him, I raised the alarm. About 40 passengers helped me catch him, said Asish Saha.        
	The bus screeched to a halt near Bishnupur, on the outskirts of Nabadwip, 100km from Calcutta, as one of the passengers called the police over his phone.        
	Bubai, a conductors helper on another route, had targeted the Class VI girl returning home from school. The incident occurred after the conductor got down as the bus neared its terminus and two passengers fled at the first hint of trouble.        
	The girl was able to tell the culprits name to the police because she remembered a tattoo on his arm that read Bubai.        
	The police had raided Bubais house twice yesterday, but in vain. He confessed to the crime today, said Pradyut Banerjee, the inspector in charge of Nabadwip.

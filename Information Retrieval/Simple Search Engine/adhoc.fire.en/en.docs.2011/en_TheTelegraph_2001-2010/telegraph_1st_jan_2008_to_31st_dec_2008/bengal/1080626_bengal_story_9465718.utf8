          OUR BUREAU                              
	June 25: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leaders meeting the chief minister on Friday will press for tripartite talks also involving Delhi while the government will stress on more teeth for the hill council and restoration of peace in the region.        
	We agreed to attend the meeting to open up a dialogue to fulfil our state-hood demand. We will stick to just one agenda, that is, to request Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to convene a tripartite meeting, said Amar Lama, a Morcha central committee member.         
	Lama, Anmole Prasad, Raju Pradhan and Dinesh Chandra Rai, who reached Calcutta yesterday, met supporters in the city today. Tomorrow, well meet a group of students. We want to know their views as well, said Lama.         
	The hill party is aware that the state will want to discuss the regions development. They will push their own agenda at the meeting. But we are firm on our stand: a tripartite meeting has to be convened, Lama said.         
	His leader, Bimal Gurung, had yesterday said: We must not make a mistake for our ultimate aim is to attain statehood.        
	Sources in the chief ministers secretariat said the government would not discuss statehood. The Morcha will not be prevented from bringing up the issue, but the demand will be politely turned down, a senior official said.         
	The hill party will be reminded of the all-party resolution against any division of the state.        
	After judging the mood of the Morcha delegation, the chief minister may talk about bringing in more areas in the Terai and the Dooars under the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council and granting it more financial powers.         
	The Morcha leaders will be told not to call bandhs, which are hurting the hill economy, and to refrain from blocking National Highway 31A, the lifeline to Sikkim.        
	The Morcha knows the states likely response to its demand and is looking at the meeting more as a confidence-building measure. Statehood talks can only take place in the Centres presence, a leader said in Darjeeling.        
	In Calcutta, the official said: Let there be a few rounds of bipartite talks first to allow a solution to emerge.         
	A tripartite meeting on the hill council or issues of development is possible only when discussions with the state fail, he added.        
	Lama accused many ministers in Bengal of still calling us outsiders. He said: We will use this point to argue in our favour.        
	Hill affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya had earlier said outsiders were creating trouble in Siliguri.

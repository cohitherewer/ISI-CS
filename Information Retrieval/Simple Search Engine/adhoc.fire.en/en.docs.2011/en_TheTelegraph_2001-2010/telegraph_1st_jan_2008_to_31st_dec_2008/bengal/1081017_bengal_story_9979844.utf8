                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Pact for 10000MW plant
                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 16: The government today signed a deal with NRI businessman Prasoon Mukherjees Universal Success Enterprise for a 10,000MW power plant.        
	The power plant, to be completed in phases over 10-12 years, would come up in south Bengal, where port facilities are available. The construction of a new port is also on the cards, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said after the memorandum of understanding was signed.         
	A 2,000MW plant will be initially built on 1,000 acres, Deb added. Around 4,000 acres will be needed for the project.         
	Universal will directly buy the land from farmers, with the government acting as a facilitator.         
	We have not identified the land. But we shall go ahead only if we get the peoples consent, chairman Mukherjee said when asked about farmers opposition to industrial projects in the Trinamul Congress-controlled coastal districts of South 24-Parganas and East Midnapore.         
	Katwa power plant        
	In Katwa, Burdwan, where Trinamul is opposing a 1,320MW plant, its leaders today threatened a militant agitation. The government is acquiring land there for the state-run plant.

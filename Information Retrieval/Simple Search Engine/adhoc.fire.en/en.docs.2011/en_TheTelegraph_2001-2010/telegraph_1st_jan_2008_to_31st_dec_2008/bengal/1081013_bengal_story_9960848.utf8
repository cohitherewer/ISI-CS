	Purulia, Oct. 12: Three people were killed and 52 injured when a Matador van carrying people home from a traditional buffalo fighting contest rammed into a stationary bus in Purulias Hura this afternoon.        
	The dead  Ramesh Mahato, 32, Sarat Mahato, 35, and Sufal Mahato  were residents of Ramnagar village, on the outskirts of Purulia town.         
	Anil Mahato, who owns a buffalo, had gone to Puncha to take part in the popular tribal contest and his 54 neighbours had accompanied him.        
	Anil had hired the van to carry his cheerleaders.        
	 The Matador, travelling at great speed, hit the bus, which was standing on the road for passengers around 2.30pm. The van overturned but those in the bus sustained only minor injuries, said a police officer from Hura, about 280km from Calcutta.        
	Samir Mahato, a villager who had rushed to help, said the van driver had managed to jump out before the crash. He has been arrested.        
	The driver was drunk. He probably picked up speed and could not control the vehicle, said Samir.

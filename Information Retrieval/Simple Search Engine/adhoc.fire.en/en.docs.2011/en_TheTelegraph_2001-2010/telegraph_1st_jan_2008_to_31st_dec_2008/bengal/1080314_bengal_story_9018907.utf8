The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mad dash to doom
                                                                                                               Mad dash to doom
                                          Abhijit Samanta can barely walk a few steps before he starts panting.
    The 33-year-old was shot just below his neck as he cycled furiously to make sure his sister was safe. Sulekha Kajli was part of a Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee group trying to beat back trigger-happy policemen from Bhangabera.
    ldquo;I never dabbled in politics and did not have the faintest idea of what was in store for me, rdquo; Abhijit said.
    The farmer, who owns a two-bigha plot, said that when he heard where his sister was, he panicked. 
    ldquo;My heart was racing and I pedalled hard. I saw my sister writhing in pain. Seconds later, a bullet hit me and I fainted, rdquo; said the father of two.
    ldquo;We have spent virtually all our savings on my treatment and now I have switched to homoeopathy, rdquo; said Abhijit.          The wound in her lower back still hurts, but seeing her schoolgoing daughter forced to sit at home pains her more. 
      Tapasi Das, 32, was fleeing home when a police bullet came flying her way. 
    Her house-painter husband Sambhu has since then been toiling to pay for her treatment but couldn rsquo;t earn enough to send 14-year-old Ruposhi (in picture with her mother) to school.
    ldquo;The future looks bleak, rdquo; sighed Sambhu as he got ready to face another day.

	Kandi, May 5: The Congress faces a peculiar situation in Kandi block of Murshidabad.         
	The AICC member and former leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Atish Sinha, has fielded 147 Independent candidates.        
	The move is being seen as a revenge on Behrampore MP and district party chief Adhir Chowdhury who, he believes, was behind his defeat in the 2006 Assembly polls. Sinha had lost from his stronghold, Kandi, to an Independent in 2006.        
	I will do as much damage as I can to the Congress led by Adhir Chowdhury. If my candidates dont win, they will ensure the defeat of Congress candidates, said Sinha.        
	Chowdhury said Sinha would have no impact on the polls.

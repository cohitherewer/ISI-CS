          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Oct. 27: Villagers unwilling to give their plots for a proposed shipyard in Geonkhali have said they will not discuss land acquisition with the government but only with the projects investors.        
	Goutam Batabyal, secretary of the Deulpota Seva Samity that represents Geonkhalis unwilling farmers, said the forum would not tolerate the hand of the government in the land acquisition process. It will be an exercise in futility if we sit for discussions with the administration. The investors in Geonkhali will have to talk to the land owners.         
	The Samity was invited for talks with East Midnapore district magistrate C.D. Lama today, but did not attend the meeting.         
	The investors in the Rs 2,000-crore project are the Apeejay group and Bharati Shipyard. They need 500 acres. Owners of about 250 acres have consented to the acquisition, but owners of 55 acres have refused to give up their plots. Others have not said yes or no.        
	The Trinamul Congress- controlled Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee, of which the Samity is a part, wants the investors to speak to the land owners through the panchayats  all are controlled by Trinamul  and buy the land after a consensus is reached.         
	The government has issued a notice for acquisition of land in Geonkhali but is silent on the compensation, rehabilitation and job packages. We want the companies setting up the shipyard to speak to the land owners through the panchayats and purchase the land after a consensus, said Goutam Das, Pratirodh Committee convener.         
	Left meet on Singur        
	The Left Front will meet on Thursday to discuss the possibility of alternative industry on the land in Singur for the Nano project.         
	Tata Motors has not yet told the government what it plans to do with the land it took on lease for the Nano project, but pressure is mounting on the government to get it back.         
	The front will also discuss by-elections to three Assembly seats as well preparations for the Lok Sabha polls.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Gurungs all-party
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Gurungs all-party
                            
	June 17: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha will take representatives of 13 parties, including the Trinamul Congress, Congress, BJP and the CPI, to Delhi for talks, Bimal Gurung said today.        
	Members of the 13 parties joined the Morcha in signing a resolution demanding talks with the Centre on Gorkhaland and condemned the Bengal government for alleged atrocities against Nepali-speaking people in Siliguri and the Dooars.         
	When the Centre calls us for talks, we will take representatives from each and every party that attended todays meeting, Gurung said after an all-party meeting he had called in Darjeeling. If the parties in the plains can be united, the hills, too, have shown they can come together to fulfil their aspirations.        
	The resolution was sent to the President, the Prime Minister, the Union home minister and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi.         
	Outfits like the Sikkim National Front and the Gorkha Rashtriya Congress, which have been demanding Darjeelings inclusion in the Himalayan state, also attended the meeting.         
	The Congress and Trinamul disowned those who attended it. Chabi Rai and Nukul Chhetri are self-styled leaders who cant represent the Congress, state party chief P.R. Das Munshi said.         
	Gopal Chhetri is not even our primary member, said Trinamuls Sougata Roy.        
	The CPI and the BJP promised action against their leaders.

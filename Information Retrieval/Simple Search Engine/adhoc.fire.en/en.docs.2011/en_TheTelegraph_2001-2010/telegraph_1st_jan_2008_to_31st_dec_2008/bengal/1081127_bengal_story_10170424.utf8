The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | DVC faces fly ash fury 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   DVC faces fly ash fury 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Nov. 26: The DVC shut down a unit in its Bankura power plant today because local villagers blocked transportation of fly ash from there saying the by-product was causing them respiratory problems.         
	The DVC has threatened to shut down the entire plant in Mejia that generates 1,340MW  four units produce 210MW each and two generate 250MW each  from mid-December.        
	The plants two 40ft-deep ash ponds are full. The fly ash needs to be sent to abandoned coal mines in Bankura, Purulia and Burdwan  three districts that consume about 500MW generated in Mejia, about 240km from Calcutta.         
	But for the last 10 days, villagers of nearby Lotiaboni have been camping near the ash ponds to stop the DVC from taking away the ash in trucks.         
	The fly ash is causing unbearable pollution. Many of us, including me, have breathing difficulty. We want our homes to be shifted and compensation for relocation and our treatment. Unless the demands are fulfilled, we will not allow transportation of fly ash through the village, said Madan Mohan Mondal of the Save Lotiaboni Committee.         
	Murali Mohan Das, a former chief medical officer of Bankura, said: Fly ash does cause allergy and can lead to rashes and asthma.        
	But Amal Sarkar, the chief engineer at the plant, said the DVC was helpless. We cant remove the ash because of the villagers, so we have cut down on generation. We cant pile any more ash in the ponds and will have to shut down the plant by mid-December.         
	The power from Mejia feeds the Eastern Coalfields and steel plants in Burdwan. Production there would be hit if there is a shutdown in Mejia.

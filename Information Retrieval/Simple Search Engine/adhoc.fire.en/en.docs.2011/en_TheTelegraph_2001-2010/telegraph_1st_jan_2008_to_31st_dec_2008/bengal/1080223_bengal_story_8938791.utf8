          OUR BUREAU                                          Ghisingh in Calcutta. (Bishwarup Dutta)      
	Feb. 22: Denied entry into Darjeeling, Subash Ghisingh today came to Calcutta, leaving behind rejoicing opposition supporters who said he had fled under pressure.        
	Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said Ghisinghs decision to leave north Bengal was entirely his own. The government has nothing to do with it.        
	The GNLF chief landed in the city around 3pm this afternoon and was driven straight to Gorkha Bhavan in Salt Lake. He refused to speak.        
	Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said he did not know if Ghisingh would meet the chief minister tomorrow.         
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee discussed the situation in Darjeeling with Ray, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and director-general of police A.B. Vohra at Writers Buildings.         
	Jyoti Basu, who was the chief minister during the Ghisingh-led Gorkhaland agitation in the late 1980s, said: He is in trouble because his own supporters have gone against him.        
	The GNLF chief had been holed up in Pintail village, 3km from Siliguri, since returning from Delhi on Monday as Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters blocked all roads to the hills.        
	The Morcha, led by former GNLF leader Bimal Gurung, is demanding Ghisinghs removal as caretaker administrator of the hill council.        
	Morcha supporters, surprised at the sight of Ghisinghs convoy leaving Pintail, waved black flags at him. Hes frightened, Bimal Dorjee said.        
	The Morcha has decided to relax its indefinite shutdown in the hills from 10am to 2pm tomorrow to allow residents to stock up food and finish pending work in banks and post offices.

	Krishnagar, Oct. 2: Police today arrested 11 people, including a CPM local committee secretary of Nadia, for alleged involvement in the lynching of three youths six months ago.         
	After picking up Atal Ghosh, secretary of the CPMs Duttapulia unit of Ranaghat, the police are hunting for the partys Ranaghat zonal committee member Bipul Ukil.         
	Ghosh and his associates were rounded up for killing three persons. Ukil, who is absconding, had masterminded the lynching along with Ghosh, Ranaghat sub-divisional police officer Anghsuman Saha said today.         
	According to Saha, those who were arrested confessed during interrogation that the three youths  Chhoton Paul, Ramesh Biswas and Kanu Mondal  were lynched because they had plotted to murder Ukil and Ghosh.         
	The youths were killed on the evening of April 26.        
	Our investigation has revealed that 20 people on bikes beat the trio to death near a busy market, Saha said, adding that gang rivalry might have led to the lynching.

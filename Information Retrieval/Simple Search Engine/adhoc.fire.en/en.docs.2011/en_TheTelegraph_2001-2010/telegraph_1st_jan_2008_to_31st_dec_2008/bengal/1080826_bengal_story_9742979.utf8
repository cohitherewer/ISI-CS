	New Delhi, Aug. 25: If the Bengal government wants to return some of the Singur land to the original owners, it can bypass the legal difficulties by enacting a law in the Assembly, legal experts say.        
	One reason the state has cited to reject Mamata Banerjees demand to hand back 400 acres to unwilling landlosers is that the law doesnt allow return of acquired land.        
	But Supreme Court lawyer K.V. Vishwanath said Bengal could solve the problem by enacting a provision like Section 48B in the Tamil Nadu land acquisition act, which permits return of land to the original owners. Fellow apex court lawyer A.K. Ganguli endorsed that view.        
	Land acquisition falls in the concurrent list. Since Bengals land acquisition act had lapsed in 1993, the state acquired the Singur plots under the central law.        
	Under Section 48 of the (central) Land Acquisition Act, 1894, a state can return acquired land to the original owner only if it hasnt yet taken possession of the plot. The collector works out and pays a compensation to the owner for the damage suffered over the acquisition proceedings.        
	But once possession has been taken, as in Singur, the state cannot return the land because the law has no clause allowing de-notification (revocation) of acquisition.        
	Besides, the Supreme Court had virtually banned any such de-notification in the 1997 Kerala versus Bhaskaran Pillai case. It said that if any land proves surplus after being acquired for a public purpose, such land  or the money from its sale  should be used for some other public purpose.        
	That judgment appears to be holding the Bengal government back, other than the argument that returning any part of the land in Singur would scupper the Tata project.        
	Vishwanath said Bengal could easily get round the apex court judgment by enacting its own law. Several other states have done that, he said.        
	Section 48B of the Tamil Nadu act, which the lawyer cited, allows the return of land to the original owner if it is not needed for either the purpose for which it was acquired or any other public purpose. The owner has to return the amount paid by the government, which may hand him a nominal compensation.         
	Another senior lawyer, P.S.V.L. Narasimha, suggested there could be a shorter way out than passing a law.        
	Instead of revoking the acquisition and returning the land  which the 1894 law doesnt allow  the Bengal government could, as absolute owner of the land in its possession, just sell it to the previous owner.

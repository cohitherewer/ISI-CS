          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bishnu Dayal Agarwala                                  
	Raiganj, May 26: A group of students today punched and kicked their headmaster in the school corridor after being denied promotion to Class XII.         
	The students have vowed not to allow headmaster Bishnu Dayal Agarwala to work at Bindol High School, about 30km from Raiganj town, until he relents.        
	Agarwala filed an FIR with the Raiganj police station in the evening, accusing Narayan Chandra Roy, the secretary of the school managing committee, and Dhanilal Barman and Ajoy Saha  two other members  of inciting the boys.         
	The headmaster has not named the students in the FIR, though he said he could identify them.         
	The incident occurred around 2pm. By 3pm, the agitating students had locked the gates of the school.         
	The headmasters room bore signs of the ransack. Fi- les and books were strewn around and furniture were overturned. The telephone lines had been snapped.        
	This year, 114 boys had appeared in the Class XI annual examination. Forty-five did not pass. The results were scrutinised, passed by the school academic council and published on May 5, the day the school gave over for summer, Agarwala said.        
	When the school reopen- ed today, the boys entered the headmasters room and asked him to consider their cases, Agarwala said.         
	I said that my hands were tied as the marks had been sent to the higher secondary council, the headmaster said, breaking down.        
	The boys swept all documents and stationery off Agarwalas table, disconnected the phone and locked him in.        
	Moments later, Roy came in with Barman and Saha. They dragged me to the corridor, where the students were waiting. I was pushed to the ground and kicked and punched. The teachers looked on, Agarwala said.         
	Roy denied the allegations.         
	One of the teachers, Arup Ghosh, said: It was a minor incident.        
	A failed student said the headmaster had promised to reconsider their cases.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 21: The chief minister today told CPM youth leaders to rectify their behaviour so people do not fear but respect them.        
	Opening a closed-door session of the party youth wing DYFIs state conference this morning, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee urged them to reach out to the poor.         
	You have to reach out to the poor and misguided villagers and suburban areas that are falling prey to the Oppositions destructive politics, trying to derail the industrialisation drive in Bengal, he said, obliquely referring to the Left Fronts setbacks in this years panchayat and municipal polls.        
	Battacharjee said the global financial meltdown would also affect Bengals industrialisation but he would stick to his vision of development propelled by industry as this alone can ensure jobs for the unemployed.        
	On the renewed movement for separate states in the hills and in the tribal areas neigh- bouring Jharkhand, he said: The far Right and ultra-Left have joined hands with agitators to spread anarchy in the state.         
	He iterated his resolve to take on the Maoists, whom he accused of instigating the tribals, and ruled out banning the CPI (Maoist). We have to take them on politically, he said.

  - 23-year-old commits suicide after marriage snub         OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Krishnagar, Aug. 14: A 23-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide late last night after her boyfriends family refused to accept her because she did not have a job.         
	Smritikana Biswas jumped in front of a running train in Nadias Bagula station, about 70km from Calcutta, police said. She might also have drunk poison as blood was oozing from her mouth when her body was found beside the tracks around 6.30am, they added.         
	Smritikanas father Gauranga, a homeopathy practitioner in Aranghata village, adjoining Bagula, said that last week, he and his wife Geeta had gone to the house of the man his daughter wanted to marry.        
	His father refused to accept the match saying he wanted a working girl for his son, Gauranga said.         
	Smritikana, who did her post-graduation in Bengali from Kalyani University last year, was planning to appear for the Public Service Commission and School Service Commission examinations.         
	Gauranga said he tried to explain that his daughter was trying to find a job soon, but to no avail.        
	He told us to come to him after she got the job, Smritikanas mother said.         
	Unemployment has been an age-old malaise plaguing the states youth, many of them educated. According to labour department sources, more than 57 lakh names are registered with employment exchanges. Of them, over six lakh are either graduates or post-graduates.         
	Gauranga lodged a complaint with the Ranaghat Government Railway Police this evening, blaming his daughters boyfriend and his father for her death.        
	We have started an inquiry, inspector-in-charge Amitava Ghosal said. We are awaiting the post-mortem report. Although it appears to be suicide, we are probing all angles.        
	Gauranga said Smritikana had been in a relationship with the man, who owns a mobile phone shop, for four years since they were students of Bagula College.

	Durgapur, June 1: A truck driver grabbed a traffic constable by the neck, forced him into the cabin and sped away, apparently when he tried to prevent him from driving into a no-entry zone.         
	Police intercepted the truck at Punjabi More in Ranigunj, 22km away, and rescued Arun Hati, in his mid-40s.        
	A witness said the constable had jumped onto a foothold and demanded Rs 100 as bribe. The driver refused to pay more than Rs 50, Pronab Mondal, a local youth, said.         
	Traffic constables allegedly take money often from drivers and let trucks enter Nachan Road, which is closed to them between 8am and 8pm.        
	According to the police, Hati was managing traffic at Bhiringee Crossing, 200km from Calcutta, when he saw the truck enter the road.         
	He asked the driver to go back. But he continued to drive on, an officer said. Angry, Hati jumped onto the truck.         
	Mondal said the driver opened the door, pulled the constable in and drove straight towards Asansol.        
	Chhotelal Majhi, 40, and helper Dharam Roy have been held for alleged kidnapping and preventing a government servant form performing duty.

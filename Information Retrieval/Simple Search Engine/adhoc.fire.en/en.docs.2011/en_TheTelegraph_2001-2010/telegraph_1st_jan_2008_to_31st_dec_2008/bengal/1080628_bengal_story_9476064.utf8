	Calcutta, June 27: The high court today acquitted a man sentenced to death 10 years ago on the charge of killing a CPM activist and accused police of producing false witnesses.    
	Justices G.C. Gupta and P.C. Ghosh said the six witnesses produced by the police had no idea about the murder. They were all lying. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha member Buddhadeb Giri, of Jhargram in West Midnapore, has been in jail since 1998.        
	Tamluk: Violence erupted in Nandigram with Trinamul and CPM supporters hurling bombs and firing at each other. Police said a Trinamul group was returning from Amdabad, where the party has dislodged the CPM from the gram panchayat after 20 years, when they were attacked on Friday evening. Ten people were injured.

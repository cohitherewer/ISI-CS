          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 14: Priya Ranjan Das Munshis health has put the state Congress in a quandary ahead of a string of Assembly byelections and civic polls.         
	The state Congress president, now in ICU at a Delhi hospital, was scheduled to be in Calcutta today to chair a meeting on the selection of nominees for the November 30 elections to the Howrah Municipal Corporation and three municipalities  Behrampore, Jhargram and Krishnagar. Preparations for the year-end by-polls to Sujapur in Malda, Para in Purulia and Nandigram in East Midnapore were also on the agenda.         
	Everything has gone awry. We are now in trouble with Priyadas return to active politics on hold, party spokesperson Subrata Mukherjee said.         
	Subrata is also the working president of the state unit in Das Munshis absence, but a section of the Congress feels he has lost credibility for the hobnobbing with Mamata Banerjee during her Singur agitation.         
	He may not be acceptable to Congress loyalists opposed to Mamata. His elevation might also disappoint boudi (Das Munshis wife Deepa), a state Congress leader said.        
	Subrata, it is said, cannot stand Deepas rise in the organisation.         
	Accompanied by fellow Congressman Abdul Mannan, Subrata left for Delhi today. Congress legislature party chief Manas Bhuniya and another state party general secretary Shankar Singh are already in the capital.         
	Sources said a race for organisational powers had begun with the leaders lobbying Delhi leaders for recognition as skippers in Das Munshis absence. Pradip Bhattacharya, a former working president under Pranab Mukherjee, is also in the fray with Deepa.         
	Pradipda has no followers in the organisation, a state leader said. Deepa is a good organiser but her clout is confined to north Bengal.        
	Sources said the AICC might pick a second working president to split powers with Subrata. It could be Bhattacharya or Deepa.         
	An MLA from Goalpokhar in North Dinajpur, Deepa played a key role in snatching the zilla parishad from the CPM.        
	The Left controls the Howrah and Jhargram civic bodies, while the Congress holds Krishnagar and Behrampore. Para and Nandigram are with the Left, while Sujapur is the Congresss.

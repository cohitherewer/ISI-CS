	Calcutta/Tamluk, April 19: Suspected CPM workers allegedly raped a 45-year-old woman in Nandigram, a year after she was raped by another gang during the violence over land acquisition.         
	The woman and her husband, who was beaten up, were brought to SSKM Hospital in Calcutta this after- noon.         
	The hospital authorities have set up a four-member medical board, which will examine her on Monday.         
	Doctors at SSKM said the woman had swellings in her pelvic and pectoral regions and injuries on her elbow and other parts of the body. She has been given antibiotics and sedatives. The rape charge can be confirmed only after an examination, one of them said.         
	Police said a rape complaint had been filed. If it is proved in the medical examination, the guilty will be arrested, said S.S. Panda, the East Midnapore superintendent of police.         
	The woman is a resident of Gokulnagar village, around 165km from Calcutta, and a member of the Trinamul Congress-backed Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee.         
	Around 10 last night, a group of seven or eight  the complaint did not specify a number  raided the womans house.         
	Hare Krishna Das and Snehangshu Das dragged me to a nearby paddy field, poured alcohol on my face and abused me. Then they raped me, the woman told doctors at SSKM.         
	Snehangshu is a CPM candidate for the panchayat polls.        
	We were asleep when they broke into our house, said her husband, a farmer. They started beating me mercilessly. They told me if we did not vote for the CPM, we would not be spared.        
	On March 14, 2007, the woman had been raped by an alleged CPM gang. The CBI had detained local CPM leader Badal Garudas on the basis of her complaint.

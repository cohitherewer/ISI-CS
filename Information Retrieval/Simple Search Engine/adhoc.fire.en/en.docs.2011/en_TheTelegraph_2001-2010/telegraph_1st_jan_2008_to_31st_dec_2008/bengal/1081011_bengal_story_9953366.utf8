	Behrampore, Oct. 10: A mason and a labourer died of rabies in Murshidabad because the vaccine to cure it was not available in the government hospital nearby.         
	Bablu Barik, a 52-year-old mason, and Mamata Bittar, an 18-year-old labourer, were both below the poverty line and entitled to get the vaccine free in any government hospital. But when they went to Kandi sub-divisional hospital  the dog bit them on September 15  they were told there was no vaccine. Health officials said hospitals in Murshidabad had been facing the vaccine crisis for the last three months.         
	Each ampoule of the vaccine costs around Rs 300. A dog-bite victim needs at least five.         
	Bablu, admitted to the hospital yesterday, died at night. Mamata died at home this morning. Both were residents of Kandi town, about 235 km from Calcutta.        
	Subrata Roy, the hospital superintendent, has confirmed they died of rabies.

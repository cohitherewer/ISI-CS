The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hopes alive at siege
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Hopes alive at siege
          KINSUK BASU                              
	Singur, Sept. 5: Sirajul Mullick went home today a tad disappointed, but not disheartened.        
	Mullick, a Trinamul Congress supporter who had worked in the Tata factory for a fortnight, is clinging to hope that the Raj Bhavan meeting will end the Singur impasse.        
	As dusk descended and lights came on at the Tata Motors factory, Mullick scurried around the Trinamul siege site, trying to catch conversations about the fate of the meeting.        
	Like the thousands of Trinamul supporters crowding around Mamata Banerjees manch today, Mullick, a plumber at the small-car plant now rendered jobless, believes a solution is round the corner.         
	Didi should scale down (her demands) and the government, too, should be a bit liberal, and Im sure a middle path will emerge. There has to be a solution to this impasse. Most like me in Singur feel that by tomorrow, something will emerge that will leave both the farmers and the Tatas happy, he said.         
	Srirupa Gupta, a resident of Kasba in Calcutta, shares his optimism. With the governor acting as a facilitator and both parties agreeing that there should be a way out, I earnestly believe that all this is not an exercise in futility, she said.         
	The 45-year-old Mamata fan has been travelling to Singur for the past few days. Aami khub ashabaadi (Im very hopeful), she said.        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis involvement in the talks has also inspired confidence in Mamatas supporters.        
	With the governor there, we hope a solution will emerge. No one is opposed to the Tatas. But one should also consider the fate of the farmers, said Prabir Das, who has come from Haripal in Hooghly.         
	Insurance agent Das said he couldnt afford to travel to Singur everyday but had to turn up today to catch the drama around the manch.

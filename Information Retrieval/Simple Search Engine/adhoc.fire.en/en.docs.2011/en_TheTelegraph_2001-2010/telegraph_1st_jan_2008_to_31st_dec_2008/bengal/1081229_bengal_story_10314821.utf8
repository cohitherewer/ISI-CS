          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Barasat, Dec. 28: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today stressed the need for nuclear power, months after his party had severed ties with the Congress over the Indo-US nuke deal.         
	The Citu union in the state electricity board also adopted a resolution at its conference here in North 24-Parganas, asking the state to set up nuclear power plants while opposing the deal in the same breath.        
	The chief minister followed his party line by criticising the Prime Minister for his haste in finalising the deal at a rally on the last day of the conference, but delinked it from his insistence on nuclear power for the states progress. We are not opposed to nuclear power. Some people think so, but they are wrong.... I had told the Prime Minister not to make haste on the deal and requested him to wait at least till (President George W.) Bush exits.        
	Referring to the state Oppositions resistance to the proposed nuclear power plant at Haripur in East Midnapore, MP Tarit Topdar tried to make a distinction between the CPM and the Trinamul Congress. We want nuclear power but not the deal with the US. They are opposing Haripur and even the conventional power plant in Katwa (Burdwan).        
	At the height of the deal debate, the CPM brass had neither opposed nuclear power nor shared Bhattacharjees stress on it. The party had harped on its high cost.         
	Singur industry        
	The chief minister said the government was making all-out efforts to set up industry on the land originally acquired for Tata Motors in Singur.        
	We are making all-out preparations.... Weve got proposals from both domestic and foreign investors and will have to decide the kind of industry suitable for the place, he said.

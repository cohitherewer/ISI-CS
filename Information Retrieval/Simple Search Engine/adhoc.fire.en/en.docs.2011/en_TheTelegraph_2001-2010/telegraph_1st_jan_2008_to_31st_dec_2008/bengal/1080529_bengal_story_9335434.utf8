The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | State orders minority survey
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   State orders minority survey
  - Wake-up call in poll rout        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Calcutta, May 28: The erosion in the CPMs minority vote share, laid bare by the rural poll results, has prompted the government to conduct a full-fledged survey to assess the deficit in the communitys development and find out ways to address its problems.        
	Our objective is to find out whether our government has been able to provide them with basic amenities such as health, primary education, proper roads and electricity, minority affairs minister Abdus Sattar said today.        
	The Left Front lost large swathes of minority-dominated areas in the polls. According to the CPMs assessment, farmers fear of land acquisition for industry and the lack of development of the mino-rity community brought forth by the Sachar Committee report triggered the sudden slide.        
	The party could not retain its grip on Nandigram-scarred East Midnapore and South-24-Parganas, where Muslims have a significant presence. The combined effect of the land row and lack of minority development also took a heavy toll in Singur.         
	Pockets of North-24 Parganas, Nadia and Howrah with a significant Muslim presence also dealt a blow to the CPM.        
	The land war and the Sachar report forced the government to order the survey, an official of the minority affairs department said.         
	The study will cover 12 districts with a minority population of over 20 per cent. The district magistrates of two of them  Murshidabad and Malda  were at Writers Buildings today to review the gaps in the state governments work for minority development.        
	The minister said: We have collected preliminary data on certain parameters but we have to conduct a full-fledged survey.        
	Minority affairs department secretary Pawan Agarwal held the meeting with the district magistrates today in the presence of the Union minority welfare ministry joint secretary, Ameising Luikham.         
	A joint secretary attached to the chief ministers secretariat later took down details of what transpired at the meeting. Sources said he would have to send a report to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	Asked about the meeting, Sattar said: There are certain development deficits and these need to be detected. We will keep the Centre posted about our findings.        
	The Sachar report had pointed out the very low representation of Muslims in government jobs in the state and their lack of access to education, health and nutrition.        
	The survey to be conducted by the state government will find out levels of literacy, participation of minorities in work outside household, number of households without toilets and electricity, and availability of drinking water, roads and health facilities.

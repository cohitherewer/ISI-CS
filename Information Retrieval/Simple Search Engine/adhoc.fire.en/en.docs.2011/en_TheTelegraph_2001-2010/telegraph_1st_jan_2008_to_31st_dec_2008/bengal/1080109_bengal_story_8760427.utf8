The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Secular, but with NDA
                                                                                                            Secular, but with NDA
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 8: Mamata Banerjee today said she would remain with the NDA in Delhi despite floating a secular front in Bengal minus the BJP.        
	I am with the Opposition in Delhi because I cannot support the government there, which is being backed by CPM. The reason is very simple: I am fighting the CPM in Bengal for its state-sponsored terrorism, she told a news conference at the Trinamul Bhavan this afternoon.        
	Mamata, however, said she did not have the time to campaign for the BJP in election-bound states.         
	Although I have not received any invitation so far from NDA, I want to spend more time for Bengal at this juncture. How can I leave the state when peoples democratic rights are being trampled by CPM? she asked.

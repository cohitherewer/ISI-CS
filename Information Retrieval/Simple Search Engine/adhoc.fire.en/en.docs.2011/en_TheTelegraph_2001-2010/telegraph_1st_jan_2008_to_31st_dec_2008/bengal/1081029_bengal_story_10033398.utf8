          OUR BUREAU                              
	Oct. 28: A first-year student in a Nadia pharmacy institute has alleged that he was thrashed, sexually abused and forced to eat drug-laced sweets by some classmates with whom he was lodging.        
	Nineteen-year-old Aurobindo Barman said he took admission in the Institute of Bengal Pharmaceutical and Sciences, a private college in Kalyani, in June. He initially stayed in a college hostel but later moved to a mess near the campus where some classmates stayed.        
	They beat me up, sexually abused me and often forced me to eat drug-laced sweets. When I went home for Durga Puja, I told my parents about it. My father said he would speak to the college authorities, said the boy from Raigunj, North Dinajpur.        
	On Saturday, when he was going home from Kalyani with father Nabakanta, Aurobindo fell unconscious. After reaching Bandel to take a train to north Bengal, I fell unconscious and my father admitted me here, Aurobindo said from his bed in Chinsurah Imambara Hospital.        
	The superintendent of the hospital, Tarashankar Sahu, said: We found him extremely nervous and under the influence of some kind of drug. We are treating him.        
	Before leaving with his son on Saturday, Nabakanta had lodged a complaint with the principal of the institute saying four classmates had thrashed Aurobindo.         
	He lodged a complaint with Kalyani police today, but did not mention drug-laced sweets or sexual torture. We have received a complaint from Nabakanta Barman saying his son was beaten up by his classmates. We have started a probe, an officer said.         
	Principal Jitendra Narayan Panda said: I have set up a committee to probe the matter. The students will join on October 31 after the Kali Puja vacation. We will speak to them.

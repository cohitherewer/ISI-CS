	Pandua (Hooghly), April 25: A snatcher who jumped out of a train with a gold necklace in his pocket and a dagger in hand was chased and caught by passengers this afternoon.        
	Two of Nasir Sheikhs mates, who had managed to escape the mob at Pandua station, were held later from Canning in South 24-Parganas, about 100km away.        
	Four men had boarded the ladies compartment of the Sealdah-Rampurhat Express at Bandel and snatched ornaments and a mobile phone. Housewife Beauty Barui was slashed when she tried to resist as the goons targeted her earrings. They snatched a gold chain from Kasturi Saha, a schoolteacher in Dankuni, and the phone from Visva-Bharati student Mousumi Pramanik.         
	As the train entered Pandua, about 45km from Bandel, the goons jumped onto the platform and the women raised the alarm.        
	Howrah railway police superintendent Shankar Singha said jewellery, watches and phones were found in the hideout from where Babai Laskar and Sanu Goswami were caught.

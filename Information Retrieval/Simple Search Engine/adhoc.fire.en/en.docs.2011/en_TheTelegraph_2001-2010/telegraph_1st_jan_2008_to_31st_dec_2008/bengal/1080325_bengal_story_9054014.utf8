                                                                                                               Bill defines township
                            
	Calcutta, March 24: The government today passed a bill defining a township to prevent mushrooming of buildings without infrastructure.         
	A township means a clearly delineated planned development project... having... basic urban infrastructure and amenities, says the West Bengal Town and Country (Planning and Development) (Amendment) Bill, 2008. It divides townships into three categories  residential, special ones like institutional or industrial hubs and integrated townships.        
	Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the concept of township had changed. We are going towards health cities and IT hubs and stressing the use of solar energy and recycling wastes.

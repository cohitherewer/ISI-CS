          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Nov. 21: One of the outfits behind the Lalgarh siege today threatened to take the law into our own hands to protest the torture of a tribal woman who was assaulted in Burdwan after being accused of having an affair.         
	She was assaulted a second time after she met the Burdwan police chief on November 18 because the local police had turned her away.         
	The way the woman and her husband have been assaulted is an insult to the entire tribal society. We will give police a deadline by which all the culprits must be arrested. If our demand is not met, we will take the law into our own hands, said Prithwiraj Murmu of the Bharat Jakat Majhi Marwa.         
	Two days after she was first attacked, because she had refused to pay Rs 50,000 to hush up the relationship that she never had, the 32-year-old woman went to the SP. Three men were arrested following his intervention.        
	At Raina village on the fringes of Burdwan town, 115km from Calcutta, the youths beat up the couple and snipped the womans hair in front of their two sons, aged 14 and 12.        
	I was alone with my children and Abhoybabu came to our house to engage me as a farm labourer. When he left, the local youths entered my house and accused me of having an affair and started pulling my sari and beating me up. They locked me up from outside and left, the woman said.         
	Her husband Ashok, who was on the way home, was also beaten up. They demanded Rs 50,000. Villagers called the police, who rescued us but refused to accept our complaint. The youths are pressuring us to give Rs 50,000 or they will drive us out.        
	The youths returned yesterday. They told me to withdraw the case. They pulled me by my hair and threatened me, threw me on the ground and kicked me. They beat up my husband and children, said the woman, now at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   400-acre hurdle   in allies court
  - CPM wants partners to persuade Mamata         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata shows the chief ministers letter at the news conference in Calcutta                                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 18: The CPM today tried to rally its partners to speak in one voice and tell Mamata Banerjee to give up her demand for 400 acres, hours after she agreed to discuss Singur with the government.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, industries minister Nirupam Sen and CPM state secretary Biman Bose today held separate meetings with the RSP, CPI and Forward Bloc leaders. The Left Front meets tomorrow to discuss the land problem.         
	Bhattacharjee, Sen and Bose today tried to convince the Left partners to reflect on the governments position and speak in one voice to the Trinamul Congress chief, who has stuck to her demand of getting back 400 acres taken from unwilling farmers.         
	We have to explain to her that it will be impossible to return the land that has been leased out long-term, not only to the Tatas but also to the ancillary units, a Left leader quoted Bhattacharjee as saying. Both he and Sen explained the practical and legal compulsions against returning the land.         
	He (Bhattacharjee) didnt present any compromise formula but said he would wait for Mamata to offer alternatives, an RSP leader said after the meeting.         
	Yesterday, Buddhababu tried to placate Mamata by saying that no land will be taken using force. He offered a quid pro quo by requesting her to accept the plant in Singur, the RSP veteran said.        
	CPM patriarch Jyoti Basu, too, appealed to Mamata yesterday for a compromise keeping in mind the uniqueness of the Tata Motors plant.        
	But the allies were not inclined to dismiss Mamatas demand in a hurry as they felt it would not help in breaking the deadlock.         
	Whatever Jyotibabu said was his partys opinion. We think the issue of returning 400 acres should be discussed threadbare when the demand has been raised. We would request both, the government and the Opposition, to be flexible so that the crisis can be overcome through dialogue, Forward Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh said.        
	He made it clear that the CPMs allies would not approve of strong-arm tactics. We want a political solution to the problem, Ghosh said.         
	But he was happy that groundwork for the talks had been prepared with the chief ministers letter as well as Mamatas willingness to interact with industry captains tomorrow.         
	RSP leader and PWD minister Kshiti Goswami hinted that the allies were still not sure what the compromise formula would be as the government and Opposition had stuck to their positions. We are yet to develop consensus on a solution. We hope to find it in tomorrows Left Front meeting, said Goswami         
	Siege meeting        
	The Trinamul-led Krishi Jomi Raksha Committee on Monday held a meeting in Singur to give final touches to the indefinite dharna in front of the Tata Motors project.        
	Becharam Manna, the convener of the committee, said: We will not allow workers to get inside or come out of the plant. This agitation is very important to us and our existence depends on it.         
	Didi (Mamata Banerjee) will sit with us in camp no. 8 at Singherbheri within 100 metres of the main gate of the small-car plant, Manna said.

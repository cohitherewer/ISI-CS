     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Barasat, Jan. 11: A North 24-Parganas judge has charged a truck driver with culpable homicide on his own initiative, though police had booked him for the lighter, bailable offence of rash driving and causing death by negligence.
    
	A bus had lost control allegedly because of the overtaking Calcutta-bound truck and run over a school student on Taki Road in Basirhat on December 22.
    
	The truck driver was fully aware of the possible consequences of his rash driving. This is not simply a case of negligence. It was a deliberate act to cause harm, said Basirhat subdivisional judicial magistrate Dulal Kar.
    
	Culpable homicide is killing somebody without intending to do so.
    
	Class XII student Rahul Das, who was relieving himself beside the road on the way to his tutors house, was crushed. His classmate Surja Kundu, who had to be hospitalised, survived the accident.
    
	Local residents chased the truck, and driver Murshed Ali Biswas, 28, fled leaving the vehicle on the road. He surrendered to the police yesterday.
    
	The judicial magistrate said though the boy had been run over by a bus, Murshed was responsible for it. 
    
	Kar said Murshed must have known that his reckless driving could lead to a fatal accident. He cannot be let off easily, the judge said, slapping the non-bailable charge and rejecting Mursheds bail prayer.
    
	Kar also directed the police to submit a detailed report on the accident by January 24. They have been told to state Mursheds role in the Class XII students death.
    
	Rahuls father, a businessman, had written to the po- lice requesting them to take strong steps to curb rash driving at the spot, around 80km from Calcutta.

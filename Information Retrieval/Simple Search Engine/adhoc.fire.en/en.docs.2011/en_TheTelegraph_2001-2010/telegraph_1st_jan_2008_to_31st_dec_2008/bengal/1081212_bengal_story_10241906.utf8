                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Acquisition notice at Andal
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Dec. 11: The government today issued a noti- fication for the acquisition of around 3,500 acres for the airport city in Andal amid murmurs of protest.        
	Burdwan district officials said the notification was put up in panchayat and block offices and villagers have been asked to file their objections, if any, within a month.         
	Land belonging to nearly 19,000 villagers has been identified for the Aerotropolis project, 220km from Calcutta.         
	Landlosers will be paid between Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 11.24 lakh an acre depending on the fertility and location of their plots. They will also get a 1-cottah plot outside the project area for every bigha acquired.         
	A section of villagers de- manded a much higher price. The compensation was discussed with political leaders in air-conditioned offices, not with us. We want more for our land, said Susanta Dutta, 34, a share broker who owns around 8 acres of single-crop land.        
	He would not settle for less than Rs 18 lakh an acre. If I dont get it, I wont give up my land. We will launch an agitation on the lines of Singur and Nandigram.        
	District magistrate Manish Jain said the compensation was fixed after a series of all-party meetings. However, the Trinamul Congress had not participated in any of the 10.         
	Moloy Ghati, 35, a grocer with 5 acres, also sounded like Dutta.        
	The villagers have started mobilising opinion and are likely to hold a meeting soon. We will form our own committee. Why will some politicians fix the price for our land? said Arabinda Banerjee, 56, who has around 4 acres.        
	According to the governments package, those who lose homes occupying less than a cottah will get a one-storey house and those losing homes on larger plots up to five cottahs. Besides, there are vocational training and social infrastructure development schemes.

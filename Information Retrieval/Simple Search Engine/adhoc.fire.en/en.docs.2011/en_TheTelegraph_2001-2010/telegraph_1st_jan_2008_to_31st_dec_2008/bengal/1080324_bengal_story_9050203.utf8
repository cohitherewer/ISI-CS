          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Sleaze tool                                  
	Krishnagar, March 23: A first-year college student whose former boyfriend is believed to have circulated nude pictures of her from his mobile phone has cooped herself up at home because of neighbours taunts.        
	Mandira Biswas (name changed) has decided to skip her university exams because she fears the same fate as her younger sister, who quit her HS exams midway after being teased about the pictures inside the centre.        
	At Bethuadahari in Nadia, about 130km from Calcutta, the entire family has been the butt of ridicule.        
	Father Kamal (name changed) said: My younger daughter wrote her Bengali paper on March 11 but did not appear in the exams after that because she was taunted in the hall.        
	Mandira broke down when contacted over the telephone. How can I appear for my exams? I cant even step out of the house. Anyone who sees me on the street taunts me about the pictures.         
	Subhankar Biswas, 22, allegedly began to circulate the pictures he had taken with his mobile phone camera a month after he got married to another woman.         
	His father Tutul, an affluent bell metal trader, has been arrested on the basis of Kamals complaint. But Subhankar is absconding.        
	The police said Subhankar and Mandira had been in a relationship for the last three years. But it did not lead to marriage because of Tutuls objections. The boy is from a rich family, said an officer of Nakashipara police station.         
	Kamal has a small garm-ent business.        
	During their affair, Subhankar had taken video clips on his mobile phone which he circulated among youths in the locality, said Pintu Saha, the officer in charge of Nakashipara police station.         
	The boys father knew what his son was up to and encouraged it, Saha added.         
	He promised action if Mandira or her sister lodged a complaint against anybody taunting them. We will definitely arrest those people. We will talk to the girls parents about this.        
	Molest arrest in city        
	Safiqul Islam, who stalked a Class XII student and then tried to grab her, was caught by a mob in Behala tonight.         
	The girl was returning home from a coaching class around 8.30 when the young man started trailing her. He is in police custody.

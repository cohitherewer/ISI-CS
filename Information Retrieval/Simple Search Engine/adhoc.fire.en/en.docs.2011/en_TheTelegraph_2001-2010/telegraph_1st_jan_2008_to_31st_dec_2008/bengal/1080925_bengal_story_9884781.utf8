          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, Sept. 24: A Trinamul Congress mob today stormed a land acquisition officers chamber when a group of formerly unwilling Singur landlosers were waiting outside to collect their compensation cheques.        
	The party alleged that cheques were being issued to the wrong people to inflate the number of farmers ready to accept the governments new compensation offer.        
	Hooghly Trinamul working president Tapan Dasgupta led about 200 people to Suman Kumar Ghoshs office around 12.30pm and gheraoed him for about an hour.         
	You are indulging in illegal activities here. Instead of giving cheques to legal owners, you have given out cheques to the wrong people without verifying the records. It amounts to fraud, he screamed as Ghosh, who was in a meeting, looked on in disbelief.        
	The farmers outside fled, fearing they could be targeted next. Collecting applications for compensation and cheque disbursal stopped.        
	Ghosh took the protesters to district magistrate Neelam Meena, who said: The allegations are baseless. We have not issued cheques to the two persons the Trinamul people are referring to. In both cases, there are some disputes.        
	The administration has so far received applications for cheques from 101 farmers, 26 of them today. Those who submitted their applications by today are entitled to an additional 10 per cent.        
	Since the government announced the new package, we have given out cheques worth Rs 11,04,388 for 1.63 acres and Rs 7,394 to a sharecropper, said additional district magistrate Soumya Purakayastha.

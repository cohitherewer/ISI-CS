The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Nano plant beneficiaries strike back 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Nano plant beneficiaries strike back

	Singur, Sept. 3: Tata Motors formal announcement of a ceasework in Singur triggered spontaneous protests today from hundreds who benefited from the project, their pent-up anger often spilling over and sparking violence.        
	The protesters held the Trinamul Congress responsible for the impasse and set up blockades on Durgapur Expressway, took out rallies and pelted with stones vehicles carrying outsiders to Mamata Banerjees manch.         
	Spurred by the protests, the CPM took out three processions later in the afternoon, the first since the siege began on August 24. CPM supporters stoned buses carrying Trinamul supporters from the rally.                 
	The first procession, of around 100 people, mostly day labourers and trainees working at the small-car plant until a few days ago, snaked out of Joymollah village around 6.30am.         
	They blocked the expressway 2km from the siege site.         
	They attacked several dharna supporters and one of them was injured on his face. A complaint has been lodged at Singur police station, an officer said.         
	Police removed the blockade after a lathi charge. The protesters backed out then but returned before noon and another blockade was set up.         
	Around 8am, a protest was held at Ratanpur, around 3km from the dharna dais towards Calcutta.         
	Again, dozens of workmen, building material suppliers and other villagers squatted on the highway, with plac- ards saying Singur wants industry, not the dharna.         
	Aamra Singurey shilpa chai (We want industry in Singur), they screamed.         
	I get three meals and Rs 110 every day from the factory. Can Mamata Banerjee ensure that? asked Sanjib Gorang, a day labourer.        
	As buses carrying Trinamul supporters started streaming in, some of the protesters hurled stones at them.        
	We were forced to take to the roads today. If the Tatas go, thousands of us will become jobless again, said Swa- rup Barui, 42, who supplies construction material to the small-car plant.         
	Barui is among those who had invested in business the money they got from their land, acquired for the project.        
	Biswajit Jana is not directly linked with the project: neither was his land taken away nor does he have a job there.         
	But he was among the protesters because he thinks his son, a second-year BCom student, can one day get a job close to his home if the Tatas stay. I hope he doesnt have to go far from home for a job, he said.         
	In the afternoon, a cycle rally from Ratanpur went to Singur station. Tension over reports of stray attacks had gripped the area by then.        
	Mamata announced from the dais that her supporters were being attacked and three buses had been prevented from entering the siege venue.         
	The police were busy cle-aring roadblocks through the day as villagers in small groups kept protesting against the dharna.        
	Then came a larger CPM rally. No permission had been granted and so they were not allowed on the highway, a police officer said.         
	However, the rallyists, carrying party flags, stayed put on the service road and hurled stones at buses packed with Trinamul supporters.         
	Two more CPM processions arrived minutes later.        
	Blockades were set up at two points. However, they were removed and there was no major violence, said Chandernagore subdivisional police officer Kalyan Banerjee.        
	Mamata said: CPM supporters are attacking us but we have maintained peace.         
	Her supporters had so long been accused of threatening and initmidating those working at the Tata plant or backing the project. Trinamul leaders had gone to a mess housing Tata guards and asked them to leave Singur or face the consequences. Their blockade outside the plant and threats to executives and engineers leaving for home on Friday had forced the shutdown.

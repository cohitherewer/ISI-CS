	Siliguri, June 3: North Bengal University was today tight-lipped on the steep cut-off marks set by some Siliguri colleges for first-year candidates from outside the subdivision.        
	Nupur Das, the secretary of its undergraduate council, said she was not authorised to say anything. Registrar Dilip Kumar Sarkar, the spokesperson for the university, too, said he could not talk to the media.        
	Questions have been raised on whether the discrimination is a legal solution to the pressure on colleges and if it was against UGC norms.         
	Repeated attempts to contact vice-chancellor Arunava Basumajumdar failed. He is busy with the ground-work for a UGC teams visit, said a university employee.         
	SFI state president Sudip Sengupta said: If colleges in Calcutta adopt such a policy to safeguard the interests of local students, a large number of candidates from north Bengal will be deprived of better opportunities. The university must intervene.         
	The Gorkha students union threatened to shut the doors of hill institutions to students from the plains if the Siliguri colleges go ahead with their skewed policy.

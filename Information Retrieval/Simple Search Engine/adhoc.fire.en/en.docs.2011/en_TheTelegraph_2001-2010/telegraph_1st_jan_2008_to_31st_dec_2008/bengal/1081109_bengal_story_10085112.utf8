          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 8: A 19-year-old girl was bundled into a Maruti near the busy Sealdah flyover yesterday by three youths who then drove off, but police said it seemed to be a case of Internet romance rather than kidnap for ransom.        
	Police sources said they suspected that the girl, who is yet to be traced, was headed for Lucknow to meet a 23-year-old man she used to chat with on the Net.        
	This is not a case of kidnap for ransom. It seems romance is behind it. Lucknow police have told us they will give us feedback on what happens next and get the girl back, an Amherst Street police station officer said.         
	The girl, the daughter of a retired army jawan who now runs a hardware business, had gone to a relatives house in Titagarh. She was on her way back home to Shibpur with her 15-year-old brother, Sandip, when the supposed abduction happened around 4.30pm, said a police officer.        
	Sandip said a Maruti stopped in front of them and three youths came out. They grabbed my sisters hands and dragged her into the car. I tried to stop them but couldnt.        
	The girls family, which has not received a ransom call yet, told the police she used to talk on the cellphone for hours.         
	We collected the call records and found a Lucknow number she had called yesterday, said an officer.         
	The man on the other end said he had never met her but had developed a fondness for her since they first chatted on the Net eight months ago. They have been talking to each other every day. They desperately wanted to meet each other.         
	The youth told police the girl was to reach Lucknow tomorrow and that his friends in Calcutta had promised to help her. They may have staged the abduction, the officer said.

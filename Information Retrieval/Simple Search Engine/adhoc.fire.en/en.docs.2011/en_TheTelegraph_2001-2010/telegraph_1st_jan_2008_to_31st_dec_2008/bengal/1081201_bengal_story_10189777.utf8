	Mumbai, Nov. 30 (PTI): A few hours and George Chatterjee would have left Mumbai for good, but his mother was shot dead before that.        
	The government employee, who had retired three months ago and planned to lead a peaceful life with mother Meera, 67, and his family in Calcutta, was set to take the Geetanjali Express early on Thursday morning.        
	As we had decided to go back for good, the luggage was more. So my mother and wife reached the station on Wednesday evening and I left for home to get the remaining luggage, said Chatterjee.        
	On my way back to CST, I called my wife Shobha. She did not answer initially. After some time, she called me and all I could hear was mother killed. By the time he reached the station, the body had been taken to St Georges Hospital. Meera was shot in the back and neck.        
	All important decisions in my life were made only after consulting her, Chatterjee said, trying to hold back his tears. I cannot come back to Mumbai again.

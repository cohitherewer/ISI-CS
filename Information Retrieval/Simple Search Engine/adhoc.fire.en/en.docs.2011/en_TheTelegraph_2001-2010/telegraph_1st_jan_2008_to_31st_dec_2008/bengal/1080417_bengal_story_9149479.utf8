	 Bolpur: Kajibul Sheikh, 30, was hacked to death on Wednesday during a feud between two families at a village in Birbhum. A year ago, Kajibuls nephew Mannan Sheikh, 21, had eloped with the 19-year-old daughter of a neighbour, sparking trouble. A few months later, Mannan returned with the girl and claimed they were married. But the families refused to accept the marriage, forcing Mannan and the girl to return to their homes. But the tension between the families continued. A clash broke out between members of the families bathing in a pond on Wednesday, killing Kajibul.

	Calcutta, March 7: Mamata Banerjee has decided to fight the panchayat polls together with the SUCI, but some of her party colleagues are resenting the pact with a Left party.    
	The Trinamul Congress chief finalised the deal with SUCI state secretary Pravas Ghosh last night. A party leader said: Itll send a wrong message to voters. Another leader accused her of going back on her promise to fight the polls independently.

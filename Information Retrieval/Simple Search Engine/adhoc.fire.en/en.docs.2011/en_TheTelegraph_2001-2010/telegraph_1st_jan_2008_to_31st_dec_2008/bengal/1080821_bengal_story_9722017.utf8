          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Aug. 20: Villagers led by alleged CPM supporters yesterday detained two supervisors of a private firm on the fringes of Asansol for at least six hours and demanded Rs 10 lakh to build a temple.         
	A large police contingent rescued the Great Eastern Energy Corporation officials, part of a team exploring coal-based methane, around 10 last night.         
	The company lodged a police complaint this afternoon, saying it was feeling unsafe and seeking security for the officials working at the Dimra exploration site.        
	The CPMs Asansol zonal committee member, Shyamal Mukherjee, defended the villagers and said they had asked for the money to develop the village. It is the companys social responsibility, he said.        
	Mukherjee is also the former mayor of Asansol town, about 230km from Calcutta.        
	The company has been looking for methane in the Asansol coal belt for three years to produce compressed natural gas (CNG).         
	Calcutta High Court has said all cars registered in 1993 or before would have to convert to CNG to ply in the Calcutta metropolitan area.         
	Great Eastern has obtained permission from the Centre to carry out the exploration but its officials said they were being harassed by the villagers. A section of them is harassing us repeatedly. They stopped our work yesterday. Earlier, they had asked for Rs 1 lakh to build a temple. Yesterday, they wanted Rs 10 lakh, said general manager Paramjit Singh.        
	Asansol police have promised protection to the companys officials.

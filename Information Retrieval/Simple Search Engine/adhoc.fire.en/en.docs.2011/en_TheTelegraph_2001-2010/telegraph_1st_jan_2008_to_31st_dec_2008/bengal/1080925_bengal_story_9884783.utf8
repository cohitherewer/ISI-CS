	Calcutta, Sept. 24: Resigned to the Tatas abandoning Sin- gur, the CPM today appeared to be gearing up for a political fight against Mamata Banerjee, making the miscarriage of the Nano an issue for the general elections.         
	Its getting too late. If it gets delayed like this, I doubt whether the project will be able to take off, party general secretary Prakash Karat said here today.         
	What Nirupam Sen has said is the partys stand, he added, referring to the state industries ministers admission yesterday that the prospects of the project were getting bleaker by the day.        
	At a seminar in the run-up to the SFI national conference from Saturday, Karat tried to cheer up the despondent party faithful this evening by describing the Oppositions agitation as part of a global anti-Left conspiracy and stressed on the political battle beyond Singur. Traditional anti-Left (forces) like Mamata and the Maoists have joined hands to oppose the project they dont want Bengal to break the hiatus in development. Our battle is not confined to a project but a political fight against the forces that want to weaken the Left by derailing development in bastions like Bengal.        
	The Tata project, according to him, was part of the Lefts fight for a different kind of capitalism. We want capitalism based on hard industrialisation, based on the manufacturing sector and sustained agriculture as against the Wall Street model of speculative finance-induced capitalism....         
	We are not going to give up because of a motley group of peoples protests. Political mobilisation of the people of Bengal should decide whether the Left front government would succeed in its moves for industrialisation, he added.         
	The state party leadership, however, is not likely to hit the streets against Mamata in a big way before the festival season is over as the governments priority will be to maintain law and order.         
	While a section of the CPM hopes a pause in the Singur project will help the party take the steam out of Mamatas agitation, others feel her plan to play farmers saviour will boomerang on her in elections after the Tata pullout.         
	We dont think Mamata will be able to repeat her panchayat poll performance. Bengals farmers are not idiots. They wont accept a scenario where their children would continue to work in fields. Educated youths will stand up against her, veteran leader Benoy Konar said, outlining the partys line of campaign.

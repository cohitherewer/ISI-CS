	Siliguri, June 16: The wholesale markets here clocked record sales today with business worth Rs 2.75 crore as the hills went on a buying spree before the indefinite shutdown resumed.        
	The regulated market at Champasari, which sells fruits, vegetables, fish and spices, loaded goods worth Rs 1.75 crore on over 50 trucks. Another 80 picked up rice, pulses, oil and other grocery items worth Rs 1 core from Khalpara.         
	The last truck left Champasari around 4pm.        
	It was a busy day for us. This is the highest single-day trading in many years. Its a record, said Tapan Saha, the secretary of the regulated market merchants forum.         
	Since 9am, at least 50 trucks have left for Darjeeling, Kurseong, Kalimpong and Sikkim, he added. Potatoes, onion, ginger, pineapple and mango were the most in demand.        
	The usual daily business is around Rs 1.5 crore.        
	This is my second trip today. Im carrying potatoes and onions, said Vishal Tamang of St Marys Hill, Kurseong, about 55km away. The trader was driving away from the regulated market in his pick-up truck around 3pm.

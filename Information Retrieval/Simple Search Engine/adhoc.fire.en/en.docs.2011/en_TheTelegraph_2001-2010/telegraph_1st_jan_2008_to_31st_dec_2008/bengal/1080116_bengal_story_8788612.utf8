     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 15: The CPM state conference today endorsed the Bengal governments policy of acquiring fertile farmland for industry on the road to capitalist development but party leaders couldnt escape criticism for the way they handled Nandigram.
    
	Delegates also slammed the leadership for speaking in different voices on the March 14 police firing on land protesters. While the chief minister had regretted the firing, some leaders appeared to defend it.
    
	But the conference had full support for the CPM-led governments policy of offering incentives to private players. A resolution in favour of development of agriculture and industry said incentives were needed because of the acute competition among states to woo investors. Naturally, our state cant take a rigid position, it added.
    
	The resolution said the industrialisation drive was capitalist by character and described the land reforms by earlier Left Front governments as essentially a part of the capitalist development. It would be wrong to find a socialist element in it, the document said, adding that the party needed to grab the opportunities for development while fighting the negative aspects of capitalism.
    
	The resolution came against a backdrop of criticism from allies and the Opposition of the financial and other incentives offered to the Tatas and other investors. The CPM has been also accused of being a capitalist-roader.
    
	The resolution said takeover of fertile land was inevitable because of the lack of barren land in Bengal, but promised that such land would be acquired as sparingly as possible. It stressed adequate compensation and rehabilitation of landlosers and alternative jobs for farm labourers. We need more visible safety valves so that farmers dont turn against us, said a leader from South 24-Parganas.
    
	A report placed at the meeting by state party secretary Biman Bose admitted the firing was a mistake. More discussion on land acquisition and the role of the government as well as panchayats and municipalities would take place tomorrow, he added.

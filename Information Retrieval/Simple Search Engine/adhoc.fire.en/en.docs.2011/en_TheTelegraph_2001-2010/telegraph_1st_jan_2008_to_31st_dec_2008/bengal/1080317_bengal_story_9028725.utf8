	Tamluk, March 16: Hundreds of Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee supporters surrounded Nandigram police station today in protest against the arrest of their comrades and warned that they would resist arrest in the future.         
	If the police come, our women will blow conch shells to alert villagers, said Abu Taher, a committee convener.         
	Among those held today was Tahers fellow convener Nanda Patra, an SUCI leader. The arrests were made in connection with recent clashes.         
	East Midnapore police chief S.S. Panda said arrests would continue but Mamata Banerjee threatened to hit the streets in Calcutta.

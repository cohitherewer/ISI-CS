                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bajaj backs Mamata
                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 7 (PTI): Rahul Bajaj, who is planning to launch a small car like the Nano, came out in strong support of Mamata Banerjee tonight, saying she was not playing politics over Singur but fighting for farmers.        
	On todays resolution at Raj Bhavan, the Bajaj Auto chairman told CNN-IBN: The agreement is subject to scrutiny of details worked out between the three parties, i.e., the vendors, Mamata and the West Bengal government.        
	He added: I am not sure what Tata Motors says on that but I do not believe that the West Bengal government would have given any commitment without first consulting Tata Motors. I hope its October October October and Singur Singur Singur for Tatas Nano.        
	Two years ago, he said, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government had not taken the issue seriously.         
	Why are the ancillary units being moved now? Who was at fault? There was insensitivity on the part of the West Bengal government... then maybe they were at fault. I am not saying if the Tatas are at fault or not. There was a problem and it was buried for too long a duration, he said.

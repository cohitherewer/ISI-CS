     OUR LEGAL REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 9: An 18-year-old girl from a village near Santiniketan has accused a former Visva-Bharati student of repeated rape in his hostel. 
    
	The girl lodged a police complaint last month saying the MA student had promised to marry her and took her to the hostel room time and again in 2005. Baidyanath (Soren) promised to marry me after getting a job. He passed MA in 2006 and got a job soon. But he did not keep his promise, she told police.
    
	Baidyanath got anticipatory bail from Calcutta High Court today. His lawyer told the court: The girls father wants to squeeze money out of his family. Two years have passed since the alleged rapes. Why did she keep silent for so long?
    
	The judges accepted the argument on the delay in filing the complaint.

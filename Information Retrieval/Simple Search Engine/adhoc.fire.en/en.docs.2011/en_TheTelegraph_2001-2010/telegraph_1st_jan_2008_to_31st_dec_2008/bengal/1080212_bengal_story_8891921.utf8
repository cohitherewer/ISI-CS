	Calcutta, Feb. 11: The government is likely to lift its ban on the movement, sale and purchase of chickens, ducks, quails and their eggs from tomorrow after a high-level meeting at Writers Buildings.        
	The ban was imposed across the state on February 5 for an indefinite period in the wake of the bird flu outbreak in 13 districts.         
	State animal resource development minister Anisur Rahman said tonight that the government was considering lifting the ban from tomorrow since the situation has improved.         
	He said no fresh districts had been hit by the bird flu virus after over 37 lakh chickens and ducks were culled since January 15.        
	Hatchery owner held        
	Police last night arrested hatchery owner T. Mondal on the charge of smuggling 2,000 chickens into Panrui in Birbhum in violation of the ban.        
	In his complaint, Bolpur sub-divisional officer Utpal Biswas said Mondal had planned to claim compensation for the birds.

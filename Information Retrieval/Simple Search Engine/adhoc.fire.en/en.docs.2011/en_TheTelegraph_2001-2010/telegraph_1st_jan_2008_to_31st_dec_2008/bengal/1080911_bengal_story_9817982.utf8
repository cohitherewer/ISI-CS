                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Basu surgery decision today
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Jyoti Basu        
	Calcutta, Sept. 10: The blood clot to the left of Jyoti Basus brain has shown no appreciable change after four days of hospitalisation, prompting doctors to consider a surgery to remove it.         
	We are keeping him under observation for a few days before going for surgery because of his age and cardiac condition, said a doctor on the medical board treating him.        
	Neurosurgeon R.P. Sengupta, who flew down from the UK today for Basu, examined him and held discussions with the 10-member board formed for his treatment at the south Calcutta hospital.        
	The CPM leadership will take a final decision tomorrow on whether the party patriarch should be wheeled into the operation theatre.         
	The CPM state secretariat today examined the opinion of medical experts in Delhi, which politburo member Brinda Karat brought to Calcutta. The doctors there felt the surgery was necessary. Party leaders also spoke to Basus son Chandan on the possible operation.        
	Basu needs an operation. But there are risks involved. Tomorrow, we will also consult him on the surgery as he is fully conscious, housing minister and party secretariat member Gautam Deb said.        
	Sengupta said he was very satisfied with Basus treatment so far.         
	The 94-year-old CPM leader had a normal diet today. He was given the food that he asked for, said a hospital spokesperson.        
	According to the medical bulletin issued by the hospital, the board had a detailed discussion with Sengupta on the various treatment options at this stage and decided to continue with the present course of monitoring.        
	He is on supportive medicine and under observation, a doctor said.        
	The condition will be reviewed tomorrow morning.        
	Basu was hospitalised on Sunday, two days after he fell in his Salt Lake home and hurt himself.         
	The veteran leader had a stream of visitors today, from comrades to industrialist Harsh Neotia.

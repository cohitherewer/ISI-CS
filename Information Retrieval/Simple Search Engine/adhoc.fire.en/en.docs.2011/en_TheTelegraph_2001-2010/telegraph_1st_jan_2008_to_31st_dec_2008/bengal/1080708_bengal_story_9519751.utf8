          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 7: The major private bus syndicates today deferred their strike demanding a steeper fare hike to July 10 as the transport minister hinted that a settlement was around the corner.        
	Around 24,000 buses belonging to 17 associations led by the Bengal Bus Syndicate could now go off the roads on July 10, instead of July 9. The Joint Council of Bus Syndicates also brought forward its strike by a day to club it with the one on July 10.        
	The revised fares come into effect from July 11.        
	Mark my words, there wont be a strike, minister Subhas Chakraborty said.        
	Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha said: I dont know what magic wand he wields. Maybe he will take up the matter with Left Front chairman Biman Bose tomorrow and declare the revised rates.        
	The unions want a minimum fare of Rs 4 for the first 2km and a hike of 50 paise to Rs 2 for every 4km thereafter.

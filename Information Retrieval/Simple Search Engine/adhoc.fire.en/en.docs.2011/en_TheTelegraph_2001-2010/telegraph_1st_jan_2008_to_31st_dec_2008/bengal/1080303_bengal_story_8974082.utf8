The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ramayan row
                                                                                                               Ramayan row
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 2: The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) is planning to move court to seek the deletion of a contentious article on the Ramayan from Delhi Universitys history reading list.         
	But the BJPs student wing has ceased its tirade against Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs daughter Upinder Singh, whom it had accused of compiling the text with the article.         
	The group may file an FIR against DU for hurting Hindu sentiments, senior ABVP members said, threatening to expand their agitation beyond the varsity.         
	The article, written by the late A.K.Ramanujan, describes different interpretations of the Ramayan as depicted in texts from across the country. The article  which has frequently been used for research  mocks the epic, the ABVP has alleged.         
	The organisation has argued that students would be forced to write against their conscience from Ramanujans article in examinations.         
	Activists had attacked the DU history department last week, demanding that Ramanujans piece be expunged from the syllabus.         
	The department has, however, rejected the ABVP demand. DU has also denied that Upinder Singh had any connection with the compilation of the reading list.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Door shut, MLA puts off feast 
                                                                                                               Door shut, MLA puts off feast 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, March 4: Kurseong MLA Shanta Chhetri has been forced to cancel her sons wedding reception scheduled for tomorrow as the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has barred the GNLF leaders entry into the hills.         
	My effigies are being burnt everyday and my house is under siege. How can I organise a wedding reception? Chhetri said over the phone from Calcutta.         
	Morcha leaders refused comment. The GNLF legislator had invited their wrath after she voiced support for the hills Sixth Schedule status. The Morcha is against the Sixth Schedule bill, which has been sent for review by a parliamentary panel, and Subash Ghisingh, the GNLF chief and one of the architects of the bill.        
	Chhetris son Sharad Chandra Karki, 24, got married to Nita, 21, in October 2007.        
	The ceremony then took place in the brides house, 35km from Kalimpong. A puja was supposed to be held in the grooms house in Kurseong tomorrow, followed by a reception, said the MLA. She had missed the October wedding for official work in London.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Krishnagar, Jan. 21: A 10-year-old boy who had fever died yesterday in Plassey, Nadia. 
    
	The area is not in the bird flu zone and doctors said there was no immediate reason to suspect the disease. 
    
	But district health authorities have ordered a probe because Samirul Sheikhs family rears chickens. 
    
	On Friday evening, the Class IV student told his parents that he was feeling ill. His condition started deteriorating that night. 
    
	We brought a quack but he couldnt improve his condition. On Saturday morning, I took Samirul to the Kaligunj block hospital, said the boys father, Manirul, a resident of PWD More, 150km from Calcutta.
    
	Block medical officer Manas Bhattacharjee said Samirul had 104-degree Fahrenheit fever and stomach pain. His blood sugar level had shot up to 260, 120 above normal.

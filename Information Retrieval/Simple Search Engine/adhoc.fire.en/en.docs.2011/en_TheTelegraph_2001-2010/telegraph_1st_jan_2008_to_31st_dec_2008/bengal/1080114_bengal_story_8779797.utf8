     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 13: The CPMs three-day state conference will hold a threadbare discussion on the political and administrative mistakes the party has made in its pur- suit of industrialisation, particularly in Singur and Nandigram. 
    
	Party leaders hinted at the agenda at the Brigade rally today. 
    
	We will review the work of the state government and decide new guidelines for it, said party general secretary Prak-ash Karat, who will open the conference at Mahajati Sadan tomorrow. 
    
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose, too, referred to the churning within the party on how to continue the industrialisation drive without alienating the party from a section of farmers and allies. 
    
	There is an effort to isolate our party. We will go for a threadbare discussion at the conference. There will also be criticism and self-criticism, he said. 
    
	Jyoti Basu hinted at his disapproval of some of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees decisions but also defended his successor. 
    
	Our chief minister admits his mistakes. This has never happened in any other state, the CPM patriarch said.

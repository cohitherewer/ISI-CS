          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, July 4: A 59-year-old man died this evening during an altercation with a nurse who would not let his son enter a hospital with saline after visiting hours.        
	Arun Sarkar suffered a cardiac arrest during the heated exchange at the entrance to the female ward at Siliguri District Hospital around 7.30pm.         
	The nurse fled the campus while his relatives and hundreds of others gathered on the hospital premises and demanded that she be punished.         
	An official of the Siliguri court, Sarkar had come to visit Bina Dutta, the 70-year-old grandmother-in-law of his son Abhijit. She had been hospitalised with gastro-enteritis.         
	This evening, when I went to see her, the paramedical staff at the ward asked me to bring three bottles of saline, Abhijit said.         
	But I was not allowed to enter the ward with the bottles when I got them. It was around 7.15pm and the nurse said the visiting hours (4pm to 6pm) had ended.         
	Sarkar, too, requested the nurse to allow his son to take the saline bottles to the patient. My father tried to persuade her but she raised her finger and told us to leave. When he told her to behave, she insulted him. He could not bear the humiliation, Abhijit said.         
	Suddenly, I saw my father falling. I tried to hold him and other people came forward to help, Abhijit said.        
	Doctors at the hospitals emergency pronounced Sarkar dead.        
	His second son Arijit, who works in a private bank, arrived at the hospital with friends, barged into the ward and asked another nurse, Swapna Dutta, to show the duty register so that they could identify the culprit.        
	She is the culprit and solely responsible for my fathers death, Arijit said. The hospital is trying to shield her.         
	Subal Dutta, the acting superintendent of the hospital, said the incident was unfortunate and that he knew Sarkar personally.         
	He had undergone a bypass surgery. We will investigate the incident on the basis of the complaint lodged by his family, Dutta said.         
	A large police team was posted at the hospital following the tension, but Sarkars sons were in a dilemma on whether to lodge a complaint. If we file a police complaint, the body will be sent for post-mortem and the release delayed, a relative said.

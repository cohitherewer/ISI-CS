          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 10: German wholesaler Metro Cash amp; Carry will open its store off EM Bypass on December 4.         
	The companys managing director, Martin Dlouhy, met agricultural marketing minister Mortaza Hossain today at Writers Buildings after which the date was announced.        
	The Metro Cash amp; Carry managing director came from Bangalore today to meet me as I was abroad when the licence was given to the company. Martin Dlouhy also requested me to be present at next months inauguration, Hossain, a Forward Bloc leader, said.        
	The wholesale giant is expected to hold a news conference on December 3 to announce the opening.        
	The German wholesalers licence was renewed on October 10.         
	Dlouhy spoke to agriculture minister Naren De before meeting Hossain.        
	The Bloc, which controls the agricultural marketing board, had protested when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee issued a directive to renew the licence to Metro Cash amp; Carry.         
	But the Bloc later agreed to give the licence allowing the company to sell and buy farm produce following a Left Front meeting.

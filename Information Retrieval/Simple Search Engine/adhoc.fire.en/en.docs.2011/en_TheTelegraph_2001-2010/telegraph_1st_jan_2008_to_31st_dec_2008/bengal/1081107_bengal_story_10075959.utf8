          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Nov. 6: Biman Bose today filed an affidavit in Calcutta High Court accusing the entire media, including CPM mouthpiece Ganashakti, of distorting his comments on judges and the judiciary at a party rally last year.        
	I have high regard for the judiciary and judges, and the comments attributed to me in different electronic media and newspapers, including my party mouthpiece Ganashakti, are baseless, the CPM state secretary said in the affidavit.         
	He has been charged with contempt of court.        
	Bose had addressed the rally on November 17, 2007, a day after the high court ruled that the Nandigram police firing was unconstitutional. What I had said was a fair criticism of the court order, he said today.        
	Citu president Shyamal Chakraborty and CPM central committee member Benoy Konar, who face the same charge for their speeches at the rally, have filed similar affidavits.

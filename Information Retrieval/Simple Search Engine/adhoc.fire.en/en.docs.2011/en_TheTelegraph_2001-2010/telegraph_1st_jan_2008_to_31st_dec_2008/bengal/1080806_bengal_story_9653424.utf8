	Calcutta, Aug. 5: CPM leaders Biman Bose, Shyamal Chakraborty and Benoy Konar appeared in Calcutta High Court today in a contempt case for making adverse comments on the ruling that the police attack in Nandigram was unconstitutional.        
	The court allowed them to file affidavits and fixed November 14 for a hearing.

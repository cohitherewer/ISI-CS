	Santiniketan, Aug. 9: Visva- Bharati this evening lodged an FIR against baul singer Purna Das, accusing him of illegally occupying a plot belonging to the university.        
	We have lodged an FIR against Purna Das after he refused to vacate the plot despite several notices, said Amitabha Choudhury, the public relations officer of Visva-Bharati.        
	Purna Das said: I have a stay order on the notices from the high court which I obtained on August 7. The court order will reach Visva-Bharati in a day or two.

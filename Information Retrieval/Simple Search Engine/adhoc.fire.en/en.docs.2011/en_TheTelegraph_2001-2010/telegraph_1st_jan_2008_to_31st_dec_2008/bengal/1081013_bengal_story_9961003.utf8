          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Mamata Banerjee at the rally. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)      
	Calcutta, Oct. 12: Mamata Banerjee today scoffed at suggestions that her urban vote base would take a hit following the relocation of the Nano plant from Singur to San-and in Gujarat, though a section of her party betrayed such a fear.        
	A section of the media is saying my urban vote bank has eroded because of the relocation of the Nano plant. I am being blamed for the mess the government has created. But I believe that those who have turned up in large numbers today must have backed my agitation against forcible acquisition of farmland for the car plant, Mamata told a rally of some 2,000 people in Tollygunge this afternoon.         
	Waving to the crowd, the Trinamul Congress chief said: Im sure all of you are from the city and not from remote Sunderbans villages.         
	Sources in the party said whatever her stance in public, Mamata was apprehensive about an erosion in her urban vote bank in the wake of Ratan Tatas pullout from Singur.         
	A party source said she visited only a few Puja pandals this time fearing protests from the younger generation. She visits at least 40 pandals in her (Calcutta South) constituency every year but, this time, she went to barely 20.         
	An old woman had waved a black cloth at Mamata outside a south Calcutta Puja. A Trinamul general secretary said: The elderly at many homes, who once backed Mamata almost blindly, are now blaming her for the Nano setback.        
	Mamata had not bargained for a Tata pullout when she decided to drag her Singur agitation till the Lok Sabha polls, a close aide of the Trinamul chief said. She was overwhelmed by the support for her siege and had not factored in the possibility of a Tata pullout from Bengal. Now she is apprehensive about her votes in the city.        
	The party, he added, was worried the Singur fallout in next months Howrah elections to the Municipal Corporation, now with the CPM.         
	Save Farmland Committee convener Pradip Banerjee admitted a mixed reaction among the people about the agitation.         
	Mamata left for Delhi tonight. She will call on the Prime Minister and the Presi- dent with 20 members of the Save Farmland Committee to demand the return of land forcibly acquired for the car project.         
	We shall also apprise them of the CPMs state-sponsored terrorism in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections, Mamata said at the rally, her first in the city since Ratan Tata announced last Friday that the worlds cheapest car would not roll out of Singur.

	May 19: Over 20 people were injured in clashes across north Bengal, including Cooch Behar where the CPM and the Forward Bloc went back to their turf war, shattering within hours the fragile peace that prevailed during polling yesterday.        
	Tension had been brewing in Cooch Behar for some time but today it began with a storm in a teacup.         
	Supporters of the two Left Front partners, known to be at loggerheads, were discussing the poll prospects of their parties at Kadamtala market in Dinhata over cups of tea when a friendly banter gave way to heated argument and then a clash. Three Bloc supporters and one from the CPM were injured.         
	The skirmish comes 24 hours after leaders of the two parties had claimed credit for the peaceful polls. They had said constant monitoring and messages to supporters asking them to steer clear of violence  especially after clashes among allies in South 24-Parganas  had contributed to trouble-free polls in Dinhata.         
	Five CPM supporters and six Congress supporters were injured at Mansai village in Tufanganj block II. They had to be hospitalised.         
	Cooch Behar district magistrate Rajesh Kumar Sinha said repolling would be held at a booth at Nisiganj, where a candidates name had been wrongly spelt.         
	At least eight persons were hospitalised in North Dinajpurs Chopra when supporters of the CPM and Congress clashed at Tilakgachh this morning. Of the 14 booths where re-polling has been ordered in the district, eight are in the Chopra block.         
	Fresh voting has to be held in two of them because of relentless clashes yesterday.         
	In the remaining six, there had been complaints of false voting and booth capturing. All 14 booths had been declared sensitive earlier.        
	A North Dinajpur zilla parishad candidate of the Bloc was arrested last night from Kanki. Police said objectionable articles had been found in the car being used by Prabhu Das, who was also accused of assaulting a Congress supporter last evening.         
	Bloc supporters put up a blockade on the NH31 demanding his release.        
	Repolling has also been ordered in 12 booths in Malda.         
	All repolls will be held tomorrow.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Siliguri, June 2: Several colleges here have decided to restrict the entry of students from outside Siliguri, raising questions on whether such regional discrimination was legal.        
	While local students will be issued forms if they fulfil the minimum criteria laid down by North Bengal University, those who have passed out from schools outside will have to score at least 65 per cent in higher secondary. The minimum for other boards is 75 per cent (see chart).         
	According to university rules, candidates are eligible to apply for honours if they obtain 45 per cent (40 for SCs/STs) in total and at least 50 in the subject concerned, irrespective of the board. For pass courses, any candidate who has passed Plus II is eligible to apply.        
	Siliguri College principal Malay Karanjai said the cut-off for outsiders had been introduced to help local students.         
	Partha Sarathi Das, the principal of Surya Sen College, said it was the only way to safeguard their interests.         
	He also said it was the colleges way to ease the rush of students. The HS success rate has gone up this year. So a large number of students will try to migrate.        
	The Siliguri College of Commerce said it had been following this system for over five years.         
	The All Gorkha Students Union called it regional discrimination. Colleges across the country have cut-offs to select the best students but the rules are same for students from any region, its president, Rabi Shankar, said.        
	Advocate Gitanath Ganguly said the colleges decision was unlikely to stand legal scrutiny as it was opposed to natural justice.        
	Father Cheriyan Padiyara of St Xaviers College, Siliguri, said the institution would have a cut-off of 50 per cent in aggregate for all students. Even students from here go out for better opportunities and they have a right to do so.

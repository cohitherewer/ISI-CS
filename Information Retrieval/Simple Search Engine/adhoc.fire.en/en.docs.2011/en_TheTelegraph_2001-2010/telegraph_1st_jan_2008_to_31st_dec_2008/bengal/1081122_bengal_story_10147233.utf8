	Durgapur, Nov. 21: IISCOs expansion in Burdwans Burnpur was stalled again yesterday by villagers who alleged that they had not got the increased compensation the court had asked the government to pay.    
	The government is giving us small amounts and publicising that everyone has collected their cheques, said Chandrasekhar Roy of Purusho-ttampur, who got two cheques for Rs 8,214 out of the Rs 6 lakh due to him. Work on the wall resumed today but the villagers have given the administration time till November 30 to pay their compensation in full.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Torture slur on director
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, July 12: The daughter-in-law of theatre director Usha Ganguly has accused her and her son of torture.         
	In a complaint lodged with Lake police station, Smita Chakrabartty Ganguly said: I was constantly insulted by Usha Ganguly because my father was unable to fulfil her financial expectations.        
	Months after marriage in December 2006, she was allegedly tortured as her father could not pay more than Rs 1 lakh as dowry. Usha had allegedly demanded Rs 3.5 lakh.         
	Smita said she went to the police when the torture became unbearable.         
	Yesterday, she narrated to a womens rights activist how her husband beat her up on several occasions. The two walked up to the nearest Jadavpur police station. Smita had to lodge the same complaint again this evening since the Gangulys house is in the Lake area.        
	The complaint comes days after her husband Hirakendu lodged a diary accusing her of torturing him.         
	Usha said the torture charge against her was absurd. To even think that I have been party to domestic violence is absurd. We can prove it. For 40 years, I have been doing plays against domestic violence. I have always seen her (Smita) as a daughter. The people of Calcutta, who know me, will realise how wrong all this is.        
	A senior police officer said: Smita sought security, which we have promised.

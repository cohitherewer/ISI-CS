The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | From Nano dust rises a poll plank 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   From Nano dust rises a poll plank 
          BISWAJIT ROY                          Mamata                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 10: The CPM will make Mamata Banerjees destructive, anti-state politics a key poll plank, hoping to reap some dividends from the debris of the Nano project in Singur.        
	CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said Singur or the exit of Nano project from Bengal would be a major poll issue for the party in Bengal. He hoped that the people of the state would give Mamata and her allies a fitting reply for their destructive, anti-state politics.        
	The party state secretariat met this morning and a three-day central committee meeting begins on Sunday. Todays meeting discussed the contours of the post-Singur political campaign that will be finalised after the central committee gathers.         
	We suspect the government would call elections in January or a little after that. So, we will take stock of the political scenario, both at the national and state levels, and discuss the preparations, said Md Selim, deputy leader of the CPM parliamentary party.         
	Konar, a central committee member, hinted that a section of the CPM in the state that was opposed to early elections after the panchayat poll setback now doesnt mind the prospect, hoping to ride the anti-Mamata sentiment, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas, after the Singur crisis.         
	But not everybody in the party seems as optimistic. Sources said some leaders felt Mamata may be able to offset her loss of the middle-class voters support by gaining in rural votes on the land issue.         
	As the Left has pulled out in Delhi over the Indo-US nuclear deal, the Congress, too, would be in the CPMs gunsights, Selim indicated.         
	The central committee will finalise a document on the demands for restructuring Centre-state relations before beginning talks with other parties for a broad-based movement, the CPM MP said.         
	It is not clear, though, if BJP-ruled states would also be included in this broad-based movement.        
	The CPM would also highlight the Congresss tacit understanding with Trinamul on Singur. The meeting between the Mamata Banerjee and Sonia Gandhi at the height of the Singur crisis and the change in the Congresss tune at the all-party meeting on the return of land confirms our apprehension, a CPM secretariat member said.        
	According to some CPM leaders, the Congress may go for the dissolution of the Lok Sabha in the coming session of Parliament beginning October 17.        
	The CPM is worried about the rising attacks on minorities in NDA-ruled Orissa and Karnataka, but the party would still go on the offensive against the Congress, keeping the third front alternative in mind.

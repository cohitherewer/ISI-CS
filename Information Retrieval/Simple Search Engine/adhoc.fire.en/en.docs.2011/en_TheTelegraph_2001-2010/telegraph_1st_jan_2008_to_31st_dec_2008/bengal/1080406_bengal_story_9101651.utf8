          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 5: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today rained sops on Muslims, with the panchayat polls a little over a month away.        
	The chief minister inaugurated Aliah University, which will have various colleges across the state to accommodate Muslim students.         
	Bhattacharjee also laid the foundation stone for the A.K Fazlul Haque Muslim Working Womens Hostel on Dilkhusa Street  a first of its kind in the state  and the Boo Ali Muslim Boys Hostel in Sealdah.        
	Over the years, we have realised through self-criticism that Muslim boys and girls are lagging in education. That is why we have laid stress on science and technology and professional courses in the new university to help them get jobs, the chief minister said.

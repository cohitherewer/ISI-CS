	Durgapur, Dec. 28: Two bombs, which police said were part of a stockpile of ammunition, exploded at the CPM youth wing office in Burdwans Guskara this morning.        
	A couple of DYFI activists, said to have been injured, were apparently taken away by other party workers.        
	Amitabha Konar, officer in charge of the local outpost, about 160km from Calcutta, quoted witnesses as saying that the duo were whisked away to keep a lid on the incident.        
	The police later found six crude bombs in the party office, which has been sealed.        
	The CPM declined comment on the blasts.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Farmer loses plot of 67 years
  - CPM village leaders push out 86-year-old from land
          NARESH JANA                      Shibkrishna                          
	Sultanpur (West Midnapore), Oct. 2: An 86-year-old farmer whose family had been gifted land in 1941 was allegedly evicted last month by CPM leaders in West Midnapore because records showed the plot was vested with the government.        
	Shibkrishna Mukherjees father Manmatha was gifted 16 cottahs (20 cottahs make a bigha) in Sultanpur by zamindar Chandra Shekhar Rudra in 1941. But when the zamindari system was abolished in 1955, the land became vested.        
	In 1956, Shibkrishna moved the Ghatal munsif court and got a decree in his favour.        
	But he made one mistake. We did not record the ruling in our favour with the land department by showing the order of the munsif court. In the official records, the plot remained vested, he said.        
	Shibkrishnas son Anathbandhu recently found out from the land reforms office that the plot was still recorded as vested. When we showed the block land and land reforms officer the order of the munsif court, he told us to move the high court. So, we filed a case in January, said Shibkrishna.        
	But news that the land was vested leaked out. In August-end, local CPM leaders asked Shibkrishna to vacate the land and threatened to throw the family out. A shalishi meeting, led by the CPMs local branch committee members Ajit Kurel and Sambhu Mukherjee, was held at Shibkrishnas house on September 2 when he was asked to vacate the plot in 48 hours.         
	The next day, stones landed on our roof, he said. We were scared and decided to leave. With my 78-year-old wife Kalyani, son Anathbandhu, his wife and children, I shifted to my younger brothers house, also in Sultanpur, he said.        
	CPM leaders planted a red flag on the plot and declared that a hostel for schoolchildren would be set up there. They also told him to withdraw the case, which Shibkrishna has resisted so far.         
	Ghatal BDO Rajib Ghosh said: Although our records show the land is government property, villagers have no right to drive out someone from a plot even if it is vested. We are probing the case, he said.        
	We cant buy our provisions from the grocer. The neighbours are scared to talk to us. My sons tutor does not come where we stay now, said Anathbandhu.        
	We approached all CPM leaders in Ghatal but no one paid heed. We were forced to leave our house where we have lived from before Independence, said Shibkrishna.        
	Kurel said: The land and the house are the property of the village. A hostel will come up there.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 13: Sudeshna Dutta, the 19-year-old daughter of a Burdwan businessman, told a court today she had ma-rried Rafizul Sheikh on her own and had not been kidnapped or forced into wedlock.        
	The statement prompted Calcutta High Court to grant anticipatory bail to Rafizuls father Imamul Haque, who had been accused of kidnapping her.        
	Rafizul, 26, used to work in Sudeshnas fathers factory in Raina, 130km from Calcutta.        
	Priyanka Todi of Salt Lake could have got a similar opportunity to tell the court if she had willingly married Rizwanur Rahman had police acted in accordance with the law.         
	Her family had lodged a similar complaint against Rizwanur and his family, but Calcutta police tried to break the marriage and finally made Priyanka go back to her fathers residence.        
	Sudeshna had eloped with Rafizul on November 11, 2007.        
	Her father Prasanta lodged the kidnapping case with Raina police the same day.         
	On November 22, the police arrested Rafizuls mother Rokeya Bibi while his father prayed for anticipatory bail before the Burdwan subdivisional magistrates court. The court granted interim bail to Rokeya Bibi but refused to grant anticipatory bail to Imamul.         
	The police failed to get hold of Rafizul and Sudeshna. Imamul moved the high court.         
	Sudeshna appeared before Justices D.P. Sengupta and P.K. Deb and said that two days after leaving her parents house, she converted to Islam. She also told the judges that none of her husbands family members had forced her.

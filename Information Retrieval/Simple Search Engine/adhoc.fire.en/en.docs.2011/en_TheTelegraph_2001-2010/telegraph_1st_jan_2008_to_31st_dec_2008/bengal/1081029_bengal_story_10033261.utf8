          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Suti (Murshidabad), Oct. 28: A farmer allegedly died of heart attack last night after seeing police arrest his son in connection with a village clash.        
	The cops came calling at Durgashankar Khamarus house in the evening, looking for his son Arun in Suti, Murshidabad, about 280km from Calcutta.         
	When the police dragged Arun out, his 70-year-old father pleaded that he was innocent and not in the village at the time of the clash on October 25. Barun, Aruns elder brother, said: My father pleaded with the police with folded hands to release my brother. He was not in the village at the time of the clash.        
	He said: As soon as the police left, my father clutched his chest and fell unconscious. We called a local doctor who told us to immediately shift him to the hospital. But before we could arrange a vehicle to shift him, he died. The doctor told us he suffered a massive heart attack. We will move the state human rights commission.         
	Arun was one of the 10 accused named in an FIR by some CPM men after the clash with Congress supporters over a gram sabha election. He was granted bail today.

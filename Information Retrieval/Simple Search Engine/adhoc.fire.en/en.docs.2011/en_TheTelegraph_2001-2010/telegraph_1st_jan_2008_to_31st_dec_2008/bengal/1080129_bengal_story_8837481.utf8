The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Sneak-out with birds
                                                                                                            Sneak-out with birds
          NARESH JANA                            Ashok Santra and Narayan Chandra Ghosh                                 
	Debra (West Midnapore), Jan. 28: Ashok Santra was sipping tea at a stall last evening when he heard villagers talking about the big news on TV.        
	Bird flu has been confirmed in our district theyll kill all the birds at Chakbeuncha tomorrow, those crowding the place said animatedly.        
	Ashoks heart sank. He has over an acre of farmland at Chakbeuncha but a chunk of his income is from selling chickens  his own and what he buys from villagers in bulk and sells at the mart at Loada, 114km from Calcutta.        
	I realised that the news will spread like wildfire by morning, said Ashok, 42.        
	He heard a Maruti van with the panchayat banner alert villagers about the flu at Chakbeuncha, about 4km from Loada, and ask them not to buy or sell poultry.         
	I made up my mind. I had to smuggle my chickens and sell them at the haat (mart) at Basantapur (15km from Chakbeuncha), said Ashok.        
	Tarun Santra, 32, a farmer and a backyard poultry raiser in Chakbeuncha, was with Ashok. They took a bus back to the village, where people were still ignorant about culling operations.         
	At 5am, Ashok and Tarun went to fellow villager Narayan Chandra Ghosh, who had about 35 chickens. Ashok told me that there was a ban on chicken trade and offered me Rs 45 a kilo. But I didnt agree to sell my birds and they went away, said Narayan.        
	Ashok and Tarun put their 34 chickens in four jute bags and took them to Basantapur. There, Ashok sold his dozen chickens for Rs 624. Tarun got Rs 1,100 for his 22 chickens.        
	At other times, we sold our chickens at Rs 70-75 a kilo. But prices had plummeted and we sold them for Rs 52 today, said Tarun.        
	As the day wore on, Narayan realised his mistake and also took a bus to Basantapur. The government would have given Rs 40 for each culled chicken. I sold 15 of them at Rs 50 a kilo and got Rs 800.        
	Uttam Mondal, the chief of the Loada village panchayat under which Chakbeuncha falls, said a series of meetings were held yesterday in the market areas to raise awareness about the avian influenza. We couldnt cover every village.

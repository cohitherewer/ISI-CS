          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, July 5: A police case was started today against the Siliguri nurse whose rude behaviour had allegedly led to a patients relative suffering a heart attack last evening.        
	The police lodged a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against the nurse after Arun Sarkars son registered a complaint.         
	Sarkar had collapsed at the Siliguri District Hospital during an altercation after the nurse refused to let his son enter with saline bottles for a relative because the visiting hours were over.         
	The nurse, who fled the hospital after the incident, is missing.         
	No one has been named in the FIR, said Prabhat Chakraborty, the inspector in charge of Siliguri police station.         
	The hospital refused to name her. It constituted a committee today to probe the death.         
	The panel will submit its report by Tuesday.        
	The nurse will be punished if her misbehaviour with Sarkar is proved, said hospital superintendent Pradip Sarkar.        
	The police are looking for the woman.

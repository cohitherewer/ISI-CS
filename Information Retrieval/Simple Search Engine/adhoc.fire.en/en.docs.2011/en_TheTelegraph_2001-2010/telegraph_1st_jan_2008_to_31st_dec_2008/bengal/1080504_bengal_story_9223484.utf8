          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, May 3: Khejuris polling booths have been declared sensitive, days after Nandigram got the tag.         
	The East Midnapore district administration said armed guards would be deployed in each of Khejuris 155 polling stations.        
	Like the 171 booths in Nandigram, we have tagged all booths in Khejuri sensitive. We apprehend more trouble as attacks and counter-attacks by members of political parties are regular affairs in Khejuri too, district superintendent of police S.S. Panda said, adding that the Nandigram and Khejuri borders would be sealed off tomorrow.         
	The Congress today decided to withdraw all its 37 candidates from Nandigram Block 1 to protest last nights attack on houses of three party candidates in Sonachura by alleged CPM activists.         
	The deadline for withdrawing nominations has passed, so the party will inform people by distributing leaflets.

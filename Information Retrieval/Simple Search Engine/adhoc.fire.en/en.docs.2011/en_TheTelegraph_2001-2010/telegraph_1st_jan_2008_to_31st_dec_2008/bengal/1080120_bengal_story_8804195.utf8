	Calcutta, Jan. 19: Morning alarms rang early in Calcutta on Friday, and Team India did not disappoint. The city that had ended the Aussies last 16-Test winning streak did not want to miss a minute of a repeat telecast seven years on. 
    
	Celebrations started much before the last wicket fell. Jogyo jobab (fitting reply), read a banner. Indian tigers (have) started roaring, screamed another.
    
	The fourth day of the Perth Test being a weekend and declared a holiday for Muharram, most people could catch the spirited performance of Kumble and Co. from the comfort of their homes.
    
	The unlucky few who had to be out on business crowded around shop windows, while some huddled at local clubs to savour the terrific triumph together.
    
	There were at least 50 people outside our showroom throughout the match, said Sandip Jana, a salesperson with Anadamela in Gariahat.
    
	South City Mall, the newly unveiled retail hotspot in town, was the top draw for the public display of adulation. Nearly a thousand people watched the winning moment on the malls giant screen. 
    
	The 30,000sqft central atrium erupted in applause as an R.P. Singh yorker sent Shaun Tait packing. Shoppers rushed out of stores to greet each other with high-fives.
    
	Attendance dipped at the cricket camps. Of the 45 boys who practise on Saturday mornings at the Sinthee Roypara camp, only 23 showed up. 
    
	Cricketer Devang Gandhi had to keep calling up his father from his Ultra Plus Steel Balak Sangha School of Cricket as the kids clamoured for regular updates.
    
	Fans at Behalas B.B. Sengupta Road, near Sourav Gangulys home, were so confident that they began celebrating as early as 9am  and did not stop till five in the evening.
    
	Sourav Fans Association at Kalighat came alive around noon when the eighth wicket fell. About 30 enthusiasts smeared each other with pink abir and distributed rosogollas and prasad from the Kalighat temple. They also danced to drumbeats, chanting: Bhool umpiring-er jogyo jobab dilo ke? India abar ke!
    
	We were very cross with the way India was made to lose the second Test at Sydney by the umpires. Then there was the needless Bhajji-Symonds controversy. In any case, beating Australia in Australia  that too in Perth  is special, said Abhijit Mukherjee, a member of the fan club. 
    
	Had Sourav got runs, we would have celebrated even more, added another fan.

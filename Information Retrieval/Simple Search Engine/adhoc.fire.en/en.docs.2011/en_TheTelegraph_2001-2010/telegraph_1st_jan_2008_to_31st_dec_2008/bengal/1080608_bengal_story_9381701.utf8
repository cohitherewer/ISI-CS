          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 7: The monsoon is expected to hit south Bengal in 48 hours, the Met office said today.         
	The monsoon today covered Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and parts of Sikkim. We expect it to cover the entire Bengal during the next 48 hours, said G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Alipore.        
	The pre-monsoon rain in Calcutta today was caused by heavy incursion of moisture from the Bay of Bengal. A cyclonic circulation (anti-clockwise movement of air) over Bihar and the adjoining sub-Himalayan districts helped bring in loads of moisture from the sea.        
	The city woke up to an overcast sky. As the day wore on, drizzles intensified into sharp shower in some areas. The rain was not uniform across the city because the cloud masses were heavier in some areas, a Met official said.        
	There were only light showers in north Calcutta, but the south and east received heavy rain. The monsoon generally arrives in Calcutta around June 8.         
	The Met office has warned of heavy rain in Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar in the next two days.

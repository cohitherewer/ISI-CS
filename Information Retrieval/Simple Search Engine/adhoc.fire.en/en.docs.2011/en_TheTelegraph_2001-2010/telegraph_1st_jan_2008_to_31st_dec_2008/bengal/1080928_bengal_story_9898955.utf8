          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Sept. 27: Police today arrested a 35-year-old man who allegedly specialised in stealing laptops from homes using an iron rod to draw them close to a window.        
	Amir Ali Mondal, of Basirhat in North 24-Parganas, has allegedly been in business for eight months, targeting houses in Salt Lake, Lake Town and Maniktala.         
	The police said Amir, ori-ginally a scrap dealer, used to go door to door, before turning thief.         
	Since Amir had travelled extensively in and around Salt Lake and nearby Dakshindari and Ultadanga as a scrap dealer, he knew the nooks and corners of these places well, said Supratim Sarkar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police.         
	He would pick houses that had shrubs nearby where he could hide. He would wait behind the bush at night before going for the kill with his iron rod.         
	The police were probing a laptop theft in a house in Salt Lakes BD block when they found some railway tickets and a shirt that had a tag with the tailors Basirhat address from a bush nearby.         
	They also learnt that laptops were being sold in the grey market at Basirhat, 75km from Calcutta and along the Bangladesh border, at throwaway prices beginning Rs 6,000.        
	A team of senior officers went to Basirhat today and picked up Amir. They found four laptops in his hideout.        
	Following Amirs interrogation, the police raided the homes of three men who would buy the machines from him and sell them.

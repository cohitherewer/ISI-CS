          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A Trinamul Congress rally in Singur on Sunday demanding 300 acres from the Tata project. (Ananda Das)                                  
	Singur, Sept. 14: Many Singur resi- dents are eagerly awaiting tomorrows Left Front rally, where they expect leaders to explain the new rehabilitation package for landlosers.        
	Sambhunath Ghosh of Beraberi, who had refused to accept the governments compensation for his small 10-cottah plot, is going to attend the rally, leaving the baggage of his political preferences behind.        
	The man, who had been to Mamata Banerjees dharna on Durgapur Expressway with the hope of getting his 10 cottah back, today said: I need to know more about the package and I want to hear it from the leaders. So, I will attend the Left Front rally tomorrow.         
	If the package is for real, he will collect the cheque.        
	Ghosh, 40, had initially thought the new offer was too good to be true. But he sat up seeing todays newspaper ads where the government promised 50 per cent more as compensation and preference in jobs among other benefits.        
	If Ghosh is waiting in anticipation for tomorrow, so is Bimal Ruidas, though his family had given over half an acre for the project willingly.        
	We had heard about the package. We saw the ad today. But we want the leaders to spell out the details and explain it to us, said Bimal, 30, of Joymollah, whose family had willingly given over half an acre.        
	If the Nano project stays in Singur, Bimal stands to gain even more because he had started working as a Tata Motors trainee after a stint at an Industrial Training Institute (ITI).        
	Samsul Haque of Joymollah, who supplied construction material to the project before it was shut down, said: Many unwilling farmers are now likely to accept the package as it promises a job for every landloser family.         
	Samsul, himself a landloser, though willing, is also excited about the offer. We, too, had wanted something more than a mere compensation. Im sure the package will also attract many farmers who were doubting the governments intentions.        
	Sona Mal could be one of them. The 53-year-old Beraberi farmer, who had lost half an acre, said: Im consulting my family on what to do (about the new offer). I will go to the rally to hear what the Left Front leaders have to say. If I am convinced, I will take the cheque.        
	However impressive the offer, some farmers still hope to get their land back. Didi (Mamata Banerjee) will make it happen, said Kartick Ghosh, 42.        
	Khagen Ghosh, 40, said: We doubt whether the government will implement the package.        
	Local CPM leaders claimed such farmers were few. We will present 100 farmers tomorrow who have not taken the compensation but are welcoming the new package, said Dibakar Das, a district committee member.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Somen Mitra                                  
	Calcutta, June 28: The meeting between Congress leader Somen Mitra and the Trinamul Congresss Mamata Banerjee has prompted sections in both parties to smell a subtle game by the Left to nip in the bud any chances of a grand alliance in the approaching general elections.        
	Congress sources said the state leadership was not kept in the picture when Mitra called on the Trinamul chief last night to discuss the formation of an anti-CPM platform.        
	Mitras perceived proximity to the Left  Mamata herself had once garnished the charge with a botanical barb by dubbing him watermelon (green outside, red inside)  is making many wonder whether the CPM had a hand in the private peace initiative.        
	Mitras detractors in the Congress often insinuate that he had repeatedly won the Sealdah Assembly seat with the undeclared support of the CPM. Sealdah will be merged with another constituency in the next Assembly election.        
	The Congress leader has vehemently denied the charge of an understanding with the Left. Today, too, Mitra said he met Mamata only because of feedback from the Congress rank and file who wanted a common platform against the CPM.        
	But who knows if Somenda is being planted by the CPM to jeopardise the partys poll prospect in the coming Lok Sabha elections? a Trinamul leader asked.        
	The Left certainly wont mind if an alliance between the Congress and Trinamul does not come through. The panchayat election results have indicated that if the same voting pattern is followed in the Lok Sabha polls, a united Opposition can wrest as many as 10 seats from the Left.        
	Another Congress leader said the perennial feud within the Congress might have prompted Mitra to explore ways to close ranks with Mamata. Sidelined in the party after Priya Ranjan Das Munshi took over as PCC chief, Mitra is looking for a chance to belittle Priyada.        
	Several Trinamul functionaries from the districts have started requesting Mamata to hold a working committee meeting before aligning with Mitra.

          OUR BUREAU                               
	Singur/Calcutta, Aug. 13: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today renewed his appeal to the Trinamul Congress to sit for talks on Singur, saying the state needs its co-operation.        
	I earnestly urge the Opposition, particularly the Trinamul Congress, to come and join talks as the state needs its co-operation. It is not as if the government is infallible and the Opposition needs to point out our mistakes, the chief minister said in the Assembly.        
	Lets discuss Singur and other industry initiatives without delay. Our joint efforts should be a continuous process.        
	While Bhattacharjee tried to reason with the Opposition, home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti visited the Tata Motors small-car plant and held a meeting for over two hours with senior officials.         
	We will take strong action against those who resort to violent movement or disrupt work in the plant, he said.         
	If any employee is prevented from joining work or if anyone blocks the gates of the Tata Motors plant or tries to enter forcibly, we will take stern measures. We will lodge FIRs and start cases, the home secretary warned. No political meeting or procession will be allowed by blocking the gates, he said.        
	Asked if the government would prevent Mamata from sitting on dharna on August 24, he said: If any political party stages a peaceful protest, the government will allow it. But no disruption to normal work at the plant will be allowed.         
	Reacting to Bhattacharjees appeal, Mamata today accused him of not keeping his promise to discuss the land acquisition problem. I will be ready for talks if 400 acres acquired forcibly from unwilling farmer of Singur are returned, she said. If necessary, we will help the government find alternative land where the ancillary units can be shifted, she added.        
	The chief minister wrote to me on December 18, 2006, promising to discuss the land acquisition problem but since then he has not bothered to keep his promise, she said. My MLAs told me about his appeal for talks. But he is himself guilty of breaking his promise. What can I do?         
	Mamata said she suspected the government may resort to repressive measures to foil her dharna. The government will be held responsible if any untoward incident takes place.

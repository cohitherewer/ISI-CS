	Facts and figures of the dharna in Singur from August 24:               
	Q: Why has the dharna been called?        
	The indefinite siege has been organised to demand the return of 400 acres forcibly acquired from unwilling farmers in Singur. Spearheading the dharna is Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress and the Save Farmland Committee, which her party backs. Other forces, like Somen Mitras Pragatishil Indira Congress, will also join Mamata.        
	Q: How many camps will there be?        
	Twenty-one camps will be set up around the Tata Motors small-car factory.        
	Q: How many people are expected to participate?        
	Over one lakh people would be present on Sunday  the first day of the dharna. After that, there will be about 200 people in each camp everyday. The dharna will begin at 1pm. Mamata is expected to reach around 2pm        
	Q: Will the same people continue the dharna or will there be relay teams?        
	There will be relay teams.        
	Q: On whose land are the camps being pitched?        
	On government land, beside the Durgapur Expressway.        
	Q: What about food and other facilities?        
	A kitchen is being set up at Rupnarayanpur, 300m from the factory site. Toilets will also be set up nearby.        
	Q: What could trigger trouble?        
	As a large number of people will be present near the factory gates at all hours, stray comments on workers, or even a jostle, could spark a flare-up. Also, if Trinamul supporters block the expressway and police try to move them, there could be trouble.        
	Q: Will workers be stopped from going in?        
	Mamata insists the dharna will be peaceful and no one will be stopped from entering the site. In case workers face any difficulty, they will be escorted inside, the police say.         
	Q: How many workers come from outside?        
	Of the 3,000 workers engaged in the plant, over 60 per cent come from outside.         
	Q: Where will the camps be set up?        
	The camps will be at Sanapara, Khasherchak, Singherbheri, Khasherbheri and Joymollah, all near the Durgapur Expressway. They will be set up approximately 200m from each other and about 100m from the factory wall. There are five gates to the plant on the expressway side and there will be five camps facing them. Mamata will be in the camp near the main gate at Singherbheri.        
	Q: What is the security deployment like?        
	Around 2,500 policemen and the Rapid Action Force will be present. Two water cannons have been brought in.        
	Q: Who is the seniormost police officer in charge?        
	Kuldiep Singh, inspector- general, western range.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bill for Ambani university
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 21: The government will table the bill to set up Anil Ambanis private university in Nadias Haringhata in the ongoing session of the Assembly.        
	The trust that set up the Institute of Information and Communication Technology in Gujarat will build a similar institute of international standards here, offering education, training and research facilities in information and communication technology, said higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri.         
	A copy of the Bill was circulated among the MLAs today.         
	The proposed Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology is going to be the second private university in the state after the Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda University.         
	The Anil Ambani-led group had sought the states permission to start the institute three years ago.         
	The government had granted the permission in 2005 and allotted over 60 acres in Haringhata, about 70km from Calcutta, at a subsidised rate but work on the university could not begin in the absence of the act.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 21: The Bengal government has said it would arrange for accreditation from the National Council for Teacher Education for all primary teachers training institutes in the next two months.        
	The move comes after the high court declared all 138 institutes in the state illegal last month because they did not have the councils permit  in some cases for infrastructure, in others for the course.        
	The ruling put a question mark on the future of over 70,000 students of the institutes  of which 80 are private and the rest state government- run.        
	Three government officials will leave for Bhubaneswar, where the regional headquarters of the council is based, on October 28. We are hoping to complete the process of arranging the accreditation for all the institutes latest by December end, said Sukumar Mahapatra, the school education department joint secretary and a member of the team.

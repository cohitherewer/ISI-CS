                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Signature war against siege
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 30: More than 16,000 people have signed up in less than a day for a campaign in the states tech hub against Mamata Banerjees siege in Singur.        
	Mamta Didi plz dont stop Bengals development, read one of the messages on the 100ftX5ft sheet where passersby in Salt Lakes Sector V were struggling to find space to put in their names this evening.         
	Let us all support Project Nano, read another message.        
	More than 5,000 people signed today, though 75 per cent of the offices in Sector V are shut on Saturday.        
	That is because if the campaign was restricted among IT and allied professions yesterday, it transcended the tech barrier today.        
	Teachers, housewives and students travelled to Sector V from as far away as Howrah to pen their signatures and comments in support of industrialisation. We want industrialisation and the states development, said Anusila Bose, from Bhowanipore.         
	Sujata Chatterjee, the head of psychology department at Bijoy Krishna College, Howrah, came after her classes.         
	One must understand that no industry will come to Bengal in future if the Tatas are driven out, said Damayanti Ghosh, a student of the Institute of Engineering and Management.         
	She signed on the sheet with her friend Jayati Bandyopadhyay. We felt it was our duty to take part in the campaign, said Jayati.         
	The signature campaign outside Infinity building was started by the employees union of the state-run IT firm Webel around 3.30pm yesterday. Initially, we had requested some people to sign on the white sheet, but it soon became spontaneous, said Moloy Pal Chowdhury, the union vice-president.         
	Chuni Lal Naskar, who works for a private security agency and is posted at a software firm, feels there is no alternative to industrialisation. If these offices were not set up, I would have been jobless, Naskar said after he put his signature.         
	Another signature campaign will be launched at Metro Channel tomorrow.         
	It will be organised by a group formed through the campaign website http://wesupportindustry.silicogene.com/ISR. Software professionals Ranjan Basu, Jhuma Mukherjee and Angshuman Mukherjee had set up the site on August 24.         
	Around 4,000 people have joined the site, said Basu who has also signed for the Salt Lake campaign.         
	After tomorrows signature campaign, a memorandum will be submitted to the governor, the Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court and the chief minister.

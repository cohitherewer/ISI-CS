The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Citu spanner in fledgling factory
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Citu spanner in fledgling factory
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Citu supporters at the factory gate. (Rana Ghosh)                                  
	Durgapur, July 9: Citu supporters stormed a cement fac-tory, planted red flags, asked employees to get out and forced the unit shut.         
	When the managing director of Durgapur Plus Cement called the local Laodoha police station, the officer on duty pleaded helplessness and advised him to meet the CPM local committee secretary, Mahabir Joshi, at the party office.        
	When Anukul Maity called the Durgapur subdivisional officer, he was told that no action could be taken until a formal complaint was lodged.         
	A complaint was faxed to him but no action had been taken till late evening.         
	Around two dozen men stood in front of the closed factory gate and shouted slogans through the day.         
	Production at the Rs 100-crore factory had started in March and an expansion work was on. The unit producing 100 tonnes of cement a day now is scheduled to make 5,000 tonnes a day by December.         
	Production-in-charge Sanjoy Haldar said the Citu supporters marched in around 8.30, hurling abuses at the workers.         
	Stop work or else we will lock you up in a room and burn you alive, the intruders told Haldar. I ran out and called our MD, Haldar said.         
	The factory is yet to have an organised workers union.        
	Maity, who lives in Calcutta, said: I was stunned to hear the police officer ask me to go the party office because they were helpless. The SDO, too, did nothing.        
	SDO Basu Roychowdhury said he was busy in a meeting when Maity called him on his mobile. I am unaware of the fax. I am not in my office, he said around 5pm.        
	Joshi could not be contacted. Burdwan Citu president Debabrata Banerjee denied Citus role in halting production. The local Citu workers were protesting against the managements decision to hire labourers from outside. But we have not asked them to stop production. We dont support such things. If such a thing has happened, it is wrong. I will talk to Joshi and other local CPM and Citu leaders, he said.        
	Maity said Citu had stepped into the factory a fortnight ago. Someone called Haru accused me of carrying out illegal activities. They told me I was wrong in engaging outsiders for the civil and mechanical construction job. I told them engaging labourers was the discretion of the management and there was nothing illegal in it, said Maity.        
	All permanent workers in the factory belong to Laodoha.         
	Only a handful of skilled workers have been engaged by contractors from Murshidabad, Maity added.        
	The Citu supporters had left that day realising they could not provide me skilled hands from the locality but threatened to come back.        
	Yesterday, someone had threatened Maity over the phone to shut down the unit if he did not come to the Citu office for a meeting. He had ignored it.

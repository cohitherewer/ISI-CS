The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | GL plan for cars from plains
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   GL plan for cars from plains
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Siliguri, Oct. 11: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today regretted the assault on drivers of vehicles without Gorkhaland or GL number plates, but said cars with WB numbers were unwelcome to the hills.         
	We regret the assault on the drivers. Some miscreants who want to defame our party may have attacked them, said Binay Tamang, the press and publicity secretary of the Morcha, distancing the outfit from yesterdays incident at Dilaram, near Kurseong. Vehicles not having GL number plates can be intercepted.        
	Norbu Lama, president of the All Transport Joint Action Committee of the Morcha, said: We would like to suggest that cars with WB numbers from the plains should change the plates at Pintail before entering Darjeeling and Kurseong and at Salugara before going to Kalimpong or Gangtok. If Gangtok-bound, they can change to WB numbers again at Rongpo, the Sikkim-Bengal border.         
	While going down, they can change back to WB numbers.         
	Today, in the peak tourist season, only four to five taxis went to the hills from NJP.

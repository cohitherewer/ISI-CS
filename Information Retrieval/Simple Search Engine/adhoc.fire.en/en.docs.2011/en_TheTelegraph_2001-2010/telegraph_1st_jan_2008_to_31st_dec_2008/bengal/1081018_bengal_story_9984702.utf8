          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 17: The Trinamul Congress today threatened to move court against Ratan Tata for alleging that the party led by Mamata Banerjee had acted for vested interests.         
	He (Tata) should come out with evidence and establish that Mamata had acted for vested interests. The onus lies with the Tatas. We demand an unconditional apology from him, failing which we will take judicial recourse, said Partha Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly.         
	Why is Tata holding the brief for the CPM and the chief minister? he asked, adding: His (Tatas) statement is nothing but an attempt to malign the party and our chief.         
	In an open letter, Tata had said: Unfortunately, the confrontative actions by the Trinamool Congress led by Ms. Mamata Banerjee and supported by vested interests and certain political parties, opposing the acquisition of land by the state government, has caused serious disruption to the progress of the Nano plant.         
	Praising the state government, Tata said: Agitation and violence drove away many industries around 30 years ago, and it has only been in recent times that the present government has been able to rebuild the confidence of investors to invest in the state.        
	All our interactions with the chief minister and the industries minister in particular, as also with several other officers, have been exemplary.        
	He asked the people of Bengal if they wanted a destructive political environment of confrontation... and lawlessness or education and jobs.        
	Trinamul MLA Saugata Ray said: Ive never heard of an industrialist giving a statement directly in favour of a state government and its chief minister and directly against the principal Opposition.        
	Some Left leaders like the RSPs Kshiti Goswami felt Tata had not behaved like an industrialist.         
	Party MP Manoj Bhattacharya said: This is personal observation of an individual industrialist. Ratan Tata does not have all-pervasive influence on the people of Bengal. The letter is not going to help form public opinion.         
	The Forward Blocs Ashok Ghosh felt the comment was undesirable. The CPI refused to comment.         
	Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee said: It is not right for a businessman to speak in favour of a party.        
	Left Front chief and CPM state secretary Biman Bose said Tata had issued the letter as an industrialist. Since we are not industrialists, we will not comment on it.

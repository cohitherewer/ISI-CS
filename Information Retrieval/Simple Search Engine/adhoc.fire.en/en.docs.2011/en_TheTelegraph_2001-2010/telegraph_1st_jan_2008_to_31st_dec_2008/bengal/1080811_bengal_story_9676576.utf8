	Calcutta, Aug. 10: A one-year-old child was found abandoned in MR Bangur Hospital this evening.         
	Police said his mother had left the hospital after 6pm asking the relative of a patient to look after him while she was away.         
	She had said she would return in 10 minutes, but when she did not show up after two hours, the woman took the boy to the hospital authorities.         
	If the parents are not traced by tomorrow, the child will be sent to a government home.

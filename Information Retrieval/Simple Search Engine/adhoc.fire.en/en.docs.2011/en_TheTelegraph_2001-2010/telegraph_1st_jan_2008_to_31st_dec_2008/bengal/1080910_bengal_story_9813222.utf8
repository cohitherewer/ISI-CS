  - Demand for industry gets louder in Singur          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Singur, Sept. 9: Nearly 3,000 Singur residents today brought out a procession demanding industrialisation and resumption of work at the Tata Motors plant.        
	The march that started near Singur railway station around 4pm had farmers, teachers and youths walking together. They did not go near the Tata Motors project site, but turned back about 2km from the plant.        
	We demand industrialisation and that work should begin immediately at the Nano factory. The more the factory grows, the greater will be the job opportunities for local people, said Balai Sabui, the Hooghly secretariat member of the CPM, which described the procession as a mahamichhil (grand procession).        
	The Singur residents who support the Save Farmland Committee stayed glued to their television sets today, curious for details of the meeting of a committee formed to work out the scope and modalities of returning land to farmers.        
	Since the meeting started, I have been in front my TV. I saw the meeting start and Im hopeful something will emerge in the next few days... we will get back our land, said 55-year-old Mayarani Kolay, whose two acres in Koylapara were acquired for the small-car project.        
	Bhuban Bagui, 42, whose two acres in Gopalnagar are now part of the plant, said he had faith in Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee.         
	We are confident that those of us who are unwilling will get back our land. There is bound to be a solution or else the committee would not have held a meeting today, he said.        
	Ananta Bali, 37, who lost over an acre to the factory, said he wanted to be present when the committee inspected the project area tomorrow in search of surplus land. I want to be there to help them identify the land, the Gopalnagar resident said.         
	Work at the Tata Motors unit was stopped 11 days ago after workers were heckled, allegedly by Trinamul activists sitting on an indefinite dharna at the gates of the plant from August 24.        
	The blockade was lifted on Sunday night after talks between chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata in Calcutta.        
	But Tata Motors has made it clear that work would not resume till the matter is fully resolved.

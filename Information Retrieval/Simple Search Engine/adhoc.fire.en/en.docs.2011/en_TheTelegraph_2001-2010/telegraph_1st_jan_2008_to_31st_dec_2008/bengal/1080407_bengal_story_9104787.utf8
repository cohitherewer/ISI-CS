          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, April 6: The Nadia administration today started culling poultry birds in the Gangnapur area where bird flu was confirmed yesterday.        
	Over 2.25 lakh birds had been culled in the district during the first outbreak of the avian influenza in January and February.         
	Samples from Mondalpukur village were sent to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal after 50 backyard chickens died last week.        
	District animal resource development officials said about 25,000 birds, including 3,000 chickens of a government poultry, will be culled within 5km of Mondalpukur.        
	Mondalpukur village is in Kalyani subdivision, which was hit by the flu the last time. Birds were culled in Haringhata, 20km from Mondalpukur, in February. Tehatta and Krishnagar subdivisions were also flu-affected.        
	An animal husbandry team from the Centre is expected to visit the newly affected area soon. Six culling teams were pressed into service today and we expect to complete culling by Tuesday, said Arindam Chakraborty, the veterinary surgeon for Ranaghat block II. Almost 5,000 birds were culled today.        
	Raghunathgunj in neighbouring Murshidabad was hit by the flu in mid-March. About 70, 000 chickens had to be culled.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Storm wreaks havoc in bird haven,1500 dead

	Sept. 29: Over 1,500 birds were killed in a storm that ripped through north Bengal last evening and the rain that came with it.        
	Most of the birds found dead at the Kulik sanctuary in North Dinajpur, Adina Deer Park in Malda and at Angina, a bird haven in neighbouring South Dinajpur, were open-bill storks.        
	Hundreds of other birds were injured and were seen hobbling around on broken legs or with damaged wings dangling in all three districts.        
	Employees of the Kulik sanctuary said hundreds of birds were killed, though the divisional forest officer put the number at around 100 and described the loss as minimal.        
	Around a hundred birds have been killed and another 400 or so injured. We are taking care of those that are alive. There is little we can do as we cannot prevent a natural event like a storm. It was a slight loss, said Asish Sen, the Raiganj divisional forest officer.        
	The sanctuary employees expressed fear that the storm might affect the arrival of winter migrants.         
	Sen agreed. We are apprehensive that this will lower the number of visitors coming to roost here.        
	At the sanctuary, four forest department personnel were seen collecting the injured birds and taking them to a sunlit patch of the ground. More than a thousand birds were fluttering there.        
	One of the four, Akai Barman, said: More than 500 birds have died. They were swept out of their nests. More than 2,000 nestlings were injured. We are collecting them and putting them out in the sunlight. They recover well when their feathers dry out.        
	Barman said open-bills, night herons, cormorants and other water birds came to the sanctuary to set up rookeries to rear their young during the monsoon.        
	At Angina, local youths were tending to the injured birds. Biswajit Basak, secretary of the Angina Birds and Environment Protection Society, said there was no alternative in the absence of a rescue centre in the area. Women are giving their old saris which we are tearing off to wrap around the broken legs. We are applying antiseptic to the wounds, he said.        
	More than 500 dead birds were buried in a pit. Basak said over 20,000 birds visit Angina, which had not been declared a bird sanctuary.        
	Malda divisional forest officer Rajendra Kumar Jakhar said over 500 open-bill storks and their young died at Adina. We have counted more than 500 dead birds. Many are injured and the toll might go up.

	Krishnagar, July 2: Told on her face that she was a burden, an 80-year-old woman left her house in Nadias Dhubulia 12 days ago.        
	Today, the police escorted her home and told her daughter-in-law she would be arrested if she failed to look after the old woman.        
	Anjali Haldar can share the responsibility with her late husbands younger brother, who lives separately. He could be picked up as well if he neglects his mother, said Bimal Mirdha, the officer in charge of Dhubulia police station, 120km from Calcutta.        
	Charubala Haldar had taken shelter in a temple after leaving home on June 20. Her husband, an affluent farmer, had died 20 years ago.         
	Every now and then, Anjali and her two sons and daughter told me I was a burden on them. They did not offer me food and sometimes told me to get out of the house. I left home when I could not take it, said Charubala.        
	Her elder son Hiralal died of cancer two years ago. His widow Anjali, 55, draws pension from the postal department, where he worked.         
	Charubalas other son Rabi, a schoolteacher in Bethudahari, 15km away, lives with his wife and two children. He doesnt bother about me, either. I want to die at times, said Charubala, breaking down.         
	Mobile phone dealer Kalu Dutta, who went to the temple three days, ago found Charubala sitting in a corner and asked the priest about her. I saw tears streaming down her eyes as she sat quietly. I decided to take her home, said Dutta, 35.        
	Dutta told his neighbours about the woman and all of them together submitted a petition to the police, asking them to intervene. Mashima refused to lodge a formal complaint against her family members, said Dutta.        
	Anjali said her mother-in-law had left home because of some misunderstanding.        
	Rabi, who was missing from home today, has been told to appear in Dhubulia police station tomorrow.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Dec. 1: The outfit leading the tribal agitation in Lalgarh has said it will block National Highway 6 and rail tracks from December 4 if West Midnapore officials do not heed its demand for talks.        
	The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities has given the government time till December 3, by when West Midnapore officials would have to visit Dalilpur or any other place under the Sijua gram panchayat. Chhatradhar Mahato, the outfits leader, said: We will give the administration time till December 3. Then well launch a bigger district-wide agitation that will include blocking National Highway 6 and obstructing railway tracks, particularly the lines from Kharagpur to Jamshedpur and Adra.         
	The committee seems to have relaxed its position slightly on the list of demands from the administration, but it made it clear that the road blocks in Lalgarh and other places in West Midnapore would be lifted only after the talks.         
	Chhatradhar said it was not necessary that the meeting with the officials would have to be held in Dalilpur. It is not that the meeting must take place at Dalilpur. We want the meeting anywhere under the Sijua gram panchayat. Let the SP and other officials come and discuss our problems. Then we can always withdraw our agitation. But they will have to come first.         
	He said: The demands like the SP would have to hold his ears and the police would have to crawl in apology were made because of public rage. It does not necessarily mean they would have to do it. We just want to say, please come for talks and that will placate the villagers.         
	The police, however, are not convinced that the agitators will give up so easily.         
	We have met many of their demands already, said superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar Singh.         
	We have withdrawn the police camps in Lalgarh, Belpahari and Salboni. We have removed the inspector in charge of Lalgarh police station and dropped charges against eight arrested persons, including three schoolboys. We have also agreed to bear medical expenses of those injured during police raids. But till now, we have not received any positive response from them, he said.        
	They have not taken any initiative to withdraw the road blocks. Instead, over the past five days they obstructed roads at new places and Jhargram town has been cut off again. We dont think the agitators want discussions for any positive outcome, Singh said.        
	A district official said those leading the agitation had little control over the tribals. We earlier held meetings with tribal leaders and they assured us the roadblocks would be withdrawn. But it was not done. What if the administration went for the meeting and faced confrontation? he asked.        
	This evening, about 600 tribals marched to the CPMs local committee office at Beltikri in Lalgarh. They broke the lock and set the office on fire after pouring kerosene.         
	Dahareswar Sen, a CPM district secretariat member, said: There were some of our comrades inside, but they left after locking the office seeing the agitators.         
	Chhatradhar said the people were angry with the CPM workers because they had removed a road block from the area. This was public anger against the CPM workers. We, however, do not support this kind of violence.

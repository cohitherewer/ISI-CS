	Kandi, June 15: A young IAS officers bungalow here turns into a free school every weekend, where children from poor families, some of whom were forced to drop out of school, learn English, mathematics and computers among other subjects.        
	Subdivisional officer Bijoy Bharti is Kandis new hero. The 32-year-old, who grew up in Bihars Nalanda grappling with poverty, was posted in this subdivision of Murshidabad in January.        
	Bhartis first students were Mamata and Sagari Harijan, sisters who came to pick garbage from his garden.        
	Sir called for us and asked about our education. When we told him that we were forced to drop out after Class IV because we were poor, he told us to take lessons from him, said 11-year-old Sagari.        
	Seventeen others have joined them over the past few months. Mamata, 10, said: I can now read and write on my own because of saheb.        
	The classes, starting at 7.30am every Saturday and Sunday, begin with mathematics and English. They continue till mid-day.         
	In between, Bharti imparts basic computer training. There are evening classes, too, between 7 and 8, especially meant for higher secondary students.        
	Bharti does not see munificence in his effort. There isnt any generosity involved. These kids were in need of some guidance since most could not afford private tuition. I had spare time on weekends and Im glad I am of some use to them, he said.        
	He also said he had benefited from the classes himself. My written Bengali wasnt too good. I wasnt able to write well. But it has improved considerably.         
	Bharti ranked 140 in the IAS examinations of 2005. After training, he was posted in Kandi, 235km from Calcutta.         
	Having graduated from Patna Science College, Bharti did his MA in geography from Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, in 1999 and then an MPhil.        
	Bharti said he wanted to buy land to set up a full-fledged school for the poor in Kandi. I may not be here but the school would remain.        
	District magistrate Subir Bhadra said the administration would extend all possible help to Bharti to fulfil his dream.

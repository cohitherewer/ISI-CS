	Calcutta, Oct. 14: The condition of industries minister Nirupam Sen, who was hospitalised with high blood pressure last night, is stable, doctors said today.        
	Sen was rushed to the Salt Lake hospitals intensive coronary care unit (ICCU) after he complained of chest pain and uneasiness. His condition is stable and the blood pressure has been stabilised, a hospital spokesperson said.         
	We suspect Sen is suffering from ischaemic heart disease, a doctor treating him said. Ischaemic heart is a condition in which the heart recei- ves less blood and oxygen because of constricted arteries.         
	Party colleagues said Sen had been suffering from hypertension and cardiac disorder for the past few years. He had fallen ill at the height of the Singur standoff last month. Yesterday, he attended the partys central committee meeting and went to Jyoti Basus house with the other leaders in the afternoon. However, he felt uneasy after returning home in the evening, a CPM state secretariat member said.         
	Tests conducted today revealed that there were no fresh abnormalities in his cardiac condition. All abnormalities detected in the general echo cardiogram and ECG are pre-existing, the doctor said.        
	Tomorrow, he will undergo an advanced echo cardiogram and further blood tests. A seven-member medical board will decide in the morning whether to shift him from the ICCU, an official said.         
	The doctors will decide after tomorrows tests whether an angiography is required.        
	Sen, a driving force of the governments pro-industry policies, was very upset after the Nano project had to be relocated from Bengal. The day Ratan Tata announced the pullout, he had expressed his desire to leave the state.        
	Hospital sources said he had a light breakfast and normal lunch.

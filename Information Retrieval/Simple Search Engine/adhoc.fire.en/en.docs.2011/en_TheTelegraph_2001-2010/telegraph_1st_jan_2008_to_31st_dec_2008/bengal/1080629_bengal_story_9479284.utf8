          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 28: A graduate who allegedly posed as a Reliance Communications executive to dupe people of Rs 24 lakh with promises of dealerships was arrested today.        
	Monjina Ganguly alias Priyanka, under the scanner for a month now, was ensnared in a trap laid by sleuths of Calcutta polices detective department. The 40-year-old got a taste of her own medicine when she was picked up while negotiating near Alipur Zoological Gardens with a candidate the officers had sent as a decoy.        
	Police said Ganguly would prey on the gullible in and around the city with dealership offers, collecting Rs 2.5 lakh-Rs 3.5 lakh from each candidate.         
	She travelled to other states, too, including Bihar and Orissa, promising candidates dealerships, said a senior officer.        
	In another incident, Jadavpur police picked up two youths for allegedly collecting Rs 13 lakh from people by promising them credit cards that were never delivered.        
	Sanjoy Ghosh and Rajiv Bose, in their mid-twenties, were arrested from a rented house in Regent Place. Attired like executives, the duo had even hired a receptionist to give the place the look and feel of an office.        
	Some residents of the Jadavpur area had paid for the cards from a private bank but hadnt received them. They told the banks regional manager who, in turn, informed the police.        
	Sanjoy is from Chinsurah and Rajiv is from Sonarpur. They charged Rs 10,000-20,000 for cards to be delivered at home, said D.P. Singh, South 24-Parganas additional superintendent of police (industrial).        
	No money, other than a nominal processing fee in some cases, is required to get a credit card. Apparently, the duo wangled the money to furnish documents. Earlier, they had even got cards issued in false names, used them to shop and sold the items at a higher price, Singh said.

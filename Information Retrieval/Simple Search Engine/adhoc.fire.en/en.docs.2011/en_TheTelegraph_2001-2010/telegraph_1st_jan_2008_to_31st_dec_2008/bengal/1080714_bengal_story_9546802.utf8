          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          BOOKWORM? The bull on a patch of green adjacent to the house that it attacked. Picture by Ramen Mondal                                   
	Balurghat, July 13: A bull smashed through the bamboo wall of a house in this South Dinajpur town last night, broke furniture and ate up the textbooks of a Class VIII girl.        
	Nabin Mahanta ran pillar to post for help. But police and the fire brigade turned him away, saying chasing away bulls was not their job.        
	The bull remained inside the house for over 10 hours. We took refuge in a temple for the night after even our neighbours, who had pitched in to drive out the animal, failed, said Nabin.        
	His son Chanchal, a house painter, said all of them had gone to a Rath mela last evening. We came back around 8pm and found the bull in the house. It had broken into our tin-roof, bamboo-walled house and scattered everything around with its horns, Chanchal said. We could see it chewing away books and clothes.        
	The family shouted for help and neighbours rushed in with torches. They threw water on the animal, but it did not budge. It came out of the house around 7am today.        
	Around 10 last night, Chanchal had dialled Balurghat police station. The duty officer said it was not his job to save people from bull attacks. He told me to get hold of local hooligans to get rid of it, Chanchal said.        
	The family took shelter in the temple after the fire bri- gade, too, refused to answer its distress call.        
	After the bull left this morning, the family went in. Things were strewn around and the animal had devoured all the books belonging to Chanchals sister Dolly.        
	The girl looked crestfallen. My father, a rickshaw-puller, and brother somehow arrange for the money to buy me books. Now I have nothing to go to school with, Dolly said.        
	Nabin said his daughter was a sincere student. She tries to study without taking private classes. All her efforts have gone in vain.        
	Additional superintendent of police Imran Wahab said he would probe the alleged police negligence. The police should not have behaved this way. It was a mistake, Wahab said.

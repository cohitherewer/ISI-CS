          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, June 3: A Murshidabad police station twice sent back a woman who went to lodge a complaint against local goons who had hit her with a rod and allegedly robbed her.         
	Her husband, who went to the police station at least 10 times when she was being treated in hospital for her head injuries, was told the personnel were busy with the panchayat polls.         
	Rangila Biwi went to the Murshidabad superintendent of police today, 39 days after she was assaulted, to lodge a complaint against the officer in charge of Bhagabangola police station.        
	OC Tanmoy Ghosh should have registered the comp- laint. I have asked him to do so immediately, superintendent Basab Dasgupta said.        
	According to Rangila, 35, her neighbours Atarul Sheikh and Mainul Sheikh had raided her home at Ramkantapur after her 10-year-old son threw stones at their houses while playing on the nearby field.         
	They started beating up my son Jahidul and I tried to save him. Then they hit me. As I lay on the ground, bleeding, they snatched my gold chain and took away Rs 2,000 from the almirah, she alleged.        
	After the goons left, Rangila and her husband Ashadul went to the Bhagabangola police station, 5km away. The OC told me to get my wife hospitalised first, said Ashadul, who owns a two-acre farmland.         
	Rangila was treated at two hospitals until May 16. She got 12 stitches on the head.        
	During the period of my wifes treatment, I visited the police station at least 10 times, but was told that the police were busy with the polls, Ashadul said.        
	The chief ministers repeated sermon to policemen  never ignore peoples complaints, no matter how poor they are  has evidently fallen on deaf ears.        
	Rangila went to the police station again after being released from the Behrampore District Hospital. This time, Ghoshbabu said there was no need to lodge a complaint as I had been declared fit. He threatened me to slap charges against me when I pleaded him to accept my complaint, she alleged.        
	The district police chief said a probe had been ordered against Ghosh.

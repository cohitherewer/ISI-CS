  - Transport department kept in dark on clampdown        A STAFF REPORTER                                                  
	Calcutta, July 19: Around the time transport minister Subhas Chakraborty was tabling his departments budget in the Assembly yesterday, Calcutta High Court was making it mandatory for the government to fight pollution.        
	Emerging from the Assembly an hour later, Chakraborty was totally unaware of this, though his department would have to play an important role in enforcing the ruling.        
	What are you talking about? I have not heard anything about the court ruling, the minister said when asked about his reaction to the order.         
	This, perhaps, was an indication of the manner in which the environment department had prepared its notification to fight air pollution  which the court turned into a judicial order  keeping as much of it away from the transport department as it could.        
	We knew we would present the document in court in a case to which the transport department was a party, an environment official said, referring to a petition moved by environmentalist Subhas Dutta against automobile pollution. But we did not want the transport department to know its contents in details.        
	The official explained that because of the overriding influence of Citu in the transport department, several schemes and recommendations to clean the citys air had been put on the backburner (see box).        
	But the environment department said it had got the nod from the highest authorities for the notification. The notification was issued after it had been approved by the chief secretary and the advocate-general, environment secretary M.L. Meena said.        
	The notification bans the plying of commercial vehicles registered before January 1, 1993, and makes the conversion of autorickshaws to LPG or CNG mode a must.        
	When the petition came up for hearing yesterday and Dutta told the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh that the government had done nothing to clear air pollution, the lawyer for the state pollution control board presented the notification.        
	The timing was perfect and the decision of the court to make it part of the ruling was praiseworthy, an official said. Without that, it would not have had teeth. Many notifications are gathering dust at Writers Buildings.        
	An environment official said that apart from last-minute consultations, the transport department had no role to play while the notification was drafted.        
	We had learnt our lesson when we were forced to withdraw our no pollution control certificate, no fuel directive under pressure from the transport department, the official said.        
	The transport department declined comment today, other than saying it would definitely try to implement the courts order.

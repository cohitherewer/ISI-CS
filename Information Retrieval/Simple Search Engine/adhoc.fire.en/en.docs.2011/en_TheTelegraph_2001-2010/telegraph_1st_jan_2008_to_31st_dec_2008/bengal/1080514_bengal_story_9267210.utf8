                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Get out, says Mrinal
                            
	Calcutta, May 13: Power minister Mrinal Banerjee today asked newspersons to get out of his office after apparently calling them for a chat.        
	Walking down the Writers Buildings corridor, he asked two journalists who enquired whether there was any news from his department, to come over for a chat even if he had nothing to announce.         
	Assuming that all were welcome, about two dozen, including TV crew, landed in his office. What kind of behaviour is this. I told you I have nothing to say. Get out please, Banerjee told the two who had initially approached him.         
	Do you (journalists) know your problem? You have stooped so low that it is difficult to talk to you, he added.

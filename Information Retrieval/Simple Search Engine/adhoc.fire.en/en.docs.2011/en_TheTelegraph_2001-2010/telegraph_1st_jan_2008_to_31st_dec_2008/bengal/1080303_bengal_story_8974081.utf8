The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cell charger bursts on boy
                                                                                                               Cell charger bursts on boy
                            
	Bolpur, March 2: A seven-year-old boy was injured when a cellphone charger exploded on his face while he was pulling it out of a plug point in his house in a village in Rampurhat.        
	I thought a cracker had burst and then my son cried out. When I went to the room, Srikrishna was lying on the floor, shivering. He was bleeding from his right cheek where there was a deep wound, said Kabita Mondal, his mother.         
	Srikrishnas father, a driver, was not home. The boy was taken to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, where doctors said he might need cosmetic surgery.

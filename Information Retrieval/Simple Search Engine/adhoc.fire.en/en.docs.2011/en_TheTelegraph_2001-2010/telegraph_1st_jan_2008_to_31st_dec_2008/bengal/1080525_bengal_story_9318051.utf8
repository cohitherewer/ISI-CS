          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, May 24: A fake Joint Entrance Examination candidate was caught here on the first day of the medical and engineering college entrance test.        
	Police said Shyam Kumar, a second-year medical student in Bihar and resident of Nalanda, was impersonating Mukesh Prasad of Durgapur town.         
	He was hired by Mukesh to write the exam. Mukesh apparently fled home after the news of the arrest spread.         
	An invigilator at the Industrial Training Institute, Durgapur, detected the fraud 20 minutes after the exam began as the examinees photograph on the document provided by the West Bengal University of Technology did not match with Kumar. He was writing the Biology paper.         
	He was detained in another room as police were called.        
	A separate complaint will be lodged against Mukesh Prasad, said Rajat Banerjee, the Jadavpur University registrar who is an observer for JEE.         
	Durgapur additional sup- erintendent of police D.S. Rudra said: We have held Kumar and are looking for Mukesh.         
	A racket in fake JEE medical examinees was unearthed last year. Several dummy candidates and those they were impersonating were arrested.        
	Bomb attack        
	Trinamul Youth Congress leader Sanjay Bakshi tonight alleged that a bomb was hurled at his north Calcutta house.        
	Personnel from the Girish Park police station went to the house and confirmed that a bomb had indeed been thrown around 10pm.

	Malda, Dec. 12: The government has sounded a north Bengal alert following a bird flu outbreak in Assam, but at least 250 chickens have died in a Malda village in two days and no sample has been sent for tests.    
	A panchayat leader said the chickens got drowsy and died. Villagers complained of dead birds being dumped all over. Children are playing with them. Over 30,000 chickens had died in Malda in January and nearly two lakh were culled. The flu struck Assam less than a month after India declared itself free of the disease. Two teams from Delhi will join three already in that state to assist in human surveillance.        
	Raiganj: A laboratory here issued a blood test report purportedly signed by a doctor who had died before the sample was collected. Suffering from prolonged fever, Shakkhi Gopal Roy, 69, had been advised the test. His doctor was shocked to see the report because he had himself signed the pathologists death certificate. An inquiry has been ordered into the charge against North Bengal Patholo-gical Laboratory.        
	Burdwan: The form-al approval for the Andal airport has arrived. The promoters said it would be made operational within 30 months of getting the land.

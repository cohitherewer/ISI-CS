	Krishnagar, Aug. 4: Over 1,000 students in Nadia locked their school today demanding action against a teacher who allegedly thrashed a boy so severely that he fainted.        
	Tapas Biswas, the temporary teacher, slapped Bhuban Ghosh of Class IX in Daiyerbazar High school when he did not hand over his class test paper after the bell rang.         
	Bhuban said the teacher also beat him outside the school. He hit me at least a dozen times and I fainted.        
	Today, over 1,000 students locked the school after asking the teachers to leave. We demand action against the teacher. Bhuban is a good boy and the son of a poor farmer, said Joydeb Das, a Class X student.        
	Biswas denied the charge, but the headmaster has showcaused him.

          KINSUK BASU                          Far from the madding crowd: Villagers in Gopalnagar, a stones throw from the plant site, on Sunday afternoon. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Singur, Aug. 24: A strange irony is playing itself out in the villages of Singur.        
	Most villagers here dont want the Tatas to go away. But they feel that the manner in which the land was acquired was unfair, unjust and highhanded.        
	Madan Mohan Ghosh, 47, of Bamanpara has been a CPM cardholder since 1984. His father has surrendered his half an acre for the Tata project and collected the cheque for it.        
	But today, Ghoshs heart lies with Mamata and her siege, though he is not participating in it.        
	Sitting in the cowshed at his home, Ghosh, an insurance agent, said there should have been some dialogue with the common people whose land was taken away.        
	We want industry, the Tatas are a group with a lot of goodwill but the land was acquired in such an arbitrary manner and in such a hurry that it has left a lot of bitterness here, Ghosh said. Despite being a die-hard CPM supporter, I feel what Mamata is doing for the farmers is right.        
	Fatik Ghosh of Gopalnagar has many differences with Madan Mohan: the 45-year-old farmer is a Trinamul supporter whose fathers nearly 5 acres has been forcibly grabbed by the government and he has refused to collect the cheque for it.        
	But the differences end there: he, too, believes that ind- ustrialisation should take place, that it is good for the health of the state and that the Tatas should stay.         
	We know that the Tata project will be good for Singur, there will be prosperity here and jobs around, Fatik said. But why should it be such a big deal to shift the ancillary units? There are several hundred acres of low-lying land at Talchanmath near Joymolla, about two minutes drive from the main Tata project. The farmers there would happily sell the land since it is usually covered with water and there is no farming. That would sort out the problem.        
	No one is quite sure what Mamatas sit-in will yield and whether the unwilling farmers will get their land back. But there is a general feeling that whatever is happening in Calcutta and Singur may be taking place just a bit too late.        
	Work at the Tata project has progressed too far  about 85 per cent of the work is done, according to the chief minister  and the Nano could well roll out this October.         
	Besides, even if the Tatas were to leave, the land would not be suitable for cultivation. At least not for now and it would cost a lot to make acres of concrete flooring yield any crop again.        
	The dialogue should have started a long time back, said law student Gautam Maity of Barwaritala. The efforts by the government to hammer out some agreement with Mamata and the Trinamul pressure to make that happen should have taken place two years back. Trinamuls success in the panchayat polls here has suddenly kick-started the Singur battle.

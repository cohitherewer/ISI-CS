	June 25: Mamata Banerjee today went to East Midnapore but stayed at a safe distance from the blocks worst hit by the floods: Bhagabanpur, Patashpur and Chandipur.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief, who addressed a rally in Midnapore town to campaign for the municipal polls on Sunday, had to make a detour to see the ravages of the floods and the governments shoddy relief, at which she had trained her guns in Calcutta.        
	The chief minister went to Kolaghat during the floods but did not go to see the victims. If he had, he would have known how they are coping with lack of relief, medicines and water, Mamata said at a relief camp organised by her party in Panskura.        
	Asked why she, too, skipped the worst-hit areas, Mamata said: I had passed through them on June 17.         
	Bhagabanpur and its neighbouring blocks were not flooded on the morning of June 17. Mamata said: The way it was raining, I knew it would lead to floods.        
	She alleged that the government had engineered the release of water from barrages to create the floods in East Midnapore as Trinamul had won the zilla parishad.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Santiniketan, Jan. 11: One or more persons knocked on the windows of a girls hostel here last night and fled, triggering panic among the students.
    
	Students living in Mrinalini hostel, a clus- ter of five single-storey buildings, said they heard footsteps outside their rooms around 11.30pm. 
    
	Repeated knocks on the windows of room No. 6 followed. The two girls sleeping in the room woke up and cried out in fear. 
    
	Other students rushed to the room and the warden of the 80-bed hostel, Srilekha Singha, was called. 
    
	The students told me that some people had trespassed into the hostel and knocked on the windows. I went to the room and called a security guard patrolling the area, Singha said.
    
	A young man had walked into the hostel on Sunday and shot dead an MA student after accusing her of cheating on him.
    
	We have been very disturbed since then. When we heard the cries for help last night, many of us rushed out of our rooms, said a first-year Bengali MA student. 
    
	The guard who was called in by the warden did not find anybody near the hostel, which houses undergraduate and graduate students.
    
	Two more security guards were posted outside the hostel last night.
    
	Our security personnel thoroughly searched the place but did not find anybody. But several footsteps were heard and there were repeated knocks. So there may have been more than one person. Well step up patrol in the area, said chief security officer Swapan Mukherjee. 
    
	Asked if he would lodge a complaint with Bolpur police, he said No.

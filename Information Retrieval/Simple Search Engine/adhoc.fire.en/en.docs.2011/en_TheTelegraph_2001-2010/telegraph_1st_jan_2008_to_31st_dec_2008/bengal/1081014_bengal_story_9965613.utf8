	Calcutta, Oct. 13: Some of the central committee mem-bers from other states today questioned Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees public opposition to bandhs.         
	They said Buddhababus comments had embarrassed the party at the national level as well as in their states, a leader said. However, there was no question of Bhattacharjee responding today as the issue did not feature on the days agenda.         
	We had far more serious issues to discuss, politburo member M.K. Pandhe said.

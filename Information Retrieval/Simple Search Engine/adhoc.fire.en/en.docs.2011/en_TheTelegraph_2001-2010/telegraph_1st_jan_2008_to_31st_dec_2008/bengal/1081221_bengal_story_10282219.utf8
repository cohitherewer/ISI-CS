          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 20: A suspected Bangladeshi national was arrested today from Kidderpore with fake Indian currency worth Rs 10 lakh.         
	Police found the fake notes in denominations of Rs 1000 stashed in a leather bag. They said 45-year-old Mohammad Sarfaroz alias Yakub, the alleged kingpin in a racket, was arrested near Fancy Market.         
	We had a specific tip-off. We are trying to find out who was supposed to receive the consignment from Sarfaroz, said Rajeev Kumar, chief of the special task force.        
	He is a director of a Dhaka-based co-operative bank, Alif Multipurpose Co-operative Society Ltd, and a realtor. He is one of the top three persons who channels counterfeit currency into the metro cities, said Kumar.         
	Investigation revealed that he delivers fake currency of several crores every month through his agents. He has a strong network in Pakistan.        
	Kumar said the counterfeit notes had most of the RBI security features. But the watermark of Gandhiji is not as accurate. The quality of the paper is as good as the real currency notes, he said.        
	Police said Sarfaroz was arrested in 2005 from a hotel in the New Market area with counterfeit notes of Rs 6 lakh. He had then identified himself as Yakub. He jumped bail after five months, said an officer of the STF.        
	The GRP also arrested a man carrying an improvised firearm from Andal station.

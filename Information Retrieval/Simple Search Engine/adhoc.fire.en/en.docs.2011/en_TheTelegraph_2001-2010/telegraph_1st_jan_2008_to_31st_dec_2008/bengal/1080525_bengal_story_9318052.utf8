          OUR BUREAU                              
	May 24: A day after a Trinamul Congress-led mob killed a CPM man in Nandigram, some 200 CPM supporters have gone into hiding fearing more such strikes, but allegations of CPM attacks trickled in from other pockets of south Bengal.        
	At least one of those in hiding now is a newly-elected gram panchayat member, Naba Samanta. We are feeling insecure. Trinamul has unleashed a reign of terror since their victory in the polls, said Naba.        
	When the land war started in January 2007, Nabas house was gutted. I lived with nei- ghbours then. But the situation is worse now. Im scared to stay in those houses. Many of my comrades are also hiding like me, he added.        
	The CPMs Nandigram zonal committee secretary, Ashok Bera, said nearly 200 supporters had fled their homes.         
	Almost half of them have left Nandigram. The rest have taken shelter in party offices in Nandigram town.        
	Tension is running high in the area, Bera said.        
	Sheikh Khalek Mullick, 27, who was accused of leading CPM raids on Trinamul houses earlier, was stopped on his way to work yesterday and beaten and hacked to death.        
	 An all-party meeting was held at the Nandigram police station today. Trinamul, CPM, Congress and SUCI representatives attended it.        
	East Midnapore police chief S.S. Panda said all parties had been asked to exercise restraint. In the evening, we went to the villages and appealed for peace over loudspeakers.        
	In Birbhums Suri, Dilip Malo, a night guard at a poultry farm, was beaten up and hacked by alleged CPM workers last night when he was going to attend a feast to celebrate Trinamul victory. Bombs were hurled at my father as soon as he stepped out of our house. Then they pounced on him, said his son Pintu, 17.         
	Malo, 45, is now at SSKMs Hospitals intensive care unit. A doctor said his condition was extremely critical. He received severe injuries in the head and tongue and multiple fractures in the jaw bone.         
	In Burdwan, about 120 families of Forward Bloc suppor-ters have fled their homes in Bamunnara and its adjoining villages following alleged threats from CPM supporters.

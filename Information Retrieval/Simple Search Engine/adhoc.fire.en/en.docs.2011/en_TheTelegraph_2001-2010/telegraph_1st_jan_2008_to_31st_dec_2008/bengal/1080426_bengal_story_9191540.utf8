                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Prawn, hilsa on Sonia plate
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          A room at the Khan Chowdhury house, spruced up   for Sonia Gandhi. Picture by Surajit Roy        
	Malda, April 25: A fare befitting the spread of a luxury hotel.         
	Bekti in banana leaves, prawn Malay curry and steamed hilsa in mustard sauce on the main course with Swiss salads and coolers like mango sherbet and fresh fruit juice, keeping in mind the soaring temperature outside.        
	But the hosts are unhappy. The guest might spend only 15 minutes when she visits them on April 28.         
	The only hope for the Khan Chowdhurys  the family of the late MP and Congress leader A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury  is that Sonia Gandhi might have heard that Ruby Noor is a good cook. She is Ghani Khans sister.        
	She will be helped by my wife Rupkhan. The food will be a mix of continental and Bengali cuisine. Our sister is famous for her cooking, said Malda MP Abu Hasem Khan Chowdhury, one of the two brothers of Ghani Khan.         
	Rupkhan Chowdhury, who is of Swiss origin, will be in charge of the salads.         
	Abu Naser Khan Chowdhury, the other sibling who lives in Switzerland, has especially flown down to be present on the occasion.        
	The menu was decided after much thought, said Ruby, the Malda Congress president.        
	According to schedule, Sonia will address a public meeting in Murshidabad at 9.30am and another at Sujapur, 18km from here, at 10.30. After that, she will go to the Khan Chowdhurys on a helicopter that will land on a pad especially built for her.        
	She will walk about 100 metres to the mausoleum built over the mortal remains of the former Congress leader.         
	After lunch, the Congress president will fly back to Delhi following a stopover in Patna.        
	We have been told by Delhi that she will be with us for only 15 minutes, said Abu Hasem.        
	The Khan Chowdhury residence has been preparing for the visit for several days. A new air-conditioner has been installed in the room that has been done up for Sonia.        
	Pictures of the Gandhi family have also been strung up on the walls. Many of them have Ghani Khan in the frame.        
	Members of the Special Protection Group (SPG) today inspected the security aspects at the Kotwali. The SPG has allowed only six persons to be with Sonia during her visit.        
	State Congress president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Pranab Mukherjee and the four of us will be present, said Ruby.        
	Abu Hasem has written to Sonia, asking her to spend a little more time with them.

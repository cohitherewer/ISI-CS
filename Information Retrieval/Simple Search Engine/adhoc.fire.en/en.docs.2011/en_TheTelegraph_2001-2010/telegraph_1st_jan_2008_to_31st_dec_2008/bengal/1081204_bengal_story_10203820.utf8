	Midnapore, Dec. 3: A group of tribals blocked the road to Jhargram from National Highway 6 again this evening.        
	They gheraoed the subdivisional officer when he went to remove the blockade, demanding the release of four tribals detained while trying to block the road this morning.        
	They were released tonight and the officer was freed but the road linking the town with Calcutta remained blocked.         
	The authorities had acted tough yesterday when they removed the blockade after the CPM won the municipal polls.

	Durgapur, Oct. 14: Villagers haunted by memories of a missing boy who was later found dead beat up a deranged elderly woman today accusing her of being a child-lifter.         
	Samontora Bai, 60, might have lost her life if the mob in Asansols Rajpara area had its way. We are sure she is a child lifter. Wed have burnt her alive had police not come, said Mohammad Sajjad. The womans crime: she had spoken to a three-year-old this morning.         
	We have become cautious since the child was found dead in a pond on September 11, said Ramji Yadav, the father of the boy Samantora spoke to.         
	Asansol deputy superintendent U.S. Mukherjee, whose force saved Samantora, said she appeared unstable. Once, she said she was from Bhopal, then from Rajasthan. Whatever that may be, we dont think she is a child lifter.

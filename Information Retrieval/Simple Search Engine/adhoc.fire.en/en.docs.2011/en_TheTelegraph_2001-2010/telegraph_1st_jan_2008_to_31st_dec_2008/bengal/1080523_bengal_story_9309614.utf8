          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee                                  
	Calcutta, May 22: Mamata Banerjee today gave her party the go-ahead to tie up with the Congress to form panchayat samitis and gram panchayats wherever the Trinamul Congress could not do so on its own.        
	We shall not object to local-level understandings for the formation of panchayat samitis and gram panchayats, Mamata said.        
	The Trinamul chief, who was opposed to a pre-poll pact with the Congress, seems to have had a change of heart following the Oppositions improved performance in the rural polls.        
	State Congress president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has reciprocated by saying his partys elected candidates could forge alliances with Trinamul to keep the Left Front at bay.        
	Our strategy is clear. Where Congress candidates are not in a position to form panchayat samitis and gram panchayats, they are free to tie up with Trinamul, Das Munshi said.        
	After winning all three zilla parishad seats in Singur, Mamata today repeated her demand for the return of land forcibly acquired from farmers for the Tata Motors small-car plant.        
	The 400 acres forcibly acquired for the small-car plant will have to be returned to the farmers. I hope good sense will prevail on the government after the poll debacle there, she said.        
	Asked if she would start a fresh agitation in Singur, Mamata evaded a direct answer but said: I have no control on the people there.        
	On industries minister Nirupam Sens assertion that the government would press ahead with industrialisation, Mamata said: The minister should resign.        
	Das Munshi said industry should come up on fallow land alone. The government has repeatedly cited how scarce such land is in south Bengal, which is where most investors want to set up projects because of its proximity to the sea.

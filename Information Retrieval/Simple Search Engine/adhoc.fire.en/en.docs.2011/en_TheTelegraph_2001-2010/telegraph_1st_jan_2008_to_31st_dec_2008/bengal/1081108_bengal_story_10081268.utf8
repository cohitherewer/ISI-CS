	Chandernagore, Nov. 7: A group of youths whose request for loud music and dance was turned down past midnight at a Jagadhatri Puja pandal today hurled bombs at committee members and shot one of them in the chest, police said.        
	According to the police, the youths, who were allegedly drunk, were dancing to Hindi film songs blaring on the loudspeakers at the pandal in Chandernagore town last night. Close to midnight, the organisers switched off the music, to which the youths reportedly objected. They allegedly threatened the organisers with dire consequences if they did not play the music. Residents also told the youths to leave.         
	Around 4.30am, the youths returned and hurled bombs at the members of the committee in the pandal. One of them fired three bullets, of which one hit committee member Pradip Debnath in the chest.         
	The committee has lodged an FIR, but no arrests have been made.

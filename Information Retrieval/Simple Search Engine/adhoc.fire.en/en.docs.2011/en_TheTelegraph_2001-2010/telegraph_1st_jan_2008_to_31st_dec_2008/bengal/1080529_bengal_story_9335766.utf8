	New Delhi, May 28: International NGO Amnesty International has indicted the CPM and its supporters for largescale violence in Nandigram last year.     
	The annual report on human rights worldwide also blamed the Bengal government for failing to peacefully persuade farmers protesting against land acquisition. In January and March (2007), at least 25 people were killed... more than 100 were injured and at least 20 women were sexually assaulted by private militia allied to the ruling CPM, says the report, released in India today. It concedes, however, that CPM supporters had  before the retaliation  been displaced from their land by those opposed to the acquisition.        
	Durgapur: A Madhyamik candidate committed suicide in Bankura on Tuesday night, fearing that she would fail. Chandrima Das, however, scored almost 50 per cent. In Burdwans Andal, Lipi Sow Mondal set herself on fire after failing. Her younger sister, who tried to save her, is in hospital.        
	Howrah: Krishnendu Bag, who got over 60 per cent in Madhyamik, was killed while going to buy sweets for friends. A truck hit his bike in Bagnan, 65km from Calcutta.

	Singur, April 3: Two workers slipped and fell to their death at the Tata Motors factory site in Singur today.        
	Shyamsundar Bhattacharya, 42, and Manik Pal, 24, were welding an iron beam atop the Trim Chassis Front shop around noon, police said. Their safety ropes were attached to another beam.        
	The police said a screw in the beam they were sitting on had come loose. As they fell, the safety rope pulled at the beam it was tied to and the beam collapsed.         
	The roof structure is 50ft high, said Priyabrata Bakshi, the officer-in-charge of Singur police station. He added that the workers, who had serious head injuries and several broken bones, died in hospital.         
	Shyamsundar was a resident of Khardah in North 24-Parganas while Manik was from a Burdwan village.        
	A spokesperson for Sapoorji amp; Pallonji, the projects main contractor, said: The families will be compensated appropriately.        
	The twin tragedies come within a week of another death at the site. A dumper driver was found dead with his head crushed on Friday.

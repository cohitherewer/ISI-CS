          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, July 6: Government employees in the Darjeeling hills have decided to donate a days salary, around Rs 500 each, every month to the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha-led Gorkhaland movement.        
	The decision was taken by two employee associations, which claim around 5,000 members each. These include central and state employees.        
	This is our contribution to the movement. We have decided to collect a days salary and hand it over to (Morcha chief) Bimal Gurung, said Amar Rai, the president of the Hill Employees and Workers Trade Union. The union will create a Gorkhaland relief fund and the employees will be given receipts.         
	We will collect the amount by the 10th of every month and after three months, we will hand over the money to Bimal Gurung. The amount will be around Rs 500 per head, said Rai, whose union is 13 years old. This means a collection of around Rs 25 lakh every month. The decision to create the fund was taken during the unions meeting in Darjeeling yesterday.         
	Representatives of the union from Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Kurseong, Mirik, Takdha, Sukhiapokhri and Bijanbari passed a resolution in this regard.        
	Another union, the Hill Employees Association, has decided to follow suit: it will collect a days salary from every employee under its fold.        
	We also held our meeting in Darjeeling yesterday and decided to collect a days salary. We will hand over the money to the Morcha for its movement, its vice-president, B.P. Chhetri, said. This association, too, claimed that a days salary from each employee would be around Rs 500. Sources said hill teachers were also thinking of donations.         
	The recently formed Janmukti Karmachari Samanwaya Manch  an umbrella body comprising the Union, the Association and the Janmukti Karmachari Sangathan  has decided to support the Morcha. Its plans include indefinite closure of state and central government offices from tomorrow.         
	The Manch will coordinate all programmes involving the hill employees, said Chhetri, who is also the convener of the Manch.

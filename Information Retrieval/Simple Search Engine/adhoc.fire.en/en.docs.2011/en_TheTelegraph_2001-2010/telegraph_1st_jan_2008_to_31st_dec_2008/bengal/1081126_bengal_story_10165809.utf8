The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Husband torture
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Husband torture
                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 25: The high court today rejected the anticipatory bail plea of a woman fearing arrest for her husbands alleged torture and death.        
	Mihir Sarkar of Dhubulia, Nadia, hanged himself in his in-laws house last month.        
	Ananya, 25, who was earlier accused of beating up her mother-in-law, had apparently charged her husband and in-laws with torture when they protested. Mihir was arrested following that complaint, but his wife withdrew the case and went back to her in-laws.         
	When he became a mental wreck, she wanted to have him treated from her parents house, Mihirs brother said.         
	A lawyer described the case as rare because the husband was allegedly driven to death. Mihir had called a friend and revealed how he was being tortured, he added.        
	Manik Das said Mihir had called him the night before he committed suicide.         
	Ananyas lawyer Sekhar Basu said she had nothing to do with the death.

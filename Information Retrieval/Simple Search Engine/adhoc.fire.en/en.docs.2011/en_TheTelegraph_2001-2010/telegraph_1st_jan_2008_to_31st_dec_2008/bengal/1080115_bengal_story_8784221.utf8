	Siliguri, Jan. 14: The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR) does not offer a moving palace but its 125-year-old narrow-gauge train has made it to a list of the Worlds Top 25.
    
	The US-based Society of International Railway Travelers has made the announcement in a special edition of its official newsletter that provides information on rail travel worldwide.
    
	Palace on Wheels and the Deccan Odyssey are the other Indian trains on the list, which has Europes very dignified grande dame, the Venice Simplon-Orient Express, and luxury coaches like the Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express and Pride of Africa. 
    
	The Worlds Top 25 Trains is based on our own experience and that of our writers, editors, members and staff, society president Eleanor Hardy said from Louisville, Kentucky. The trains met stringent standards for service, accommodation, scenery, itinerary, off-train experiences and passenger enjoyment.
    
	DHR director Subroto Nath said: So far, we have mainly had British enthusiasts attracted to the train because of their nostalgia for steam engines. Now we hope to get tourists from all over the world.

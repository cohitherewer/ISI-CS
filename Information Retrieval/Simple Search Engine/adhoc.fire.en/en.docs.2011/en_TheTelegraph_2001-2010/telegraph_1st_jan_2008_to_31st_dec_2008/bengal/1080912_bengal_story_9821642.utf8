The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Basu surgery decision on hold
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Basu surgery decision on hold
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: Doctors have put off till Monday a decision on whether to perform surgery on Jyoti Basu, who has a blood clot in his brain.        
	The clot, liquefying and growing in size, may cause problems for the 94-year-old former chief minister if it is not drained out surgically, doctors said.        
	Basu was admitted to AMRI Hospitals on September 7, two days after hurting himself in a fall at his home. He is stable and the clinical parameters are within normal limits. He is having normal diet, a hospital statement said.        
	This morning, a 10-member medical board decided to continue with the current treatment regime while constantly monitoring Basus condition. Basu, his son and others close to him agreed with the boards decision, an official said.        
	Doctors said the clot had formed about three months ago after a similar fall. The recent injury aggravated the clot, said R.N. Bhattacharya, the hospitals chief neurosurgeon and head of the medical board.        
	The clot, a chronic subdural haematoma, has formed between the brains left hemisphere and the dura mater, the outermost layer of the brains covering membrane that lies just under the skull bone.        
	In the elderly, the brain is shrunken and the clot gets more space to liquefy and grow, Bhattacharya said.        
	CT scan reports show the clot covering almost the entire space between the dura and the brain. Once it grows beyond this, it will press against the brain and could cause headache, vomiting or even unconsciousness.        
	If the clot presses against the left hemisphere, it can affect the movement of the right limbs and cause paralysis, Bhattacharya said. However, now the clot is not creating any problem; so we have decided to keep him under observation for some more time.        
	If things do not improve, the doctors will opt for bar hole surgery. A 2-3cm incision will be made in the skull with a drill, allowing the clot to drain out. If it doesnt, it will be washed out with the help of a fluid. The surgery will be done under local anaesthesia.        
	Among Basus visitors today were chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Left Front chairman Biman Bose and politburo members Brinda Karat and Sitaram Yechury.

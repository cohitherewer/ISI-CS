	Nabadwip (Nadia), Oct. 12: Seventy-five-year-old Shantilata Biswas, who begs on the streets for her meals, donated in January her only possession, a piece of land in Nabadwip town, for a new building of the local primary school.        
	The Nadia Primary School Council took the land but did not do any thing with it.         
	The school at Rajbanshipara  about 100km from Calcutta  for which the three-cottah plot was given has been running from a rented house for 40 years.         
	The building is crumbling and its classrooms have no benches. A few hundred students sit on the floor.         
	Headmistress Debi Kar had approached many in the area for land to build a proper school. But there was no response. Then, in January, Shantilata Devi came forward. We have requested the council to construct the school as soon as possible. But I cant explain the delay, she said.        
	Class II student Subal Rajbanshi said: On rainy days, teachers ask us not to come to school because of leaking roofs.        
	Shantilata decided to donate her land when she heard that the school authorities were thinking of shutting it down because of the condition of the building.         
	A widow at 13, she left behind her 20 acres in Barishal  in erstwhile East Pakistan  in 1947 and crossed over with relatives and other refugees. My husband was a rich farmer, but he died two months after my marriage.        
	In Nadia, she bought the 3-cottah plot, built a thatched house and earned a living as a domestic help.        
	Now I dont have energy to work and so I beg on the streets, she said.        
	Before donating the land, she spoke to an old age home, which agreed to provide her accommodation. But the woman refuses to move from her thatched house before she sees some sign that the construction of the school is about to begin. She would not let others grab her vacant plot.         
	Had she sold the 3 cottahs instead of donating it, Shan- tilata would have made Rs 6 lakh.        
	She had expected work on the school to begin as soon as she gave the land. When nothing happened in six months, she wrote to the council as well as the local school inspector, urging them to begin construction.        
	Sir, I am a poor widow and struggled for many years against various odds. I was born in Bangladesh and came to Nadia after partition leaving acres of land behind. I was pained to see small children sitting on the floor and studying and getting drenched because of the leaking roofs of the school, she wrote to Nadia primary school council chairman Bibhash Biswas.        
	I have made arrangements to shift to an old age home but many months have passed since I donated the land and nothing has happened. Please see to it that my last wish is fulfilled, she added.        
	Biswas said he was ashamed to learn that the application for the new school building was gathering dust in his office for months.         
	I have sought a report from the school inspector. We have allotted Rs 3 lakh and the school will be built soon, Biswas had said in August.        
	Not a brick has been laid on Shantilatas plot yet.        
	Biswas today said the council had to borrow Rs 3 lakh from the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan funds. So it took time. Work will soon begin.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Howrah/Midnapore, Oct. 18: Drivers of private buses in Howrah, South 24-Parganas and the two Midnapores kept vehicles off the roads today to protest a police decision to slap the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against them if their wheels turned killers.        
	Earlier, only a case of negligent driving used to be filed.        
	The strike affected visitors to the city who were found fewer buses at Howrah station.

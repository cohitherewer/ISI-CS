          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Feb. 14: Three schoolboys, pushed into crime by a metal scrap dealer, have been arrested for stealing underground railway signal cables and telephone wires.         
	Ranjit Das, 12, Raghu Mukhi, 12, and Sheikh Sunny, 13, were picked up last evening near Mecheda station. Knives, chisels and hammers were seized from them. Raghu is the son of a railway clerk.        
	Playing Fagin - the character who introduced Oliver Twist to theft in the Charles Dickens novel - to the trio was Kolaghats Jawahar Kumar Pande. He would lure the boys with money, Railway Protection Force officers said.         
	The boys would do their job while pretending to play. Although there would be people around, nobody would suspect the children.        
	Pande, too, has been held. A juvenile court has sent the boys to 14 days custody.

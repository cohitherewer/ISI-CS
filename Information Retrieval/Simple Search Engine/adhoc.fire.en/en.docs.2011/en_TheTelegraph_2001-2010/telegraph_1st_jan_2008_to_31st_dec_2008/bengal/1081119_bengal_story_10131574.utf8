The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Dunlop workers seek govt help
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Dunlop workers seek govt help
          OUR BUREAU                          A worker listens to union leaders outside the Dunlop factory gate on Tuesday. Picture by Ananda Das                                  
	Nov. 18: Workers at Dunlops Sahagunj factory today de- manded government intervention to end the impasse following the managements move to suspend production and the unions opposition to its offer of a monthly grant of Rs 2,000.        
	Nearly 1,000 workers assembled in front of the factory this morning and demonstrated. Some of them asked the government to make sure that the management at least paid the balance when the unit reopened.        
	The company refused comment on the proposal.        
	Sahagunj workers get Rs 4,500 to 5,900 on an average every month.        
	We want the government to intervene immediately and hold a tripartite meeting because the union (Intuc and Citu) leaders have sold out to the management. They had initially agree to the proposal to pay us Rs 2,000 a month, less than half our salary? asked Kanaia Prasad, who works in the tyre-moulding department.         
	Prasad is a member of the Congresss Intuc union, but is a Trinamul Congress sympathiser.        
	Joginder Tiwari, a Citu member, also said the work-ers did not trust their leaders. They have betrayed us. We want the government to step in, Tiwari said.        
	However, labour minister Mrinal Banerjee said the government would not intervene unless the unions or the management approached it formally. At Dunlop, there is neither a lockout nor a closure, which come under industrial disputes. We havent yet received any communication either from the trade unions or the management. If they approach us, we will do everything within our scope.         
	Many of the 1,200 workers at the factory are not buying the argument that the financial downturn had led to the suspension of production.         
	In the three years since the new owner, Pawan K. Ruia, took over, production touched 30 tonnes a day only on two occasions, an insider said. There was never enough raw material. Between April and August this year, the average daily production never went beyond 17.48 tonnes.        
	When Ruia took over the company in end-2005, hope prevailed over apprehensions among workers who had lost faith in previous owner Manu Chhabria.         
	We had made substantial financial sacrifices so that the new management could revive the company. Why should we do it again? asked one.        
	Ruia had yesterday said: There were two options. We could have issued an order for suspension of work and not paid anything. But we decided not to do so and pay this amount (Rs 2,000 a month).        
	The Dunlop plant in Ambattur, Tamil Nadu, is shut for over a year.        
	Citu and Intuc leaders at Sahagunj have fixed a meeting with industries minister Nirupam Sen on Thursday.        
	Leaders of unions said they received a letter from the management yesterday. It says the unions were supposed to sign the agreement with the management (agreeing to the Rs 2,000 a month proposal) on Monday but they did not. It also says if the company takes any step now, it may not be beneficial for the workers, said Citus Dipankar Roy.         
	Both Roy and Intucs Bijon Kanti Sarkar ruled out signing the deal before a meeting with the industries minister.

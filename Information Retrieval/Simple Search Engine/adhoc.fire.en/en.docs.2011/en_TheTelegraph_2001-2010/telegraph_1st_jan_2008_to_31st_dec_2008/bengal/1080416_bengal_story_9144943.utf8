          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, April 15: A primary school headmaster who allegedly forced students to eat rice and salt for a mid-day meal as punishment for naughtiness has been demoted and transferred.        
	Amal Kumar Saha, 50, a resident of Patabuka in Nadias Karimpur area, where the school is also located, has been made teacher in-charge and posted to a school in Tehatta, 40km from his home and close to the Bangladesh border.        
	The Nadia Primary School Council, which ordered Sahas transfer last week, said an inquiry was on and Saha could face more stringent action like suspension or dismissal.        
	We have not only transferred the headmaster but have also demoted him to a teacher-in-charge in a school in Tehatta, said Bibhash Biswas, the council chairman.        
	On March 30, three teachers were absent in Pata- buka Primary School, about 180km from Calcutta. Saha and another teacher were having a tough time managing the 300-odd students.        
	The headmaster, known for his strictness, went to each class and told the students to stay quiet, but as soon as he left one class, the children started shouting.         
	Saha got angry and told the cook not to serve any vegetables or dal for the mid- day meal.         
	The headmaster ordered the cook to serve only rice and salt. He took all the vege-tables, lentil stocks and eggs from the school storeroom to his house so that the cook would not be able to violate his orders, Biswas said. He also instructed the only other teacher pre- sent to ensure that each student ate the tasteless meal.        
	The next day, Saha brought the food items back to school. But parents demanded an explanation from him.         
	He told us he had done the right thing. He also told us that our children deser- ved what they got, said Subol Roy, a farmer whose son Mihir is in Class III. We are not wealthy, but we dont serve salt and rice to our children for lunch.         
	Two days later, the parents lodged a complaint against Saha with the council.        
	Asked about the action taken against him, Saha declined comment. I have done nothing wrong, he said.

	Hind Motor, Jan. 9: Citu has improved its vote share from 42 to almost 50 per cent in the Hindustan Motors union elections, apparently because of its opposition to a strike at the Uttarpara plant and support for industrialisation.
  
	The opposition Sangrami Shramik Karma-chari Union (SSKU) had shut down the Uttarpara factory for a month last year, following which the company declared suspension of work. It got only 38.9 per cent votes, about 23 per cent less than in 2005. Weve fallen short of majority by six votes but the result shows the people are in favour of industry, said a Citu leader.
    
	Behrampore: BSF jawans found an AK-47 rifle, 30 bullets and a wireless set in a bag left behind by a Bangladeshi trying to cross the border at Jalangi, Murshidabad. He fled when chased.

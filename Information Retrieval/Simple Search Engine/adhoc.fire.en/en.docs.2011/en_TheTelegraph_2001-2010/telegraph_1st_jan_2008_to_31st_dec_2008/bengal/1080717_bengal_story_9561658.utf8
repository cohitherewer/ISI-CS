          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, July 16: The state was today promised new power plants of 4,000MW in five years, but not one of the six scheduled to start running by 2007 has started steady commercial generation yet.        
	Power minister Mrinal Banerjee announced the new projects (see box) in the Assembly today, saying tenders for all, but a 250MW unit at Santaldih entrusted to Bhel, would be floated soon.         
	We are going to add nearly 4,000MW. The projects will cost around Rs 25,000 crore, he said, setting 2013 as the date for their completion.        
	Almost 90 per cent of the money will be raised by the utilities  the West Bengal Power Development Corporation and Durgapur Projects Limited (DPL)  while the state will buy 10 per cent equity in the projects.         
	We will tide over the (power) crisis soon, Banerjee said.        
	The delay in bringing on stream the power plants that were to start generation last year has severely hit the state, leading to frequent power cuts with the rise in temperature and demand.        
	Banerjee said of the six units promised by 2007, three would provide 900MW of stable generation to take care of the increased demand after monsoon.        
	Officials said the demand was expected to rise to about 1,470MW in the run-up to the festival season.        
	Two new units at Sagardighi and one at DPL, being set up by Chinas Dong Fang, have been breaking down repeatedly during trial runs.         
	The turbine blade of the 300MW plant at Sagardighi broke and has just been repaired, Banerjee said.         
	At DPL, a new unit broke down five times after it began generation on April 30.         
	It hummed back to life five days ago.         
	The Congresss Manas Bhuniya and Trinamul Congresss Subrata Bakshi criticised the choice of the Chinese firm but the minister said it had quoted the lowest in a global tender.         
	Bhel had quoted lowest for the Santaldih and Bakreswar units and they were given the job there, Banerjee added.         
	Among the new plans, orders for a unit in Katwa will be placed later because the 1,030 acres required havent been acquired, an official said.         
	Some villagers have set up an anti-land acquisition body there.

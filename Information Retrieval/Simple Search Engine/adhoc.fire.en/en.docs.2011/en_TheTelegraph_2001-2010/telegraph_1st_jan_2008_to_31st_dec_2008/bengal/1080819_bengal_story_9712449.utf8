	Cooch Behar, Aug.18: A first-year student of a polytechnic institute died last evening after becoming unconscious in his hostel room.         
	Police have begun a case of unnatural death.        
	A roommate said Sunil Murmu,17, went to bed around 3am on Sunday after watching a cultural show, organised for first-year students of Cooch Behar Polytechnic. When he did not wake up even at 3pm, we thought something is wrong, roommate Santanu Jana said. He was alive then, but seemed unconscious.        
	Senior students took Sunil to a nursing home where doctors declared him dead.         
	Superintendent of police Debendra Prasad Singh said a post-mortem would be carried out tomorrow.

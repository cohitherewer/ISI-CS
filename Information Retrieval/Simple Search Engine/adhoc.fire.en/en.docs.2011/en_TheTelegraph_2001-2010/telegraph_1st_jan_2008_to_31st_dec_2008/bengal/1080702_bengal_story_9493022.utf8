	Tamluk, July 1: At least seven Trinamul panchayat samiti members out of the 23 sworn to office in Nandigram today have arrest warrants against them. But no policeman tried to nab them when they walked into the Nandigram I block office.    
	East Midnapore police chief S.S. Panda said: Peace is returning and this is not the right time to make arrests. If we arrest a large number of people at one go, the law and order situation might deteriorate. There are warrants against 500 Opposition and CPM supporters in connection with the land war.        
	Krishnagar: A man was held in Nadias Dhubulia on Tuesday for allegedly extorting money from truck drivers and traders on NH 34 using a trekker that police had once hired. Amit Goswami and three others, who have fled, had put a police sticker on the vehicle owned by a CPM leader.

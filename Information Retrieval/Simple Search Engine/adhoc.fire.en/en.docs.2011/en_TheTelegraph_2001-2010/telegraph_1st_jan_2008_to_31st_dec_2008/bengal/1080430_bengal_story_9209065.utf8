          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, April 29: A gynaecologist has been sent on a two-month leave after a woman in labour died last evening in the Durgapur subdivisional hospital.        
	The family of 26-year-old Kalpana Sarkar had brought charges of negligence against the doctor and lodged a complaint with hospital superintendent Nemai Chand Debnath.        
	Debnath today served a notice on the doctor asking him to go on leave and ordered a probe.         
	This is the second time such a complaint has been lodged against the doctor. I have forwarded the complaint to the Burdwan chief medical officer, Debnath said.        
	Kalpana, from Kanksa in Burdwan, about 160km from Calcutta, was admitted to the hospital yesterday.         
	She was in pain since yesterday afternoon and died around 7pm, but the doctor under whom she was admitted didnt examine her once, alleged Bacchu Sarkar, her brother-in -law.

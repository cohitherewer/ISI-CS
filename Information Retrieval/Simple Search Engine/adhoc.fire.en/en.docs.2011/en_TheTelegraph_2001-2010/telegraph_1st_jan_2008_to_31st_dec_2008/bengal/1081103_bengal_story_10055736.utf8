The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Enemy of development at work,   says CPM 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Enemy of development at work,   says CPM 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, Nov. 2: The CPM leadership saw in todays blast the hand of anti-development forces targeting the Jindal steel plant in Salboni.        
	Anti-development forces in the state are gearing up for more violence. The same forces, from far Left to far Right, that forced the Tatas to say goodbye to Singur today blasted a device near Salboni. They now want to stop the big steel plant from coming up in Bengal, state CPM secretary Biman Bose said.        
	On whether the intended target was Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Bose said: We are yet to gather full information on the blast. As of now, we know that a blast occurred sometime after the chief ministers convoy had passed.         
	Bose indicated that todays political violence over industrialisation in two places in south Bengal  Singur being the other one  would help the party brand the Opposition an enemy of the state in its campaigns.         
	He asked the party rank and file to hold marches and rallies tomorrow condemning todays violence.         
	State secretariat member Benoy Konar said: Since the Maoists have turned themselves into Trinamul activists, particularly in the western part of the state, we fear more violence before the general election.        
	He added: The Maoist blast today underlines the threat to the Salboni steel project in particular, and industry in the state in general. It shows that the forces of anarchy do not want industrialisation.        
	Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee had, however, said recently that her party had no problem with the plant.        
	We did not oppose the Salboni project since there was consensus (on land acquisition) and the interests of the poor were protected, Mamata said.

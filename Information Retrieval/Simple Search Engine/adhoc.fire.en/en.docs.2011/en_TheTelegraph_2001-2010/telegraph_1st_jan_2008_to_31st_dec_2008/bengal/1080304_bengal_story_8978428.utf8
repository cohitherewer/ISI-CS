     ALAMGIR HOSSAIN
               
	Behrampore, March 3: Two small-time BJP leaders have been stripped of panchayat membership in Murshidabad but do not regret it, realising that politics doesnt ensure a decent livelihood.
    
	Working as a labourer in Mumbai does.
    
	Sunil Mondal, 40, and Mujibar Rahman, 37, earn Rs 900 a week there.
    
	I send over Rs 2,000 every month to my family after keeping enough to buy food. Lodging is free, Mondal said. Im fed up with village politics. Earning decent money for my family is far more important.
    
	Mondal and Rahman were BJP members of the Congress-majority Kalinagar village panchayat at Raninagar, about 50km from district headquarters Behrampore.
    
	Subdivisional officer Mrityunjoy Banerjee, who supervises the day-to-day activities of the panchayat, cancelled their memberships after they skipped three general body meetings in a year.
    
	The West Bengal Panchayat Act, 1973, says village panchayat members will have their membership cancelled if they fail to attend three general body meetings on development projects in a year.
    
	Mondal said: It was a blessing. I was unable to make ends meet.
    
	He has left his wife, two children and ailing mother behind at Chardurgapur village. A neighbour, Amjad Sheikh, had told him that job prospects were better in Mumbai.
    
	Rahman lived in Harudanga, 2km from Mondals village.
    
	The only crops grown in Kalinagar are jute and wheat. The soil is not suitable for paddy cultivation.
    
	Murshidabad has no major industries. There is a power plant in Farakka, 150km from Kalinagar, and another is coming up in Sagardighi, about 80km away. Hundreds of men have left Kalinagar for greener pastures in Mumbai and Bangalore.
    
	Neither Rahman nor Mondal cares about the May panchayat polls. Ive had enough of politics, Rahman said, ruing the lack of employment opportunities in his area.
    
	As panchayat members, we got Rs 25 in travelling allowance for general body meetings. That was all, said the man who has six mouths to feed.

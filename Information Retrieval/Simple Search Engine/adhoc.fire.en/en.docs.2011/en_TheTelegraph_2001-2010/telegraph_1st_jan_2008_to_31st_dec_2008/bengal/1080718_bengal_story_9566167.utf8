          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Beldanga, July 17: An alleged rapist was let off in a Murshidabad shalishi, apparently held at a police station, after his father agreed to pay Rs 30,000.        
	The Congress-led Beldanga panchayat samitis sabhapati, Sukhen Haldar, saha-sabhapati Saharaddin Sheikh and CPM panchayat member from Beldangas Janakinagar, where the victim lives, attended Tuesdays kangaroo court, apparently on the police stations terrace.         
	Saharaddin said officer-in-charge Sandip Sen was present but the OC denied such a meeting.         
	Asraful Haque, 19, has been moving around freely since April 23, when he allegedly raped the 13-year-old, a neighbour, in her house in Janakinagar, about 180km from Calcutta. Her 18-year-old brother and father were away at the time.        
	On July 9, the OC told me to settle the matter. I accepted because two and a half months had passed but the accused was still free, Sanarul Haque, the victims father, said. The small farmer had lodged a complaint the day after the alleged rape but said the police hadnt come to his village for a probe. We moved the chief judicial magistrate in Behrampore. The court ordered an investigation but nothing happened.        
	Saha-sabhapati Saharaddin confirmed he was present at the shalishi, saying Sanarul had asked him to come. We settled the matter as the OC wanted it. Asrafuls father will pay Rs 30,000, Rs 10,000 in 10 days and the rest within a month. The girls family will then withdraw the case, Saharaddin said, adding such meetings at the police station werent uncommon. OC Sen said: We are trying to arrest Asraful but he is absconding. Asrafuls father Afazuddin declined comment, saying the matter had been settled.         
	Murshidabad police chief Basab Dasgupta said a shalishi couldnt settle a rape case. I will ask the OC to arrest the accused. The deputy superintendent, Shanto Mitra, will probe the matter.

	Calcutta, Aug. 28: The CPM appears divided on whether alternative plots should be offered to unwilling farmers in Singur to end the siege.        
	State party secretary Biman Bose didnt rule out the alternative-plot option today, but industries minister Nirupam Sen and veteran Benoy Konar had denied such a possibility.        
	Some see the confusing signals as an attempt to bring back Mamata Banerjee to the negotiation table, without committing the government and the CPM to anything.        
	Bose suggested today that it was up to Mamata to make the proposal. I am not ruling it (alternative plots) out. But let the Trinamul leader join the dialogue and put forward her alternative proposals. She can even discuss her demand on the return of 400 acres.         
	Bose criticised Mamata for continuing with the agitation, saying her siege had choked an important supply route to the state and paralysed traffic.         
	Trinamul leaders are said to have dropped hints that Mamata might settle for 200-250 acres, instead of 400 acres, if the state agreed to relocate some ancillary units and offered alternative plots to the rest of the farmers.         
	Industries minister Sen has discounted the possibility using around 300 acres across the Tata Motors site for relocating the ancillary units or offering alternative plots to the unwilling farmers.

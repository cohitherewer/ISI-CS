                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Patient beaten up over curry
                            
	Behrampore, May 2: A 50- year-old patient was beaten up with a ladle at Behrampore Mental Hospital after she asked for more curry at dinner.        
	The April 18 incident was kept under wraps until the Murshidabad chief medical officer was tipped off. Mango-binda Mondal, who went to the hospital for an inquiry yesterday, said he had seen injury marks on Lakshmi Bhakat.        
	Rina Saha, a Group D employee, told Mondal the patient became furious when she was refused a second helping of the curry and threw a bowl of dal at her. Then Rina beat her up with the ladle. Ive sent a report to my superiors, Mondal said.

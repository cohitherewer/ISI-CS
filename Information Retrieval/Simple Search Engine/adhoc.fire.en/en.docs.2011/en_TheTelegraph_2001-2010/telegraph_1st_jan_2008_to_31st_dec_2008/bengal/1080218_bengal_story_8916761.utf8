                                                                                                               Threat to shut down Darjeeling state banks
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Feb. 17: Subash Ghisinghs rivals in Darjeel- ing will allow nationalised banks to work only twice a week to demand his ouster from the hill council.        
	Banks had been left out of the strike in the last round, but only private banks have been spared this time. Nationalised banks will be allowed to work only on Tuesdays and Fridays, said Bimal Gurung, who broke away from Ghisinghs GNLF last year to form the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha.        
	Well stop the movement of timber to the plains. Well dry up the states revenue from the hills, he added.        
	Post offices, closed for a week, will also be allowed to open only on Tuesdays and Fridays. Well not let any government office work, a Morcha leader said.        
	The Morcha had on Wednesday called off its hunger strike after a meeting at Writers Buildings. Its leaders said the government had agreed to take a decision on their demand by Saturday. But on Friday, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya clarified that there was no way the government could remove Ghisingh before his term as caretaker ended on March 24.         
	The decision to renew the agitation followed the ministers statement.        
	Groups of 11 Morcha supporters in the three hill subdivisions  Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong  resumed the fast this morning.         
	Doctors and paramedics have been warned not to come near those who are on fast, said Gurung.         
	Yesterday, Morcha supporters had laid siege to the municipality to prevent the election of its chairman. But GNLF councillors sneaked into the building the night before and elected Pema Yolmo their leader.

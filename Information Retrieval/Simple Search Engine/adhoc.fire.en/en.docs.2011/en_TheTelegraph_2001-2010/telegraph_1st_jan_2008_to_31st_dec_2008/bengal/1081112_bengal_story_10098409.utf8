          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 11: The industries minister may cross continents to scout for investments in Bengal but his babus wont walk the extra mile  1.86 miles precisely  to reach office.        
	The commerce and industries department employees are sulking because the government has shifted their office from Writers Buildings to 4 Camac Street. The excuse: The Writers is close to Howrah station, about 4km, and also near to Sealdah.         
	Sanket Chowdhury, general secretary of the Federation of Secretariat Employees, said the Writers is a brisk walk from Howrah. From Sealdah, it takes half an hour to reach.         
	Camac Street, about 7km from Howrah and 6km from Sealdah, is a mile too far for the departments 230 employees.         
	Even if we reach Camac Street by public transport, we have to get down at Jeevandeep or at Nizam Palace. Then theres a walk to Camac Street as no public transport is allowed in, Chowdhury said.        
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen was recently in Germany wooing investors.         
	In Calcutta, his babus are wearing black badges. The government order had said the department will start operating from Camac Street on November 10. The attendance register has been taken to Camac Street, so the employees are marking attendance on a piece of paper.         
	Former chief secy dies        
	Rathin Sengupta, a former chief secretary, died today after a heart attack. He was 78.

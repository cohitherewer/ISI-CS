          JAYANTA BASU                              
	Calcutta, April 21: The environment department has directed all hotels, resorts and even tents for tourists within a kilometre of forest areas to take the state pollution control boards permission to continue operations.        
	The directive follows a string of complaints of violation of environment norms against hotels and resorts  both government and private  near forest areas, particularly in north Bengal.         
	The directive will apply to all reserve forests and wildlife sanctuaries, both new and old.         
	Hotels and resorts inside forests will have to get clearance from the forest department before approaching the pollution board.         
	According to the departments notification, circulated to all district magistrates and superintendents of police, the pollution board will consult the tourism department before giving its nod to applications within a month of their submission.         
	The complaints, mostly received from NGOs, include trespassing on corridors for wild animals, irregular dumping of waste and growing traffic.         
	These have been happening everywhere, more so in north Bengal where mushrooming eco-tourism units have been infringing on corridors for wild animals like elephants and bison, said Lt Col S.R. Banerjee, a former member of the state wildlife board.

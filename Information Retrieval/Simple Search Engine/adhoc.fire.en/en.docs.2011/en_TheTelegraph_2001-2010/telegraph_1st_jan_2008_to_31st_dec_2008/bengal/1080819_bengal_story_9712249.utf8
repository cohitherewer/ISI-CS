          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 18: The state government will set up the Fifth Pay Commission for salary revision of its employees, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said today.        
	Like the Union government, we have also decided to set up the states fifth pay panel. The notification for setting up the commission and naming its chairman will be issued in a week. The terms of reference of the new commission will be decided on the basis of which the panel would work. The pay commission will start its work by mid-September, Dasgupta said after meeting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	He said the Centre should bear half the additional expenditure the state would incur because of the pay revision. Last time, the states expenditure increased by 39 per cent. This time, there will be a hike again. The Centre should bear 50 per cent of the increase. I am going to speak to the Centre, Dasgupta said.        
	The fourth pay panels report was implemented on April 1, 1997, two years after it was released.         
	Asked if the state would pay interim allowance to employees pending finalisation and implementation of the report, Dasgupta said: The issue of interim relief can be thought of after the terms of reference of the commission are fixed. Similarly, the question of whether a few more instalments of dearness allowance can be given would be considered later.        
	The panels report would decide the salaries of 4.2 lakh government employees, 4 lakh teachers and 1.8 lakh panchayat and civic staff. The commission will also make recommendations for 4.3 lakh pensioners, Dasgupta said.

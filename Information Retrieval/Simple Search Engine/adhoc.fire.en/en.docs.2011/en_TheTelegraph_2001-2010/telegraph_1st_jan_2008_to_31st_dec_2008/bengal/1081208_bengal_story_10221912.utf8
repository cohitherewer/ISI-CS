	Chakdah (Nadia), Dec. 7: A woman last night jumped to her death in front of a running train with her baby after calling up her husband and giving him the exact location.        
	Police said Kijani Karmakar, 23, had walked out of her home in North 24-Parganas Khardah yesterday afternoon after a tiff with her jeweller husband Sajal. The man allegedly suspected his wife of having an affair.         
	Sajal said he received the call from Kijani some four hours later, around 8pm. From a public booth, she told me she was near Madanpur railway station in Chakdah. Look for my body near the station, my wife told me and hung up, said Sajal.        
	Around 9pm, the blood- splattered bodies of Kijani and 18-month-old Ayush were found near the railway tracks at Madanpur, about 40km from Khardah.

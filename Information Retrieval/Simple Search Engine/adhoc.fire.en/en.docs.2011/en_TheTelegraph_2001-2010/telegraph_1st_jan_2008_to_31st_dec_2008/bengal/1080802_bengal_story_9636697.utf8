          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 1: A schoolgirl and her brother were killed when a Sumo carrying students to a temple to offer prayers for their results crashed into a tree in front of the Calcutta Leather Complex this morning.         
	There were 13 people in the vehicle, 10 of them students of a coaching centre at Malancha in the Minakhan area of North 24-Parganas.         
	They were going to Tarakeswar in Hooghly with their teacher, Shibsankar Das, 37.         
	All the 13 injured were taken to National Medical College and Hospital, where Bulu Mondal, 16, a Class XII student, and Biplab Mondal, 26, were declared dead. The condition of seven students was said to be critical.        
	Additional superintendent of police (rural) Mitesh Jain said a case had been started against driver Manas Mondal, 45. He is also in the hospital.        
	We started early from our homes so that we could reach Tarakeswar in time to offer puja, said Pinki Patra, 16.         
	Her sister Rumpa, 15, said from the hospital bed: We were going to offer the puja as we had all fared well in our final exams. We also wanted to pray for good results in the future.        
	No one could say why the Sumo hit the tree at Bantala, 25km from Calcutta.        
	Local resident Bipul Das said he saw the Sumo hitting the tree at a great speed and overturning.         
	Pinki experienced a severe jolt. After that I cannot remember anything. When I opened my eyes, I found myself in the hospital.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 22: Asked to spend a night in a hotel room with her estranged husband before taking a final decision on divorce, a woman chose his home, instead.        
	Sandip Chakraborty will have to bring home good food for Mousumi and the couple should enjoy the night before heading back to Calcutta High Court tomorrow, a division bench headed by Justice Asim Banerjee said today.        
	It is not known whether one night together will take the two away from a divorce but the choice meant the 25-year-old lady headed back to the very Chinsurah home from where she had walked out on Sandip eight months ago.         
	The 32-year-old businessman will have his plate full tonight.         
	Give her a warm reception. Bring good food and enjoy the night. Then come to us tomorrow, the bench said.        
	Mousumi had been staying with her parents at Salanpur in Asansol since she left Chinsurah following a spat over returning to her in-laws after the birth of their daughter Monalisa, now six months old.        
	Last week, Justice Banerjee had asked the couple to spend the night before the hearing in a hotel in Calcutta to know each other better.         
	In June, Mousumi had petitioned the high court, asking for a Chinsurah-to-Asansol shift of the case filed by Sandip seeking restoration of his married life.        
	Thirty couples have been sent to neutral places so far and it has worked wonders. Except one, all have patched up, advocate Jayanta N. Chatterjee said last week.         
	The judges hope Mousumi and Sandip will again hit it off together.

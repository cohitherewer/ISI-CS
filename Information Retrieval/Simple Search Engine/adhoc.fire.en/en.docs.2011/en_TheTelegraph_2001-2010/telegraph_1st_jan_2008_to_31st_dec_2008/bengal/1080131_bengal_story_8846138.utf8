	New Delhi/Calcutta, Jan. 30: Tests today revealed bird flu in previously unaffected blocks of Birbhum, Murshidabad and Hooghly, but animal husbandry officials said 80 per cent of poultry culling targets had been achieved. 
    
	A report from the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, Bhopal, said samples from Suri I in Birbhum, Raghunathganj II in Murshidabad and Chanditala II in Hooghly had tested positive for avian influenza. 
    
	Animal husbandry joint secretary Arvind Kaushal said the number of birds culled in the 13 affected districts of Bengal had crossed 23 lakh, only 500,000 short of the states assessment that 28 lakh needed to be culled. 
    
	We expect culling to be completed in two or three days, he added. The teams will then concentrate on mop-up  forcible culling without compensation  and disinfection.
    
	There is no suspected case of human avian influenza so far, said Shiv Lal, the director of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Delhi, which has sent teams to screen people in the affected areas. 
    
	Health surveillance of people within 10km of bird flu epicentres in 2,700 villages is likely to continue for several days. 
    
	Among 1.6 million people surveyed, health teams have detected 3,700 people with signs of upper respiratory infection such as cold, cough and fever. Only 28 have had a history of exposure to poultry. 
    
	Lal said not one of these people had avian influenza symptoms such as lung infection, breathlessness or lung patches visible on X-ray. 
    
	Chicken deaths were today reported from Maheshtala in South 24-Parganas, 18km from Calcutta. All 250 chickens in a private farm died today. Samples have been sent to the Bhopal lab for tests.
    
	The flu has been confirmed in nearby Budge Budge.
    
	The Bengal government today decided to allow 57 more farms to sell poultry. It had issued a list of 14 earlier. 
    
	Some of the farms left out earlier had written to us. We checked if they met our hygiene and health criteria before giving the clearance, animal resource secretary Dilip Chakraborty said. 
    
	Delhi mulls damages
    
	A PTI report said the Centre was considering a package to compensate poultry farmers. 
    
	The agriculture minister has promised a better package than what was offered in Maharashtra in 2006, said Shashi Kapoor of the Poultry Federation of India.
    
	The package is expected to be announced in eight-10 days.
    
	At a meeting with the ministry, industry representatives demanded income-tax waiver and interest cuts on loans.

	Tamluk (East Midnapore), Dec. 26: A teenager and her father were stabbed today by her former private tutor, whose marriage proposal she had allegedly rejected.        
	Local people overpowered Purna Chandra Maity, 22, when he was still stabbing the two repeatedly with a dagger this morning.        
	Police said Mousumi Bera, 16, and Durgapada, 45, had received serious injuries on their head, throat and hands. At the district hospital in Tamluk, their condition was said to be critical.        
	Mousumi, who will sit for her Madhyamik examination in 2009, was going to another tutor with her father when attacked at Bhagabankhali village in Chandipur, about 120km from Calcutta.         
	A Chandipur police officer said the girl had discontinued classes with Maity in 2006 after he professed his love for her and proposed marriage.        
	The mob handed Maity over to the police after a thrashing.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 16: A two-year-old boy was held at gunpoint as a gang of five looted a flat in a new apartment building in Barasat tonight.        
	Ratan Debnath, who works with an insurance company and had bought the flat recently, had just returned home from work around 7.45 when the doorbell rang. He opened the door and five men armed with country-made revolvers barged in.         
	One of them went straight for little Raj and put the gun to his head.        
	Ratan said he handed over the almirah keys to the goons without a second thought.         
	They allegedly took away Rs 6,000, jewellery and a digital camera.        
	The robbers had threatened to kill all three  Ratan, his wife Kakoli and Raj  if he tried to act smart and raise the alarm or step out of the apartment immediately after they had left.        
	The couple cried for help a while after the goons fled.        
	Police reached Indraprastha Building at 8.30pm.         
	The Debnaths live on the top floor of the five-storey building.         
	Only two or three famil-ies have moved in and security was lax, said an officer.        
	The robbers finished their job in 15 minutes, he added.        
	The residents locked up the first police team that arrived, alleging that they had responded late.         
	Subdivisional police officer Joy Biswas went to the spot around 9.30pm to pacify the residents.         
	The policemen were freed after Biswas promised to arrest the culprits in three days.

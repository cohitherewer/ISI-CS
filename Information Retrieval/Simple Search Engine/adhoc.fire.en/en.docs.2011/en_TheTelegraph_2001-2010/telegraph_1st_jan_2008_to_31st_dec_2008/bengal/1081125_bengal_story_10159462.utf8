The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tribals plan to starve cops
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tribals plan to starve cops
          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Lalgarh, Nov. 24: Tribal leaders here today said they would start campaigning among villagers tomorrow requesting them to enforce the social boycott of the administration.         
	The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities will go shop to shop and ask owners not to sell essentials to policemen camping in the area.        
	There are about a hundred of them in Lalgarh who depend entirely on local stores for their ration. If the supply is choked, survival on the Maoist-infested terrain could be tough. Our camp is now isolated from the rest of the district. Roads on both sides are blocked. We buy vegetables and other foodstuff from the bazaar. If local traders stop selling provisions to us and the protesters dont allow us to move, we will starve, said an officer at the Ramgarh police camp.        
	The protesters have vowed not to allow any government vehicle or public transport to enter Lalgarh after the government ruled out holding peace talks in Maoist hotbeds Kantapahari and Ramgarh.        
	The tribals are protesting alleged police atrocities after Maoists triggered a landmine explosion targeting the chief minister on November 2.        
	Our campaign will continue for the next two days and we will strictly enforce the boycott from Thursday, said tribal leader Chhatradhar Mahato. We are also boycotting the civil administration but it does not have much of a presence here. Our target is the police.        
	The boycott will be gradually spread to other parts of the district like Belpahari, Jamboni and Binpur, he added.        
	A senior West Midnapore police officer said informal talks were on and the administration was hopeful that the boycott would be put off.         
	An official meeting, the tribals said, can only be held at Dalilpur and after the district police chief apologises.

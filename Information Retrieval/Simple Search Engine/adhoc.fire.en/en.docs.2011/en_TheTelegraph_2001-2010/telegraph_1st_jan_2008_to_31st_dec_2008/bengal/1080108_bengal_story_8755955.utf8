     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 7: Three city policemen, including the officer in charge of Tollygunge, have been asked to explain why action should not be initiated against them for negligence that led to the theft of the revolver with which Saswati Pal was killed.
    
	Theyve been asked to reply to the showcause notice within three days, special additional commissioner Kuldip Singh said.
    
	Detective department assistant commissioner Kamakshya Bhattacharya today submitted his report after a probe into how Amaresh Kundu, a cook at the Tollygunge police station mess, got access to the revolver.
    
	Sunil Majhi, the constable whose revolver was stolen from an unlocked box, has been suspended.
    
	Officer-in-charge Shanti Roy, sergeant Gautam Roy and constable Abdul Majid Byapari are under the scanner for their alleged negligence. 
    
	The OC cannot skip responsibility. The incident shows lack of discipline at the police station. We have enough reasons to believe that not depositing the service revolver after duty hours had become the practice, Singh said.
    
	The sergeant was supposed to monitor the movement of outsiders in the police station. Byapari had issued the revolver to Majhi. He should have noticed that it had not been deposited even after Majhi completed his duty, Singh said.
    
	Singh said a full-fledged investigation would be ordered if the trios answers were not satisfactory.

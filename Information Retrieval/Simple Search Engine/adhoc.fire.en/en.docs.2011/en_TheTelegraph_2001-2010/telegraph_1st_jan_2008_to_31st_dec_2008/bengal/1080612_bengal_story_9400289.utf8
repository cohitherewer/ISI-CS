          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 11: The government today announced a slew of austerity measures to make up for the revenue loss because of last weeks sales tax cuts on fuel.        
	All but two of the measures had also been announced in 2000 and 2002 when the state was facing a financial crisis.         
	The new ones announced by finance minister Asim Dasgupta were the bar on furnishing offices and deployment of police and home-guards at officers homes.        
	A day after the oil prices were hiked, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had asked all central ministers and departments to cut down expenditure.        
	Dasgupta said the state drive will help the government save Rs 500 crore. In the wake of the recent price hike the state government has cut sales tax to give relief to the common people and this will result in a substantial loss of revenue. So it is important we cut down our expenditure, he added.        
	The measures recommended are:        
	 Restriction on fuel consumption: 8 litres a day for emergency vehicles like police jeeps and ambulance; 5l a day for officials        
	 Bar on hiring cars without finance department approval; restriction on use of vehicles on holidays        
	 Chief secretarys permission must for trips        
	 Expenses on conferences, seminars and workshops to be cut        
	 Bar on furnishing offices        
	 Home-guards or police personnel not to be posted in officers homes without chief secretarys approval        
	 No vehicles to be purchased        
	 Re-employment to be restricted        
	 Restriction on purchase of equipment or machine in February or March of any year         
	All these measures will come into effect from today, Dasgupta said at Writers Buildings.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Payne: Happy?                                  
	Durgapur, Nov. 25: The US consul-general in Calcutta was taken around an industry cluster here today to convince her that not all investors in Bengal faced the same fate as the Tatas.         
	Industries department officials said Beth A. Payne had expressed her anguish after violent protests forced Tata Motors to pull out from Singur.        
	She (Payne) had wanted to know if American investors could face the same fate here as the Tatas and we had assured her that there were areas like Durgapur where industries had come up and were operating peacefully, said an official.        
	After touring an industrial complex and a software technology park in Durgapur on an invitation from the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation and the urban development depart- ment, Payne said she would tell Americans that the area had potential. I will describe to prospective US investors the good industrial atmosphere in Durgapur and the potential it holds for them, she said.         
	There is lot of scope to work here. I am happy to see how IT firms are doing good outsourcing jobs for US and other international companies.

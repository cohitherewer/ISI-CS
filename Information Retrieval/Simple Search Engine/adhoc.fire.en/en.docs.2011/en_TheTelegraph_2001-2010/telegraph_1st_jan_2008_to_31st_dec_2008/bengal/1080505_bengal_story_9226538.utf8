                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   On rally day, walk and see Darjeeling
  - Taxis on morcha duty on May 7          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          NO TAXI? TAKE THE TOY TRAIN                                        
	Darjeeling, May 4: The All Transport Joint Action Committee has advised tourists to reschedule their itinerary on May 7 when most hired vehicles in Darjeeling will be busy ferrying Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters to Siliguri for a rally.        
	The committee, which has 48 taxi syndicates under its fold, is a Morcha affiliate.         
	The advisory is being issued so that tourists do not feel harassed. All our vehicles will be going down to Siliguri for the rally. However, there will be no general strike. Taxis bringing in tourists from the plains or anywhere else will be allowed free passage, said Sabu Rai, vice-president of the committee.         
	Rai, however, suggested an alternative for the tourists. There are a number of places that are within walking distance. The day will not go waste, he said.         
	Rai also listed the spots  the Darjeeling Himalayan Institute, the zoo, Nightingale Park, Lloyd Botanic Garden, Happy Valley tea garden, Japanese Peace Pagoda and the Tibetan Refugee Centre  tourists can trek to.         
	If their feet are too tired, they can hop onto a toy train, which will take them to Ghoom and back.         
	The places tourists will have to give a miss to include Tiger Hill, Rock Garden, Tenzing Rock and the monasteries in Dali. They also cannot go to Mirik and Sukhipokhri, 35km and 18km from here.        
	The tourists will only need to adjust their travel plans. Instead of going to Mirik on May 7, for example, they can list it for the next day, Rai said.        
	Those planning to leave Darjeeling on the day of the rally must bank on taxis that come from Siliguri and other places.

	Behrampore, April 30: Suspected Maoists shot dead an RSP leader in his house in a Murshidabad village last night.         
	Serful Sheikh, 35, a party branch committee member in Naoda, was shot twice in the chest and once in the face, only about 50m from a police picket.        
	The district police chief said the family had named two Maoists  Raqib Mollah and his uncle Tauhib  in the FIR. Raqib had been arrested last year following Serfuls tip.        
	Around 11.30pm, we had gone to bed. Serful had just returned from a panchayat campaign meeting. Suddenly, eight men barged into our house and shot him. Then they ran away firing wildly, said Serfuls uncle Najaddin.

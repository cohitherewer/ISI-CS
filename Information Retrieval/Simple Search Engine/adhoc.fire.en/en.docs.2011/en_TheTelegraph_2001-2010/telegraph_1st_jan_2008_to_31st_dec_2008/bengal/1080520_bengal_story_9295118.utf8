	Basanti, May 19: Personal tragedies were pushed to the back seat for the sake of the party  democracy, to be politically correct  in Basanti today.         
	Six RSP supporters were killed here in violence related to Wednesdays polling.         
	But except the kin of Gouri Naskar, relatives of all the other victims were at the booths, distributing voter slips or voting during the repolling in pockets of Basanti, about 90km from Calcutta.        
	Seventeen-year-old Amit Haldar, whose father had been shot dead while returning home after casting his vote, sat on a charpoy in the CPM-dominated Taldaha village through the day and distributed voter slips.         
	Asked how it felt participating in the polls despite the tragedy, Amit said: My fathers shradh would be held a few days later. But I cannot shirk my responsibilities. I believe in the democratic process and need to get over my grief to perform my duties.        
	Even with his left shoulder plastered after being shot on May 14, Subal Haldar, 52, made a tour of the polling booths. Let the CPM goons fire at me again. I cant let go of an opp- ortunity to exercise my constitutional right, he said.         
	Amits mother Anjali was not to be left behind. The widow broke down when fellow residents referred to Wednesdays bloodshed. But vote she did. I have lost my husband and do not know how our family will cope with the loss. But we cannot be scared away from the polling booth, said Anjali.        
	Lakshmi Haldar, 45, stood in a winding queue braving the scorching sun at Taldaha and voted to defeat fear and the loss of her son Madhusu- dan, 24, five days ago. My son may have died but I am steadfast in my commitment to peaceful polls. I came today to show the world that my vote matters, said Lakshmi.        
	Early this morning, RSP activist Taufiq Mollah died at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, raising the Basanti toll to six. One of the six was a CPM supporter.        
	Irrigation minister Subhas Naskar, whose relative Gouri was among the victims, land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah and Sunderbans affairs minister Kanti Ganguly camped here today to monitor the polling. RSP leader Naskar and his two CPM colleagues held a news conference in the evening to say that the allies had not shed each others blood on this occasion.

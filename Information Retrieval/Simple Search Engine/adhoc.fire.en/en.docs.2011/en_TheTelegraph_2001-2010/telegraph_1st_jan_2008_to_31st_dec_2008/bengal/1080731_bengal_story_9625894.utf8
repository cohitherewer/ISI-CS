                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Three-day HPL strike 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, July 30: The CPMs labour arm today called a three-day strike at Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd from August 18.        
	Citu had called a days strike at HPL on April 8, demanding permanent employment for 183 contract workers. It was put off after senior CPM leaders intervened to prevent the state governments industry jewel from being dragged into the bandh culture.        
	We waited for nearly four months but our demands were not met. We are being compelled to go on a strike, said Ashok Patnaik, the vice-chairman of the HPL Employees Union.        
	State Citu president Shyamal Chakraborty defended the strike call, saying the employees had long-standing demands. They have every right to resort to a strike.        
	A senior HPL official said: We have requested the Citu leaders at HPL not to resort to the strike as it will cripple the plant. The management has told the union it would not be possible to absorb all 183 contract workers at one go.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 10: Three persons were arrested today from Jharkhali in the Sunderbans for their alleged involvement in the death of a tiger.        
	A forest official said a police team from Gosaba raided Jharkhali, about 260km from Calcutta, and arrested Amulya Samaddar, Babu Mondal and Nishi Haldar  all in their thirties.         
	The arrested persons were handed over to the CID, which is probing the case.         
	The three were involved in an earlier case of deer poaching. In the tiger death case, they are either directly involved or are part of a gang, said Neeraj Singhal, the director of the Sunderbans tiger reserve.        
	In the deer poaching case, the trio got bail as more investigation needed to be done, said South 24-Parganas superintendent of police Ajey Ranade.        
	The decomposed carcass of the adult male tiger was found floating in the Bidya river on Monday.        
	The carcass was taken to the Alipore zoo for post-mortem.        
	It had two bullet marks, but no bullet was found in the animals body as these had pierced the back of its head.         
	After the post-mortem, the body was taken back to the Sunderbans.         
	Instead of burying it, the carcass was preserved in the Dobanki forest office, in case it is needed during further investigation.         
	Going by normal practice, we would have buried the tiger but as some questions have come up we have preserved it, a forest official said.         
	He added that as no bullet was found, it was difficult to ascertain what sort of gun was used to kill the tiger.        
	The post-mortem confirmed gunshot injury by a country-made weapon.        
	 It is also not clear whether the tiger was killed for poaching or in self-defence by the alleged deer poachers. If tiger poachers kill the animal, they never leave it behind because every part of the animal is valuable.        
	Singhal had earlier said: We suspect that deer hunters might have shot the tiger in self-defence. Had the animal been killed by tiger poachers, they would have taken away the carcass. But all its parts, including the skin and claws, were intact.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Sept. 12: Trinamul Congress supporters today barged into an all-party meeting on land acquisition for a power plant in Katwa and demanded the project be shelved.        
	The group led by the partys Burdwan chief, Azizul Mondal, submitted a memorandum to district magistrate Manish Jain saying the farmers would not give up their land and walked out in spite of requests to attend the meeting.         
	We are not against the plant but acquisition of multi-crop land. We are behind the farmers, said Mondal.         
	When he was requested to take part in the meeting, being held in the Katwa subdivisional office, Mondal insisted he only wanted to submit a memorandum, which Jain accepted.        
	The CPM, CPI, RSP, Forward Bloc, Congress and the BJP attended the meeting at which Jain set up a committee comprising two members from each party to convince landowners to accept the governments compensation. The package offers Rs 5 lakh to 11 lakh an acre, depending on the plots proximity to the main road.        
	The 1,320-MW plant will require 1,033 acres. Of this, 350 acres are to be taken over in the first phase.         
	I have requested Trinamul to co-operate for the sake of development, Jain said.         
	The Krishi Jomi Krishak Khetmajur Raksha Committee, which is spearheading the protests, had earlier this week warned of a backlash like Singur and Nandigram if the government acquired land forcibly.         
	Biswanath Saha, a leader of the Congress, the main Opposition in Katwa, said: The ad- ministration should hold meetings with the representatives of the unwilling farmers. It wont be easy to convince them.        
	The CPMs Katwa zonal committee secretary, Anjan Chatterjee, accused Trinamul of fomenting trouble. They are blocking development work across the state. They are instigating the farmers in Katwa.         
	The Krishi Jomi committee has decided to submit a memorandum to the administration demanding the acquisition plans be put off.         
	The district authorities have held two public hearings to acquire land for the first phase. Of the 250 farmers called, 205 refused to give their land.

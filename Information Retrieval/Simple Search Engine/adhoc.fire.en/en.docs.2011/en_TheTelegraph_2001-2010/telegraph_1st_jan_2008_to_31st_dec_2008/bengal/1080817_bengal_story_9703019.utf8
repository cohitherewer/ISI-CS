          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Aug. 16: Around 1,000 students and their parents today kept teachers of a Bankura school confined in the staff room for bunking off the Independence Day flag hoisting.        
	All 14 teachers, including teacher in-charge Pranab Roy, were kept locked for over three hours in Bhului Sashi Roy Vidyapith till they apologised in writing. It was a grave fault on our part not to hoist the Tricolour on Independence Day, Roy said.        
	The students were told on Thursday that the school would observe Independence Day like previous years. But when they assembled around 10am yesterday, the school was closed. No teacher was around.         
	Some students then went to Bengali teacher Badal Chandra Gorai s house and forced him to come to school and hoist the flag.         
	The district inspector of schools (secondary), Purnendu Jana, said I will seek explanation from them (the teachers), as flag hoisting is compulsory in schools.

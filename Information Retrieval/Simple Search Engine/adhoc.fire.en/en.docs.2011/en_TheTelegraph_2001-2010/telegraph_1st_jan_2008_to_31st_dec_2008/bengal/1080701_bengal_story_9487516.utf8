	Calcutta, June 30: The government plans to table the long-awaited rehabilitation and resettlement policy for landlosers in the monsoon session of the Assembly.         
	I hope to place it in the Assembly as soon as possible, the chief minister told the Indian Chamber of Commerce annual general meeting today.        
	The bill, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said, will be a comprehensive document addressing all aspects of rehabilitation and resettlement. We faced so much resistance in land acquisition. People are worried about land. We must formulate a very clear land acquisition and rehabilitation policy as we have to protect the evicted people, he added.        
	While batting for industrialisation and globalisation at the meeting, the chief minister did not disclose the details of the new policy, but insiders said a land-for-land model could be its cornerstone.         
	Officials had earlier said the state was considering giving a small part of the land acquired back to landlosers.        
	Land prices go up manifold after industries come up and those who had given their land for them often feel cheated. As a result, there is a tendency not to sell land for industry.        
	The idea (of the land-for-land policy) is to ensure landlosers can cash in on the value of the land after industries come up and infrastructure in the area is developed, an official explained.        
	Nobel laureate Amartya Sen had first spoken about making the prospective value of land part of the compensation in an interview with The Telegraph last year.        
	The government is also toying with the idea of paying a monthly compensation to the elderly.        
	We are providing train-ing to the young so that they get jobs. In some cases, we may build shops for them. But there are many elderly people who cant do all that. We can give some money to them ev- ery month, the official said.        
	The new proposals will form a broad framework of guidelines for industry. The government is now conducting a socio-economic survey in places where large tracts are to be acquired.        
	Bengal had earlier said there could not be one-size-fits-all policy for all projects.         
	The CPM and the government are yet to sort out their differences on whether the st-ate should acquire land first and then rehabilitate landlosers or do it the other way.         
	The industries department fears rehabilitation first would delay industrialisation, but the land department thinks otherwise.        
	There is, however, a common aversion to the idea of offering equity to landlosers.        
	There is consensus on offering a 60 per cent solatium over the land price but not on whether recorded sharecroppers should get 50 per cent of the value of a plot, instead of the 25 per cent given in Singur.

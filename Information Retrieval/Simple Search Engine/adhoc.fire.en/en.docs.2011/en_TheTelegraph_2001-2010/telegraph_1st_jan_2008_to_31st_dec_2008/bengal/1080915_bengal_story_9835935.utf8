                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mamata missing at Singur meet
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 14: The Save Farmland Committee met at Trinamul Congress Bhavan this afternoon to discuss Tuesdays march to Singur, but Mamata Banerjee wasnt around.        
	That she was at her Kalighat home all along but did not come to the party headquarters on EM Bypass left some of the committee members surprised.         
	Sources said she had informed the committee she would not attend the meeting.        
	The meeting decided that street-corner gatherings would be organised in and around the city tomorrow to seek public support for Tuesdays Singur chalo (March to Singur) programme.         
	We shall tell people about the importance of Tuesdays rally. People should know how the CPM has violated the agreement which was signed in front of the governor last Sunday night (September 7) to resolve the standoff over the small-car plant, said Pradip Banerjee, a committee convener and Naxalite leader who chaired the meeting in Mamatas absence.         
	The breach of agreement also amounts to disrespect of the constitutional head of our state, Banerjee said.         
	Trinamul leader Subrata Bakshi said: We are waiting for the governors return (from Delhi). We shall complain to him about the CPMs move to put ads in newspapers announcing the rehabilitation package for farmers in violation of the agreement, he said.

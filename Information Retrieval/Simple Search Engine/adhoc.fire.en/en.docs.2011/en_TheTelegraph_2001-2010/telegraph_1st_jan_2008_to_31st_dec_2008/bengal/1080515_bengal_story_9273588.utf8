	The family lived in Jaidebpur Basti, 85km from Uttar Mendabari, where the crash took place. The area is about 30km from Alipurduar town.        
	Fire brigade and police personnel from Hasimara and Kalchini reached the spot within 20 minutes and brought out six bodies.         
	By that time, the bus passengers had been brought out through windows and windscreens, which were smashed.         
	The fire was brought under control in 40 minutes.         
	Sabyasachi Raman Misra, the Alipurduar additional superintendent of police, said: The bus passengers left after that. We have no clue where they went.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Nayachar hope on Paswan lips
                                                                                                               Nayachar hope on Paswan lips
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Burnpur, March 18: The Centre could give its consent to the proposed Nayachar chemical hub in two to three months.         
	Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan said an expert panel was examining the proposal sent by Bengal.         
	Bengals 162sqkm Nayachar-Haldia project falls short of the proposed central stipulation of 250sqkm to be called a petroleum chemical and petrochemical investment region, but the minister said that should not pose a hurdle.         
	The chief minister is worried. He has spoken to me a few times. I have assured him that the Centre would clear the project, Paswan said.        
	Paswan was here to lay the foundation stone for a road bridge over the Damodar. It will connect Burnpur in Burdwan with Madhukonda in Purulia.         
	The Rs 50-crore bridge is being funded by Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) under its corporate social responsibility programme.         
	The 720m bridge will ensure better connectivity between the entire area under the Asansol Durgapur Development Authority, where the IISCO Steel Plant (ISP) is located, and Ranchi, the capital of neighbouring Jharkhand.         
	The ISP, which was merged with SAIL two years ago, is being modernised and expanded. Addressing the gathering, Paswan said the ISP would keep to its revamp deadline of 2010.         
	He also requested the Bengal government to extend the sales tax waiver to the ISP beyond March 31.         
	The recently revived Kulti Steel Works  about 35km away  is likely to start production by this August.

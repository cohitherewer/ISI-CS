          SUBHASH CHANDRA BOSE                          Nilu Subba                                   
	Jaigaon, June 1: Nilu Subba has got 88.75 per cent in Madhyamik, but has none to finance her further studies.        
	Nilus father died when she was in Class IV, forcing her mother to leave for Bhadrapur in Nepal to stay with relatives.        
	But Nilu and her sister Namrata came to their aunts house in Hamiltonganj.         
	Their aunt, an anganwadi worker, cannot finance Nilus studies further.        
	The head of Latabari Higher Secondary School, Dwarika Sharma, said: She has done Kalchini proud. I will see what I can do for her.         
	The 16-year-old said she wanted to study science in higher secondary.         
	My sister is in Class IX. She, too, doesnt know how far she will be able to continue, Nilu said.        
	Jitendra Sha, who studied in Nilus school, secured 77 per cent in higher secondary.         
	The 19-year-olds father, a cartpuller, earns Rs 50-100 a day and has a six-member family to support.         
	How can I encourage my son to go for higher education? Badri Sha asked.        
	I dont know how I will do it but I want to graduate from Alipurduar College and find a job to end my fathers toils, Jitendra said.        
	The closed Dooars tea gardens that have many sad stories to tell do not know if they should celebrate their childrens success.        
	In the neighbouring Madarihat block, Radhakrishna has secured 75.4 per cent in the Class XII board examination.         
	His father Rajnarayan was a chowkidar at the Mujnai tea garden that has been closed since November 2007.         
	Everyday, Radhakrishna cycled 12km to Birpara Mahavir Hindi High School. The most difficult time was during rain, when I had to battle the currents of the Mujnai, Radhakrishna said.         
	As the garden is closed, Radhakrishna had to do without electricity while studying.         
	Milan Chhetri, whose father worked in the Ramjhora tea garden, has scored 78.8 per cent in Madhyamik. This could also be the end of the road for his academic life.

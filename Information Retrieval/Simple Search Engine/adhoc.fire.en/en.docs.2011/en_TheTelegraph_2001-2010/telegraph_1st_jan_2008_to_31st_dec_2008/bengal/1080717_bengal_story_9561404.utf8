          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, July 16: Several Left Front MPs and MLAs are apprehending an erosion in minority votes if the rainbow coalition votes with the BJP on the trust motion the Manmohan Singh government is going to face in Parliament.        
	After the panchayat poll setbacks and the loss of municipalities in minority-dominated areas, a joint vote with the BJP could kick up questions that may impact both Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. Muslim voters might react as it was the BJP that pulled down Babri Masjid, said Hannan Mollah, an MP and party central committee member.        
	He added, though, that we have got to toe the party line and do a lot of homework (before the general elections due next year) to prevent the possible damage.        
	According to the CPM leader, the issue might crop up at weekly state secretariat meeting on Friday.         
	Lets see what strategy can be worked out to convince the Muslim electorate that we are not working in tandem with the BJP, he said.        
	The CPM lost the East Midnapore and South 24-Parganas zilla parishads, districts which have a sizeable minority population, in the May panchayat polls.         
	In June, the Trinamul Congress wrested from the CPM the Habra, Diamond Harbour and Guskara municipalities, which also have a high minority concentration.         
	CPM MP Mohammad Salim did not deny the possibility of the minorities developing the perception that the Left was hand in glove with the BJP to topple the UPA government. The Opposition in Bengal will try to whip up communal passions during elections by pointing it out to the minorities that the Left had joined forces with the saffron outfit to oust a secular party like the Congress, he said.        
	Like Mollah, Salim said the focus was now on damage control.         
	The minority population and the general electorate will have to be told during the parliamentary polls that efforts are being made to tarnish the Lefts image by making it a BJP accomplice.        
	According to Salim, it is the issue and not ideology that would force the Left to vote alongside the BJP. If I have decided to take a flight to Delhi, do I enquire about my co-passengers? We are against the government and so is the BJP. But that does not unite us, though the minority perception may harm us in elections.        
	Forward Bloc MLA Mehboob Mondal has already started facing questions in his constituency.        
	Its becoming difficult to explain that we are not with the BJP. Its clear that Muslims are not happy with us and their feelings may well reflect on the Lok Sabha results, Mondal said.        
	According to state governments chief whip, Syed Mohammad Masih, the going could be tough in the polls. Misconceptions about our stand will have to be cleared soon. Otherwise, there will be a loss of minority votes.        
	Minority affairs minister Abdus Sattar, who didnt want to be dragged into such a discussion, also admitted a likely dent in Muslim support.         
	Like Salim, he blamed the Opposition for the dent. They will spread the canard among the minority community during elections that we have become close to the BJP.         
	Almost reconciled to the likely losses, minister Anisur Rahman and Bengal Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim spoke more of remedial action.

	Balurghat: Over 1,000 chicks bought from the flu-hit government farm here have died in Gangarampur, 45km away, raising fears of a similar outbreak in that town.
    
	NGO Gangarampur Block Gramodyog Samiti had bought 1,450 chicks on January 11. The outbreak in Balurghat was confirmed on Tuesday.
    
	The dead birds in Gangarampur have been buried but there have been no efforts to cull the 525 chicks and 288 chickens on the NGOs farm.

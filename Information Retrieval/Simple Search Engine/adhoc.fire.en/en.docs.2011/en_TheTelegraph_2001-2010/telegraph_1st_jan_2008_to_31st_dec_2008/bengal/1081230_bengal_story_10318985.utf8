  - Opinion sought on what to do with killers on road         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Race to Kill: A bus uses the wrong lane to speed past another in Calcutta. (File picture)                                        
	Calcutta, Dec. 29: The government will seek peoples opinion on what should be done with killer drivers.        
	A committee formed to examine whether or not to charge them with culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Section 304 of the IPC), a non-bailable offence that leads to at least 10 years in jail, today decided to issue a notification seeking the peoples opinion.        
	Home department special secretary A.G. Ghosh, who heads the committee, chaired the meeting attended by transport and judicial department officials, police officers and representatives of bus owners and employees.        
	After the meeting, a transport official said: We are all aware that there have been several accidents in the city and its adjoining areas over the past few months and they triggered public outrage and demands that the killer drivers be severely punished. So, the government has decided to make the forum broad-based and seek the view of people from across the state. We will receive their opinions till January 16.        
	The notification, to be issued in a day or two, will specify where the views can be sent.        
	Over 410 people have died in Calcutta alone this year, a police officer at Lalbazar said.        
	The government wants to charge the killer drivers with Section 304 while transport unions favour Section 304A (death due to negligence), which makes the offence bailable and can jail an offender for two years at the most.        
	Differences of opinion between the government and the bus unions had prompted the formation of the panel, which would submit its report in February.        
	Citu leader Subhas Mukhopadhyay, who attended the meeting, said: There are drivers who care little while driving and end up causing accidents trying to overtake others. But there are people on the road who also care little about safety and create situations where a driver fails to control the vehicle. We should consider both aspects.        
	An official said advocate-general Balai Rays opinion would be sought before a final decision was made. People react strongly after accidents and, in most cases, put the blame on drivers. So, it is natural that they will want strong charges against drivers. After getting their opinion, we will talk to the advocate-general on the feasibility of the move.

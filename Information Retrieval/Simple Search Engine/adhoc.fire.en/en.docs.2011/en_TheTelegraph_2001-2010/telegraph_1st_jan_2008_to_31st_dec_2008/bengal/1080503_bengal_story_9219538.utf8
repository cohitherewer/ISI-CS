The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Nandi attack slur on CPM
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Nandi attack slur on CPM
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nandigram, May 2: Many Trinamul Congress supporters and around 50 panchayat poll candidates have apparently had to flee Nandigram villages over the past few days following attacks by CPM cadres roaming on motorcycles.        
	Some 300 people who fled Gokulnagar, Simulkundu, Rainagar, Jambari, Sonachura, Bhangabera, Kalicharanpur and Southkhali had thrown a ring around the Nandigram I block office till late tonight demanding security and food.        
	Trinamul Congress candidates have submitted a written complaint, saying they are not being able to campaign. They are not being able to write graffiti, put up posters or hang festoons, said BDO Shantiram Gorai.        
	CPM district secretariat member Ashok Guria said Trinamul was feeling insecure as it did not have a support base in Nandigram. Their allegations are baseless.        
	Shibshankar Sahu, 40, a Trinamul candidate in Kalicharanpur who is now in hospital, had a different story. We were campaigning last night when about 30 CPM supporters armed with sticks and revolvers came in motorcycles and asked us not to hold the meeting. When I went to talk to them, they beat me up.        
	About 50 CPM cadres on motorcycles went to Rainagar, 10km from Kalicharanpur, on Wednesday and surrounded a Trinamul gathering. They fired in the air and hurled bombs, scaring away around 100 people. A clash followed.        
	But all the violence is not the CPMs doing. Five persons, including Trinamul panchayat samiti candidate Swadesh Das Adhikary, were injured in a blast in Gokulnagar yesterday. Police said they were making bombs.        
	East Midnapore police chief S.S. Panda had said earlier that both sides possessed arms.         
	Two of the three bamboo bridges built connecting Nandigram and CPM-dominated Khejuri have been dismantled. The Nandigram people said the third bridge was built for their convenience. If we find it was set up to create trouble, we will pull it down, Gorai said.

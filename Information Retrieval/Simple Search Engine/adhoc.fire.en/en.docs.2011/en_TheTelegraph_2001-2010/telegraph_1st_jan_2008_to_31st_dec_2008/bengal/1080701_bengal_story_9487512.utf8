          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, June 30: Home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti today said the state and the Centre would take all necessary steps to ensure movement of essential commodities to Sikkim even if the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas indefinite shutdown resumed from July 6.        
	The Morcha had blocked the section of the National Highway 31A, which passes through the Darjeeling hills, during the earlier bandh, cutting off the supply lines to the land-locked state.        
	After a meeting with senior administrative and police officers of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar near Siliguri this evening, Chakrabarti said: We are aware of the problems faced by residents of Sikkim whenever there is a strike in the hills. The issue has been raised before the Centre, too.         
	As discussions with the Morcha have started, we would request the Morcha leadership not to resume the strike that severely affects the people of Darjeeling as well.        
	If the strike resumes, necessary measures would be taken, he added.        
	Additional forces could be deployed to keep the highway open.        
	The home secretary said: At the meeting, we discussed the need for extra forces. We will write to the Centre seeking additional forces for the Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar districts.        
	The Sikkim chief secretary had earlier said that if the situation became unmanageable because of a bandh in Bengal, the state would seek army deployment to clear blockades. It is imperative that the highway is kept open for essential commodities and services to reach us, N.D. Chingapa said.         
	He had also sent SOS messages to Delhi and Calcutta, asking the governments to ensure that the hill states supply lines were not choked.         
	Sources said the Siliguri meeting also discussed the agitation for a new Greater Cooch Behar state  with parts of Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri in it.         
	The Bengal home secretary got a low-down of the of the law-and-order situation in the three districts at the meeting.         
	In the Darjeeling hills, he said, the situation was peaceful, but fragile.        
	The Morcha has asked its supporters to change the number plates of their vehicles from WB (West Bengal) to GL (for Gorkhaland) .        
	Chakrabarti said: The motor vehicles act defines in detail everything about the registration and numbering of vehicles. If the law is flouted, the district administration will take appropriate steps. There is no need for any new decision or circular. The government is keeping a close watch.

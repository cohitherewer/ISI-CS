          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 14: Congress MLA Sudip Bandopadhyay will meet Mamata Banerjee tomorrow to finalise a date for his return to the Trinamul Congress after being humiliated and isolated in his party.        
	I took the decision to protest the humiliation and isolation I faced in the state Congress, Sudip said tonight.        
	He was associated with Trinamul since its inception in 1998 and was elected from the Calcutta North West parliamentary seat that year. Mamata, however, denied him a seat in 2004 following his overtures to the BJP for a berth in Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees ministry.         
	Sudip left Trinamul and fought for Calcutta North West as a Congress-backed Independent. Both Sudip and the Trinamul candidate lost, paving the way for a CPM victory.         
	Today, Sudip said he had informed Congress president Sonia Gandhi about the humiliation. I had no choice other than to join hands with Mamata, he said.        
	Asked if Mamata had promised him a ticket for 2009, Sudip replied in the negative.         
	Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee said: He is leaving the party for an election ticket.

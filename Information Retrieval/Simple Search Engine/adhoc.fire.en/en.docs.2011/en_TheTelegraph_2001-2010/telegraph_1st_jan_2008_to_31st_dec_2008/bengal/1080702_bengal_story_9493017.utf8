The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Drunks behind ladies bars
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Drunks behind ladies bars
  - Morcha women imprison tottering residents          VIVEK CHHETRI                          Morcha women in front of the jail along Peshok Road, 12km from Darjeeling town. Picture by Suman Tamang                                  
	Second Mile (Darjeeling), July 1: The rugged wooden cubicle with a chair inside along the busy Peshok Road connecting Darjeeling and Kalimpong has apparently cured a bunch of men of their fondness for liquor in three months.        
	The structure, dubbed a jail by local women, has a simple role: to keep drunks in solitary confinement.         
	Any individual found drunk and loitering in the village, 12km from Darjeeling town, is locked up in this 5ft by 4ft cell for seven hours. They are also fined Rs 500 for the offence.         
	The drive is the brainchild of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha womens wing. The Nari Morcha built the jail in March.        
	We decided to construct the jail after holding a meeting with the villagers. We also issued a warning to all residents asking them to refrain from drinking both for our political cause and for the wellbeing of the society. So far we have jailed about 15-20 men and it has worked wonders, said Srijana Tamang, the Second Mile local committee president of the Nari Morcha.         
	People get drunk mostly in the evenings. However, we do not take them to the jail immediately. They are confined from 8 in the morning and the women take turns to guard the cell and escort them out if they need to relieve themselves, said Tamang.         
	The shame of being jailed has apparently been driving men away from the bottle.         
	I was arrested once and felt really bad when inquisitive people travelling along the busy road kept peeping through the wooden logs. I have stopped drinking now, said Nima Tamang, 31, who is unemployed and has been a habitual drunk.         
	Initially, there had been some resistance. However, later all the families agreed to this mode of punishment, said Srijana.         
	The Nari Morcha leaders said they hit upon the plan after seeing many drunks taking part in protests and strikes to demand Gorkhaland.         
	We are now very happy. The atmosphere in the village has improved. People have even stopped drinking at home. We need discipline in our movement for Gorkhaland and this is a novel way (to ensure that), said B.L. Pradhan, a retired army man.        
	The Nari Morcha has also requested the three-four houses in the locality that brewed local liquor to stop doing so.         
	They have agreed, claimed Pradhan.         
	In fact, even people from other villagers do not pass by the jail when they are drunk.        
	Asked if the Morcha central leadership approved of the move to imprison people for drinking, the partys publicity secretary, Binay Tamang, said he did not know about any such jail. He added: It might be a local initiative.

	Calcutta, Sept. 29: A man who later identified himself as a Kerala MP triggered a scare at Cal-cutta airport tonight. CISF personnel cordoned off bag he had left behind outside the domestic terminal and the bomb squad was called.     
	A. Vijayaraghavan arrived after some time and claimed his bag. He was allowed to go after he identified himself as the MP.    
	Half an hour later, at 9.45, a bag was found near the Air India check-in counter inside the terminal. No one turned up to collect it, but a search revealed clothes inside.        
	Darjeeling: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has relaxed its ban on the payment of power bills from October following the chief ministers request. Demanding a separate state, it had begun its movement against collection of government revenues on April 1.        
	Behrampore: A wo-man in Murshidabads Barwan allegedly poisoned her two sons and drank the pesticide, unable to bear her alcoholic husbands beatings.

	Ranchi/Chinsurah, Feb. 26: An engineering diploma-holder from Chinsurah in Hooghly was kidnapped in Jharkhand, where he works, yesterday.
    
	Goons armed with revolvers stopped Deepak Kumar Shaw, 24, who was on a cycle, at Mahagama around 11am. They took away a local contractors motorcycle and drove off with him towards Bagjori village in Godda district.
    
	Rajesh Singh, an accountant in Shaws office  the Ranchi-based Classic Coal Construction Company  received a call in which the kidnappers demanded Rs 10 lakh.
    
	Deepak has been working for four months with the company, which is laying a rail-way line to carry coal to the NTPCs Farakka plant. He went to Mahagama, 450km from Ranchi, to work on the project.
    
	Godda superintendent Satish Prasad said the police suspected Deepak had been kept in one of the small villages on the hilly terrain of Lalmatia, under Mahagama police station. 
    
	The police are questioning local contractor Jadupati Kapri, who was held after the kidnap.
    
	At Deepaks house at Aymadanga Colony in Chinsurah, 60km from Calcutta, his family accused the company of not informing them about the incident. We came to know of our sons kidnap from his friends today, said Deepaks father Deonarayan, 59.
    
	A railway guard, he was on night shift yesterday. Deepaks elder sister Sunita heard about the abduction and called up Deonarayan this morning.
    
	Luckily, we had the number of one of his colleagues, who helped us get in touch with Binay Sinha, the brother-in-law of the companys owner. Sinha told us the company was trying its best to free Deepak, said Deonarayan.
    
	Deepaks elder brother Pradip, an agent of a private shipping company, has left for Ranchi. I last saw my brother on January 26, when he came on leave. I spoke to him over the phone on Sunday, he said.
    
	Sources said Classic had let the kidnappers know that it was willing to grant them sub-contracts for supply of materials if they released Deepak.

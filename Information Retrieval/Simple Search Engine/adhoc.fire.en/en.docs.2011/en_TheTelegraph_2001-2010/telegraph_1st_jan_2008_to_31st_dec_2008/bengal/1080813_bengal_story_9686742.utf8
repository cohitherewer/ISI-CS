	Calcutta, Aug. 12: A question mark hangs over Prosenjits first foray into television  the Lux Fatafati Filmy Fight (F3).        
	The reality show, which was to have Prosenjit as one of the judges, was to be telecast on ETV in the 9pm prime time slot from August 14.        
	But production stopped last week after three members of the F3 unit were arrested for scuffling with some hotel staff in Midnapore.        
	One employee, Prasun Adhikary, dropped down four floors from the hotels roof. He died last night.        
	The channel has postponed the show and its too early to say when it will happen. A lot of things need to be worked out, said Prosenjit, Tollywoods No. 1 hero.         
	Its unfortunate. We were all prepared and very involved with the show. We are sorting out various details for a replacement of F3, said P.K. Manvi, chief producer of ETV network, from Hyderabad.         
	The 54-episode, one-hour show was to groom the next generation of stars. We had put up around 70 hoardings in Calcutta alone. We had gone a little overboard with the budget because we were sure that it would have been the most popular show with Prosenjit in it, Manvi said.         
	The 36 contestants had gone through grooming sessions and rehearsed in front of Prosenjit last Friday.         
	The winner would have got Rs 8 lakh cash and a film offer from Rose Valley Production.         
	Our whole life and career is at stake. We have given so much time to this show, said Santanu Mondal, a contestant.

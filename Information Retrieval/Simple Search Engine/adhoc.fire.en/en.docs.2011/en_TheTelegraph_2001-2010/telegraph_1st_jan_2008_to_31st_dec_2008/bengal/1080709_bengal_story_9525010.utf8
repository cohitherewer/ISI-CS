	Calcutta, July 8: A high court division bench today upheld a trial bench verdict cancelling the approval of 40 private primary teachers training institutes across the state.    
	However, considering the future of 4,000 students who had gra-duated from these institutes before they were deemed illegal, the court said their certificates would be valid.    
	In 2004, the primary education department had granted approval to these institutions, though they did not fulfil the essential criteria  having a one-acre campus and qualified teachers for example.

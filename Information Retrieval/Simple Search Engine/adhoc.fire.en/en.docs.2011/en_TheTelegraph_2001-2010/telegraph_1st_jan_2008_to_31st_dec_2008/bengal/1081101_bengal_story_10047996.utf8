          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 31: Political parties today urged the chief electoral officer to request the poll panel to consider lifting the poll graffiti ban.         
	The Election Commission has said no election graffiti or posters will be allowed on walls of buildings even with the house owners permission.         
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen, who called an all-party meeting today, said: The political parties gave their views that will be communicated to the EC.         
	Manas Bhunia, leader of the Congress legislature party, said in a democratic system, rights and privileges of candidates shouldnt be curbed. The purpose of the campaign is to reach out to the electorate. If curbs introduced by the EC obstruct communication, it will be detrimental to a parliamentary democracy.         
	Bhunia said the Congress had suggested that posters, banners, hoardings and graffiti be allowed if house owners permitted them, but there should be a directive asking parties to clean the walls later.         
	CPM state committee member Rabin Deb, too, said the poll panel should not have problems if house owners allowed graffiti. We find nothing wrong with that, he said.        
	Trinamuls Mukul Roy said if the ban stayed, the poll panel must suggest how poor parties would campaign.

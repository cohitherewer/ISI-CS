          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 9: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has taken personal responsibility to find land in Trinamul Congress-ruled South 24-Parganas for a university promised to Muslims.        
	The government had announced a year ago that the Calcutta Madarsa college would be upgraded to Aliah University, but all its efforts to acquire the required 50-odd acres have failed so far.        
	Bhattacharjee today met minority affairs minister Abdus Sattar and land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah to discuss the universitys possible location and the process of land acquisition, a touchy issue that cost the CPM in last months panchayat polls.        
	The chief minister told us he would personally try to organise land for the university. All of us know that circumstances surrounding land acquisition have changed in the past one month, and so we must be cautious, Sattar said.        
	Mollah, too, was cautious when asked if it would be possible to find land in South 24-Parganas, whose zilla parishad the Trinamul has wrested.        
	He replied: I cant say whether land can be taken in that district. Besides, I would not like to speak on land acquisition before the Lok Sabha polls. Lets see what can be done to get land for this university.        
	A land department official said the state government had initially thought of Kalyani in Nadia as a possible site for the university but could find only 10 acres there.         
	There was resistance from local people and so the government could not proceed. Similar efforts failed at Barasat (North 24-Parganas), the official said.         
	Bhattacharjee told Mollah to identify a place in South 24-Parganas because the university needed to be close to Calcutta, Sattar said.        
	Energy plan        
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen has said the multinational Great Eastern Energy Corporation Ltd would soon start exploring for coal-bed methane gas in Saltora, Bankura.

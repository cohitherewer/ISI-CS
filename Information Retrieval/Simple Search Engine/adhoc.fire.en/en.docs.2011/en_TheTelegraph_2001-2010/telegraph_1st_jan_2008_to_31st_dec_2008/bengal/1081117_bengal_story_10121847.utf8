                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Rap on principal heavy hand
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Nov. 16: The CPM-dominated West Bengal College and University Teachers Association has turned the glare on the autocratic attitude of 16 college principals in the state.        
	In the associations annual report, its general secretary Tarun Kumar Patra has called the college heads undemocratic, autocratic and teacher-unfriendly. The report holds these principals responsible for many of the problems dogging higher education.         
	The association held its 82nd annual general meeting at the Malda College grounds today where more than 2,500 teachers were present.        
	The association had yesterday kicked off its state conference at the same venue. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had addressed the opening day of the meet.         
	One of the problem colleges, according to the report, is Harimohan Ghosh College in Calcuttas Garden Reach.         
	The teachers of Harimohan Ghosh College have been protesting against their principals autocratic manner of functioning and we have ask ed the university to end the problem soon, Patras report said.         
	The college is under Calcutta University.        
	Eleven of the 16 colleges that came in for a rap in the report are outside Calcutta, and all of them are in south Bengal.        
	In Bankim Sardar College in South 24-Parganas, the report said, the principal was not democratic and members of its managing committee had ganged up against some teachers.        
	Dhruba Chand Halder College in North 24-Parganas, too, is plagued by a widening rift between its faculty and principal.         
	This college does not do anything in consultation with the teachers council. Many departments have been withdrawn without the knowledge of its teachers, Patras report alleged.        
	He said some of the principals were so unreasonable that the teachers association had to report them to the university. Patra cited the case of Ranaghat College in Nadia, where the principal had allegedly threatened to hold an inquiry into why the association had sent him a letter asking for the reasons behind holding up a teachers promotion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Judges probe into police firing
                                                                                                            Judges probe into police firing
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 10: The government today ordered a judicial probe into Tuesdays police firing on rampaging Forward Bloc supporters in Dinhata that left six dead.        
	We have ordered a judicial probe into the February 5 police firing. The judges name and terms of reference are yet to be decided, chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said.        
	Officials said the chief minister would announce the name of the judge and terms of reference after consultations with law minister Rabilal Moitra.        
	The chief ministers media secretary announced the probe in the morning, apparently to keep it a low-key affair unlike the announcement after Rizwanur Rahmans death. That probe had to be wound up after the high court ordered a CBI inquiry.        
	The court had also ordered a CBI inquiry into the Nandigram firing before the government could order a probe.        
	Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh had written to the chief minister yesterday demanding the inquiry, four days after Dinhata firing, apparently under pressure from the partys local unit.         
	I have come to know about the judicial probe from the media. The chief minister didnt call me up after his return from Delhi, Ghosh said today.        
	The Bloc leader said his party was also demanding the withdrawal of police cases against party cadres accused of violence in Dinhata and punishment for officials responsible for the police firing.         
	The Blocs Cooch Behar unit secretary, Udayan Guha, has been accused of murder after the death of a National Volunteers Force jawan. Krishnakanta Barman, 55, was beaten to death by Bloc supporters in front of the Dinhata subdivisional office.        
	Guha said he was not happy with the governments silence on our other demands.         
	RSP state secretary Debabrata Bandopadhyay said: The government should set a deadline for the commission to complete its task. Otherwise, the fate of this probe would be the same as those by earlier commissions that worked for years only to see their reports being dumped.        
	Although Ghosh has likened the Dinhata firing to Nandigram, where 14 people were killed on March 14, and called it premeditated murder, he has refused to walk out of the government.        
	He has also not spoken a word against the chief minister, who holds the police portfolio.         
	The Opposition parties said the judicial probe would only help the government sweep the police highhandedness under the carpet.         
	A judicial probe is nothing but an attempt to hush up the case. The findings of many judicial commissions have not seen the light of day, said Trinamul Congress MLA Partha Chatterjee.

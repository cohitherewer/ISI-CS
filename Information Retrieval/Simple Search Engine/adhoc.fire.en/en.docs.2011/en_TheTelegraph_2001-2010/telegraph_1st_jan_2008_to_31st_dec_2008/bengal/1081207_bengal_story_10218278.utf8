	Calcutta, Dec. 6: A young man walked up to a table at an Ekbalpore eatery, accused a man sipping tea of plotting to kill him and opened fire.     
	A friend with whom Faiyaz Ahmed was sitting thrust him aside in the nick of time and the bullet hit the wall behind. The assailant, later identified as Shehbaz, did not fire a second shot as the people around raised the alarm. He fled. Police said Shehbaz and Faiyaz were known criminals and friends who had fallen out.     
	At the Maulana Mo- hammed Ali Road shop, where Faiyaz was with Mohammed Akbar, Shehbaz landed with two others this afternoon hatching the murder plot.     
	He shot Faiyaz even as he kept saying he had no plan to kill him.

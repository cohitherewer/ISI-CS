          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, May 3: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has wangled the governments permission to hold a rally in Siliguri.        
	The decision came a couple of hours after Morcha supporters sat on a hunger strike at Darjeeling More below Tenzing Norgays statue this afternoon.         
	After a discussion with a Morcha delegation, it has been decided that it can organise a meeting at Indira Gandhi Maidan on May 7 from 11am to 4.45pm, B.L. Meena, divisional commissioner of Jalpaiguri and caretaker administrator of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, said.        
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri met Meena at the circuit house with 16 other leaders.        
	The Morcha, in turn, has promised to withdraw its ongoing hunger strikes and keep government offices open in the hills, the divisional commissioner said.         
	Rajesh Pandey, the Darjeeling district magistrate, handed over a list of 19 conditions to the Morcha team after the meeting to make sure the May 7 meeting to press for a separate state is peaceful.         
	The Morcha expressed satisfaction with the outcome of todays talks. We have finally got permission for the rally. Expecting a large turnout at the meeting, we thought of holding it at Indira Gandhi Maidan, Giri said.         
	All the hunger strikes have been withdrawn from today, he added.        
	Morcha supporters have been on indefinite fast in at least 10 places across Darjeeling and Dooars, demanding permission for the Siliguri rally.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Go-slow wise, say civic poll managers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Go-slow wise, say civic poll managers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Shyamal Chakraborty and Biman Bose: Fingers crossed      
	Calcutta, June 3: District leaders of the CPM sounded relieved today with the government deciding to go slow on land acquisition for Salim Group and DLF projects.        
	They were to come up in the 24-Parganas, East Midnapore and Hooghly, where the Trinamul Congress jolted the CPM in the rural polls.        
	The CPM is worried about its likely impact on the elections to 13 municipalities on June 29, particularly those in South and North 24-Parganas.         
	The go-slow is to allay the fears of the rural voters in municipal areas and keeping in mind the Lok Sabha polls (due next year), a CPM state committee member from South 24-Parganas said today.        
	Four of the 13 civic bodies  Diamond Harbour in South 24-Parganas, Midnapore, Haldibari in Cooch Behar and Alipurduar in Jalpaiguri  are now with the Opposition.         
	Having snatched the South 24-Parganas, East Midnapore and North Dinajpur zilla parishads from the Left, the Opposition is eyeing the municipalities in Habra and Panihati in North 24-Parganas, Chakdah in Nadia and Dalkhola in North Dinajpur.         
	Officially, the CPM is denying any likely impact of the rural results. The two polls are different. The impact of the land row was not even felt everywhere in panchayat polls and we won the zilla parishads 13 to 4, state secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty said.         
	State party secretary Biman Bose, however, cautioned party members in Panihati yesterday, putting the civic election in the context of the rural polls. We should not consider the municipal polls as routine because of the Opposition unity against us in the panchayat polls.        
	He knew that a loss in the municipal polls would be construed as an erosion of the CPMs support in urban areas.         
	CPM leaders in North 24-Parganas have their fingers crossed. Panihati will see a tough fight, one of them said.         
	In Habra, where the party controls the civic body with a lone extra member, the situation is worse. In the rural polls, we lost the areas around Habra town, said a leader.         
	A South 24-Parganas leader said: The go-slow on land is wise but unlikely to undo the damage immediately.        
	The party lost panchayat samiti and gram panchayat seats in Diamond Harbour, where an acquisition notice for a 7km stretch of the proposed Barasat-Raichak expressway had been served.         
	Realising that a fractured Left Front had made the Oppositions task easier in the rural polls, the CPM walked the extra mile this time.         
	The RSPs Manoj Bhattacharya said the discord in South Dinajpurs Balurghat had been sorted out as the CPM agreed to allow the RSP to retain its control of the board.         
	Udayan Guha, the Forward Bloc leader in Cooch Behar, said he had buried the hatchet in Mekhligunj and Haldibari.         
	We will continue our campaign against the Dinhata po- lice firing (in February) that killed five of our supporters. But we also want to sort out the misunderstanding among the allies, Guha said.

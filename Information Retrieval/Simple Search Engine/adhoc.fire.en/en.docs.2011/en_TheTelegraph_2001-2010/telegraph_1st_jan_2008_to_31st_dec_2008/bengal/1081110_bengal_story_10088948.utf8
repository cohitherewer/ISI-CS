          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 9: Three brothers aged between 6 and 12 were burnt alive last night and their mother suffered 70 per cent burns when a kerosene lamp toppled over and set afire a heap of cotton in their shanty.        
	The boys were identified as Bapan Mistri, 12 Swapan, 10, and Ripon, 6. The three were sleeping with their mother, Jayanti, in their Ghutiarisharif house in South 24-Parganas when the blaze started.        
	Police said Jayantis husband Ratan was a quilt maker and had stocked a lot of cotton and fabric.        
	Last night, after dinner Ratan went to a neighbours house and Jayanti went to sleep with Ripon. The other sons were sleeping in the adjacent room, a police officer said.         
	Neighbours first noticed that Ratans house was up in flames and started pouring buckets of water. Ratan also reached the house and tried to bring out his wife and children. In the process, he suffered burns.         
	The villagers doused the fire in one side of the house and dragged out Jayanti and the children.         
	They were taken to Canning sub-divisional hospital, about 55km from Calcutta, where Swapan and Bapan were declared dead. Ratan, Jayanti and Ripon were rushed to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital where Ripon was declared brought dead.         
	Jayanti was admitted with more than 70 per cent burns. Ratan was released after treatment.         
	Bankim Sardar, a neighbour, said the fire spread so quickly nothing could be done. We rushed with buckets of water but could not save the children, he said.         
	The police suspect the fire started after the kerosene lamp in a room tipped over and fell on the stack of cotton.         
	The fire may have started from the kerosene lamp after it fell on heaps of cotton and cloth stacked in the house. We are checking if there was foul play, said Nishad Parvez, additional superintendent of police (rural).

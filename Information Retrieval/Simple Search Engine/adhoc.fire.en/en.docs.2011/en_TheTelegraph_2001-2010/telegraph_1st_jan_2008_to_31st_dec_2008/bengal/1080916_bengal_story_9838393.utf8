          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, Sept. 15: A young man feigned to set out in pursuit of a rogue truck and fled last night, leaving behind his pillion rider, a girl who lay bleeding on the road with her head smashed.        
	Police identified the girl from an I-card in her bag as Basanti Mondal, 20.         
	The truck, trailing the motorcycle, ran over the girl after the two-wheeler skidded on the rain-drenched National Highway 34 in Nadias Shantipur, 55km from Calcutta.        
	Witnesses said the youth, almost unhurt, quickly picked up his vehicle and sped after the fleeing truck.         
	The alacrity with which he picked up the bike and started off gave local villagers the impression that he was going to chase down the truck. But he neither returned to the spot nor enquired about the girl at any nearby hospital, said Ranaghat subdivisional police officer Angshuman Saha.        
	They were travelling at great speed, though it was drizzling, the officer added. Basanti was not wearing a helmet.        
	Police traced her house to Ranaghat, 15km from where she was run over.        
	Her father Nityagopal, a garments trader, told the police Basanti had left home around 4pm saying she was going to a friends house in Krishnagar, about 30km away, for some notes.        
	The BA student of Netaji Subhas Open University met with the accident on the way back home, around 10pm.         
	After a round of inquiry, we feel the girl was on her boyfriends motorcycle. She had told her father that she was going with a male friend but did not reveal his identity. We are looking for him, a Shantipur police officer said.        
	Local residents took Basanti to the Shantipur State General Hospital, where she was declared dead.         
	The officer said some of the girls other friends could be questioned.        
	Basanti was her parents only child. Nityagopal sobbed like a child himself while speaking to the police today.        
	The police said locating the man who was with Basan-ti may not be easy as she had not told her father whose house she was going to or with whom she was travelling.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Dignagar, May 28: A young man from Nadia is missing in Sudan, where he worked as an oil company technician.        
	Biplab Biswas, 23, was abducted on May 13 along with three other Indians.        
	The rebel Justice and Eq- uality Movement, which has forces in South Kordofan and has in the past kidnapped oil workers, has denied having a hand in it.        
	The resident of Dignagar near Shantipur, about 70km from Calcutta, was kidnapped between the Neem and Heglig oil fields. Heglig is one of Sudans largest oil fields.        
	Every night in my sleep I see masked men dragging my brother across a courtyard. I have read about Daniel Pearl, the journalist who was killed by the Taliban. I fear my brother will also be killed if something is not done immediately, said Biplabs sister Rumi, tears rolling down her cheeks.        
	The Class XII girl doesnt believe he is dead, but all kinds of thoughts haunt her.         
	My friends tell me there is little hope, Rumi, 18, said.        
	On Monday, she travelled 10km to Krishnagar and pleaded with the district magistrate to prod the government to find her brother. Sir, we are in trouble. Please save my dear brother, Rumi told Onkar Singh Meena.         
	Meena said he has forwarded the girls prayer to the state government. I have learnt that the matter has been taken up by top officials of the state and the Centre, he added.        
	Rumi said officials of the company for which Biplab worked had called up the family and said all attempts were being made to rescue him.        
	But the family has neither heard from them nor from any Indian agency since May 23.         
	Rumis other brother Sajal, 25, who studied till Class VIII like Biplab, works at a construction company in Dubai.         
	Mother Kanak said the brothers wanted to see Rumi educated. My sons encourage her to keep studying. But she has refused to go to school until she hears about dada.        
	Bipalbs father Sasthi Charan, 55, is mute. He used to work in the field. But he quit five years ago because of failing health, said Kanak.        
	Biplab went to Mumbai two years ago to work as plumber. From there he went to the oil-rich Sudan. My sons send Rs 3,000 each every month for their fathers treatment, sisters education and daily expenses, Kanak said.        
	Last October, the Justice Equality Movement had captured five oil workers and warned all oil companies to stop work and leave the country. The hostages were freed after intervention by the Egyptian government.

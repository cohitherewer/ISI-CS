	Krishnagar, June 9: A woman killed herself last night after her husband pronounced talaq on her, refusing to believe she had been late returning home because of the back-to-back bandhs last week.        
	Chimatan Bibi, 42, had gone to see her brothers pregnant daughter at Behrampore State General Hospital on June 4. The bandhs  one called by the Left Front and the other by the Trinamul Congress  fell on June 5 and 6.         
	Chimatan had no choice but to stay back at her brothers home. When she returned to her Nadia home on Saturday night, husband Rahim Sheikh, 50, demanded the reason for the delay.        
	He refused to accept her explanation and pronounced the triple talaq, asking her to leave the house within a couple of days. This might have led the woman to end her life, said Manas Chowdhury, the officer in charge of Thanarpara police station.        
	Januara Bibi, wife of Chimatans brother, had accompanied her to Nadia. She told the police that Rahim had pronounced talaq in her presence.        
	On Sunday night, Chimatan drank pesticide at her Karimpur home, 180km from Calcutta.

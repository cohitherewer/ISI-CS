          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dinhata, Feb. 7: Paramita, the 18-year-old fiancee of slain Forward Bloc worker Indrajit Chakrabarty, today denied that she had attempted suicide yesterday.        
	She dubbed the report of her suicide bid a Bloc conspiracy to embarrass her father, a CPM supporter. Paramita (name changed) said Indrajit had a crush on her but she was not interested in him. Why should I commit suicide then?        
	Her father said: Indrajits relatives had come to us for Paramitas hand but nothing had been fixed.        
	But Indrajits mother claimed the families had been looking for an auspicious date in mid-March for the wedding.

	Calcutta, Dec. 30: The state has written to the Centre it will start arranging the land and other infrastructure for a dedicated National Security Guard unit in Bengal once Delhi confirms its decision to house the force in the metros.        
	The Centre has said an NSG unit should be in place in our city in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. Our government feels the unit should be close to Calcutta as it will require lots of infrastructure support, state home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said. The unit, he added, needs to be close to the airport. It has to go for regular anti-hijack drills. Rajarhat is a possible location.         
	The state has told Delhi it wants to set up a marine intelligence network of its own to safeguard the 259km coastline.

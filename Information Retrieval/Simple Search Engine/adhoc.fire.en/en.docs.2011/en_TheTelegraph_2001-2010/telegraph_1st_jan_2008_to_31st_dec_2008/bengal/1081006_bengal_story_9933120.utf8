	Alipurduar, Oct. 5: An elephants violent death on tracks yesterday has proved the railways are not following the speed rules they are supposed to, the states chief wildlife warden said today.         
	We had discussed the problem at a seminar in Calcutta last month in the presence of Project Elephant representatives. But yesterdays incident proves the railways are not abiding by the speed rules. I will inform Project Elephant about the incident, said S.S. Bist.         
	A.P. Singh, deputy field director of the Buxa Tiger Reserve, said: The way two wagons jumped rails while dragging the female for 400m is evidence that the train was running at a considerable speed.        
	Six elephants of the herd had managed to cross the tracks at Pampubusty  17km from here  but one of them was injured, he added.         
	A report submitted to the Railway Board in March by a team comprising forest and railway officials had highlighted the need to reduce the speed of trains travelling through elephant corridors (their traditional routes). Many spots between Alipurduar Junction and Siliguri had been tagged sensitive in the report. Pampubusty is one of them, said Bist.         
	However, R.K. Gupta, the acting additional divisional railway manager of Alipurduar, said yesterdays accident occurred in a zone that was not vulnerable, referring to a high court ruling asking the railways to take precautions in four vulnerable spots.        
	Our drivers strictly follow speed restrictions at the specified zones, but Pampubusty is not on the list, Gupta said.         
	Thirteen elephants have been run over since the tracks connecting Siliguri and Alipurduar were converted to broad gauge in 2004.

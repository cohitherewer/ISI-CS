          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Jalpaiguri, Dec. 25: The Bengal chief minister today said that apart from exceptional cases, the government would not hire anyone on contract to work in a government department.         
	The coordination committee of state government employees has prompted us to take the decision that other than exceptional cases, we would not make any contractual recruitment.... whoever we recruit, would be recruited as a staffer, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said. He did not explain, though, what the exceptional cases could be.        
	Standing against the current trend of downsizing during the economic depression, we will not retrench a single employee working in government departments in our state. The depression has left an impact on us but even then, we would stick to our decision, he said, which the 800 delegates of employees associations applauded.

          OUR BUREAU                          Father Dilip: Never say die                                  
	Feb. 29: The Prime Minister has sanctioned Rs 1 lakh for a girls education, touched by The Telegraphs report on her visually challenged father toiling as a labourer to ensure that she went to school.         
	The money has been put in a fixed deposit and Dilip Ghosh, 45, of Dhubulia in Nadia, 120km from Calcutta, can draw the monthly interest for Shampas education.         
	He will get about Rs 700 to 800 a month, a district official said. The principal of Rs 1 lakh will be given to Shampa when she turns 18.         
	The Class V student of Anandanagar High School was ecstatic at the news, but couldnt name the Prime Minister. I dont know who the Prime Minister is but I want to study, she said.         
	After Dilip was forced to pull Sharma out of school in January, Dilip saw his daughter dump her schoolbag in a pond. He then begged for a job under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme with the panchayat.        
	He was overjoyed today. Now I have no worries. The Prime Minister is taking care of my daughter, said Dilip.

	Calcutta, June 23: About 300 primary school teachers are under the scanner in South 24-Parganas after the government admitted in the high court today that at least two of them had submitted fake mark sheets for the jobs.        
	The court asked the school education department principal secretary to file an affidavit giving details of the recruitment of primary teachers in the district in 2002, when the duo had got their jobs.        
	The government also has to tell Justice Soumitra Pal how many had been found guilty of furnishing fake mark sheets, what action it took against them and how it recovered the salary already paid. The district primary school council has to file a separate affidavit stating how it had scrutinised the mark sheets before appointing the teachers.         
	The order followed two petitions filed in 2002 by Jagadish Mondal of Canning and Dipali Dingal of Diamond Harbour, alleging that many of the 300 candidates had submitted fake mark sheets for jobs. Mondal and Dingal had failed to make the cut.        
	The lawyer for the primary school council today said Prativa Das and Subimal Dass fraud had been detected and they were dismissed.

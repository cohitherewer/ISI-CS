                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Life term for seven Roma abductors
  - Desperate act invites tough sentence        A STAFF REPORTER                          Gunjan Ghosh in court on Saturday. Telegraph picture                                        
	Calcutta, Sept. 20: Roma Jhawars kidnappers, who took her away at gunpoint in Salt Lake over three years ago, were sentenced to life today.        
	The Barasat court also told prime accused Gunjan Ghosh and six others to pay a fine of Rs 3,000 each.         
	The first additional district and sessions judge, Samaresh Prosad Choudhury, said: The act (of abduction) is desperate and the crime they committed rocked the civil society to a great extent a sentence to imprisonment for life and Rs 3,000 fine is delivered.        
	Roma, on her way to college with a friend, was kidnapped on February 4, 2005, barely 50 metres from her home.        
	Today, when the judge pronounced the sentence, Gunjan  in a neat white shirt, black trousers and polished shoes  seemed unmoved as the other six accused broke down. He stood with his head held high.         
	Minutes before the verdict, he told the judge: I am the only son and there is no one to take care of my mother. Sir, please consider this.        
	The seven were brought to the courtroom at 11.30am.         
	Neither Roma nor anyone else from her family  they had paid a ransom of Rs 20 lakh  was present in court. The girl was released on the night of February 4 after the gang got the ransom.        
	A man, who said he was the manager of the Jhawars family business, was in court but refused comment.        
	In 2005, an amendment to the IPC made kidnapping for ransom punishable by death.        
	Public prosecutor Naba Kumar Ghosh said the accused had no way out as the evidence before the court was strong enough to hold them guilty. Gunjans lawyer Sisir Nandy, however, said he would move the high court.        
	Police traced Gunjans whereabouts by tracking his cellphone calls to Romas brother Rajesh when he was negotiating the ransom.         
	Amit Kiran Deb, then home secretary, also appeared in the witness box because he had authorised the investigators to tap the phones.        
	Before giving the verdict, Choudhury called all seven accused to the witness box and asked if they had anything to say. They pleaded for mercy.         
	Bikash Shaw, one of the accused, broke down. He pointed to his two-and-half-year-old son and begged for release.        
	The others who were sentenced were Ramchandra Singh, the Jhawars driver who had tipped off Gunjan about Romas movements, Munna Shaw, Dinesh Yadav alias Guddu, Sukumar Mandal and Mukesh Singh.         
	Another accused, Pappu Mahato, is absconding.        
	Gunjan has three murder cases against him. He allegedly killed Arvind Bhai, another gang member, after a quarrel over the ransom. He is also believed to have killed a taxi driver and another man he allegedly kidnapped.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 27: The deal with Tata Motors was read out to the Assembly standing committee on commerce and industry this afternoon but the sole Trinamul Congress member on the panel skipped the meeting.        
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen told the meeting that it was not possible to hand over a copy of the agreement without the Tatas consent. According to the right to information act, a document where a third party is involved cant be made public.        
	Industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen, who attended the meeting, read out the text of the agreement to the committee chaired by the Congresss Sudip Bandopadhyay.        
	Nirupam Sen added that he had explained the deal to the committee, detailing the concessions being provided to Tata Motors. I have cleared all doubts of the members.        
	The Tatas had to be given the concessions to ensure that the project did not go to some other state. We compensated them on three counts  by not taking any lease premium on the land, by providing a soft loan of Rs 200 crore to neutralise the excise duty and by giving a refund on VAT, Sen said.         
	The Tatas, however, will have to pay an annual rent, and pay for their water and electricity, he added.        
	According to a committee member, Uttarakhand offers 100 per cent exemption from excise duty for 10 years. There is also 100 per cent exemption from corporate tax for the first five years with 30 per cent exemption for the next five years.        
	As the excise duty on small cars has been slashed from 16 per cent to 12 per cent, the soft loan provided by the government is likely to be revised downwards, Sen said.        
	Bandopadhyay felt the rent was meagre. It is only Rs 1 crore for the first five years with a 25 per cent increase every five years for the next 30 years. Between 30 years and 60 years, the increase will be 30 per cent every 10 years. At the end of 90 years, the rent will amount to Rs 20 crore. We think this is a very meagre amount, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The CPM feels governor Goplalkrishna Gandhi, who had facilitated talks between Mamata Banerjee and the Bengal government during the Singur standoff, was not impartial.         
	In a document adopted by the central committee in Cal- cutta recently, the party attacks the Congress, too, saying it played a dubious role with state party chief Priya Ranjan Das Munshi encouraging disruption of the Nano project.         
	The role of the governor, who acted as a facilitator between the two sides, was also not impartial. Finally, the Tata motor company decided to shift its plant out of Bengal and announced the shifting out on October 3, the party paper says, adding that this happened when public opinion in the state was veering around in support of the project.         
	The report on political developments says Mamatas adamance led to the deadlock despite all efforts for negotiations and settlement.         
	Mamata, who had refused to talk to the government repeatedly, had finally relented following Gandhis request. The talks at Raj Bhavan failed, though, with the Trinamul Congress chief insisting on the return of 400 acres from the 1,000-acre small-car plant.        
	The governor had earlier earned the CPMs wrath on Nandigram, when he expressed cold horror after the partys recapture of the area. His decision to switch off Raj Bhavan lights for two hours every day when the state was going through a power crisis had also not gone down well.

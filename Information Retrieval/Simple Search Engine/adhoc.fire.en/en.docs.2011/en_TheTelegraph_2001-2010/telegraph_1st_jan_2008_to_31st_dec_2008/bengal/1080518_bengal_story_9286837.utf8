          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Calcutta, May 17: Colleges in the city are scrambling to advance dates for giving out admission forms after the HS council said results would be out on Tuesday.         
	Several colleges have planned emergency meetings next week, Presidency, Scottish Church, Bethune and Ashutosh College being among them.        
	After many years, the HS results will be declared so early and before the announcement of ISC and CBSE (Class XII) results, said Sanghamitra Mukherjee, the principal of Lady Brabourne College. We were supposed to finalise the date for posting the admission form on the Net a fortnight later. As the results will be declared on Tuesday, we have convened an emergency meeting that day, she said.        
	We had no information that the HS results would be declared so early. We are yet to complete the process of designing the software for posting our admission forms and examination criteria on the Net, said D. Kundu, bursar, Scottish Church College.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 30: The states cess on petrol and diesel had a Congress MLA fuming. Then he started gesticulating wildly and his speech stuttered to a stop.         
	Did he choke on his own steam? Not quite.         
	Its a fly, Sir, Congress leader Manas Bhuniya told the Speaker, still waving his hands right and left and right.         
	The smell of chowmein or chicken cutlet, from lunchboxes MLAs sneak into the House, lures in flies everyday. One came in a little early today in anticipation of the feast, around 11.30am.        
	Whats wrong with you? Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim asked Bhuniya as he stopped. The fly is preventing me from asking a question to the finance minister, the MLA said.        
	The treasury benches lapped up the opportunity. He is telling a lie (michhe kotha), thats why the fly (machhi), said one.         
	Its a Left Front fly, Sir, retorted the Congress leader.        
	The Speaker, however, did not take the matter lightly. I know some MLAs leave behind empty food packets. This cant go on. Why do you behave like schoolchildren? Halim said.        
	If I catch anyone bringing food in the future, I will suspend the member for a week.        
	According to the rule, MLAs are not permitted to bring food into the House. They have an afternoon recess to savour their lunch.        
	But members are often seen munching on fish or vegetable chops with their heads down to avoid the Speakers gaze.         
	No wonder Halim called them schoolchildren.         
	Snoozing after lunch in the air-conditioned House is also not a rare sight.        
	Some MLAs get chops, puffed rice and peanuts. Many go to them asking for a handful, an MLA said. We didnt expect a fly to trigger his outburst, he added.

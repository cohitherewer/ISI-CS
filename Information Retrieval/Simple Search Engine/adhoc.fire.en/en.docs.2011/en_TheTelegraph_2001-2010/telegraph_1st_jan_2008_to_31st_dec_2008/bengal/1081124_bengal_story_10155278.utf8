                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Deadline goes by, boycott rolls in
  - Lalgarh roadblocks removed for bullock carts, not administration        PRONAB MONDAL                          The mine-proof vehicle in which the additional district magistrate came to Lalgarh on Sunday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	Lalgarh, Nov. 23: The two-day ultimatum given to the West Midnapore administration over, the outfit leading the tribal agitation here said government vehicles would not be allowed to enter Lalgarh.        
	Chhatradhar Mahato, a leader of the Peoples Commi- ttee Against Police Atrocities, said roadblocks in the area would be withdrawn only for villagers to transport essentials.         
	The outfit had on Friday given the government two days to hold peace talks at Kantapahari or Ramgarh, where there are panchayat offices and schools, and threatened it with a social boycott if it did not respond. The administration refused to go anywhere beyond Lalgarh police station.         
	The protesters removed tree trunks today to create a narrow way for bullock carts and cycle vans on the metalled road that connects Lalgarh bazaar with villages like Dalilpur, Kantapahari and Ramgarh.         
	Villagers who had run out of essentials after a fortnights blockade came out in large numbers on cycles, motorcycles and bullock carts to fetch supplies from the bazaar.        
	We allowed an ambulance to take a patient to the Lalga-rh health centre. Farmers can also bring home crops from their fields. But we wont allow a government vehicle to move in our area. Buses and trekkers will also not be allowed because the police might sneak in, said Chhatradhar.        
	Like the protesters in Lalgarh, tribals in the Belpahari-Banspahari area said they would remove the blockades only partially.        
	The administration described the development as disturbing. They are trying to make the area inaccessible to us and run a parallel administration, said an official.         
	Additional district magistrate R.A. Israel iterated it was not possible to hold talks at Kantapahari or Ramgarh. We have told that to them, but talks to find a suitable venue are on, he added.        
	According to intelligence reports, top Maoists like action squad leaders Kishenji and Sasadhar Mahato and state CPI (Maoist) secretary Kan-chan are camping in Lalgarh. How can we allow officials to go to the interiors for talks with the tribals in such a situation? a police officer asked.        
	Israel today drove into Lalgarh police station in an armoured landmine-proof vehicle. We did not want to take any risk, said an officer of the Lalgarh police station.         
	Mamata Banerjee today said her party would attend an all-party meeting to end the impasse only if it was convened in Lalgarh and involved the agitating tribals.         
	Left Front chairman Biman Bose said it was for the government to decide.        
	A faction of the Jharkhand Party led by Aditya Kisku has called a 48-hour bandh in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore on Friday and Saturday in support of the Lalgarh protesters.        
	The Lalgarh tribals have been up in arms against alleged police atrocities since the November 2 landmine blast targeting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	Chhatradhar today handed over to the administration specific complaints of police atrocities signed by nine women of Chhotopelia village.         
	Israel accepted the complaint not at the police station but a police camp at a local school, where there was a larger force.         
	Chhatradhar accused the administration of going back on its word. They had earlier said the talks could be held in any government building in the area, he said.

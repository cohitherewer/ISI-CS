The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha firm on Siliguri plan
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Morcha firm on Siliguri plan

	Darjeeling, April 25: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today said it would hold rallies in Siliguri anytime between April 28 and 30, though the government has made it clear that no permission would be granted for such a programme.        
	The Morcha has, however, scrapped its earlier plan of a public meeting at Baghajatin Park in Siliguri on Sunday.         
	The announcement comes a day after party president Bimal Gurung said the Morcha would stick to its April 27 programme at Baghajatin.         
	Observers said the change was to keep an avenue open for talks with home secretary Ashok Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	Well be meeting the home secretary in Siliguri tomorrow. We will ask him for permission to hold a rally. If denied, we will go ahead and hold it anytime between Monday and Wednesday, Morcha secretary Roshan Giri said over the phone from Kalchini, where Gurung held his last rally in the Dooars today.        
	Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb had said on Wednesday that Siliguri was too tense for a rally. Sources at Writers Buildings said the home secretary, too, has made it clear that no permission would be granted.         
	All government offices that had been closed for almost 15 days in the Darjeeling hills will be allowed to work from April 28 to May 5. The relaxation has been granted keeping in mind pending work and to ensure that employees get their salaries on time, said Giri.         
	Government offices usually need a week to prepare salary statements of employees and get them sanctioned by higher authorities.         
	Tourists planning a joy ride on the toy train could be lucky if they visit Darjeeling during this time.         
	Gurung said all vehicles from the hills, Siliguri and the Dooars should sport new number plates with GL (for Gorkhaland) from July 7.         
	Vehicles from Darjeeling should have GL-A. B, C, D and E will be used by vehicles from Kalimpong, Kurseong, Siliguri and the Dooars, said Giri.         
	This Morcha plan is one of its many that are difficult to implement. Gurung had earlier said 10,001 people would march on foot from Darjeeling to Calcutta from May 7. The party is now mulling taking the rallyists by train.         
	Darjeeling residents are sceptical about the plan to change registration numbers as vehicle owners might be arrested for using fake number plates. No insurance can be claimed on these numbers.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 19: Racing vehicles claimed three lives on the roads today, a fortnight after 21 people died when a speeding bus fell into the Lower Bagjola Canal.        
	In the first accident around 4.30pm, a teenager and his father died in Maheshtala when a loaded truck keeled over and fell on their motorbike while racing a bus.         
	Barely three hours later, another motorcyclist was knocked down on VIP Road by a route 217 bus that was racing another close to Lake Town.         
	In the third accident today, 55-year-old Asoke Mahato was run over by a private bus on route 230 when he tried to get off the vehicle at Nonapukur tram depot.         
	The police said Mahato slipped off the footboard. The bus has been seized and the driver arrested.        
	Eyewitnesses in Maheshtala said the truck loaded with glass pipes was trying to outdo a private bus and fell on Ahmed Hossain and his 18-year-old son Tausik, who were coming from the opposite direction, on Budge Budge Trunk Road near Beniapole.        
	The accident spot is 5-6km from the Taratala crossing.        
	The truck was trying to overtake the bus from the wrong side.         
	Hossain, 53, and Tausik, riding pillion, were going to a relatives house. The duo, residents of Garden Reach, died on the way to hospital.         
	The driver fled leaving the truck behind.        
	Both father and son got trapped under the truck with their motorcycle. A crane had to be brought to remove the truck. We later extricated the duo and rushed them to hospital with multiple injuries, said Talat Sultana, who was passing by.        
	Agitated residents blocked the road for over two hours demanding a speed-breaker. They lifted the blockade after senior officials intervened.        
	In the accident near Lake Town, police said, the driver lost control of the bus while racing another.        
	The driver (of the route 217 bus) lost control and hit the motorcyclist. We have impounded the bus but the driver fled, said a Lake Town traffic guard.        
	The injured motorcyclist, 35-year-old Vishal Jhunjhunwala of Shibpur, was taken to a nursing home where he died.         
	On April 4, 21 passengers died when a route 217B bus fell into a canal near Keshtopur while speeding.

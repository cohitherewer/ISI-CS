The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | RS rift in mini-front 
                                                                                                               RS rift in mini-front 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 6: The Left Front today failed to resolve the row over sharing Rajya Sabha seats, but the CPM could derive some solace from the growing rift within the mini-coalition led by the Forward Bloc.        
	The RSP joined the CPM to ask the Bloc to make room for the CPI in the Upper House. Five Rajya Sabha seats from the state have fallen vacant. Three are held by the CPM, one by the Bloc and the fifth seat is occupied by the Trinamul Congress.        
	The CPI and other smaller front partners, including the Socialist Party and the RCPI, are now clamouring for their share of the pie and their eyes are on the Bloc seat.        
	Our meeting today ended inconclusively since we could not reach any consensus. We will meet again on March 13, front chairman Biman Bose said.        
	The Bloc, which has been the most belligerent among the partners over the governments land acquisition drive for industry, suspect the CPMs arms-twisting tactics behind the CPIs demand.        
	According to the allies, Bose has made it clear that it would not be possible for the CPM to give up any one of its three secured seats for the CPI. The decision was taken at the CPM state secretariat meeting this morning.        
	The Bloc wants to ensure the renomination of its general secretary Debabrata Biswas for his fourth term, citing his importance in the Left co-ordination committee at the Centre.         
	The CPMs Benoy Konar and the RSPs Kshiti Goswami today suggested to Boc veteran Asoke Ghosh that another Bloc MP, Barun Mukherjee, be removed from the House to make way for the CPI candidate. But Ghosh refused to oblige.         
	Mukherjee has completed around two years in the Rajya Sabha and, according to the CPM-RSP calculation, he can step down and let the CPI nominee compete the rest of his six-year term.         
	I made the suggestion to end the impasse. But its up to the Bloc to decide, Goswami said.

	Calcutta, Aug. 2: Calcutta today got a young brigade to help police make the city greener and cleaner.        
	The civic police volunteers, called the green police by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, will join the city cops and the municipal corporation to protect the environment.        
	Calcutta has the smallest police force in the state and, in balancing everyday law-and-order work with criminal investigation, there remain gaps that cannot be neglected. which is where the new initiative will come into play, Bhattacharjee said at the launch of the new force.        
	The project is the first joint initiative by Calcutta police and Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	The volunteers of the green force have been picked from the 560 clubs that participated in the para-football tournament organised by Calcutta police.         
	Bhattacharjee said women and members of the minority communities should be also be included in the force.        
	The priority for the force will be to save the greenery, wetlands and the water bodies, Bhattacharjee said. Trees are being felled illegally and signboards put up everywhere. This needs to be stopped.         
	Other areas of work include helping the traffic police. They will also look into illegal construction as well as make people more aware of road safety, Bhattacharjee added.        
	The chief minister also launched Kiran, another Calcutta police initiative, to train underprivileged children in computers free of charge.

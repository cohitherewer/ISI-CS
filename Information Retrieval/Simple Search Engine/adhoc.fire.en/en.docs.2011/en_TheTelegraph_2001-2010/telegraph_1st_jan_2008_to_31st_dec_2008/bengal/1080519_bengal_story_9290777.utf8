          OUR BUREAU                               
	Calcutta, May 18: The state government today dismissed the molestation charge against CRPF deputy inspector-general Alok Raj, who had gone to Nandigram last Saturday to oversee the law-and-order situation on the eve of the polls there.        
	Charges of molestation against the CRPF deputy inspector-general have no credibility. I personally detest the idea of hurling the allegation of molestation at the slightest pretext, home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said at Writers Buildings.        
	Raj had denied the allegation against him and said that he was being framed. On polling day, he had a heated telephone conversation with local MP Lakshman Seth, who wanted the central force to be confined to its camp.        
	CPM leader Benoy Konar, however, insisted that the complaint was genuine. (But) our home secretary doesnt want to proceed further with the case and is looking for a compromise.        
	Two CPM supporters from Sonachura in Nandigram had accused Raj of molesting them during a raid on the election eve.         
	Raj had said he was in a meeting at the Nandigram police station around the time the women claimed they were molested.         
	One of the women later distanced herself from the allegation in a television interview. I dont know anyone by the name of Alok Raj and no jawan of the CRPF molested me. CRPF jawans, however, beat up my brother-in-law, the 32-year-old housewife had said.        
	The complaint filed at Nandigram police station had said: On Saturday night, CRPF jawans entered our house and beat up my husbands brother. When I went to protest, Alok Raj pulled my sari and molested me.        
	Asked about the complaint attributed to her and carrying her purported signature, the woman said: I dont know what complaint has been lodged. The leaders told me to sign a complaint and I followed their orders.         
	Raj was not available for comment today.        
	The home secretary also dismissed the molestation charge against the officer in charge of Nandigram police station. CRPF constable Dimple Sharma had lodged a complaint against OC Debashish Chakraborty, accusing him of calling her names and assaulting her.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Howrah, July 28: A youth today battered his neighbour to death with a crowbar after rain water that had accumulated on the roof of her house fell on his house in Joypur, Howrah.         
	Some villagers rushed to Palas Doluis house, about 80km from Calcutta, and set it on fire. Palas and his family managed to run out.        
	Police arrested Palas, 18, on the charge of killing Sandhya Pramanik, a 32-year-old housewife who was his neighbour.         
	The police said the neighbours always fought about draining out rain water. Today, during a tiff, Palas rushed out of the house with a crowbar and hit Sandhya several times on the head.

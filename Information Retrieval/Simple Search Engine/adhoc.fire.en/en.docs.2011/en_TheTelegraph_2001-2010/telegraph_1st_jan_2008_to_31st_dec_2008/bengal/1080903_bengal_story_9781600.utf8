          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Singur, Sept. 2: Around 250 trucks were allowed to pass through Durgapur Expressway for around three hours from seven this morning.        
	A police officer said the trucks, going towards Calcutta or in the other direction, drove past Mamata Banerjees siege site through one flank of the highway. We allowed the vehicles to pass after talks with the Trinamul Congress leaders. The road was blocked again at 10.10am.         
	The trucks resumed their journey at 11 tonight. The road was open till around 12.30am.        
	Yesterday, 59 trucks, in two batches, had rolled past Singur. A test run was held yesterday morning with four trucks under police protection, which were the first to go through the area since the siege began.         
	We are in touch with the National Highways Authority officials, the police officer said.         
	Hundreds of Calcutta-bound trucks are still stranded on the highway. Most drivers appeared to have run out of patience. We have been here for 10 days. We have no money, no food, said Munna Yadav, whose vehicle is laden with stones.         
	Sunil Kumar Yadavs plight is the same. I could not call up my wife as I have spent all my money on food. I will be thankful to God if they allow vehicles to ply all night today, he said.

	Tamluk, Sept. 11: A mob beat up a CPM panchayat leader after his security guard allegedly thrashed a driver for not allowing them the right of way on National Highway 6.         
	CPM supporters blocked NH 6 and NH 41 in Panskura this evening, demanding the arrest of those who attacked Niranjan Shihi. The blockade was lifted at 11.30pm.         
	Shihi, his guard and the driver were taken to a hospital.

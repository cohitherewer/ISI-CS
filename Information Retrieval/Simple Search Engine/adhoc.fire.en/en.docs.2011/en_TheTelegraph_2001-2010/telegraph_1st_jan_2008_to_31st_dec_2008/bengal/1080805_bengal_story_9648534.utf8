The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Triumvirate in Amars epic
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Triumvirate in Amars epic

	New Delhi, Aug. 4: Amar Singhs Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh have joined hands, courtesy the BJP.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan today joined hands against the BJPs persistence to go full steam ahead on the cash-for-vote scandal that erupted during the trust vote.        
	The bonhomie between Lalu Prasad and Paswan had been seen coming for a while  the two had struck a chord in Parliament even before the BJP MPs sparked the furore.        
	When the Samajwadi Party agreed to back the UPA in the floor test, the possibility of the socialists coming together had become real.        
	These three are like Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. The BJP has to be thanked for getting together north Indias scattered forces, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh said at a news conference.        
	Lalu Prasad and Paswan stood by Mulayam, coming down on the BJP and accusing it of doctoring evidence to malign the Samajwadis.        
	The trio possibly united on an invitation from Mulayam but also in the name of secularism.         
	Amar remarked that his good relations with Arun Jaitley had put a communal blot on the Samajwadi Party but that had been wiped off now.         
	Lalu Prasad and Paswan needed to get their act together to counter Nitish Kumar, whose work in Bihar has made them uncomfortable. The two can now try to garner the minority vote by working together.        
	While Mulayams presence can help Lalu Prasad strengthen his hold on the Yadav vote, Paswan can influence Dalits in Uttar Pradesh to slow down Mayavatis juggernaut.         
	In politics, one and one is eleven, so now we are one hundred and eleven, said RJD MP Devendra Prasad.        
	He said the old socialist forces would revive the golden past that north India prided itself on during the times of Ram Manohar Lohia and Jaiprakash Narayan.

	Calcutta, March 1: Behind an iron curtain, Suchitra Sen today showed the first signs of recovery.        
	After five nights in hospital, her oxygen dependence has come down and blood parameters have improved, said a source, defining her condition as serious but stable.        
	The medical bulletin issued by Belle Vue Clinic this afternoon said: Mrs Suchitra Sens medical condition has improved. Her breathing is better with improvement in her blood oxygen status. However, she still remains on antibiotics, oxygen and other supportive therapy. She is tolerating normal diet orally. She is still under strict observation.        
	That her oxygen dependence has reduced is a positive sign but her condition continues to be serious, the source said.         
	Apart from breathlessness and weakness, the reclusive screen legend is suffering from a pain in the knee. Physiotherapy began today but she is still unable to sit in a chair.        
	On a day that saw elder granddaughter Raima coming down from Mumbai to be with her Amma, the security cordon around ICCU 702 was tightened under the supervision of police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	After spending an hour monitoring security arrangements, the citys top cop said: Somebody from a news channel tried to enter Mrs Sens room on Friday night. The Sens are concerned about her security. We have taken adequate measures and have tightened security. Mrs Sen is our favourite star and we all want her to get well soon. I request you all to co-operate.        
	An immediate fallout was an additional security check on the second floor, stepped-up vigil on the seventh floor and a notice at the reception stating: For security reasons, visitors to the 7th floor are requested not to carry any handbag or packets, including mobile phones. All are requested to co-operate. Any inconvenience caused due to this is regretted.        
	While leaving the hospital at 8pm, daughter Moon Moon said the family was very disturbed by the sneak-in bid.

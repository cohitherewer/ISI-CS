          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Alipurduar, July 22: A Group D employee of a rural hos-pital today stitched the fore-head of a young man who was bleeding from the back of his head and had fallen unconscious.        
	The incident at the Falakata Rural Hospital in Jalpaiguri took place when the on-duty doctor had gone home for lunch around 1pm.        
	Hospital sources, however, said the Group D employee, Vim Kurmi, was the one who usually stitched wounds.        
	Kurmi was apparently sozzled when he tried to treat the patient.        
	Kush Biswas, 20, is yet to regain his consciousness. His mother Saraswati and uncle Rabi have lodged a complaint with the Falakata block medical officer.        
	The officer, Dinesh Biswas, who was in Jalpaiguri today, promised a probe.         
	Kush was cycling home this afternoon when the cycle skidded on a wet road and he fell. The back of his head hit the concrete road and he lost consciousness immediately.        
	Residents of the area, 36km from Alipurduar town, took him to the rural hospital. Kurmi came to attend him.         
	He was intoxicated and started stitching an imaginary wound just above Kushs forehead, though he was bleeding from the back of his head, said Saraswati, who had arrived at the hospital hearing about her sons accident.        
	When I protested, the employee turned angry and said he was the doctor, not me. He told me that if I wanted I could stitch the wound of my son myself. Then he simply left, said Saraswati.         
	By then the mother was wailing. My son was lying without treatment and I started crying. Other hospital employees came running and stitched Kushs head. My son is still unconscious. If anything happens to him, I wont not let that man get away, she said.

	Gede, Feb. 29: The Calcutta-Dhaka train could start running before the Bengali New Year on April 14, Bangladesh army chief Moeen U. Ahmed said today.        
	We are trying our best to start Maitrayee Express before Poila Baisakh, said Ahmed, on a trip to Gede in Nadia.         
	Gede, 150km from Calcutta, will be the last station before the train enters Bangladesh.        
	The project had got stuck over Delhis demand for a fence along 800m of the border on either side. Dhaka has agreed to the fence on the Indian side.

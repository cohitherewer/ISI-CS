          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 29: The CBI is ready with its chargesheet in the Rizwanur Rahman case and will place it in court as soon as the high court allows it to register criminal cases against the seven accused.        
	We only need the courts permission to file the charges, a senior official said from Delhi. We have the evidence to substantiate the charges.        
	The CBI has held deputy commissioner of police Ajoy Kumar, assistant commissioner Sukanti Chakraborty and sub-inspector Krishnendu Das guilty of abetting Rizwanurs suicide. The same charge has been levelled against Rizwanurs father-in-law Ashok Todi, his brother Pradip and relative Anil Saraogi and an associate of the Rahmans, Pappu.         
	The CBI official said: Pappu was paid Rs 11 lakh to break the marriage of Rizwanur and Priyanka Todi.         
	The government has decided to hold in abeyance the promotion of former city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. The court has asked him to explain his statement that the police had done their duty by interfering in Rizwanurs marriage.

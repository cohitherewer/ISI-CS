	Poro (Alipurduar), Feb. 8: A 19-year-old was shot dead by forest guards in the Buxa Tiger Reserve this morning.     
	The guards said they fired pellets from a double-barrel gun at a young man felling a tree. Villagers said Shyamul Rava was a cowherd collecting twigs for firewood. The only child of Padman and Rajbala Rava died on the spot. Amrit, a friend who was with Shyamul, said: They fired without a warning. He was hit on the head.         
	Calcutta: Train services in the Sealdah south section were disrupted for several hours on Friday. For over an hour from 9am, trains were stalled as a rod had fallen on a wire from an overbridge under construction at Baghajatin station.     
	A blockade at Mograhat to demand an extra train crippled services for 90 minutes from 1.12pm. Banana leaves and sleepers were placed on tracks at several places to protest against delays.        
	Calcutta: A Druk Air flight from Bangkok to Paro, Bhutan, via Gaya was diverted to Calcutta on Friday as the pilot could not land in Gaya because of bad weather. The aircraft with 109 passengers landed here at 9.10am, an airport official said. It left Calcutta at 11.10am but could not proceed to Gaya again because of the weather and went to Paro instead.        
	Tamluk: The CBI, which is probing the March 14 police firing in Nandigram, questioned former western range IG Arun Gupta and DIG (Midnapore range) N. Ramesh Babu in Calcutta. It has sought permission from eight CPM leaders questioned on Thursday for their polygraph test.

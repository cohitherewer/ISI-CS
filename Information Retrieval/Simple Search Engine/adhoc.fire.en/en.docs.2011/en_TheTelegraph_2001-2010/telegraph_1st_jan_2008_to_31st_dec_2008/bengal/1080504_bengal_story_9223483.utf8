	Howrah, May 3: A fire ravaged a Howrah jute mill this evening, turning bales of jute to ashes.         
	Officials of the Fort William Jute Mill on Foreshore Road, however, could not give the exact extent of the damage.         
	The flames were first spotted at the packaging department, from where they spread to the rest of the mill, fanned by the Norwester.        
	It became difficult for us to bring the fire under control. The strong winds helped it spread, said Gautam Banerjee, officer in charge of the Howrah fire services department.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoist gunfight
                                                                                                               Maoist gunfight
                            
	Midnapore, Feb. 17: Police fought suspected Maoists in a West Midnapore village last night when the rebels fired on people who had assembled around a slain CPM leaders body.        
	The guerrillas fled into the woods in Banspahari when challenged, but the driver of the Trekker in which Mangal Mahatos body had been brought, took a bullet in his arm.         
	Shukhchand Murmu was arranging the wreaths on the body, brought back by CPM supporters with the help of police escorts.        
	Mahato was shot dead on the way home from a party meeting in neighbouring Bankura on Friday night.         
	A police officer said 26 bullets were exchanged in last nights encounter, which began moments after the convoy reached the village and continued for about half an hour.         
	The Maoists fired around 20 bullets from behind the forest cover and fled when we retaliated, said an officer who had accompanied the body from Bankura.        
	Murmu said: First, I tried to dive into the drivers seat. But I felt a shooting pain and saw my shirtsleeve soaked in blood. Then I threw myself on the ground and crawled behind a shrub.

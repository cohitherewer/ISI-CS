	Durgapur, April 25: A heart bypass surgery was performed in a private hospital in Durgapur today.    
	Government hospitals outside Calcutta do not conduct bypass surgeries. Doctors said they were rare even in private hospitals beyond Calcutta and Howrah. Trader Zulfikar Ali Kapadia, 58, came from Calcutta, 200km away, for the operation at Mission Hospital, which started run- ning in early April.         
	Calcutta: Congress state chief P.R. Das Munshi said on Friday it was impossible to prevent functionaries from forging pacts with the BJP and Trinamul for the rural polls. Panchayat poll pacts do not follow the grammar, he said.        
	Calcutta: A cyclist was run over by a pri- vate bus on BT Road on Friday night. Police identified the victim as Dipan Sahu, 36, an iron dealer.     
	A truck killed a man in his 40s near Koikali in the airport area.        
	Calcutta: The state poll panel may have to requisition a chopper to carry polling personnel to Maoist-hit villages, its secretary, S.N. Roychowdhury, said on Friday. Video cameras will be installed in sensitive booths, he added.

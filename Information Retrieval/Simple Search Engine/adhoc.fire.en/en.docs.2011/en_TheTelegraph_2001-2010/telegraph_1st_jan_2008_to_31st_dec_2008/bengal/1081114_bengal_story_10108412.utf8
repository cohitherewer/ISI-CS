The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Delhi turns down CRPF plea
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Delhi turns down CRPF plea
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 13: The Centre has told the state government that it cannot spare CRPF personnel for Lalgarh and Jhargram with five Assembly elections round the corner, state home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said today.        
	He said the Union home ministry had informed chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb two days ago. The Centre expressed its inability to send the CRPF as they have been deployed in five election-bound states. So, we are deploying state forces in Lalgarh and Jhargram.        
	Chakrabarti said the government had asked for central forces after six companies of CRPF jawans were withdrawn from the Maoist-infested West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia districts in view of the Assembly polls.         
	Raj Kanojia, inspector-general of police, law and order, said six companies of the State Armed Police, Eastern Frontier Rifles and the Indian Reserve Battalion had been despatched to the disturbed areas in West Midnapore.        
	In the city for a CPM event, politburo member Sitaram Yechury said the party had hoped the Centre would co-operate in combating Maoist violence. Naxalite activity is a menace in many states, including Bengal. The Prime Minister himself had called it the biggest threat to the internal security of the country, he said. Even if elections are due in some states and central forces have been deployed there, there are reserve forces which can be used (in Bengal).        
	In a recent article in party organ Peoples Democracy, Yechury had accused the Congress-led Centre of deliberately denying necessary assistance to the state government to combat Maoists, hinting at the partys eagerness to forge ties with the Trinamul Congress.        
	CPM sources said that after tomorrows state secretariat meeting, the party would echo Yechurys charge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Basu vetoes surgery
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Basu vetoes surgery
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 14: Jyoti Basu is likely to be released from hospital on Tuesday, sources said today.        
	Basu himself does not want a surgery (to remove a blood clot in his brain). His family members are also against it, a CPM source said.        
	The party patriarch had been admitted to a south Calcutta hospital last Sunday.        
	 A CT scan done today revealed the clot had not grown further, doctors said.         
	His clinical parameters are within normal limits and he has a normal diet, the hospitals medical bulletin said.         
	A repeat CT scan was also done and the report will be placed before the medical board on Monday morning to decide the further course of action.         
	The 94-year-old former chief minister was hospitalised two days after he hurt himself in a fall at his Salt Lake home.         
	Doctors treating him had suggested a burr-hole surgery to remove the clot.         
	The procedure requires only local anaesthesia and a small incision in the skull to drain out the clot.         
	The party secretariat had decided that the decision on surgery would be left to Basu, a source said.        
	Last Friday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, state CPM chief Biman Bose and politburo member Brinda Karat went to the hospital and explained to Basu the pros and cons of the surgery.         
	After listening to them, Basu said he would not go for the surgery as he was doing fine, the source said. Today, Karat visited Basu again.         
	Basus Salt Lake house, Indira Bhavan, is being renovated. The stairs in the toilet adjoining Basus bedroom have been removed to ensure that he does not have an accident, an Indira Bhavan source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Promise: peaceful Nandi poll
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Promise: peaceful Nandi poll
                            
	Excerpts from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees news conference on Friday              
	Q: Clashes have broken out in Nandigram again. Is this a battle for political space?        
	A: The present confrontation is not similar to what happened there last November.         
	Nothing untoward occurred in Nandigram over the past month or so, and peace was gradually returning. Small skirmishes have been reported but there hasnt been any major clash. Has there been any death?         
	Rumours are spreading fast and prompting people to flee homes or confront each other.         
	Q: Do you think the panchayat polls can be held peacefully in Nandigram?        
	A: There is bitterness (among people) because of the problems Nandigram faced last year, but things have changed radically in the past few months. I assure you peaceful polls.        
	Q: Is it true that Opposition supporters are being threatened?        
	A: The state election commission, which has observers all over, never said people could not file nominations because of fear or intimidation. If the Opposition doesnt have candidates, what can we do? I shouldnt predict, but we hope to win all the zilla parishads.        
	Q: The Maoist menace is a big worry. Several people, including CPM supporters, are being killed. What action do you plan to take?        
	A: It would have been good had they joined mainstream politics, but they took to violence, which cant be tolerated.         
	Their presence, however, is limited to some 15 villages in Purulia, seven-eight in West Midnapore and about five in Bankura.         
	Q: You must have seen governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi switching off Raj Bhavan lights.        
	A: The power situation here is far better than other states. Investors would not stop coming because of stray power cuts resulting from technical failures.         
	Q: Your ministers have criticised the governor. Dont you have anything to say?        
	A: No.        
	Q: Do you want the governors post to be abolished?        
	A: I wont discuss this here. There is a panel to look into Centre-state relations. Our party will submit its views once it starts functioning.         
	Q: The Opposition is still not agreeing to talk to you on industrialisation. Why?        
	A: If the leader of the principal Opposition party doesnt want to see my face, it would hardly bother me but it does matter when it affects the states interests. How can the state progress without co-operation? I always wanted a consensus on industrialisation but it didnt happen.        
	Q: Do you advocate takeover of farmland for industry?        
	A: Our objective is to take mono-crop or less fertile tracts. But if we are forced to take fertile land, can we say there is no need for industry?         
	Q: Whats the solution?        
	A: Our aim is to ensure proper compensation and rehabilitation for landlosers and that the food output doesnt fall.         
	Industrialisation has to continue. There hasnt been any problem with the seven steel plants coming up in Bengal or the shipbuilding yard in Mahisadal where people expressed their approval in writing.         
	In Singur, a section of the people opposed (the car plant), while we hurried up things in Nandigram. Singur and Nandigram are exceptions.        
	Q: Your Left Front partners are making all sorts of noises.... How do you take it?        
	A: Our vision about industrialisation and the states progress is clear. Others may have slightly different views but discussions can always be held. Those who are not realising (the need for industry) now would understand later.         
	Q: Is the same applicable to intellectuals who are taking to the streets on Nandigram?        
	A: I should tell you that an overwhelming majority of cultural personalities is with our government.        
	Q: But you are being criticised by intellectuals.        
	A: Tumi adham bole aami uttam hobo na keno (you may be inferior but how can that prevent me from being superior).

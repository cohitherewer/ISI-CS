                                                                                                               Clash at acquisition meeting 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Feb. 15: CPM supporters allegedly beat up members of a Trinamul Cong- ress-led save-farmland forum when they tried to attend a meeting on land acquisition for a power plant in Katwa.        
	Police said all mainline parties had been invited and the CPM leaders present did not want the Krishi Jomi Khet Majur Banchao Committee members at the meeting that Trinamul had boycotted.        
	They beat us up with sticks and warned us against attending the hearing. Fifteen of us were injured. One of them was hospitalised, said Tapan Ghosh, the secretary of the committee who barged into the meeting venue.         
	A large police force led by the Katwa officer-in-charge dispersed the warring groups.        
	Ghosh vowed not to allow farmland acquisition for the 1,000-acre plant.        
	Local Congress MLA Rabindranath Chatterjee criticised the administration for not calling the committee to the meeting where officials explained the acquisition process and how landlosers would benefit from the project.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mini tie-up on cards
                                                                                                            Mini tie-up on cards
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ashok Ghosh                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 8: The Forward Bloc, RSP and the CPI today said they would not accept the CPMs surrender to big capital.        
	We are not opposed to industrialisation per se. But we wont accept the surrender to the whims of the corporate empires. Neither will we accept the chief ministers line that there is no alternative to the capitalist model in the given situation, RSP central secretariat member Manoj Bhattacharya said.        
	The outburst came a day after CPM general secretary Prakash Karat pulled up the RSP for its confused criticism of Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.         
	The Forward Bloc, the RSP and the CPI  the triumvirate known as a mini-front within the ruling Left Front  met at the Bloc office today.         
	The allies want to contest the forthcoming panchayat polls together but without the CPM.         
	With the Bloc having decided to go it alone, the RSP and the CPI today tried to convince it to reconsider its decision.        
	RSP ministers Kshiti Goswami and Biswanath Choudhury and the CPIs Nandagopal Bhattacharya and Manju Majumdar requested Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh to agree to a joint fight.        
	Ghosh said the go-alone policy had been recently adopted by his partys state council. But he didnt rule out the possibility of an alliance of our three parties and said he would discuss it with the party, a Bloc leader said.        
	Although still reluctant to sever ties with the CPM, the mini- front today staked claim to the legacy of the original Left Front.         
	We have been accused of trying to break or weaken the Left Front. But I must declare on behalf of the three parties that we are the Left Front, Ghosh said.        
	We wont allow any particular party to run the front and government in our name and impose its decisions on us, ignoring our opinions.        
	The Bloc leader, however, would not call this an ultimatum to the CPM. RSP and CPI leaders, too, said they were not considering the option of leaving the front right now since the alternative Left forum is yet to develop.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The smashed school bus. (Palash Debnath)                                  
	Bethuadahari, June 1: A school bus with 45 children hit a truck while overtaking another bus and overturned in Nadia this morning.         
	The condition of five students who suffered head injuries, one of the two teachers accompanying the children to a quiz contest and the driver is said to be serious.        
	The students of the Don Bosco School in Azimgunj, Murshidabad, were heading to Krishnagar when the mishap occurred on National Highway 34 in the Nakashipara area of Nadia, about 150km from Calcutta.        
	The seven with serious injuries and the other teacher have been admitted to the Shaktinagar District Hospital.         
	The others are at the Bethuadahari rural hospital with broken limbs and cracked skulls. Many of them are on saline drips.        
	Many boys and girls were lying on the floor at the rural hospital, which has only 20 beds.        
	The principal of the Don Bosco School in Manigram, also in Murshidabad, visited the children and promised to bear the medical expenses.        
	The principal of the Azimgunj school, who was in Jalpaiguri, has started for Krishnagar, said an official of the Krishnagar diocese, which controls the Azimgunj and Manigram Schools.         
	Nadia police said the 50-seat school bus was racing the Siliguri-Calcutta bus.         
	Busy speeding, the school bus driver had not seen the Siliguri-bound mustard oil-laden lorry coming from the opposite direction, said district superintendent of police H.K. Kusumakar.        
	Class IX student Michael Hansda, whose head was swathed in bandages, said the driver had ignored their repeated pleas to go slow. Our bus was travelling at a high speed even after we warned the driver against speeding. It rammed into the lorry and overturned.         
	The bus fell into a roadside ditch after a couple of somersaults.        
	Hearing the crash, local people rushed in and sent the injured to hospital on passing vehicles. They later helped police lift the bus from the ditch.        
	We dont know how we are still alive. There was a deafening sound and darkness descended on me as I lost consciousness. Many of us would have died if the local people had not rushed to our rescue, said Santana Soren, a Class X student.        
	Father Chandan Biswas of the Krishnagar church, who was in charge of the Bible quiz, said the programme has been called off.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         CPM calls for force in Katwa 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Oct. 5: The Burdwan CPM leadership today urged the government to speed up its process of land acquisition in Katwa for the proposed 1320MW power plant and pleaded with the administration to start issuing compensation cheques.        
	The power plant will be set up in Katwa at any cost. We have lost the Nano project in Singur but the people of Katwa dont want to lose the power plant here. The government should start acquiring land soon. If any resistance comes, we will handle it with our cadres and not with police, party district secretary Amal Haldar told a rally in Katwa town, about 180km from Calcutta.         
	The rally was organised in support of the project for which a majority of the farmers have refused to give up their land.         
	However, Haldar said only a handful of farmers were not willing. We will have to convince the farmers, but if they dont change their mind, the government should go for forcible acquisition. The land acquisition act does not give (owners) the option of being willing or unwilling. We will not allow the government to shift the project from Katwa, Haldar thundered.         
	In the first phase of acquisition, 55 of the 403 farmers called for hearing gave their consent. Over 1,000 acres belonging to 4,600 farmers are required for the project.        
	Power minister Mrinal Banerjee had recently ruled out the possibility of forcible ac- quisition and said the project might be shifted to Sagardighi (in Murshidabad) or any other suitable location if the Katwa farmers did not want to part with their land.         
	The Trinamul Congress has already pledged support to the Katwa farmers and threatened a Singur-like agitation if the government tries to acquire land forcibly.         
	The Trinamul general secretary in Burdwan, Azizul Mondal, said if the CPM continued to be aggressive on Katwa, it would lead to confrontation. They (the CPM leaders) will be responsible if there is a bloodbath.        
	District officials said they had submitted a report to the government on the situation. We will now do whatever we are told  shelve the acquisition plan or go ahead, a Burdwan official said.

	Calcutta, Dec. 10: Sunderbans tigers claimed their sixth victim this year when Mohammed Mondal was attacked this afternoon.         
	He was collecting crabs on the bank of the Matla over 220km from Calcutta when the animal pounced on him. It could not drag him away as other fishermen raised the alarm. Mondal, 45, was declared dead at a health centre 70km away.

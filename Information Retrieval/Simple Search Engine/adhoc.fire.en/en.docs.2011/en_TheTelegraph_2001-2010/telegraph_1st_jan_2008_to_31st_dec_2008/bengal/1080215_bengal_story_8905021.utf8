The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Front fights over RS seats
                                                                                                               Front fights over RS seats
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 14: The Left Front is squabbling again, this time over Rajya Sabha seats.        
	The CPM is likely to re-nominate former Calcutta mayor Prasanta Chatterjee and Cooch Behar leader Tarini Roy to the Upper House, where five seats from Bengal fell vacant in early April.         
	Nadias Khabiruddin Ahmed may, however, have to make way for another minority leader in the CPM.        
	The remaining two seats have become the bone of contention among the partners. The CPI and the Socialist Party (SP) are eyeing the seats to be left vacant by Forward Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas and Trinamul Congresss Dinesh Trivedi, both of whom are set to complete their terms.         
	With Mamata Banerjee deciding to go it alone this time, the front is confident of wresting the Trinamul seat.        
	The sixth seat, occupied by the RSPs Aboni Roy, is yet to fall vacant.         
	According to the front norm, the CPM gets three seats, while the Bloc and the RSP have two permanent seats. The CPI and the SP are now clamouring for their share.         
	Is it justified not to give the CPI any representation from Bengal? asked party leader Gurudas Dasgupta, who had been Rajya Sabha member in 1995-2000.        
	Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh, however, ruled out giving up the partys seat for the CPI or the SP. Our general secretarys RS seat is permanent as is that of the RSP. There is no question of leaving either seat, he said.

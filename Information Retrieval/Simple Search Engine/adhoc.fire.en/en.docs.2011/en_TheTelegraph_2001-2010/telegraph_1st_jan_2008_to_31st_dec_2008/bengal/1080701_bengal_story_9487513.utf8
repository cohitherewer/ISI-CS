	Islampur, June 30: A man flung his four-month-old daughter in front of a truck in North Dinajpur this morning following a tiff with his wife.        
	Police said Siddhanta Biswas, a vegetable vendor in Chakulia, got into an argument with his wife after she refused to give him money for liquor.         
	Soon after the argument, Siddhanta snatched the girl from her mothers lap and ran outside to the highway.         
	He threw the child towards the onrushing truck, which crushed her to death, the police said.        
	Siddhanta had got married to Rupali 15 years ago and the two had four children  two boys aged 10 and five and a four-year-old girl besides the infant.         
	Ten-year-old Sanjoy, who ran after his father and saw what he did, was in shock as he sat on a bench in the Chakulia police station. Please make sure that my father is punished, he told the police.        
	Siddhanta has regular fights with his wife over drinking, an officer said.        
	Neighbours said he often beat up Rupali and the children. He also apparently suspected her of having an affair.

	Krishnagar, April 4: Nadia police last night arrested seven wanted Maoists from different parts of the district and found a cache of arms, including a sten gun, buried in a field.        
	The villagers in whose houses the rebels were found have been detained.         
	Among the rebels in the net is Prashanta Das, 35, a resident of Beleghata in Calcutta and the secretary of the CPI (Maoist) zonal committee, the police said.        
	The rest are either members of the committee or the outfits action squad.         
	They have all been with the organisation for the last eight to 10 years and had come to Nadia last month to plan an attack here, district superintendent of police H.K. Kusumakar said.         
	He added that Somen, the CPI (Maoist) state secretary arrested earlier this year, had revealed the identities of the seven and their roles.        
	After interrogating the seven hardcore Maoists, the police said they had come to know about many other members of the organisation. We will begin raids and wipe out the Maoist network in the district, Kusumakar said.        
	After the rebels were held last night, they told the police where they had hidden their weapons.         
	Six firearms and 76 rounds of ammunition were dug out of a field at Porgachha. Among them were two .303 rifles that had been snatched from policemen in Kotwali last August.        
	We also seized an improvised .315 musket, two .38 bore revolvers and one 9mm sten gun. Of the two revolvers, one is a service revolver, which does not belong to Nadia police, Kusumakar said.        
	The police also seized a hit list, which had the names of several CPM leaders from Nadia and its adjoining areas.

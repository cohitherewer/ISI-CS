	Tamluk, May 26: The Citu-affiliated union at Haldia Petro today asked the management to clarify within 48 hours its stand on the arrears in the retrenchment benefit of 176 security guards on contract.         
	According to a pact, the benefit is payable in lumpsum to the workers when the contractor is changed. The dues are to be paid from 2001, but Citu wants them from 1996.         
	If the management does not let us know its stand in 48 hours, we will decide our course of action, said Ashok Patnaik, a Citu leader.         
	The union had called a strike at HPL on April 8 demanding permanent employment of 184 contract workers. It was put off following the intervention of senior CPM leaders.

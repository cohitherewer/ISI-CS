	Shalboni, Feb. 10: A woman was bludgeoned to death by one of her sons as the other held on to her while her daughter and husband looked on because they believed she was possessed by an evil spirit.        
	Police in West Midnapores Shalboni said Krishna Ghoshs elder son Biplab, 28, a tantrik, had proclaimed that all her blood had to be drained to free her from the demon.         
	Biplab, his brother Bikash, father Chittaranjan and sister Aparna have been arrested.        
	Biplab told the police he hit his mother on the head with a grinding stone in front of a picture of goddess Kali.        
	Manoranjan Ghosh, who lives next door at Tilaboni village, about 160km from Calcutta, said he avoided his elder brother Chittaranjan and his family because of their quarrelsome nature.        
	Around 10 last night, I heard a groan from his house and peeped through a crack in their window. I saw Krishna lying naked on her back. Biplab, also naked, was sitting on her chest and battering her with a stone. Bikash, who was also without clothes, was holding her feet. Chittaranjan and Aparna were in a corner of the room, said Manoranjan.        
	He nearly fell unconscious at the sight. I recovered my self and ran to neighbour Prasanta Ghoshs house. He, too, saw what was happening. As blood flowed from the womans body, Biplab shouted look the devil is leaving, Manoranjan said.        
	It was Manoranjan who called the police and a team arrived around 11.30pm.        
	Deputy superintendent of police K.P. Barui said Biplab kept saying dont meddle with me. He tried to say a spirit would possess him soon and he would bring back his mother. Both brothers confessed to us that they had tried to exorcise their mother, said Barui.        
	Gurudev Narayan Mondal, who lives at Omrapota village in Goaltore in the same district, had allegedly asked the brothers to exorcise Krishna, 43. We are looking for the guru. Biplab also requested us that he be allowed to go to his mothers body naked and chant mantras. We did not allow it, a police officer said.        
	The Ghoshes have a small piece of land, which they till. The brothers had dropped out of school after Class VIII.         
	Ganja (cannabis) and a bottle of country liquor were found in the house.

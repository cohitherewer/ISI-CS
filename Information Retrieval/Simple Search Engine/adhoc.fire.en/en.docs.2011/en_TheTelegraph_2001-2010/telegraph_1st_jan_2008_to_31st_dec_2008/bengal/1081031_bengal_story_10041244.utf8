          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab: Tehran calls                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 30: Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee has dropped out of the inauguration of the Jindal steel project at Salboni on Sunday, the second Congress leader to do so.         
	Mukherjee, who hails from the state, cant make it to the foundation stone laying ceremony as he will be in Tehran this weekend.        
	The project has so far steered clear of controversies usually associated with investment  land acquisition, too, has been event-free  but its brush with VIPs had not been so smooth.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had invited Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to inaugurate the plant in February. The foundation stone was to be laid in early March.        
	However, the Prime Minister could not make it to the state then, though he flagged off two steel expansion projects in neighbouring Jharkhand in April.        
	The Prime Ministers inability to visit the state had come in the middle of the stand-off between the Congress and the Left parties over the nuclear deal.        
	The inauguration of the Rs 35,000-crore Jindal project, which aims to produce 10 million tonnes of steel and power in phases, was deferred to the latter part of the year.        
	But before that, the Left walked out of the UPA and the Trinamul Congress agitation forced Tata Motors to dump Bengal. With the Lok Sabha elections round the corner, the Congress saw reason in siding with Mamata Banerjees Singur campaign.         
	Sources said Mukherjees Tehran visit had come as a blessing in disguise for the local Congress which otherwise would have had to watch silently as its veteran leader graced an occasion with which the Left Front hopes to gain some face lost in Singur.        
	Bhattacharjee will lay the foundation stone on November 2 in the presence of state industries minister Nirupam Sen, Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan and civil aviation minister Praful Patel.        
	The global financial crisis and a fall in demand for steel are expected to hit all major projects in India. Mittal Steel, the worlds largest steel company, too, is reviewing its expansion plans in different countries, including India.        
	However, Sajjan Jindals JSW Bengal braved the storm and decided to kick off the Salboni project, albeit in a truncated form.

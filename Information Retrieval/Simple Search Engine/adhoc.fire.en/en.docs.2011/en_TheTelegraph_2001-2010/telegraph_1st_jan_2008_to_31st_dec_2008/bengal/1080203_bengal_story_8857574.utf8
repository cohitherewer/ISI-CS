     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Feb. 2: A wheelchair-bound passenger from Bangladesh was today mistakenly taken to the domestic terminal by an airline without immigration and customs checks. 
    
	Jet Airways has been showcaused by immigration authorities for the alleged breach of security. 
    
	Sahida Rashida, 71, was going from Dhaka to Chennai through Calcutta for treatment. She was with three family members, two of whom had also been provided with wheelchairs by the airline. 
    
	They arrived at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport by Jets Dhaka-Calcutta flight at 5.15pm and were scheduled to take an 8.10pm plane of the same airline to Chennai.
    
	Before entering the domestic terminal, an international passenger has to undergo immigration and customs clearance. 
    
	An airport official said: Rashida was taken from Bay 42 (where the aircraft was parked) on wheelchair straight to the domestic terminal. She protested and asked the airline employee pushing the chair why she did not undergo the immigration and customs clearance.
    
	The employee allegedly did not pay heed to her. Rashida then asked him to take her to the airport managers office. 
    
	The airport authorities arranged her clearance and she was again taken to the international terminal. 
    
	We have asked the airline to explain why such a lapse took place, a senior immigration official said. 
    
	Jet officials attributed the mistake to confusion. There were two wheelchairs at the international terminal and the third had to be requisitioned from the domestic terminal, an official said. 
    
	We have both domestic and international operations. The loader (employee pushing the wheelchair) mistook the flight to be a domestic one and so he mistakenly took her away without the necessary clearance.
    
	The three others in Rashidas group faced no problem with their checks.

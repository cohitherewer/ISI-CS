The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mittal shrugs off Singur effect
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mittal shrugs off Singur effect
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: The worlds largest steel-maker, ArcelorMittal, has no plan to review investment plans in India because of the tension over land acquisition in Singur.         
	Steel tycoon Lakshmi Niwas Mittal told newspersons here: Singur cannot be an example. One can face this kind of problem in any other country.... The country as a whole is interested in growing.         
	The Calcutta-educated British-resident billionaires statement came after infotech giant Infosys said it was terrified of entering Bengal.        
	Singur has changed everything. If land promised by a sovereign state government cannot be handed over to a corporate house because of a group of people who are out to settle political scores, then it is not a conducive atmosphere for bringing in investments, T.V. Mohandas Pai, director (human resources), Infosys, had said.        
	The Trinamul Congress-led agitation for return of 400 acres from the 1,000-acre Singur project, seen as one that could help rejuvenate Bengals industrial climate, long considered by industrialists to be hostage to strikes and protests, has left many industrialists worried.         
	Chambers of commerce have expressed apprehensions about the lack of clarity on a settlement  between the government and the Opposition  on Singur reached over the weekend.         
	Mittal, who has planned steel mills in Jharkhand and Orissa, a state plagued by similar agitations against land acquisition, indicated that his firm was committed to its investments in India, which could go up to $30 billion because of bureaucratic delays and cost over-runs.         
	The London-headquartered group has planned relief and rehabilitation efforts for tribals whose land is being acquired for the iron and coal mines that will feed the steel plants.         
	We are having regular dialogues with different panchayats, tehsils, and concerned people along with NGOs to explain what the policies are, how this will benefit their livelihood and future, and how they will participate. Such discussions will reduce peoples anxiety and motivate and excite them about (our) projects, Mittal said.         
	Analysts said the Mittals had taken a lesson from the agitation against Poscos steel plant in Orissa and made huge arrangements for relief and rehabilitation efforts to win over local people.         
	The steel magnate, who has also made large investments in petrochemicals in the country, said that as part of corporate social responsibility, ArcelorMittal was undertaking projects in education, health and training.         
	We are talking about future growth, employment for their (local) families and satisfactory relief and rehabilitation.

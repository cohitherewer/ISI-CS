The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Priya slams quit threats
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Priya slams quit threats

	Singur, Sept. 28: Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today criticised the Tatas for frequently threatening to leave Singur.        
	The Tatas should not frequently threaten to leave Bengal. You (the Tatas) have taken a decision to set up a factory in Singur and so you will have to stay, he told a rally at Singurs Gopalnagar.        
	Das Munshi, the state Congress president, said he would meet the Tata management and request them not to leave Singur.         
	I will also urge them to pressure the state government to better the compensation package. The Tatas, too, have a responsibility. If Ratan Tata today says he wants to leave because of the agitation, that is not right. If the Tatas leave Singur, it will become a shashan (graveyard), he said.        
	Das Munshi would lead a delegation to governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi tomorrow and request him to again take the initiative to end the Singur stalemate. I will urge the governor to take another initiative to resolve the crisis in Singur and call an all-party meeting. I will also request him to make the Tatas understand that they cant leave Singur just like that.         
	The information and bro- adcasting minister came down heavily on the state government for signing the September 7 agreement with Mamata Banerjee. The chief minister has accused the Opposition of going back on its word after the agreement. But how could the industries minister sign a deal that said maximum land would be provided from inside the project area and the remaining would be acquired and given to farmers from outside? If maximum land is given from the project area, ancillary units cant come up, he said.        
	The deal had said land to the maximum would be provided from within the project area.        
	Das Munshi advised Mamata Banerjee: Think twice before taking a drastic step. Make sure the Left Front does not get a campaign plank for the Lok Sabha polls.... They will say it is because of Trinamul that industries have fled Bengal. Please dont hand this weapon to the Left.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Nov. 9: About 20 villagers beat up a doctor and ransacked a rural hospital following the death of a patient in Murshidabad district last night.         
	Maiful Sheikh, a resident of Nabagram, said his elder brother Kajem, 52, was admitted to the block hospital after he complained of stomach pain last evening. We admitted him under doctor Santanu Mondal. He examined Kajem, wrote a prescription, then left the hospital, said Maiful.        
	Around 8pm, Kajems stomach began to swell. We rushed to the doctor who was in his quarters on the hospital premises, but he refused to come as his hours were over. He told us that block medical officer of health Atindranath Mondal was on duty, said Maiful.        
	But Atindranath was not around. When the villagers told Santanu about this, he referred Kajem to Behrampore General Hospital, but he died on the way. The villagers returned and ransacked the block hospital. They also broke into Santanus house and thrashed him.         
	The doctor and Maiful have lodged police complaints.

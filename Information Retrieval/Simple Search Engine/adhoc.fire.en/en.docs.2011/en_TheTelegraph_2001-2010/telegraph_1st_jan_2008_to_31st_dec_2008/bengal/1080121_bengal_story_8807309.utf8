	Calcutta, Jan. 20: Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee today ruled out the formation of the Second State Re-organisation Commission to look into the demand for state- hood in the Darjeeling hills.        
	A false campaign in this regard is going on in Darjeeling, Mukherjee told a news conference here.        
	A bill to confer special status on Darjeeling under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution is with a select committee. Outfits opposed to Subhash Ghisinghs GNLF had been opposing the bill and demanding the new state.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 3: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the CPMs Left Front partners were being misled by the Oppositions campaign against industrialisation.
    
	They (the allies) have failed to understand the governments clear intention to acquire land to set up industries and provide jobs to youths, the chief minister said at a programme to mark the 42nd anniversary of CPM mouthpiece Ganashakti.
    
	He stressed the need to remove the partners misgivings about the governments policy on industrialisation.
    
	Bhattacharjees comments came a day after a reduced vote share soured the CPMs victory in the Balagarh bypolls. Front disunity, which has become apparent of late, was seen as a reason for the drop in support. 
    
	But the chief minister reiterated that industrialisation was the need of the hour, a stand that remains a thorn in the CPMs ties with allies.
    
	Industrialists are queuing up to invest in Bengal. How can I ask them to go back? What will I explain to our future generation? he asked.

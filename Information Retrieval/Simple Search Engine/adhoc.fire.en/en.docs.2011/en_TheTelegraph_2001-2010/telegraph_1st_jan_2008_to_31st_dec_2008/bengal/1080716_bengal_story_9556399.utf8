                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tusker kills tea worker
                            
	Alipurduar, July 15: A man who slipped and fell in front of a tusker while trying to flee a marauding herd was picked up and hurled to the ground last night.        
	Juel Minj, 43, died on the way to the hospital.        
	Foresters said the lure of liquor and encroachments on elephant corridors had made jumbo attacks frequent.        
	On Sunday, a tusker had thrown a man and trampled him before being chased by 2,000 people and cornered in a jute field for 10 hours.        
	Chief conservator of forests N.C. Bahuguna said the number of elephant squads had to be increased. But the big problem is that elephant corridors have been encroached upon and forests have become fragmented. Elephants are also known to raid huts for handia, the local liquor made from rice, he added.        
	Two tuskers, three females and two calves entered Nangdala Tea Garden last night.

	July 22: The students of IIT Kharagpur lunched in peace today with the unions agreeing to put their agitation on hold and the hostel messes working normally.        
	Trouble had erupted over a demand to absorb contract labourers in three of the five messes that had been handed over to private caterers this year.        
	Over 250 residents of the Jagadish Chandra Bose hall had to make do with food from snack canteens on the campus yesterday as the caterer closed shop after some of its employees were bashed up by members of a joint forum of the CPM and CPI labour arms.        
	The authorities requested us to put our protest on hold as the convocation is scheduled on July 25 and a lot of people will come for it. They have promised to consider our demands after the first week of August, said Manoj Dhar, the president of the Hall Workers Union.        
	Another union, that of temporary construction workers, also wants its members absorbed. Secretary Purnendu Panigrahi said the agitation had been deferred till the first week of August.        
	It is a relief. The new students have started coming and guests are expected for the convocation, said dean of students affairs D.K. Tripathi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | State demand
                                                                                                            State demand
                            
	Calcutta, Jan. 27: The RSP today warned that greater autonomy to the Darjeeling hills under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution may fuel the demand for separate states across north Bengal.         
	PWD minister Kshiti Goswami said the Centre and the state should consult constitutional experts before amending the Constitution. The Sixth Schedule was meant to safeguard the rights and autonomy of tribals. But its extension to a language group in the hills has made tribals and other ethnic groups like Rajbangshis restive. We have to see to it that it does not pave the way for the division of Bengal.

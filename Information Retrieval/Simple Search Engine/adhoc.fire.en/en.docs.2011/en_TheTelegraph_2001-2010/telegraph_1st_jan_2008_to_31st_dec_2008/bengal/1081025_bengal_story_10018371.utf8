          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Santiniketan, Oct. 24: A research scholar in Visva-Bharati has lodged a complaint with the registrar, accusing her guide of misbehaviour.        
	The woman, in her 20s and doing research in anthropology, has also met vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray.        
	The complaint, which reached registrar Monimukut Mitra on Tuesday, alleges that the professor had pushed the research scholar when she had boarded a Howrah-bound train on October 3.        
	He entered the compartment and pushed me. He told me I couldnt go home. He also threatened to get my research project cancelled. He has been misbehaving with me since July, she said.

	Calcutta, Sept. 28: A police officer suffered serious head injuries when the rear wheels of a packed bus came off on north Calcuttas Bhupen Bose Avenue tonight.         
	Assistant sub-inspector Karali Charan Halder, who was standing near the rear gate, was thrown off the bus. He was heading to the Hastings police station for night duty.        
	The Barrackpore Cantonment resident would have got down from the Howrah-bound bus at Esplanade and taken another one to reach office. He has been admitted to a nursing home near Shyambazar.        
	The bus driver has been arrested.

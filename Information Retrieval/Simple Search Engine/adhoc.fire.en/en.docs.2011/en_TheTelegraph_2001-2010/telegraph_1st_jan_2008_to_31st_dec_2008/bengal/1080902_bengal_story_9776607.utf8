The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM not keen on umpire Gandhi
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CPM not keen on umpire Gandhi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 1: The chief minster may have welcomed the governors initiative to end the Singur impasse but his party appeared cold to the possibility of Gopalkrishna Gandhi playing mediator.         
	So far as we know, he (the governor) is himself not interested and would prefer an independent mediator. So why should we ask him to take the responsibility? a CPM state secretariat member asked.         
	We wont name the third party. Let Mamata do so first, he added.        
	The CPMs allies feel the governor will be reluctant to be the arbitrator because of his strained relations with the CPM.         
	The CPM is keeping mum on the governors move just because he is goading Mamata to the talks table. But the party has indicated to us that Gandhi wont be acceptable to it. The governor knows it well, a senior Left Front leader and minister said.         
	As the government and the CPM want to continue their political moves parallel to the Raj Bhavans apolitical one, the front will meet tomorrow to take stock of the situation and finalise its decision on an all-party meeting.         
	In an apparent bid to per- suade the Congress not to join Mamata, the chief minister said this evening that he had already spoken to its state president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and legislature party leader Manas Bhuniya over the all-party meeting.         
	He is yet to speak to the Trinamul Congress.         
	The all-party meeting will be held even if Trinamul refuses to attend it, a CPM leader said.        
	The shadow of Singur hovered on the Lefts anti-imperialist rally today.         
	Front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose renewed the appeal for talks and a negotiated settlement, but contested Mamatas claim that 400 acres belonged to unwilling farmers.         
	Owners of 254 acres are genuinely unwilling, he said. Another 51 acres are tangled in legal disputes.

	Calcutta, April 5: In her semi-conscious state, Runu Das can barely keep her eyes open. But they dont tire of searching for her only son.         
	The 23-year-old, five months pregnant, was on her way to her parents home in Rajarhat with five-year-old Subho when tragedy struck.        
	Where is my son? I want to see him, she keeps asking her relatives and doctors at the New Life Nursing Home at Baguiati.        
	Her family doesnt have the heart to tell her that Subho is dead. She might not be able to bear the shock, and that might affect her unborn child.         
	Tests done at the nursing home revealed that the foetus had not suffered any damage.         
	We have told her that he was admitted in the nursing home yesterday but went home today, said Manik Khamrui, Runus brother.        
	Rahim Mondol, 55, has lost three members of his family but knows of only one.        
	He knows about his wife Asma Bibi but we havent told him that his two granddaughters, Hena and Neha, have died, too, said Rafiq Mondol, a relative.         
	Rahim was taken to Apex Nursing Home along with four other injured. Doctors said they were on their way to recovery, but the trauma is proving tough to get over.         
	Apex manager Saibal Sen today announced that the nursing home would bear the cost of treating all the accident victims.         
	Sumana Mahapatra, in her mid-30s, was shifted from a private nursing home to Apollo Gleneagles after her condition became critical. She is on ventilator and in a state of deep shock, said a hospital official.

	Calcutta, Sept. 18: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state CPM secretary Biman Bose briefed party general secretary Prakash Karat on the Singur stand-off this morning.         
	Karat was in the city to visit Jyoti Basu, who was released from hospital on Tuesday. Accompanied by Bose, he called on the party patriarch after the Alimuddin Street meeting and left for Delhi in the afternoon.        
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen was not present at the meeting with Karat, fuelling speculation about his differences with the chief minister over the Singur agreement reached at Raj Bhavan on September 7.        
	The party has of late been showing signs of a crack over the leaders attitude towards the Tatas. Bhattacharjee, Bose and some other members of the state secretariat are said to be unhappy with the companys delay in resuming work at the Singur site. While the chief minister, who is in touch with the Tatas, yesterday expressed hope that work would restart as early as possible, Sen today declined comment on the matter.         
	Among the party secretariat members who attended the morning meeting with Karat was housing minister Gautam Deb. The minister had been present at the last round of the failed talks between Bhattacharjee and Mamata, in Nandan, and had played the role of a backroom emissary with the Trinamul Congress camp.        
	According to sources, Karat advised caution in handling the situation so that Mamata did not get an opportunity to renew violence like she had done in Nandigram.         
	In public, however, Karat was tight-lipped. The state government is trying to do whatever is needed to resolve the Singur problem, was all that he told reporters.         
	He denied discussing the impasse with Basu. Bose said they spoke about national and international issues.         
	The CPM politburo will take stock of the Singur situation before a three-day session of the partys central committee begins on October 12 in Calcutta.

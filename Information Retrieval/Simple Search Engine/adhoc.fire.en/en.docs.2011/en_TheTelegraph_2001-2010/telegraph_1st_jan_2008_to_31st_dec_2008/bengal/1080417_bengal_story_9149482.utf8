          OUR BUREAU                              
	April 6: On the last day of filing nominations for the first two phases of the panchayat polls, the Left Front won three blocks almost uncontested.        
	The Opposition had not put up candidates in Garbeta Block I and Keshpur, which was once the site of a bloody battle for supremacy between the CPM and the Trinamul Congress.         
	In Khejuri, adjoining Nandigram, front leaders were the lone candidates in a large number of seats.        
	The CPM also won five Nadia gram panchayat seats uncontested.        
	While the Opposition blamed a CPM-run terror campaign for failing to put up candidates in Keshpur and Garbeta, the CPM said the rivals had backed out because they had no popular support and, in some places, no suitable candidate.         
	The Trinamul Congress and other Opposition parties said the number of uncontested seats would go up once the final nomination reports pour in tomorrow.         
	The CPM is not allowing our candidates to file nominations in many places, particularly at the gram panchayat level. In the last panchayat polls, too, the Opposition could not file nominations in more than 20,000 seats, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee said.        
	In Keshpur and Garbeta, the CPM retained their hold over the two panchayat samitis and all the gram panchayats. In a rerun of the 2003 panchayat polls, the CPM made a clean sweep of 199 gram panchayat seats and 45 panchayat samiti seats in Keshpur.         
	West Midnapore Trinamul president Mrigen Maity alleged that his party had received threats from local CPM leaders.        
	We could not find any candidate for Keshpur and Garbeta. We tried to persuade some party members but CPM activists threatened out party members with dire consequences if they filed nominations, Maity said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Metro MD Martin Dlouhy on Monday. (Kishor Roychowdhury)                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 23: Metro Cash amp; Carry will take a call on its Bengal operations on Thursday, though agriculture minister Naren De asked the company today to wait till the weekend.        
	Managing director of Metro India Martin Dlouhy and Henry Birr, vice-president (international relations) Metro Group, met De today.         
	They will call on the chief minister tomorrow.        
	The German wholesalers Rs 140crore establishment on EM Bypass employing 350 people is sitting idle as Des party, the Forward Bloc, has denied it the licence to trade in farm products.        
	After the 40-minute meeting at Des Writers Buildings office, Dlouhy said: We had a very factual and fact-based meeting with the minister, Naren De. We are planning to have one more meeting with the chief minister tomorrow. After these meetings, we will decide on our next steps on Thursday and inform about our decision on how to proceed.        
	However, De said Metro had to wait till Sunday, when the Bloc and the CPM meet to sort out the impasse.         
	He said Metro had not told him about taking any decision on Thursday. I told them I cant tell you anything just now. I have got your papers and read them.        
	The minister admitted that there was no legal bar to the company getting the licence. It is a political decision. It is not a government decision. I am a minister of the Left Front and Ill abide by the fronts decision. That will be cleared by Sunday, he added.        
	Later in the evening, Metro issued a written statement that said: Our meeting with Naren De went off very well. We have discussed the issue on APMC (agri-product marketing committee) licence. We have also explained the benefits that we bring to the local small and medium businesses like kirana stores and also to the farmers. We are looking forward to our meeting with the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, tomorrow. We would like to get back to you on Thursday with an update.        
	De said Metro had not told him about any plans to quit Bengal. They have agreed to wait till Sunday, he said.        
	Metro was issued the licence to trade in farm commodities in 2005 and it was renewed in 2006 and 2007 before the ag-riculture marketing board headed by Des party colleague Naren Chatterjee unilaterally withdrew it in June last year.        
	De had defended the move to cancel the licence saying the company was not working for a year. The purpose for which the licence was issued was not being served, he said.

	Calcutta, Oct. 13: Representatives of the willing Singur farmers and those who had been earning a living from the Tata project today asked the governor to initiate steps to bring the Nano back to Singur.        
	Raj Bhavan sources said Gopalkrishna Gandhi told them he would speak to the government. Over 4,000 members of the Nano Banchao Committee assembled at Rani Rashmoni Avenue to protest against Mamata Banerjees irresponsible movement that forced Ratan Tata to move to Gujarat.

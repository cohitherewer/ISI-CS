	Durgapur, Oct. 15: Relatives of a six-month-old boy who died in Bankura Medical College and Hospital today locked the main gate, preventing hospital staff from entering the premises for three hours.         
	They alleged the boy died because of negligence. The gates were opened after the principal of the college promised an inquiry.

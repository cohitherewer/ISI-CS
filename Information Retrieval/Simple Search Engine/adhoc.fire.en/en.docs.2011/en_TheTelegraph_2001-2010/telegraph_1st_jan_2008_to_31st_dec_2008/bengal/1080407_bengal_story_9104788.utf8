                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Seth threatens Haldia strike
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, April 6: Lakshman Seth, the president of the Citu-led employees union at Haldia Petrochemicals, today said a strike at the plant would be called again if the management did not give permanent employment to 183 casual workers.        
	The earlier strike call (on April 8) was put off following the intervention of top CPM leaders and the managements request for talks.         
	Union leaders are slated to meet management representatives tomorrow. Seth, the CPM strongman in East Midnapore, will not attend the meeting but local MLA Nityananda Bera and Ashok Patnaik, both union vice-presidents, will be there.         
	If the talks fail, we will call a strike again, said Seth, also the MP from Tamluk.        
	At the opening of a bus terminus in Tamluk town, Seth announced the plan to acquire 50 acres for a stadium and cultural hub. His notice for acquisition, as the Haldia Development Authority chief, had triggered the land war in Nandigram.        
	The Trinamul Congress said it would resist the acquisition of the 50 acres. We did not object to the acquisition of 100 acres for administrative buildings because they were necessary. But we will not allow acquisition for entertainment, said district Trinamul president and Egra MLA Sisir Adhikary.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Purulia, Sept. 6: A railway employee was killed in a vain attempt to save a man who was trying to hurry across the tracks ignoring the closed gates at a level crossing this morning.        
	Gate man Rameswar Rai, 42, ran to rescue Gour Kumar, 62, who was crossing the tracks on a bicycle as a passenger train hurtled in at Durgu in Purulias Jhalda, about 310km from Calcutta.         
	But Rameswar had misjudged the speed of the approaching train. Both were run over.        
	Gour was a resident of Bamni, a nearby village. Rameswar was from Bagmundi.        
	The level-crossing gate was closed but Gour ignored it. He managed to take his cycle through a narrow opening on one side of the gate. Rameswar saw him and shouted a warning. But he did not respond, said Sandip Bera, who was at the accident spot on the Bengal-Jharkhand border.        
	Then Rameswar ran towards him in the hope that he would be able to push him off the tracks in time.        
	Gours grandson Bablu Kumar said his grandfather was hard of hearing. He could not hear the gate man shouting.        
	Purulia station manager Shyama Prasad Majumdar said Rameswar had always been an alert gate man.        
	In the past, he has saved people who were trying to cross the tracks unmindful of, or deliberately ignoring, an approaching train, Majumdar said.        
	Ranchi divisional railway manager Anil Kumar Dutta promised adequate compensation for Rameswars family.        
	The gate man is survived by his wife, three daughters and a son.        
	Rameswar was killed while trying to save an elderly man. We will provide all kind of help to his family, the divisional manager said        
	The train, travelling from Dhanbad to Hatia, near Ranchi, stopped at the level crossing for about 30 minutes after the accident.         
	The bodies of Rameswar and Gour have been sent for post-mortem.        
	A railway official said many villagers using the Durgu level crossing did not heed signals and such accidents could happen again.         
	We will ask the district administration to create awareness among villagers that they should not cross the tracks when the gates are closed, an official said.

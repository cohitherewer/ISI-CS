	Singur, Aug. 31: Tata Motors trainees forced to sit at home by the siege today let out their frustration at Trinamul Congress supporters going towards Mamata Banerjees dharna dais.         
	A procession of several hundred young people intercepted two vehicles decked with Trinamul Congress flags and breezing through the Durgapur Expressway that has been closed to all other vehicles for eight days.        
	Lathi-wielding policemen chased the mob away and cleared the way for the Trinamul cars.         
	But the trainees threatened to force their way into the factory through the Trinamul blockades. The impasse will snatch our bread and butter and it cant be allowed to go on. We will enter the factory tomorrow, said Mantu Jyoti, 21.         
	In the march, there were about a hundred young trainees like Jyoti and many who work for the syndicates formed to supply men and materials to the Nano plant.        
	The procession started around 11.15am from Berapara in Gopalnagar. After having covered around 2km, the protesters wanted to take the expressway about 2.5km from where Mamata has been squatting.        
	Aamra kaaj chai, dharna chai na (We want jobs, not the siege), they shouted.         
	Police led by Singur officer-in-charge Priyabrata Bakshi blocked their way. Please do not proceed towards the siege site. If you want to hold a rally, do it here, the OC said.        
	The rallyists sat on the expressway, shouting slogans.         
	Around 11.45, a Tata Sumo carrying Trinamul supporters from the direction of Calcutta arrived. A mob surrounded it and started thumping on the bonnet. Some of the protesters grabbed the driver by the collar and he reversed at full speed and fled.        
	As the police tried to persuade the protesters to block only one lane and maintain peace, a Maruti van reached and once again the protesters rushed to the car, banged on it and hurled abuses at the passengers.        
	This time, the police chased the protesters away and allowed the car to pass.         
	Our men handled the situation well. There was no major problem, Hooghly superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra said later. If workers want to get into the factory and join duty, we will provide them full protection, he added.        
	The pro-industry youths said they had no plans to attack Trinamul supporters. But we were heckled by Trinamul supporters last Friday and so some of our friends were agitated seeing vehicles flying Trinamul flags, said Jahar Pakhira, 20, a car plant trainee.         
	On Thursday evening, busloads of people employed at the Tata plant were stranded for over three hours after work because of a roadblock by the siege supporters. Work at the plant was stopped after that incident.        
	Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee today accused CPM-backed men of attacking our supporters.

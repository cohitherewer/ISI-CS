	Rampurhat, Jan. 16: Bird flu has brought bad news for passengers from Calcutta who enjoy the chicken on their on-flight menu. 
    
	A number of airlines have decided to withdraw chicken meals from their platter from tomorrow to avoid any risk for passengers. 
    
	No chicken will be served on board from tomorrow in all 22 flights taking off from Calcutta, an Air India spokesperson said in Calcutta. 
    
	The breakfast will be totally vegetarian. Mutton or lamb will be served for high tea, lunch and dinner.
    
	The official said passengers from Calcutta had preferred vegetarian meals in the past few days.
    
	Other major domestic carriers are following Air India. Jet Airways today decided not to load chicken meals on its flights from Calcutta. All the 19 flights will have either mutton or lamb for the passengers. 
    
	In some cases, there will be vegetarian meals, a Jet official said. 
    
	Kingfisher has also decided to serve vegetarian meals on board.
    
	Inderjit Singh Saini, a businessman who will take a Kingfisher flight to Delhi on Friday, said: Im a die-hard non-vegetarian but ticked the veg option on the ticket this time.
    
	Anil Punjabi, eastern India chairman of the Travel Agents Federation of India, confirmed the trend. A large number of passengers scheduled to travel later this week are opting for vegetarian meals. They are enquiring about whether eggs and chicken are being served on board, he said.
    
	Some of the international carriers, too, are planning not to upload chicken but nothing has been finalised yet. 
    
	We are keeping a watch, a British Airways spokesperson said from Delhi. 
    
	Singapore Airlines assured its passengers there was no need to worry about its chicken meals. All our food being served to passengers from Calcutta is loaded in Singapore, said an official.
    
	At the Calcutta airport, health officials said there was no immediate need to make tests mandatory for passengers. 
    
	There is no report of the virus affecting human beings. We are in constant touch with the Union health ministry and action will be taken if necessary, an officer said.

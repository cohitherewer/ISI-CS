The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM flaunts Jhargram
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CPM flaunts Jhargram
          BISWAJIT ROY AND ANINDYA SENGUPTA                              
	Dec. 2: The Left Front today tom-tomed its civic poll triumph in Jhargram, which had been cut off from the rest of the state by a tribal unrest.        
	Its reaction was muted to the reduced margin in Howrah, where it had expected to reap the fallout of the Nano pullout, and the rout in Beh- rampore and Krishnagar.         
	Front chairman Biman Bose said the Jhargram verdict proved that the tribals had rejected the separatists and other forces that were shedding crocodile tears for them.         
	He cited the win in ward No. 1, populated mostly by 300 Lodha families, to stress that tribals had not deserted the Left. However, he also admitted that only around 10 per cent of the population of Jhargram town was tribal.         
	Led by Maoists, a section of the tribals had cut off the town alleging police atrocities. They are still laying siege to large parts of nearby Lalgarh.         
	On Howrah, Behrampore and Krishnagar, Bose said: We cant explain the result without reviewing its details.        
	The Left had lost eight of the 13 civic bodies that went to polls in June. The jolt in urban areas, coupled with the rural poll setbacks in May, had made the CPM defensive in its drive for industry. State secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty sounded more confident today when he said: We have decided to stand by the 11,000 people who gave land for industry in Singur on their own.        
	Trinamul setback        
	Trinamul admitted that Mamata Banerjees bargaining power, which had increased after the rural polls, might take a hit with the Congress comfortably winning Behrampore and Krishnagar.        
	After the rural polls, there were signs of change as we got two zilla parishads and won a large number of panchayat seats in Howrah and Nadia... the Congress will now be on a solid footing and Didis bargaining power may lessen, a Trinamul MLA said.        
	Hours after the results were declared, Mamata announced that she would not field a candidate for the Sujapur Assembly bypoll in Malda, where the late MLA Ruby Noors daughter Mausam is contesting on a Congress ticket.        
	She justified the move at a rally in Singur: Rubi Noors daughter called me yesterday with the request. People may think we are not contesting because of todays results, but our ultimate target should be to oust the CPM. We could not prevent the CPM from capturing Howrah, where there was no seat adjustment and that was our failure.        
	The Congress was prompt in returning the favour. Working president Subrata Mukherjee said: Weve decided not to field a candidate for the Nandigram Assembly bypoll because Trinamul is contesting.        
	If we had an alliance in Howrah, we could have thrown out the CPM, he added.

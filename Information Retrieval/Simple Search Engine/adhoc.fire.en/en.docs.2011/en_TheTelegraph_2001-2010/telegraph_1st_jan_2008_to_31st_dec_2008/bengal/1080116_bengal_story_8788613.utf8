     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 15: For Subhas Chakraborty, the Bharat Ratna will be apt recognition for Jyoti Basu even if the CPM top guns and the party patriarch himself have rejected the idea. 
    
	Why Bharat Ratna? Jyotibabu deserves all the ratnas. We should accept societys recognition of anyone considered a gem of the nation, the minister said on the sidelines of the state party conference. 
    
	With his penchant for speaking his mind even if his opinion goes against the official line, Chakraborty questioned the wisdom of refusing state awards. 
    
	After a rally at Brigade Parade Grounds on Sunday, party general secretary Prakash Karat had said: What (do) we have to do with (the) Bharat Ratna? Our leaders do not accept state awards. That is our partys stated stand.
    
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had echoed Karat while confirming that the Centre had sounded his government on conferring the Bharat Ratna on Basu.
    
	Reminded about the partys refusal in the case of its former general secretary and Kerala chief minister, E.M.S. Namboodiripad, Chakraborty shot back: Are we not paying the price for it? The traditional approach to this social recognition should not continue. 
    
	He didnt explain what price the party had paid. Chakraborty said: The Centre decides who gets the award. If it decides on Basu, Ill welcome it.
    
	Basu was in no mood to oblige his self-professed disciple. Subhaske nite bolun, aami eshob nii naa. (Ask Subhas to take it. I dont accept these honours), he said while stepping into the conference hall. 
    
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh this evening said there was still time to take a decision on the Ratna.

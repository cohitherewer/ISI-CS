	Calcutta, May 3: Students of Bidhannagar Government High School and their parents today staged a protest against a temporary market coming up in an adjoining field, which threatens to rob the children of a playground.        
	The structure, taking up 60 per cent of the field, is being built to house shops of the BD block market in Salt Lake while it is upgraded to a mall.         
	The parents said they were surprised to see the structure yesterday, when the school re-opened for the new session after a break.        
	They marched to municipality chairman Biswajivan Majumdars office, but could not meet him.         
	Around 50 students and their parents gathered in the field this morning and started a demonstration.         
	We have a very small patch of green on the school premises, which is not enough for all the students to play on. We used to play in the field during lunch break. If a market comes up there, where will we play? asked Ishita Nandi, a Class XII student.        
	The school, which has 600 students, has been using the field since it was established in 1977. The annual sports meet and football matches are also held there.        
	The school authorities have sent a written complaint to the director of school education, Dibyen Mukherjee.        
	Students dont come to school just to study. They should also have a playground., said Tapan Chatterjee, the school in-charge.        
	The BD market will be turned into a shopping mall, and till the first floor is complete, around 200 shops will operate from the temporary structure.        
	Nandagopal Bhattacharya, chairman in council in charge of markets, said: The field does not belong to the school. We cannot do anything about it.

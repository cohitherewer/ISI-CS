	Jan. 31: District authorities complained about meagre compensation and flu fighters hurry to get home during a video conference with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today.
    
	The chief minister spoke to all 19 district magistrates from Writers Buildings for an hour this morning. Thirteen districts have been declared bird flu-hit so far. 
    
	Officials said most of the DMs urged Bhattacharjee to raise the compensation being paid for chickens and ducks that are culled. 
    
	Villagers are being given Rs 40 for chickens and ducks and Rs 10 for chicks. Animal resource development minister Anisur Rahman has said these villagers would get an additional Rs 500.
    
	More people were today brought into the ambit of the rehabilitation package. Those who have lost their birds to unusual deaths would get Rs 500, as would traders whose eggs have been destroyed, the minister said.
    
	We will pay Rs 500 each to six lakh people across the state. That is why we have released Rs 12.5 crore and the Centre has been requested to provide a matching amount, the minister said.
    
	Discussions on whether bank loan waivers can be provided to those whose chickens and ducks have died are on, Rahman said.
    
	The other complaint of the DMs was that the rapid response team members were in a rush to return home, citing fatigue. Their quarantine period after culling is at least 10 days. 
    
	Around 185 flu fighters returned from Margram block in Birbhum soon after culling last week.
    
	The chief minister promised to look into the matter and said he would also ensure that the flu fighters take Tamiflu tables before culling operations.
    
	Bhattacharjee asked government officials to finish culling in the next two days. The target was raised to 28 lakh today with reports of more chicken deaths pouring in.
    
	Samples of two dead chickens tested positive at Rajarpukur village in Suri block I. Over 250 chickens died in a private poultry farm at Maheshtala in South 24-Parganas, 18km from Calcutta.
    
	South 24-Parganas DM Sanghamitra Ghosh issued an order this evening banning the sale of chicken and eggs within a 10km radius of bird flu-hit Budge Budge.
    
	Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said 18 human blood samples had tested negative, adding that 18 lakh people were under surveillance.

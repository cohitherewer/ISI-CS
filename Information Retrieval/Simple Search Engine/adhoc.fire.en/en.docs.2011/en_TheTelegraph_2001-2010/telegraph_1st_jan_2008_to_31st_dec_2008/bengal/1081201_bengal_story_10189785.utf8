	Calcutta, Nov. 30: The Bengal home secretary today admitted that the state lacked the firepower to adequately respond to a terrorist attack.         
	The state and city police lack the training and firepower that can match attackers (as well prepared as in Mumbai), Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said after a meeting with IG (law and order) Raj Kanojia.         
	The Border Security Force will be requested to train the police in the use of sophisticated weapons, he added.         
	The government will also acquire more AK-56 rifles.         
	The police commissioner will meet officials of the citys prominent hotels tomorrow to asses their preparedness.

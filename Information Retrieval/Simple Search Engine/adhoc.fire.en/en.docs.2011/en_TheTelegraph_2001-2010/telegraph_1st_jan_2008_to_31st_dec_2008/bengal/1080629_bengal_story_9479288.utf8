          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 28: A lot remains to be done for the minorities in education, training and employment, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said today.        
	Muslims have benefited greatly from land reforms but we have not been able to do much for them in education, training and employment, the chief minister told a programme organised by the West Bengal Minority Development Finance Corporation.        
	Bhattacharjee conceded that the state lagged in training, education and, as a consequence, in jobs.         
	He said skill development was important if one had to benefit from the new opportunities in business.         
	Our minority development corporation is doing a lot to provide finance in the form of loans. Developing skills through training is a pre-condition for business and industry, Bhattacharjee said at the corporations post-matric scholarship programme.         
	Bhattacharjee expressed concern that efforts to modernise madarsas werent always interpreted rightly.         
	We are trying to modernise them but the efforts are not always interpreted rightly. We want these students to learn computers and English, apart from Urdu and the Quran.

	Feb. 26: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has agreed to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tomorrow. 
    
	Bimal Gurung, the Morcha president, will lead a seven-member team to Writers Buildings.
    
	The party has also declared a 12-hour relaxation in its hill bandh for tomorrow, starting 6am. 
    
	In line with the Morcha demand for a written invitation, the chief ministers principal secretary, Dipankar Mukhopadhyay, today sent a letter to Gurung through the Darjeeling district magistrate. 
    
	We welcome the invitation. The meeting, we hope, will be fruitful, though we will stick to the two demands, said Gurung. 
    
	The Morcha has been demanding the immediate removal of Subash Ghisingh as caretaker administrator of the hill council and scrapping of the Sixth Schedule bill. Both demands had been rejected by the government, following which the Morcha launched a fast and the indefinite bandh. 
    
	The protesters had put up road blockades to prevent Ghisingh from entering the hills after his return from Delhi on February 18. 
    
	The GNLF chief was forced to stay in Pintail, on the outskirts of Siliguri, for four days before heading to Calcutta. 
    
	The state today offered Ghisingh adequate security to enable him to return to Darjeeling. The government is likely to urge the Morcha not to obstruct the GNLF chiefs passage to the hills. 
    
	Ghisingh met chief secretary A.K. Deb, home secretary P.R. Ray and director-general of police A.B. Vohra. He told them that work in the DGHC has come to a standstill because of his absence.
    
	Deb said: In 2001, there was an attack on Ghisingh and his security happens to be a worry. The government has decided to make adequate arrangements to ensure his safe journey to the hills.
    
	Ghisingh said: Going back to the hills was never an issue. It is not a problem at all. 
    
	In Delhi, a meeting between the chief minister and a delegation of six anti-GNLF parties, except the Morcha, could not take place today as Bhattacharjee had to fly back.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Shutdown Dunlop cites cash crunch to govt
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Shutdown Dunlop cites cash crunch to govt
          OUR BUREAU                           Dunlop workers read the work suspension notice at the factory gate on Sunday                                  
	Dec. 1: The Dunlop management today wrote to the Bengal labour minister explaining why it had suspended work at its Sahagunj factory yesterday, but did not seek his help to end the impasse with workers.        
	Minister Mrinal Banerjee today said he would first study the letter, then talk to the unions for a way out of the stalemate. In the evening, I got a letter from the company that stated the reasons for declaring suspension of work. I will discuss the letter with my department and then talk to the labour unions, Banerjee said.         
	The labour minister clarified that nowhere in the letter had the company sought his intervention to resolve the impasse. They have explained in detail what forced them clamp the suspension order. But my intervention has not been sought. The company management has stated that the financial crisis and poor market conditions forced it to take the step, Banerjee said.         
	The company also wrote about the workers rejection of its proposal of a reduced monthly pay of Rs 2,000.         
	Yesterday, the company issued the suspension of work notice, rendering nearly 1,200 workers jobless. The notice at the gate said: The company has no liability to pay and will not pay any wages/salaries to the workers during the period of suspension of operation.        
	Banerjee said a meeting with the unions may be held, followed by a another with the management. If necessary, a tripartite meeting can be called to re-open the plant.        
	The unions want the government to be party to any deal with the management, but labour department officials earlier said it was not possible as the industrial disputes act barred such intervention unless workers were laid off or the plant was shut down. Now, with the suspension of work declared, the government can intervene directly.        
	Banerjee today said: If necessary, the government can sit with the management and the unions for a solution and we are not averse to that. Suspension of work is unfortunate and would certainly affect the reputation of the company and the interest of workers. Last time, Ruia had told me that he was confident of re-starting production by March 2009. Lets see what happens now.        
	Banerjee said the government has received the Presidents assent on an amendment to the industrial disputes act that would allow it to make efforts for recovery of dues and benefits of company workers.        
	This amendment would allow us to appoint recovery officers who would listen to disputes regarding wages and salaries and arrange for their recovery. There is, however, always a possibility of the opposite side obtaining a stay. This amendment will have nothing to do with the re-opening of any company, Banerjee said.        
	About 300 Dunlop workers led by local leadership of Trinamul Congress have started a sit-in at the factory gate under the banner of Dunlop Banchao Committee. The agitating leaders said efforts are on to bring Mamata Banerjee to the factory to address a meeting on Thursday.

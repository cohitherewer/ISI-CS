          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Purulia, Nov. 23: A CRPF jawan in Maoist-stalked Purulia was today transferred to Calcutta after being caught molesting a homemaker by villagers who held him hostage for over two hours.        
	The jawan was transferred after he was caught molesting the housewife in a drunken state, although no complaint was lodged with us. He will be sent for medical examination tomorrow, district superintendent of police Rajesh Yadav said.         
	The CRPF has ordered its own probe. We are interrogating the jawan, a senior official said from Purulia town.        
	The police said the jawan, Mohanlal, first went after a 27-year-old woman outside his camp near Ayodhya hills, 315km from Calcutta, around 11am. When she shut herself in her shanty, he entered an adjoining hut and embraced her.         
	The woman raised the alarm. Villagers arrived at the scene, grabbed the jawan by his collar and abused him.         
	We demanded an apo-logy and informed the CRPF camp, said villager Akhil Sardar. Twenty jawans arrived and pleaded with the villagers to let off their colleague. We forced Mohanlal to apologise and slapped him in front of them, said jawan Kecham Kamle.         
	The CRPF camp was set up over a year ago following reports of the increased Maoist activities.

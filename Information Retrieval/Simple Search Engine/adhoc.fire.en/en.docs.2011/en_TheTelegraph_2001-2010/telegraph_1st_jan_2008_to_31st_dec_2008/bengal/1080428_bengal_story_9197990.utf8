          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, April 27: A 14-year-old fled her home in a Murshidabad village on Friday because she did not want to get married before completing Class X.        
	Class VIII student Meherunnisa (name changed) has succeeded in putting her marriage  which was to be held tomorrow  on hold.         
	Police will escort her to Shyampur village and stand guard to ensure that she is not forced into the marriage.        
	Ice cream seller Zahiraddin Sheikh had fixed his daughters marriage so early because he thought he would not get another man to agree to a wedding without dowry.        
	It did not matter that the groom, mason Bullet Sheikh, was 15 years older than the girl, a student of the local Al Fida Mission School.        
	Learning of her fathers plan, Meherunnisa had tried to talk him out of it, but in vain.        
	I was very fortunate to have got a groom who had no demands. I had finished making all the purchases, said Zahiraddin.        
	Meherunnisa fled to her maternal aunts house at Palashbati village, about 15km away.         
	Uncle Nasiruddin Sheikh got in touch with Zahiraddin. When the father refused to cancel the wedding, Nasiruddin took Meherunnisa to Lalgola police station, 240km from Calcutta.        
	But the police turned them away, saying Meherunnisa lived in the area of the Bhagabangola police station.         
	Nasiruddin then took her to block development officer Anirban Chatterjee.        
	I repeatedly told Zahir to cancel the marriage but he wouldnt listen, Nasiruddin said.        
	The BDO assured Meherunnisa that the marriage would not take place and asked the Lalgola police to escort her home. The police will stand guard in front of Meherunnisas house to prevent the marriage. If the girl really wants to study, I will personally help her, the BDO said.        
	District superintendent of police Basab Dasgupta said he would probe why Lalgola police station had refused to take the complaint.         
	Meherunnisa made it clear that she did not bear a grudge against her parents. It is only that I wanted to continue my studies, she said with a smile.        
	When I came to know about my marriage, I repeatedly told my father that I didnt want it so early. But he refused to see reason. He told me he would not get another man who would not ask for dowry. So, I fled.

	Durgapur, Sept. 25: Only seven farmers today attended a hearing for land acquisition for a power project in Burdwans Katwa and agreed to give up their plots.        
	This is poor response. We will have to decide whether there will be another round of hearing, a district official said.        
	The number of farmers who have given their consent since Monday is now 10. Earlier hearings, on July 30 and August 1, had got 45 villagers to agree.        
	The government has decided to acquire 1,033 acres belonging to around 4,600 farmers for the 1,320MW project. In the first phase, 350 acres of 403 farmers are to be acquired.

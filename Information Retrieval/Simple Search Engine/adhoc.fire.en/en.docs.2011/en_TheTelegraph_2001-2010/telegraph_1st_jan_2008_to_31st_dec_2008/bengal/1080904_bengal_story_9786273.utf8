The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM for Mamata in talks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CPM for Mamata in talks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 3: The CPM brass had wanted direct talks between Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee with the governor playing the peacemaker.         
	We wanted her to join the talks since her representatives would not be able to take decisions on their own. They would have to shuttle between Singur and Raj Bhavan as Partha Chatterjee had done in the past few days. This will delay the negotiations, said a CPM state secretariat member.         
	The party and the Left Front have empowered Bhattacharjee to finalise the compromise formula before placing it for discussion at the meeting chaired by the governor.         
	RSP leader Kshiti Goswami said his party had wanted experts to represent the front at the meeting. But the others ruled it out. Theres no need for a CPM or front emissary. The governments presence is enough, said the CPMs Benoy Konar.

          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, Aug. 23: If the Tatas pull the plug on the Nano project in Singur, it could jeopardise investments worth over Rs 10,000 crore in Bengal.         
	Ratan Tata had warned yesterday that if Tata Motors abandoned its Nano project in Bengal, it would have a knock-on effect on the other projects planned in the state by the group, which has more than 85 companies within its fold.         
	A quick check revealed that the Tatas were involved in about 40 projects in the state, most of which are in various stages of planning and implementation, a little detail Mamata Banerjee can chew on when she begins her Singur siege tomorrow.         
	The Nano plant, in which the Tatas have invested Rs 1,500 crore so far, has hogged the limelight but it isnt the groups largest investment in the state. At the top of the pile is the Rs 4,425-crore Maithon Left Bank Thermal Power Project in which Tata Power will hold 76 per cent stake. Other major investments include Hooghly Met Coke amp; Power and Tata Metaliks steel project.         
	The Tatas have already tied up all the funds for the Maithon project but the Rs 1,000-crore steel plant has been stalled by land acquisition problems.         
	Hooghly Met Coke has invested nearly Rs 1,600 crore on a metallurgical coke and power plant and wants more land for a second, Rs 2,000-crore unit in Haldia.         
	Senior officials at Tata Metaliks and Hooghly Met Coke have said in the past that they may have to look elsewhere if they dont get land in Bengal.         
	Many believe that Tata Metaliks waited over three years for 350 acres at Kharagpur because of Ratan Tatas close relationship with the states political leadership. There is a possibility that the group may not pursue the projects which havent got off the ground, a source close to the development said.         
	The Tatas have also been looking to build a logistics and business hub through Tata Realty amp; Infrastructure Ltd and build budget hotels under the Ginger brand in Bengals small towns.         
	A Tata pullout will not only adversely impact future investment by some of Indias biggest companies  Tata Steel, TCS, Tata Power, Tata Chemicals, Indian Hotels  but also tarnish the states image, an observer said.         
	Brand Finance, a UK-based consultancy, recently valued the Tata brand at $11.4 billion and ranked it 57th in the world. The groups revenues in 2007-08 are estimated at $62.5 billion (Rs 251,543 crore).

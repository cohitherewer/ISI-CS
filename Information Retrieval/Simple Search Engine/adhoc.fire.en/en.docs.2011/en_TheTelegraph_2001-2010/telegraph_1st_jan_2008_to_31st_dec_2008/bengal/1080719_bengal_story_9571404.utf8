	Calcutta, July 18: A tiger mauled a fisherman near the Sunderbans core area today.         
	A forest department official said Purna Das and nine others were catching fish in the Matla, 150km from Calcutta, when the tiger sprang on Das.         
	It fled as the others raised the alarm. Doctors in South 24-Parganas Kultali said Das had severe injuries in his neck, shoulders and back.

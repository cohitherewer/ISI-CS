Nobody molested me, says woman 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, May 12: A woman whose signed complaint to police accused CRPF officer Alok Raj of molestation has distanced herself from the allegation in a television interview.        
	I dont know anyone by the name of Alok Raj and no jawan of the CRPF molested me. CRPF jawans, however, beat up my brother-in-law, the 32-year-old homemaker told the TV channel.        
	Asked about the complaint attributed to her and carrying her purported signature, she said: I dont know what complaint has been lodged. The leaders came and told me to sign a complaint and I followed their orders.        
	The complaint filed at Nandi- gram police station had said: On Saturday night, CRPF jawans entered our house and beat up my hus- bands brother. When I went to protest, Alok Raj pulled my sari and molested me.         
	The officer in charge of Nandigram police station, Debashish Chakraborty, confirmed the contents of the complaint. He said another woman had also complained that she was molested by CRPF jawans.        
	The East Midnapore CPM leadership avoided a direct reply. I dont know who said what to a TV channel. But what is written in the complaint has happened, said Ashok Guria, a district secretariat member of the CPM.        
	Guria, however, added: Our complaint in general is not against Alok Raj. Our complaint is against the CRPF. The jawans have been raiding the houses of our party supporters and beating them up. They are also misbehaving with the women.        
	The Trinamul Congress leadership in Nandigram said the CPM had engineered the complaints to malign the CRPF deputy inspector-general.        
	It was because of Alok Raj that nearly 500 of our supporters could return home on Saturday. The CPM wanted to make the DIG leave Nandigram and they cooked up the allegation to malign him, said Abu Taher, the convener of the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee.

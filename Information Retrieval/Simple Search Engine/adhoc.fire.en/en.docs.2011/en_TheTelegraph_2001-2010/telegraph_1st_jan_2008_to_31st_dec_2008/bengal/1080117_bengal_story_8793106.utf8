     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 16: The CPM leadership today admitted that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees do-it-now slogan had not helped fight the bureaucratic mentality both in the government and the party. 
    
	While the leadership urged the party to face the criticism with courage as the drive for industrialisation had rocked the long-held mentality to retain status quo, its rank and file spoke about the anxieties and uncertainties the drive had created. 
    
	As the state party conference discussed the document  Left Front Government, Panchayats, Municipalities and Our Task  placed by industries minister Nirupam Sen, delegates cautioned against creating false hopes.
    
	Administrative weakness is the major obstacle for the implementation of the governments pro-people programmes. The lack of commitment is quite evident at all levels, the document said. 
    
	The Left Front manifesto for the last Assembly polls had promised administrative reforms in keeping with the changing times to accelerate work and ensure transparency. The first meeting of the new cabinet had passed a resolution to form a committee on administrative reforms under the leadership of the chief secretary. No significant progress took place. 
    
	Implementation of projects is hindered not by the want of funds but administrative weakness, it added.
    
	The same problem dogs development projects in rural areas. 
    
	The party document said: Our fundamental understanding of the state apparatus says it is difficult to translate the partys political good intention and the governments priorities and pro-people programmes into reality. Thats why we have been stressing on mass initiative and consciousness. 
    
	Citing the Nandigram mess, several delegates accused the government and the party brass of depending too much on the bureaucracy to pursue the goal of industrialisation. The local units, they alleged, were asked to bail out the authorities when the situation went out of hand. 
    
	They pulled up state leaders for failing to review of the partys mistakes in Nandigram and place them before the conference. 
    
	Sens report complained that land acquisition had never been made an emotive issue earlier in the state and sought an amicable solution to this problem to continue the development of the state. 
    
	Post-Nandigram, the party, however, has decided to give importance to farmers anxieties and include them at the local level in the process of land acquisition.
    
	Farmers would have to be included while deciding the price of land and comprehensive plans for the alternative livelihood of the landlosers would be drawn up in addition to the compensation being offered.
    
	The document said: We have to create confidence among the people about the positive outcome and social impact of the (industrial) projects. This is not only an administrative task but also political.
    
	The report made it clear Bengal cant refuse to set up SEZs in view of competition from other states.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Allies step up heat, CPI soft
                                                                                                               Allies step up heat, CPI soft
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 9: The CPM and the CPI today stepped up pressure on the Forward Bloc to sacrifice sitting MP Barun Mukherjee to ensure the return of party general secretary Debabrata Biswas to the Rajya Sabha.         
	The new CPI state council today endorsed the party brasss decision to ask for a sure seat in the Upper House.         
	Its state secretary, Manju Majumder, refused to speak to his Bloc counterpart Ashok Ghosh to thrash out a solution.         
	We wont hold any bilateral meeting with the Bloc as we have already placed our demand with Left Front chairman Biman Bose. All the partners, including the Bloc, have accepted the legitimacy of our demand, Majumder said.         
	Bose, also the CPM state secretary, made it clear that he wont take the initiative for another round of bipartite talks before the front meeting on March 13. We have to take a quick decision at the meeting. March 15 is the last date for filing nominations, he said.         
	At the last front meeting, the CPM and the RSP had asked the Bloc to pull out Mukherjee to make room for a CPI candidate and ensure Biswass renomination for the fourth consecutive term.         
	Ghosh, who had rejected the formula then, appeared to have softened his stand today. Weve been in the front since its birth and will continue to be in it. We are ready for talks with the CPI or any other partner to work out a consensus. But it is not the Blocs responsibility alone to ensure Left unity, he said.         
	The Bloc, which drew a blank in the Tripura Assembly polls by contesting on its own, also hinted that it might review its decision to go it alone in the Bengal panchayat polls.         
	Asked if he was firm on the stand, Ghosh said: Im not saying that. Its not my personal opinion but the partys decision that matters.         
	The partners feel that the CPIs demand for the Rajya Sabha seat was orchestrated by the CPM to tame the recalcitrant Bloc before the rural polls.

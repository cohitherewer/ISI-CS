          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Singur residents at Fridays CPM rally. (Ananda Das)                                  
	Singur, Sept. 12: Singur residents owing allegiance to the CPM have decided to launch an indefinite dharna outside the Tata site from tomorrow seeking immediate resumption of work at the plant.        
	Their camps, however, will not block Durgapur Expressway as Mamata Banerjees 15-day siege had.        
	About 200 villagers, including young Tata trainees, day labourers engaged in the project and those supplying construction materials, today gathered around 50m from the highway for a public meeting addressed by local CPM leaders.        
	At least 5,000 people were earning their livelihood from the project. That is why we want work to start immediately, said Balai Sabui, the partys Hooghly secretariat member.        
	We want the plant to work normally from Monday. We will launch our dharna tomorrow and continue until work resumes. But we will not block the highway, Sabui added.        
	The camps will be set up at Ratanpur and Joymollah, at the two ends of the plant along the expressway.         
	The CPM MLA from Arambagh, Benoy Dutta, led a procession of about 200 villagers that went around Joymollah before converging at the rally site.         
	Srimanta Pakhira, 36, of Joymollah, who used to earn about Rs 100 a day working as a labourer at the project, said: We are in dire straits. That is why we have decided to sit on a dharna until the resumption of work.        
	Rabin Santra, 44, member of a syndicate that supplied bricks, sand and stone chips to the project, said: The contractor owes me about Rs 10 lakh. The suspension of work was declared before my payment was cleared. Without the project, our future is bleak.        
	Bikash Pakhira, 30, a trainee at the Nano plant, said: We have a social commitment. We are fighting for the economic uplift of Singur.        
	On Wednesday, Joymollah farmers who had willingly given their plots for the project had said they would not allow redistribution of their land among the unwilling farmers.

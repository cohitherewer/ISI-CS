	Cooch Behar, Sept. 28: Police are trying to trace an alleged imposter after one of the two Class IX students he had befriended committed suicide in Cooch Behar on Friday.         
	The dead girls parents told police she took sleeping pills after being tortured by her school principal for her association with the man.        
	Besides using filthy lan- guage, she hit my daughter. Rumki (name changed) killed herself unable to bear the humiliation, her mother Bharati Pal said.        
	The 15-year-old had introduced one of her classmates to the young man, who identified himself as Sarbajit Barman and claimed to be an English teacher in a Balurghat school.         
	Sarbani (name changed) said: In May, Rumki gave my cellphone number to a person named Sarbajit Barman, who called me up frequently.         
	Her grandfather said the family noticed a sudden drop in concentration while studying and that she had started getting low marks. When I got to know from her how she had befriended a stranger, I met Rumkis father and asked him what was going on, he said.        
	When Rumkis father, Paritosh Pal, allegedly refused to react, Sarbanis grandfather met the principal.         
	The principal called her and another friend, Anindita (name changed), separately on September 23 and 24. We were told not to mix with Rumki. The principal also asked how I came to know Sarbajit, Sarbani said.        
	Rumki had told her friends that the principal kicked and abused her when she met her on September 25. The principal also told her she had loose morals, Sarbani said.         
	Rumkis father said in the FIR the principal tortured her physically and mentally on September 25 and his daughter killed herself the day after.        
	Balurghat High School said it had no English teacher named Sarbajit Barman.         
	Cooch Behar additional superintendent of police Ashesh Biswas said what transpired between the principal and Rumki was yet to be ascertained. However, we have come across the name of Sarbajit Barman and are trying to verify whether it is the real name, Biswas said.

     OUR BUREAU
               
	Jan. 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called up Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee yesterday to express concern over the bird flu outbreak. 
    
	I briefed the Prime Minister about the condition of the flu-affected districts. He assured me all possible help to combat the situation, Bhattacharjee said at Writers Buildings this afternoon.
    
	The chief minister said he was in constant touch with Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar.
    
	Bhattacharjee said the outbreak was under control in Burdwan and Bankura. The problem in Murshidabad and Birbhum will be sorted out soon, he said without clarifying what the problem was.
    
	The state has enough vets at its disposal, he said.
    
	The flu has been confirmed in Birbhum, Murshidabad, South Dinajpur, Nadia, Burdwan, Bankura and Malda.
    
	Union animal husbandry secretary Pradip Kumar today said 21 lakh chickens and ducks would be culled in the next seven days. The number of culling teams would be increased to 600 by tomorrow. Each team has been asked to cull 500 birds a day, Kumar said.
    
	Around 150 veterinary experts are being brought from Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Assam, Orissa, Rajasthan and Punjab. 
    
	Asked whether the state was doing enough to tackle the virus, Kumar said: Its not the time to do a post-mortem. We are working jointly and operations need to be stepped up. We are also trying to find out whether migratory birds can cause infection.
    
	A team comprising officials from the Union animal husbandry department and their counterparts from the states will monitor the possible spread of bird flu to Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa and the Northeast.
    
	The Centre has provided the state with 5,000 protective gears. More protective gears would be sent. Bird flu is a national problem, Kumar said.
    
	School of Tropical Medicine director D.K. Neogi said there was no harm in eating chicken bred in non-bird flu areas. The chicken has to be cooked in at least 70 degrees Celsius for half an hour. If the virus enters our stomach even after that, the gastric juice and the bile will destroy it.

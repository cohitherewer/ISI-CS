          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 7: The government today revived its plan to introduce English as a medium in all its schools.        
	The proposal, shelved un-der pressure from Left Front partner RSP, will be soon placed before the cabinet again, school education minister Partha De said today.        
	There is a great demand among parents for English-medium institutions, he told the Assembly during the discussion on his departments budget. We are determined to open English medium units in as many state-run schools as possible.        
	The proposal and the approval of the finance department had been placed before the cabinet for a final nod in May.        
	But it was put on hold after PWD minister Kshiti Goswami raised objections and demanded a discussion among the Left Front partners first.        
	The Trinamul Congresss Ashis Banerjee and Saugata Roy and Manas Bhuniya of the Congress today wanted to know the governments stand.        
	In his reply, De admitted that the importance of English education was increasing fast. Students must have a sound knowledge of computers. They have to access the Net every now and then. So proper education in English is necessary.        
	Being good in English also helps students crack national-level entrance tests for engineering and medical courses, the demand for which is increasing. Guardians had been urging schools to create separate facilities offering English and vernacular languages as mediums of instruction.        
	The minister regretted that the government had once opposed the introduction of English language from Class I.        
	Many states are now offering education in English medi- um in government schools, he said today.         
	There is no reason why we should not do the same.

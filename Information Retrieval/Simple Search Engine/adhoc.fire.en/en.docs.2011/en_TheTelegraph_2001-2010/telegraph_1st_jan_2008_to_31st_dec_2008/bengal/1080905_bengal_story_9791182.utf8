  - Rally watchers and residents want car to roll out from Singur        A STAFF REPORTER                                    Rohitasha, Dipannita, Sanjib: GeNext voices				                                       
	Singur, Sept. 4: Many young dreams in Singur are riding on a small car.         
	Gargi Ghosh, who stays in Singur Bazar and studies English (honours) in Sreerampore College, has one such dream. I want to work in a bank. After the Tatas Nano project took off, four new banks came up in Singur and I was working hard to get a job in one of them, she said.        
	With the cars rollout under a cloud, Gargis thoughts about her career are also dark. A lot of futures in Singur depend on the Nano plant. We cant let the plant go from our land, said the first-year student.        
	Like Gargi, Dipannita Chatterjee, also hails from Singur. She is from a family of farmers in Ratanpur, studies English at Raja Peary Mohan College in Uttarpara and dreams of sitting in a corporate boardroom someday.         
	Dipannita, who is in first year, said she would like to do her Masters first. You cannot expect me to till the land after that, the teenager said. We want industry in Singur.         
	Dipannitas friend Sanjib Chakraborty, a first-year zoology student, said: I can vouch for my friends and relatives and say that more than 90 per cent people in Singur want the Tatas to stay.         
	The youth of Singur, to whom The Telegraph spoke, were keen on a farmland-versus-factory debate, but not at the cost of the Tata Motors plant in the area.         
	The situation became worse only because of the politicking. I think a resolution could have been reached had the Trinamul leaders been keen to find a solution. The leaders are playing with our future, said Rohitasha Mitra, a first-year Arts student and a resident of Jalghata village in Singur.

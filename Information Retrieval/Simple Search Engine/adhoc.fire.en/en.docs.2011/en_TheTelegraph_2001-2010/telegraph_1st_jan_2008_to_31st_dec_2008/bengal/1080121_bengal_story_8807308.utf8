The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | US good and bad for CM
                                                                                                            US good and bad for CM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 20: American capital is welcome for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee but not defence deals and joint military exercises with the US.        
	US aggression is two-pronged: its finance capital and armed forces are trying to oc-cupy new territories. Those who have refused to open their markets to US capital have faced its military might. But we wont accept India becoming a junior partner to the US strategic game in the name of defence deals, he told a rally of the CPM union for central government employees here.        
	He was at pains to explain the dichotomy in the CPMs anti-Americanism.        
	Our position is that US capital should come to our market. Let all countries do business in others territories, let there be equality of nations. We will invite US investment where it is needed. But the US insists on opening our banking, insurance and pension sectors to its companies, Bhattacharjee said.         
	US companies also want us to open our retail sector to them so that they can sell our vegetables to us.        
	The CPM is averse to foreign direct investment in retail but not Indian retail giants.        
	He assured supporters that he would resist downsizing of government units. We are with you in your fight against privatisation of pension and other social security schemes. We are opposed to the policy of disinvestment in VSNL and other Navaratna companies.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, Sept. 20: Teachers in a Nadia school have not got their August salary after grants to the institution were stopped because its managing committee refused to reinstate the headmaster.        
	Chandicharan Biswas, the headmaster of Hanspukuria High School, was suspended by the committee for allegedly misappropriating about Rs 1.6 lakh that the school had got as a grant under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.         
	But the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education found the charge did not hold and told the committee to reinstate Biswas. When it refused, Nadias district inspector of schools (secondary) stopped state grants and the salary of 23 teachers of the Tehatta school, about 150km from Calcutta.        
	We were not satisfied with the headmasters explanation, so we suspended him, said Bishweswar Mondal, secretary of the committee. Biswas was suspended in April and the committee informed the board about its decision.         
	The board summoned Biswas and asked him to explain the charge.        
	I was falsely implicated, the headmaster said. When they (the managing committee) showcaused me, I told them I had diverted Rs 1.6 lakh from the Abhiyan fund to the schools development fund. But they did not understand.         
	Mondal, the managing committee secretary, said: We have to see whether any such fund was at all diverted. Moreover, such transfer of funds is illegal without the managing committees approval.        
	Last month, the board held the headmasters suspension illegal. Anil Pramanik, the district inspector of schools (secondary), said: The board told me that the headmaster was not guilty.         
	Pramanik said he had asked the managing committee to revoke the suspension order a fortnight ago. But as they (the committee) refused, we have decided to freeze all grants to the school. The teachers salaries are part of it. We will wait for sometime and if the headmaster is not reinstated, we may dissolve the committee, he said.        
	The teachers have threatened to go on strike.

	Krishnagar, Aug. 4: Robbers pumped six bullets into a retired employee and watched him die on Sunday night as a another group held off at gunpoint neighbours who had rushed to help him.        
	Police said that around 1.30am, a dozen men came in a Tata Sumo to raid Nepal Nags house in Haringhata, about 45km from Calcutta.         
	Breaking down the iron gate, one group kept vigil while the other entered the house.         
	Nag, a 66-year-old retired group D employee of the Border Control Commission, was shot six times from point-blank range.        
	He died on the spot.        
	When his 55-year-old wife Jyotsna and son Ashok, 30, tried to stop the thieves from shooting Nag, they were assaulted with sharp weapons.        
	Ashok and Jyotsna fell to the ground, bleeding. Nag, riddled with bullets, died on the spot, said an officer of the Haringhata police station.        
	The gang took away gold bangles, earrings and a ring from Jyotsna and some cash. The amount of cash stolen is not known, the police said.         
	Nags son runs a transport business at Haringhata.        
	Neighbours said they heard shots and rushed to the house but the armed men at the gate told them to stay away or get shot.         
	After the gang left, residents rushed Jyotsna and Ashok to Kalyani Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital.         
	We are yet to get the full version of the events. They are seriously injured and cannot be interrogated now, a police officer said.

	Calcutta, March 4: The government is likely to remove home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray from his post before the rural polls in May.         
	The CPM was apparently not happy with the way he often admitted the partys role in the violence in Nandigram and the trouble in Singur and refused to corroborate its version of incidents.        
	Roy, who is scheduled to retire on September 30, is likely to be replaced by higher education secretary Ashoke Mohan Chakraborty.

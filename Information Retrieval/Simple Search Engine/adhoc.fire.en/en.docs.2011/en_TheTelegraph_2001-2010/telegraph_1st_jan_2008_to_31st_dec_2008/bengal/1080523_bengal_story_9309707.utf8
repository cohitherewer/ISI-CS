The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM readies to review rural result
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CPM readies to review rural result
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, May 22: The CPM is expected to discuss its panchayat poll performance at the state committee meeting on May 25 and 26.        
	Let the party leaders discuss and analyse it at the state committee meeting. I shall be able to comment only after that, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said today in response to questions on the Left Fronts tally.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat can attend such meetings if he wants to, but party leaders said they were not aware of any plans by the central leadership to take part in the review beginning this weekend.        
	Although the Opposition and some front partners cited hasty land acquisition as the main reason for the loss of seats in south Bengal, CPM state secretary Biman Bose blamed the partys public relations failure.        
	We have to analyse our shortcomings and see whether arrogance or complacence among our workers, or their failure to meet the peoples expectations and convince them, was responsible for our losses in some districts, Bose said.                  
	The CPM leader said his party as well as its partners would review the factors behind this kind of result.        
	The party has been referring to administrative and political mistakes in Nandigram but Bose declined to explain where exactly the CPM had gone wrong.        
	He said separate meetings would be held with the partners before a review by the front.        
	A post-mortem will also be carried out to ascertain whether the bickering among some partners had any impact on the results. Bose appealed to all sides to maintain peace.        
	He ruled out any major churning within the party over industrialisation and land acquisition.        
	Any new idea faces some resistance in society. But it is true that our responsibility to convince people has increased, he said.        
	Bose ruled out a review of the Bhattacharjee governments policy of industrialisation.        
	Why should we review the industrial policy? he asked, citing the acquisition of 21,000 acres for steel plants and other industries in Purulias Raghunathpur, Burdwan and West Midnapores Salboni.        
	The Left Front bagged 30 zilla parishad seats out of 35 in Purulia and 57 of 62 in West Midnapore despite land acquisition there, so we should not look for simplistic explanations, he said.        
	But some allies felt that Boses arguments were misplaced.        
	All these tracts of land were in an arid zone of the state where investors, the government and the CPM took a persuasive approach to land acquisition, unlike in Singur and Nandigram, where fertile land was taken over forcibly, said RSP leader Manoj Bhattacharjee.        
	Murshidabad deaths        
	Two CPM supporters  Saidul Sheikh, 30 and Sadikul Sheikh, 31  were killed last night in an explosion in Chakambarpur village in Murshidabads violence-torn Domkal, about 245km from Calcutta.         
	With last nights deaths, the toll has risen to 19 in Murshidabad and 10 in Domkal since polling on May 18.

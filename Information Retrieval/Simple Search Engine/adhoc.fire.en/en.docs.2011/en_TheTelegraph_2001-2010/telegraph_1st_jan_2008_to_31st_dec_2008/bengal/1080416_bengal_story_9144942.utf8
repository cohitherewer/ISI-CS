	Darjeeling, April 15: Tourist attractions like toy train rides in Darjeeling, the zoo and the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute will be unaffected by the indefinite strike called by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha.        
	But the main toy train service between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling will not be allowed.        
	The party had said all state and central government offices would shut down indefinitely from April 14 in protest against a lathicharge on a rally of ex-servicemen in Siliguri on April 9.         
	Darjeelings botanical garden, zoo, Rock Garden and Shrubbery Park will open tomorrow, as will the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute and its museum. They had been shut today and yesterday.        
	Five in blast net        
	Five persons suspected to be linked to the Champasari blasts and the subsequent seizure of explosives have been arrested in the past 24 hours.         
	Ganga Gurung, Sandhya Tamang, Krishna Gajmer, Suresh Biswakarma and Balkumar Rai were picked up by police from different parts of Siliguri. Ganga had been detained last night.        
	A multi-department committee has been formed to investigate the twin blasts and the explosives haul. There has been no breakthrough on identifying the woman whose picture police released yesterday.

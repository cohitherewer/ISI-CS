	Malda, Sept. 14: Police teams from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh arrived here today to probe suspected ISI links of two Malda men arrested with fake currency from their states.         
	Malda additional superintendent of police Sujit Sarkar said Entaz Sheikh was picked up from Indore on September 7. Notes with a face value of Rs 79,000 were seized from him. Entaz hails from Ratua.         
	Nazrul Sheikh of Kaliachak was held in a Vadodara shopping mall.        
	Raids in Kaliachak, Bais- navnagar, Manikchak and Englishbazar today in search of men whom the duo had named, however, drew a blank.

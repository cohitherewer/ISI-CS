The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tourist on treetop
                                                                                                               Tourist on treetop
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 22: A Frenchman perched himself on a banyan tree at the Sudder Street-Chowringhee crossing late last night, saying he would rather stay there than be cooped up in a Sudder Street lodge.        
	Clad only in underwear  he had left his jeans and T-shirt behind while climbing up  a sobbing Vernier Tess, 21, was finally forced down by officers of the New Market police station and fire services personnel.        
	Tess, visiting the city for a few days, admitted that he had run out of money, and the treetop, with the cool breeze blowing, seemed a fine option.        
	Firefighters reached the spot with ladders around 12.30am today, almost an hour after some passers-by called the police.        
	When he was brought down, the youth broke down. A crowd, which included a few foreigners, had gathered around the tree by then. The people tried to console him and he was fine in a few minutes. He then climbed on a roadside bench and demanded to know why he had been brought down against his wishes, a senior police officer said.         
	He also wanted to know if this was the way Indians treated foreigners. He accused us of violating his freedom and threatened to lodge a complaint.        
	As if standing on a pulpit, Tess, sporting a plait, then began to address the crowd. He said that in his country, no one would have bothered a person wanting to spend a night on a tree.        
	Done with the speech, the Frenchman dropped a bombshell. He said he wanted to meet Karisma Kapoor since she was the only person who could understand his plight, the officer said.        
	During interrogation, Tess said he was learning to play the tabla at the Benaras Hindu University and had come to Calcutta a few days ago.         
	Tess also showed the police his French passport.         
	When some officers suggested that he be taken to an asylum, Tess shot back: Why, you feel I am mad?        
	Finally, some foreigners took him to the Salvation Army guesthouse where they were staying.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Sept. 27: Two Trinamul Congress MLAs and a Naxalite leader today arrived in Katwa and pledged support to the farmers opposing land acquisition for a thermal power plant.        
	 The farmers have invited Mamata Banerjee to join the protest against the governments attempt to grab 1,033 acres of multi-crop land. We have promised all support to the Katwa movement, MLA Saugata Ray said.         
	In Calcutta, leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee said: If we succeed in stalling the acquisition in Katwa, it would add to Trinamuls credibility as farmers friend before elections.         
	Ray, fellow MLA Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay and Purnendu Bose held a rally at Koshigram, one of the 14 mouzas to be acquired for the 1,320MW plant. Around 1,000 farmers attended the meeting, around 180km from Calcutta.         
	A few days ago, CPM activists had beaten up some of the farmers who refused to give their land. The government hasnt learnt from its mistakes in Singur and Nandigram. It is committing the same blunder in Katwa, Chatterjee said.        
	Let the farmers decide whether to give their plots, the government shouldnt apply force. We are extending full support to them, he added.        
	The four-day hearing for the acquisition of 350 acres in the first phase ended on Thursday with only 10 farmers of the 358 giving their consent.         
	The hearing had been announced after all mainline political parties in the area except Trinamul and SUCI accepted the governments compensation package for landlosers and vowed to convince farmers about the necessity of the project.        
	Many among the unwilling farmers in Katwa are supporters of the Congress, the majority party in the area whose MLA was among those to have approved of the compensation.        
	Sunil Saha, 40, of Koshigram, who owns over 6 acres, said he could not think of parting with the land that his family had tilled for generations. Saha and Mahesh Ghosh, 30, of Debkundu were beaten up by suspected CPM supporters on Tuesday while waiting outside the block to formally register their objection to the acquisition.        
	Plea to Priya         
	About 100 farmers who have given their land for the Tata Motors plant in Singur today called on Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi with a request to take up the protests against the project with the Prime Minister.         
	A former Trinamul chief of the Beraberi gram panchayat, Kushal Saha, was among the Singur villagers who met Das Munshi. We wanted Didi to accept the new compensation package instead of carrying on with the agitation. But she sidelined us in the party. We want the factory to come up at any cost, he said.         
	Das Munshi said he would talk to the Prime Minister.        
	The state Congress president will address a rally in Singur tomorrow.

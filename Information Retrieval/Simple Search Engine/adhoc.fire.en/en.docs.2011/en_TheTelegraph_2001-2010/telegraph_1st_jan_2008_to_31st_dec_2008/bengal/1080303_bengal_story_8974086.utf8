	Santiniketan, March 2: Police tonight arrested a night guard at the Visva-Bharati University guesthouse on the charge of raping a tribal woman.        
	Sanjay Roychowdhury, 41, was picked up from the Purbapalli guesthouse at 9.45pm.         
	Roychowdhury had raped the 32-year-old married woman, who works at the guesthouse as a cleaner, on the night of February 29, the police said.        
	We received a complaint from the victim today and arrested Roychowdhury, superintendent of police Lakshmi Narayan Meena said.         
	An investigation has been started and a medical examination of the victim will be conducted tomorrow, he added.        
	Roychowdhury alleged he had been framed. On the night of February 29, I had gone to the woman to ask for some vegetable curry as I had brought only rice from home. Nothing untoward happened. I cannot understand why I am being accused of such a serious crime. I am innocent, he said.        
	This is the second time in three months that crime has tainted Santiniketan.         
	On January 6, 23-year-old Saswati Pal, a student of Sangeet Bhavan, was shot by her spurned lover at the Ananda Sadan girls hostel. Amaresh Kundu, a Calcutta Police driver, pumped bullets into his head after killing Saswati.

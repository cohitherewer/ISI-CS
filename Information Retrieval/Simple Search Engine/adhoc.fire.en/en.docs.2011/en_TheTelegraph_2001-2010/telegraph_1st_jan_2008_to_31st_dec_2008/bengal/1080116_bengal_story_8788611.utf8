	Rajabhatkhawa (Jalpaiguri), Jan. 15: A baby elephant was dragged 900 metres and cut to pieces by a speeding goods train here last night.
    
	The driver was allegedly not following the rules laid down for trains passing through forests, which include speed limits. An FIR has been filed against him.
    
	Around 1.55am, an elephant herd was roaming the area, part of the Buxa Tiger Reserve, when the train heading towards Assam from Siliguri sucked in the 10-month-old animal standing next to the tracks.
    
	The driver did not stop the train. The railway guard at the nearby level crossing was witness to the incident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Belpahari nurses wary of village duty
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Belpahari nurses wary of village duty

	Belpahari, Oct. 26: The 24 nurses who stayed in the quarters of the Belpahari health centre with Bharati Majhi have said they are too scared to go to villages after the Maoist blast.        
	Bharati died on October 22 in an explosion in Belpahari while she and Dr Dhaniram Mandi were returning from a routine medical trip to some villages.         
	Hiralal Bishai, the Binpur-II block medical officer of health, said: The auxiliary nurses (recruited specifically for the mobile medical team) are very frightened after the blast that killed one of their colleagues and a doctor. We have been forced to stop the health check-ups as well as the vaccination and immunisation programmes after the attack.        
	The Tata Sumo carrying Mandi, Bharati and the driver had a red cross on it, but the Maoists still triggered the milk-can bombs.        
	The health centre in Belpahari, a Maoist hotbed, has 15 beds, but almost always an excess of 50 patients.         
	One way out for the ailing villagers is to lie outside the building on string cots borrowed for Rs 25 from a tea stall near the health centre.        
	But lying under a tree has its risks.         
	The birds are a problem, said 27-year-old Mamoni Murmu, a labourers wife who came to the health centre with high fever. They dirty our food, clothes and beds.         
	For safety, she keeps a torch. Not to spot Maoists, but scorpions and snakes. One day, I was getting off my khatia and found a scorpion near my slippers. There may be snakes too, Mamoni said.        
	The other option is to go to the sub-divisional hospital in Jhargram, 50km away.         
	Most villagers are too poor  they are labourers or small farmers  to make the journey.         
	There is no bed empty at the health centre, so I had to hire a khatia from the tea stall, said Sumoni Soren, who brought her seven-month- old son to the health centre last week but did not get a bed. Panchet has fever and travelled 20km from Menirdihi village on a cycle van.         
	What else can I do? We cant afford to go to Jhargram, the mother said.        
	The hospitals most sophisticated equipment is an X-ray machine and the most complicated procedure done here is a Caesarean Section.         
	The health authorities know about the state of affairs at the health centre. There is talk of upgrading it to a 60-bed rural hospital.

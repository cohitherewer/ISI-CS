          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Haldia, Sept. 16: Nearly 250 farmers in East Midnapores Geonkhali today gave their written consent to land acquisition for a shipyard.        
	Additional district magis-trate Srikumar Tarafdar said 246 landowners of Bhangagora and Badur mouzas  two of the four identified for acquisition  gave their nod to the takeover of 176 acres.        
	We are hopeful that the land will be acquired smoothly, Tarafdar added.        
	In the earlier hearing in August, 89 farmers from Babupur mouza had refused to part with their land.        
	There were some dissenting voices today as well, with 23 farmers landing up with about 50 people and banners and festoons saying they would not give farmland for industry.        
	Tarafdar said: We are not in a hurry. Well try to convince the unwilling farmers. We want to know their demands.        
	About 500 acres are required for the project to be developed by Bharati Shipyard and the Apeejay Group.        
	Those who promised their land today were happy at the prospect of industries coming up in the area. Abdul Rezzak, whose 10 acres at Bhangagora will be acquired, said: The project will generate jobs and make this place better.        
	Bhaktihari Das, also from Bhangagora, will not give his land because he feels his sons will have nothing to do once it goes. I grow 2,400kg of paddy, vegetables and betel leaves every year. I have a pond where I catch fish. Once they go, who will guarantee work for my three sons? asked Das, 66.        
	According to rules, a landloser will get the market price of the plot, a 30 per cent solatium and an extra 10 per cent. The administration, however, is yet to announce the market price. Sources said Bharati and Apeejay were likely to announce additional benefits.

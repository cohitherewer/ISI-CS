The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha bent on Delhi trip
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Morcha bent on Delhi trip
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Darjeeling, July 8: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has ignored Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees call for talks and is trying, instead, to cash in on the part of his letter that says he is not averse to tripartite talks, along with the Centre.         
	In a faxed message to the chief minister, Morcha leader Bimal Gurung today said: I am delighted that you have responded positively and agreed to accept our proposal for the tripartite meeting. I now look forward to meeting you in New Delhi.         
	Responding to a Morcha letter, Bhattacharjee had written: I accept your proposal for a tripartite meeting to discuss your demands.         
	But the chief ministers reply had also said it would be fruitful if a meeting at the bipartite level preceded the talks in Delhi.         
	The Morcha, however, has completely ignored the second part.        
	Gurung today wrote: I would now request you to communicate your acceptance for a tripartite meeting to the Union home ministers office, too, so that an early solution to the issue of Gorkhaland can be met.... I am also taking this liberty of sending a copy of your letter dated July 6 to the Union home minister, Shivraj Patil.         
	Morcha leaders felt that after reading Bhattacharjees letter, Patil would press the state government to convene a tripartite meeting.         
	At a meeting with Morcha leaders, Gurung wrote, the Union home minister had agreed to tripartite talks and had added that the initiative should come from your (Bhattacharjees) good office.         
	Party general secretary Roshan Giri said: We have already met the chief minister thrice and we now hope to meet him in Delhi.        
	State home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti confirmed having received Gurungs letter.         
	But it says nothing about the bipartite meeting. They (Morcha) have once again requested the state government to facilitate a tripartite meeting in Delhi, he said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, July 20: A 10-year-old saw her unconscious mother being hanged from the ceiling fan by her two uncles and her statement prompted police in Nadias Nabadwip to register a murder case.         
	Class IV student Susmita Ghoshs mentally unstable father was not at home when her mother Rupa, 35, was killed on Friday. Her brother Dipankar, who is in Class VI, was in school.        
	Police said Susmita, who had skipped school, was at a neighbours place when she heard her uncles quarrel with her mother. I did not take it seriously as they often fought with my mother, the girl said. But after sometime, I heard something heavy fall and I rushed home.        
	Through a window slit, Susmita saw her uncles Biren, 35, and Milan, 30, hanging her mothers body with her aunt Shikha helping them.        
	I was too scared to scream. I watched in horror what they were doing, said Susmita. But she could not take it after some time. Susmita cried out and her uncles came to console her.        
	They started crying and said my mother had committed suicide. But I had seen everything, said Susmita. She tore herself from her uncles and started screaming that her mother had been killed.        
	The inspector in charge of Nabadwip police station, about 100km from Calcutta, said the girl had nerves of steel. Although crying, she told us everything in detail. She is the prime witness to her mothers murder, Pradyut Banerjee said.        
	Alerted by Susmita, neighbours arrived and brought her mothers body down. But Biren, Shikha and Milan had fled by then. They are still missing.        
	A neighbour of the Ghoshes, Satyen Mondal, 40, said Susmita had told them how her uncles had hanged her mother. We were stunned. But she was sure about what she was saying, said the garment trader.        
	Police officers working on the case said the 10-year-old did not falter once while giving her statement. We have recorded the statement and registered the case on the basis of it and circumstantial evidence, said Banerjee.        
	A preliminary inquiry has revealed that Susmitas father Manohar, 43, had been deprived of the land left behind by his father. Biren and Milan had been taking advantage of Manohars mental instability, an officer said.        
	Suren Ghosh died a year ago after distributing his over 13-acre plot among his four sons equally. The eldest, Kishore, 48, lives separately. It appears that Rupa used to protest against what Biren and Milan were up to and felt humiliated the way her husband was treated. Her in-laws were angry with her, the officer said.

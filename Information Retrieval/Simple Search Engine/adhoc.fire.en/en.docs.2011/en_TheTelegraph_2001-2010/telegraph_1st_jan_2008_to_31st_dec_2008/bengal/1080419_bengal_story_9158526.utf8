          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, April 18: Around 100 miners today ransacked the office of Eastern Coalfield Limiteds general manager after chunks of coal fell on two colleagues and grievously injured them.        
	Bhagaban Chowdhury, 49, and Madhu Bauri, 47, were cutting coal at the north Searsole colliery in Ranigunj, 230km from Calcutta, when the incident occurred around 8am.        
	They were rushed to the ECL hospital in Asansol.         
	As soon as the news spread, workers from the coal mines in the area marched into GM Indrajit Ghoshs office. They flung chairs in the air, overturned tables and computer sets and smashed windowpanes. Ghosh was not in the room.         
	We are forced to work in a death trap but the authorities are not bothered. The number of accidents has been increasing but no steps have been taken despite repeated appeals, alleged Srikanta Tafadar, one of the protesters.         
	Police and jawans of the Central Industrial Security Force arrived around 10.30am and chased the workers away.         
	The incident is unfortunate. We have ordered a probe into the mishap. The workers ransacked our office and damaged government property. I have asked the police to take necessary steps, said ECL official Ishwar Mehta.

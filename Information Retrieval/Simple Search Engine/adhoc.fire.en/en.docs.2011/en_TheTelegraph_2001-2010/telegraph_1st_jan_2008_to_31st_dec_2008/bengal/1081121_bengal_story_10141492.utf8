	Calcutta/Chinsurah, Nov. 20: Dunlop officials today met labour minister Mrinal Banerjee to discuss the suspension of work at the Hooghly factory.         
	Some officials came to Writers Buildings to meet me today. They said the company had lost several orders because of the global meltdown and so, had to stop production. I told them to speak to the unions and get back, said Banerjee. Writers sources said the government may meet unions and Dunlop officials next week.

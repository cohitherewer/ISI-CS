	Jan. 19: A visiting Union minister picked holes in Bengals flu-fighting efforts on a day the state government failed to keep its promise of starting instant payment to farmers.
    
	Theres a communication gap. The Centre has reason to believe that the compensation to the owners of culled birds is not being given in a proper manner and this is hampering the entire culling process, junior health and family welfare minister Panabaka Lakshmi said in Calcutta today.
    
	Her comments came hours after state officials said it would take a few more days to begin paying farmers on the spot  an incentive that was scheduled to start today. In the event, the expected fillip to culling never came and the operation continued to crawl.
    
	Lakshmi also accused Bengal of keeping Delhi in the dark about whether the states government hospitals had the infrastructure to fight a human epidemic.
    
	She said she had received reports that the isolation wards at Rampurhat subdivisional hospital and the Basoa health centre, both in Birbhums worst-hit belt, did not have a single ventilator. 
    
	Over the past few days, the Centre has sent 15 ventilators to the state government for use in isolation wards, Lakshmi said. She reached Santiniketan this evening and will visit Rampurhat tomorrow.
    
	Bengal animal resource development minister Anisur Rahman spoke of a new measure from tomorrow that might further slow down culling but was necessary for human safety.
    
	He said villagers were not covering their hands or faces while carrying poultry to the culling spots, so the rapid response teams would travel door-to-door and collect the birds.
    
	Rahman added that arrangements had been made to distribute Tamiflu tablets among villagers in the affected areas, though no human patients had been detected so far.
    
	They should take the capsules as a precaution. The culling team members, too, are taking the capsules.
    
	Lakshmi said the Centre suspected that the virus had arrived from Bangladesh. The two affected villages in Nadia  Kanainagar and Paschimpara  are just 2km from the border.
    
	Cull team attacked
    
	Five officials returning from a culling operation at Ward 1 in Nalhati, Birbhum, were attacked at Ward 16 by a mob that asked them why they had killed the birds. Biplab Ojha, civic chief of Nalhati, about 270km from Calcutta, said the five officials had been admitted to Rampurhat hospital. 
    
	In Murshidabad, three persons were arrested while smuggling out 1,000 chickens and ducks on a truck from bird flu-hit Khargram. 
    
	They said they had bought the chickens at Rs 10-20 a kg and were ferrying them to Jharkhand, an officer said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Sept. 18: A major accident was averted early this morning when a cabin man spotted sparks emanating from underneath a bogie of the speeding Delhi-bound Brahmaputra Mail and alerted the station manager.        
	The train was brought to a halt at Chamagram station on orders from the control room in Malda. Senior engineers, who carried out a check, said the brakes on the wheels of the 10th bogie from the engine had jammed.         
	The wheels were being dragged along the rails, generating heat and causing the sparks.         
	I heard a loud screeching noise and saw sparks flying below the train. As the train sped by, I smelt burning metal. I immediately alerted the station manager, cabin man Kailash Mondal said.        
	The engineers said that had the fault been detected a little later, the train could have derailed. There were 72 passengers in the bogie.        
	The incident took place around 4.30am, 20 minutes after the train, originating from Guwahati, left Malda Town station.         
	Chamagram station manager Ananta Kumar Jana told reporters that on getting the message from the cabin man, he alerted the control room, which told him to put the signal down so the train would stop.        
	The train had to wait for over three hours as another bogie had to be brought from Malda station after engineers failed to repair the brakes that had jammed. The train left Chamagram at 8.11am.         
	The railway engineers said the wheel and axle boxes of the coach had got burnt because of the excessive heat generated from friction.        
	Accident kills girl        
	A BCom first year student was killed in Kharagpur this morning when the auto-rickshaw she was in overturned while trying to swerve past a dog lying on the road.         
	The accident occurred near the IIT campus around 7.30am. Manti Biswas, 19, died on the spot.        
	A group of around 200 residents thrashed the auto driver, Mujibar Mullick, 32, after tying him up with a rope inside a local club. Police arrived and rescued Mullick.         
	The residents blocked the Kesiari-Midnapore road for four hours.

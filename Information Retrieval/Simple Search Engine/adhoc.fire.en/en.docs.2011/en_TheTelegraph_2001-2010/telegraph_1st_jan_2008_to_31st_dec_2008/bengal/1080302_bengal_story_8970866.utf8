The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Smooth sailing on CBSE Day I
                                                                                                               Smooth sailing on CBSE Day I
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 1: Candidates of CBSE X and XII examinations had no problem with the new high order thinking skill (HOTS) questions introduced by the board this year.         
	The 2008 CBSE exams began today with Class X students writing their IT paper and those in Class XII taking their chemistry test.        
	The announcement that 20 per cent of the questions would be based on high order thinking skills had led to confusion. The new pattern was to measure the students ability to reason, analyse and evaluate information in physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, political science, history and economics for Class XII, and languages, social science, math and science for Class X.         
	A teacher said Class XII candidates were earlier asked direct questions on metal extraction in chemistry.         
	This year, the question was: What chemical principle is involved in choosing the reducing agent for getting the metal from oxide ore? Consider the metal oxide as aluminium(3)oxide and ferric oxide. Justify the choice of reducing agent in each case.         
	Presidency hoax        
	A police dog scanned classrooms at Presidency College this morning after an anonymous person called its office to say a bomb had been planted. It turned out to be a hoax.

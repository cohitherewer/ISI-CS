                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Manipur militants held in heart of city
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 7: Police and military intelligence picked up seven alleged Manipuri militants from an auction house here this evening, claiming they were planning to extort money from the bidders.        
	The young men, detained for questioning, are suspected members of the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (Prepak-Shanti), which had claimed responsibility for a grenade explosion in front of the Manipur chief ministers bungalow in Imphal last month.        
	The groups leader is lieutenant T. Kantha Singh, a man in his early 30s, who had been staying at a Madhyamgram address with aide Abiyoma Singh for the past one month, officers of city polices special task force (STF) said.        
	The other five apparently arrived a week ago and checked into lodges in and around Chowringhee.        
	Today, the group turned up at an auction house on Lenin Sarani, near Jyoti cinema, after learning that old vehicles belonging to the Border Roads Organisation were to go under the hammer.        
	Only the auction was being held in Calcutta  the vehicles were in the Northeast and most of the bidders came from that region, sources said.        
	The alleged militants, who were unarmed, planned to intimidate the successful bidders into agreeing to pay them a percentage of their bids after returning home, said a senior official of military intelligence, Eastern Command.        
	The idea was to extort money from Northeast businessmen who were planning to buy the vehicles. Kanthas job in Calcutta was to oversee any Northeast-related auction in the city and then extort money, the official said.        
	Jawed Shamim, the city detective chief, however, said: We have detained them for interrogation. If Manipur police inform us about their criminal antecedents, we will arrest them and produce them in court. As of now, there are no city links.        
	Last year, two Manipuri students  alleged Prepak members wanted in their home state  were arrested in Calcutta.        
	Officers said a sum of Rs 15 lakh was seized from the group, of which Kantha was carrying Rs 9 lakh. Kantha, they added, was a founder-member of one of Prepaks many wings, the United People Liberation of Kangliapak.        
	One of the others, Chittaranjan Singh, was a senior member of the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA)  Prepaks armed wing  and oversaw the outfits finances, sources said.        
	The joint police-army team, wearing ordinary clothes, arrived at the auction house around 5.30pm and surprised the seven before the others at the venue could realise what was happening, the sources said. The young men were being questioned late tonight.        
	Their photographs have been sent to the Manipur police. A team from Manipur is scheduled to arrive tomorrow and once they produce the charges against the seven, the detainees will be arrested, a senior STF officer said.

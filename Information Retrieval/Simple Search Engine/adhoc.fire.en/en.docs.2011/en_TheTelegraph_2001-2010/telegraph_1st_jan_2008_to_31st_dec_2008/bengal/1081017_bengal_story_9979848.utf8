	Tamluk, Oct. 16: Suspected Trinamul Congress supporters beat up a police inspector when he went to disperse a clashing mob in Khejuri, neighbouring Nandigram.        
	Circle inspector Pranab Chatterjee lost three teeth.         
	Police said he led a force to Vidyamandir village in Khe- juri, about 175km from Calcutta, around 2am when Trinamul and CPM supporters were hurling bombs and firing at each other.         
	When Chatterjee ordered a lathicharge to disperse the warring groups, the alleged Trinamul activists turned on him. Chatterjee, who received several blows on his face, had to be admitted to the Contai Sub-divisional Hospital.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A rickshaw parked in Jaipur on Thursday. (AFP)                                  
	Malda, May 15: Last month, Abdul Mannan left his village in Harishchandrapur, Malda, for Jaipur to earn some extra money for the education of his children. On Tuesday, the rickshaw-puller was killed in one of the blasts in Jaipur.         
	Mannan, 30, was among 40 men from the Borai gram panchayat area to go to Jaipur. He was a labourer in Malda.        
	At least three of them were injured in the explosions and are in hospital. Three-four others are missing.        
	Mannans wife and three children were inconsolable after the news of death reached Nihar village, over 100km from Malda town, today. The pradhan of the Borai gram panchayat, Ankhi Begum, said a man called Sheikh Belal rang up to inform about Mannans the death.         
	Belal, who hails from Borai, said the body was in the morgue in a Jaipur hospital.        
	Mannans elder son Mukaddar, who is in Class VIII, and one of his brothers, Ibrahim Sheikh, have left for Jaipur.        
	Mini Parvin, Mannans wife, said: He went to Jaipur only a month ago to earn some extra money to meet the rising expenses of our childrens education. He had sent Rs 4,000 this month. We never dreamt we would have to carry his body back.

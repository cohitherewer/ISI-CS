          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Aug. 16: The state government has said the Calcutta High Court order in the Rizwanur Rahman case was an emotional judgment and that it would contest Thursdays ruling.        
	The court has allowed the CBI to file chargesheets against seven persons, including Rizwanurs father-in-law Ashok Todi, his brother Pradip and three police officers, for abetment of suicide        
	But Subrata Mukhopadhyay, the junior counsel for the state, said: There has been no trial and unless this is done no one can be seen as guilty of abetment of suicide. This is clearly an emotional judgment.        
	The court has also termed the city polices attempts to arm-twist the couple unconstitutional and inhuman.

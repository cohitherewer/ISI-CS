                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Girl left alone in swap row
          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE                                           The baby in the nursing home      
	Asansol, Nov. 18: The parents of a girl born in a nursing home have refused to accept the child, alleging a baby swap.         
	Rina Kundu had given birth to a girl on October 29, five hours after a daughter was born to Aparna Majhi. But the nurse on duty, by mistake, put Aparnas name on the stickers of both babies.         
	The error was detected when Rinas baby was referred to a private hospital after developing a respiratory problem.         
	I rushed back to the nur-sing home and lodged a comp-laint of baby swap, said Rinas husband, Dilip Kundu, a diploma engineer. He also lodged a police complaint on October 30.         
	The baby is left in the private hospital, which is looking after her.         
	The baby has now recovered. Our hospital staff are taking good care of her. But for how long? asked Ramen Bhattacharya, its administrator.        
	Bhattacharya said he had contacted Dilip over the phone twice but he simply refused to take the baby. We have sent a letter by registered post.         
	Aparnas family has not lodged any complaint, but Rinas husband said: I will not take the baby home unless it is conclusively proved that she is my biological child.        
	Asansol subdivisional officer (SDO) Debashish Sarkar yesterday held a meeting with Dilips lawyer, police officials and the hospital authorities after Bhattacharya approached him last week.         
	But Dilips lawyer, Kaliram Mukherjee, demanded a legal solution and the police today moved the court of the additional chief judicial magistrate, pleading that a DNA test be conducted and Rina breastfeed the baby on humanitarian grounds.        
	Mukherjee accepted the DNA test plea. We want it to be proved beyond doubt that the girl child was born to Rina Kundu, he said.        
	Judge Jitendra Kumar Gupta heard both sides but reserved his judgment.

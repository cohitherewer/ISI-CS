          OUR BUREAU                              
	Dec. 22: Mamata Banerjee has asked her party leaders in Nandigram to ensure the participation of Congress leaders in her campaign for the Assembly bypoll on January 5.        
	The Congress has stayed away from the campaign even after pledging support to the Trinamul Congress candidate because of the partys alleged high-handedness.         
	Our workers should be polite and gentle while involving Congress workers in a joint campaign. We should not do anything that might hurt them, Mamata was quoted as telling her aides this morning while discussing her visit to Nandigram.         
	Firoza Bibi, whose son was killed in the March 14 police firing last year, is our candidate and the state Congress has promised to back her. So we should see to it that local Congress workers join us.        
	Observers saw Mamatas wooing of the Congress in Nandigram as an attempt to send a message to her party across the state: build bridges with the Congress with an eye on the 2009 Lok Sabha polls.         
	East Midnapore Trinamul chief Sisir Adhikary said Congress supporters in Nandigram were hurt at the way some local Trinamul leaders had behaved with them.         
	Adhikary, the MLA from neighbouring Egra, said party workers had been asked to ensure Nandigrams anti-CPM vote bank remained intact. Although we have swept the rural polls here, the Congress has a considerable presence.        
	Nandigram Congress leaders accused Trinamul of taking their support for granted. They have been ignoring us since we pledged our support to their nominee. They sent us a letter on December 18 with a directive to come to their party office, said Sheikh Asrafultullah, the Youth Congress chief in Nandigram. Ours is a national party and we cannot accept Trinamuls diktats.        
	Sobuj Pradhan, a Congress leader who is also joint convener of the Trinamul-led Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee, said a joint campaign would be possible only if Trinamul changes its dictatorial attitude.         
	The Trinamul vice-president of Nandigram panchayat samiti accused the Congress of making an issue out of nothing. But Abu Taher added: We want them with us.

          OUR BUREAU                               
	Calcutta, April 2: The state poll panel today said the panchayat elections would be held between May 11 and 18. The results will be out on May 21.        
	Although the notification on the polls is yet to be issued, we have come to know from the government that they will be held on May 11, 14 and 18. We have given the necessary instructions in this regard to the officials associated with electioneering in the districts, state election commissioner Ashok Gupta said.        
	He has asked the government for at least two armed personnel in each of the 45,000 polling booths. We need a large deployment of forces before and after the polls, he said.        
	Sources at Writers Buildings said the Left Front would put its seal of approval on the dates at a meeting on Saturday. The Front will then request the government to issue the notification, said an official associated with the chief ministers secretariat.         
	Home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said the government had requested the Centre for 100 companies of the Central Reserve Police Force before the elections. We have requested the Centre to send 100 companies of the CRPF in the run-up to the polls. If all the polling booths are to be manned by two armed guards, we would require more forces. In that case, we might have to bring in forces from other states, he added.        
	The government is yet to declare the list of sensitive booths, which might require more than two policemen.         
	Chief secretary A.K. Deb will hold an emergency meeting on Monday with all the district magistrates and superintendents of police. Its main task will be to prepare the list of roads and bridges to be repaired before the polls so that voters have easy access to booths.

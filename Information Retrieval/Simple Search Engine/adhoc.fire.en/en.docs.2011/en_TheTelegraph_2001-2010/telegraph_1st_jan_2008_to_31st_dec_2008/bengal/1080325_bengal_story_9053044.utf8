	Krishnagar, March 24: A retired headmaster killed himself in a Nadia village last night after being told by his son and daughter-in-law to mind his own business.        
	Deben Das, 65, had tried to intervene during a quarrel between Dipen, 30, and Durgarani, 25, over the renovation of their house.         
	To calm his son, Das said the house belonged to him and he should have the final say.        
	A note found in his panjabi pocket said: Nobodys responsible for my death.

	Midnapore, Dec. 9: A slew of tribal bodies today warned the community against Maoists who were taking advantage of your poverty.         
	The Bharat Jakat Majhi Marwa called for unity. We want to warn those trying to mislead the tribals and causing bloodshed that we will unite and fight them, its leader, Nityananda Hembram, told a gathering of about 6,000 in West Midnapores Belpahari.        
	Another leader, Manasaram Mandi, slammed the Maoists for killing a doctor and a nurse of the Belpahari health centre in October. They have repeatedly killed tribals and blown up roads. Dont give them shelter. Drive them away.        
	Maoists were believed to be leading the anti-government agitation in nearby Lalgarh.

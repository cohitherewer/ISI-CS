The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Delay bill: Rs 1 crore a day
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Delay bill: Rs 1 crore a day
          OUR BUREAU                          Cost clock ticking: The Singur plant                                  
	Sept. 1: Tata Motors and its vendors are losing close to Rs 1 crore every day since work at Singur was stopped on Friday after suspected Trinamul Congress supporters roughed up some of the personnel and prevented them from entering the factory.        
	Work at the plant remains suspended. The conditions in Singur (are) still not conducive for resuming work, a Tata spokesperson said this morning.        
	Sources said some officials tried to enter the factory even today but were prevented by the protesters.        
	Mamata Banerjee said in the evening that the Tatas should resume work, but the company was cautious in its response. No official communication came on whether work will resume tomorrow.         
	But the frustration at losing precious workdays was palpable in the Tata camp. Something has to happen in a day or two, said an official.        
	Tata Motors has invested about Rs 1,500 crore in the plant and completed 85-90 per cent of the work.         
	For the company, the loss is more on the cost of capital and opportunity cost (the re-turn the investment would have fetched had it been put elsewhere).        
	For the vendors, the loss is more direct. Of the 55 vendors, five, which have got their units ready, face the same predicament as Tata Motors.        
	We are waiting for the plant to start. It is already delayed. Our investment is sitting idle while we pay interest costs, an official of an ancillary unit said.        
	For the 50 vendors whose units are in different stages of construction, the suspension of work will escalate costs.        
	The delay means the Singur plant will not go into production as anticipated. There is a huge opportunity cost for not being able to bring the product in the market in time from the most cost-effective production site, a source familiar with the plant said.        
	The project has already witnessed a significant cost overrun. It has gone up from Rs 1,250 crore to about Rs 1,700 to 1,800 crore.        
	Tata Motors is said to have asked its vendors to be ready with components for about 1,500 cars by September 8. They have not told us the location (of the production site), said a vendor official.        
	There is a possibility that the company might use its Pantnagar plant in Uttarakhand to roll out the Nano in October.        
	Tata Industries managing director Kishore Chaukar hinted at the possibility in Hyderabad. I suppose that the Nano cars could be made at the Uttarakhand plant but as our chairman has said it again and again, there is no plan B for contingencies.        
	For many young Singur hands, forced to stay at home because of the siege, the wait seems endless.        
	Abhisekh Dutta, (name changed on request), who is on a 15-month apprenticeship at the car plant, said: All of us want to resume work but cant. The authorities have told us to wait. We are waiting for their phone call.         
	For day labourers like Sanatan, 32, Haripada, 29, and Sukumar, 45, the condition is worse. A days work lost means a loss of Rs 80 to 100 and an uncertain tomorrow.         
	If this continues, we will have to starve, said Sanatan.

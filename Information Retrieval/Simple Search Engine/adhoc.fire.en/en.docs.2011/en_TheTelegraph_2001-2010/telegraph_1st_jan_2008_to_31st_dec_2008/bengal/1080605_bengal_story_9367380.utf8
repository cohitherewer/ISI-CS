                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Citu locks up Haldia factory
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Haldia, June 4: Citu leaders today shut down a Haldia factory for several hours after driving out its 240 permanent employees around 1pm to press its demand for a hike casual workers wages.         
	Manaksia Ltd, which makes aluminium coils and foils and has an annual turnover of Rs 100 crore, began production in the unit last year.         
	The CPMs labour arm let the factory re-open around 5.30pm but its supporters laid siege to the main entrance till late tonight.        
	If Citu behaves in such an irresponsible manner, we will have to close down the factory and shift elsewhere, said Saurav Chatterjee, a senior manager of the company.        
	Talks to settle the dispute over the hike failed this afternoon, prompting the sudden strike. Local MP Lakshman Seth, also a Citu leader, was present at the meeting.        
	According to Chatterjee, the union demanded that the wages be raised to Rs 4,830 from Rs 2,000 a month. We agreed to pay Rs 3,008 and asked for eight months to review their wages further. But the union stuck to its demand.

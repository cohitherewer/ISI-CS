	Chandernagore, Jan. 27: A boy from Hooghly fell 25 feet on a rock and died after his rope snapped during a climbing class in Purulia yesterday.        
	Abhijit Ghosh, 19, of Duplex Patti near Chandernagore, was among 53 youths taken to Joychondi hill for the three-day course.        
	He was climbing down the hill when he fell. Trainer Tarun Mondal, a resident of Chandernagore, took him to a Raghunathpur hospital with injuries in the chest and head. He was declared dead there.        
	Abhijit was a first-year arts student of Chandernagore College.         
	Purulia superintendent of police Ashok Prasad said no probe had been ordered since no complaint had been lodged.         
	Trainer Mondal called up Abhijits family around 4pm yesterday to inform them about the death.         
	Father Nimai, who runs a press in his house, said Abhijit should have been given a helmet. He also didnt have a rope tied around his waist. Well lodge a complaint of negligence against the trainer.

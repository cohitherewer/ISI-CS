The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Basu buzz on Somnath
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Basu buzz on Somnath
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 11: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Nirupam Sen met Jyoti Basu this evening, fuelling speculation they discussed whether Somnath Chatterjee should step down as Speaker before the July 22 trust vote.        
	Left Front partners feel Bhattacharjee and Sen, members of the CPM politburo, could have urged the patriarch to persuade Chatterjee to step down.        
	The perception gained ground as the Bolpur MP, who reveres the former chief minister, had accepted the post at Basus urging.        
	However, Sen described the talks as routine and declined to reveal the partys stand on Chatterjee. Whatever Prakash (Karat) has said is our position, he said after the meeting.         
	The Speakers name figures on the list of Left MPs who have ended support to the UPA.         
	CPM general secretary Karat had left the question of continuance of Speaker to Chatterjees wisdom, saying the MP would take an appropriate decision at the appropriate time.        
	CPM leaders pointed out that Chatterjee had resigned from the partys central committee after his election as Speaker in 2004 to uphold constitutional propriety.         
	The RSP and the Forward Bloc have said the Speakers resignation is a logical conclusion of the Lefts withdrawal.         
	As the CPM wrestled with the question, Mamata Banerjee said she would move a no-confidence motion against the Speaker even if the Centre won the trust vote.         
	Somnathbabu has not resigned even 72 hours after the Left leaders submitted their list of MPs to the President. He shouldnt hold the post even for a moment on moral grounds, she said        
	Recalling she had moved a similar motion against former Speaker P.A. Sangma, the Trinamul chief said she was confident of getting the 10 MPs needed for the move.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Barasat, Feb. 22: A couple who allegedly got people to sell their kidney for money were arrested from the northern fringes of Calcutta this evening.        
	A police team picked up Dilip Sen, 45, and his wife Putul, 39, from their house at Gitanjali Pally in Barasat from where two men and a woman have gone missing.        
	The Sens had themselves donated their kidneys, the police said.         
	They allegedly paid a meagre amount to the donors and kept a larger chunk of the money themselves.        
	The couple used to encourage local youths and housewives to donate their kidney for money, said Sugata Sen, the North 24-Parganas additional superintendent of police.        
	Shankar Das, Sukumar Das and Sheela Mondal are missing.        
	Sheelas 15-year-old daughter said her mother hadnt returned home since leaving for an aunts house two days ago. Putul aunty used to visit their house to advise her mother to undergo a gall-bladder operation, she added.        
	Shankars father Nirapada said he knew about his sons recent hobnobbing with the Sens. I got suspicious about the couple when he (Shankar) went missing a week ago, said Nirapada, who has a van-renting business.        
	The police said a probe was on to trace the trio.         
	Dilip, who came to the neighbourhood a year ago, had started a money-lending business and a chit fund. But he suffered losses.         
	About a month back, the police said, Dilip came across a newspaper ad for a kidney donor. He got in touch with the advertiser, Gurdev Singh, a resident of Jamshedpur. Dilip donated his right kidney and made his wife Putul agree to donate one of hers to a Chennai patient, said an officer.        
	The CBI blew the lid off a kidney racket and arrested Delhi doctor Amit Kumar in Nepal earlier this month. Kumar and his brother were accused of misleading poor labourers into sham surgeries and stealing their kidneys.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, July 1: A group D employee of a government hospital allegedly beat up a man today as he could not pay Rs 50 to him to get his daughters wounds dressed.        
	Seven-year-old Priyanka Patra was admitted to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital on June 24 after she fell into a burning cauldron of cattle feed while looking at a helicopter flying to a flood-hit area with relief.        
	Father Joydeb, a small farmer, said the group-D employee  Chandan Hawladar  had been dressing his daughter every day since June 25 and charging him Rs 50.        
	Today, when he came to dress the wound, I told him that I had only Rs 20 on me. He became very angry and told me rudely that I wont have to pay him anything. Then he started removing the old dressing with rough hands. He pulled the cotton swathes from the raw wound in such a way that my daughter started bleeding and she cried out in pain, said Joydeb, a resident of Bamla village in Lalgarh, West Midnapore.        
	When the father protested, Hawladar, who is supposed to change bedspreads and push medicine carts, allegedly hurled abuses and punched him.        
	I could not bear my daughters pain and asked him what he was doing. That was my fault, said Joydeb.        
	Relatives of other patients rushed to my rescue. Nibaran Mahato, who had come to see his son, said: I saw the group D staff slap and punch the man (Joydeb). We rushed and rescued him.        
	Joydeb lodged a complaint with hospital superintendent Swapan Kumar Santra. We have started an inquiry, he said.        
	Doctors said a group D employee is not supposed to dress wounds. It is the nurses job. But group D employees often assist them, a doctor said.        
	Medical college principal Susanta Bandopadhyay added that it was illegal to charge money to dress up wounds in a government hospital. Strong action will be taken if the group-D employee is found guilty.         
	In Calcutta, director of medical education S. Banerjee also promised to look into the matter.        
	A doctor and a nurse dressed Priyankas wounds after todays incident. This is the first time that they have done the job, said her mother Saraswati.

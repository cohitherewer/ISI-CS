	Alipurduar, Dec. 7: Forest guards caught a tea garden worker with five dead flying squirrels on him in the Buxa Tiger Reserve on Friday.         
	According to some forest officers, squirrel skins are in demand as they can be used to make decorative items.         
	The guards were acting on a tip-off on three poachers, but the two others gave them the slip after a chase through the north Bengal forest.         
	Niren Ekka, who works at Rydak Tea Estate, named his two colleagues who were with him and, officials said, raids were on to nab them.

	Bankura: Over 450 chickens have died at a poultry farm in Onda block, 15km from Bankura town.        
	Vets went to Ledashon village today to collect samples of the dead birds. Bankura has a primary testing centre for bird flu, created after the outbreak in January. If we find any indication of the flu, we will send the samples for further tests to Calcutta and Bhopal, said Mihir Satpathy, an animal husbandry department assistant director.

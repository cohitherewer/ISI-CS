	Nandigram, Nov. 9: The people of Nandigram may meet Diego Maradona, if sports minister Subhas Chakraborty keeps his word.        
	At a DYFI rally in Nandigram today, Subhas said: I shall try to bring Maradona to Nandigram by a helicopter.         
	The soccer star will arrive in Calcutta on December 6. Nandigram will vote in an Assembly bypoll at the end of the year.        
	CPM MP Lakshman Seth, who was present, said: We will build the chemical hub in Nayachar. If any one tries to prevent it, the people of Haldia will break their legs.        
	In response to Seths warning, Trinamul Congresss MLA from Contai (south), Subhendu Adhikary, tonight lodged a complaint against Seth in Nandigram police station.

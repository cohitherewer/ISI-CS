                                                                                                               Neglect in school burn
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, March 16: The Nadia primary school council today admitted negligence after a Class I student tumbled into a tub of steaming starch in a school courtyard on Friday.        
	It is the teachers duty to look after students in a primary school. The teachers of Udaichandpur Primary School in Bethuadahari neglected their duty, council chairman Bibhash Biswas said.        
	The condition of six-year-old Puja Nag, who was hospitalised with 40 per cent burns, has turned worse with an infection. She has high fever and breathing problems, said block medical officer Vivek Das.        
	Doctors wanted to shift her to the district hospital in Krishnagar, but her father, a poor farmer, pleaded against it because he cannot afford a trip to the town, about 40km away, every day.        
	Mother Swapna demanded action against the school for its negligence. The starch was kept in the courtyard where over 100 children jostled for playing space next to a makeshift kitchen.        
	Biswas said: Ive summ- oned the teachers tomorrow. The council is empowered to transfer or suspend a teacher. Well take a decision after the inquiry is completed.

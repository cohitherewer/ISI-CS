                                                                                                               Hill strike
                            
	Darjeeling, Feb. 12: Government offices were closed in the hills today following a call for an indefinite shutdown by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha.        
	The toy train service has been suspended.         
	The Morcha is demanding a visit by the parliamentary standing committee looking into the bill to give Sixth Schedule status to the hills. Representatives of the party, whose leader broke away from Subash Ghisinghs GNLF last year, are going to meet government officials in Calcutta tomorrow.         
	Educational institutions, banks, food corporation offices and essential services have been left out of the strike.

                                                                                                               New hurdle to north bench
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 16: The move to open a Calcutta High Court circuit bench in Jalpaiguri has suffered another setback with the administration of the states apex court saying the land allotted for the purpose isnt adequate.        
	The government had acquired 40 acres in Jalpaiguri for the construction of a new building for the bench. The court wants 20 acres more for judges quarters, a library and other facilities.        
	A law department official said acquiring 20 more acres in the same area would be time-consuming.         
	The setting up of the circuit bench has been hanging fire for a long time. Lawyers of Siliguri and Jalpaiguri had fought for over a decade on where it should be located.         
	The Supreme Court and the Centre had approved the bench in north Bengal to cater to litigants in six districts  Malda, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and South and North Dinajpur.         
	A team of high court judges finally decided that the bench should be set up in Jalpaiguri and the government chose the Rajbari, an irrigation office and adjoining areas for the temporary court.        
	A high court official said: A former chief justice had promised that the circuit bench would start functioning as soon as the government started construction of the new building. Accordingly, the government acquired 40 acres in Jalpaiguri and started work.        
	Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar, some of his fellow judges and chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb visited the proposed bench site last month.         
	After the visit, the court administration demanded 20 more acres, a court official said.         
	The government hasnt yet approved acquisition of the additional land.

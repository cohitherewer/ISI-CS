	Calcutta/Singur, Jan. 16: Calcutta High Court will on Friday deliver the verdict of the case on land acquisition in Singur. 
    
	At least five separate petitions were filed before the court challenging the legality of the process adopted by the state during the acquisition of about 1,000 acres in Singur for the small-car plant. 
    
	A division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.K. Ghosh had concluded the hearing in September but adjourned the verdict.
    
	Tata Motors today inducted 80 youths, including some from Singur, as apprentices at the car plant. 
    
	Company officials said the young men had earlier registered themselves with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation.
    
	They underwent either a six-month or a nine-month training programme at various industrial training institutes and the Ramakrishna Shilpa Mandir in Belur.
    
	The apprentices will now undergo a 15-month hands-on training at Tata Motors facilities, an official said.

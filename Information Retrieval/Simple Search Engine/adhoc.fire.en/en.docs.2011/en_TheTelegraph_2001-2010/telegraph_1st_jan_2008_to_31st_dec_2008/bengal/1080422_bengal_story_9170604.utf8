	Jangipara, April 21: Alleged CPM activists today forced two Trinamul Congress candidates from Hooghly to pull out of the panchayat polls.        
	A gang of 25 arrived at the house of Gour Barui and Ananda Ghosh, contestants from the Dilakhas gram panchayat in Jangipara, this morning.         
	They ordered me to go with them to the block development officer and withdraw my nomination. Or else, they said, they wouldnt let my family live in peace, Ghosh said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | College goof-up cloud on 26 students
                                                                                                               College goof-up cloud on 26 students
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 6: An oversight by some Calcutta University colleges, including Presidency, during admission to undergraduate courses has put the future of 26 students in jeopardy.        
	University authorities today cancelled the admission of the 26 as the colleges had not followed CU guidelines.         
	The authorities said the students had been given admission although they did not fulfil some of the universitys admission criteria.        
	For instance, all the 26 students had included their marks in environmental studies in the ISC and CBSE Class XII exams as one of their best five scores while calculating their percentage.        
	The university had issued a circular last year, saying the subject could not be considered as one of the best five while seeking admission to BA, BSc and BCom courses.        
	We had drawn up our guidelines very clearly before the first-year admissions in June-July last year. But many colleges did not follow our rules. We had to reject these irregular admissions, said Shayamal Sarkar, secretary of CUs undergraduate council.        
	The colleges under glare include Presidency College, Ashutosh College, Vivekananda College for Women, Sushil Kar College and Budge Budge College, officials said.        
	The universitys decision has come as a blow to the students, who have completed their first-year classes and are preparing for the Part-I exams in May.         
	The authorities of the colleges had appealed to the university to waive the rules for the 26 students. The request had been placed before the CU undergraduate council.         
	We had been repeatedly telling the colleges for the last few months that they should be careful about admission procedures, Sarkar said.        
	The college heads refused comment.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Maoist mother wages her war
  - Narus amp; Tagore poems face scrutiny in Chhattisgarh jail          RABI BANERJEE                          Anasuya Sen with the children in her kindergarten school. Pictures by Amit Biswas                                        
	Kalyani, June 1: For the past one year, an 82-year-old woman has travelled to a Chhattisgarh prison every month from Bengal to see her son, held on the charge of being a Maoist.        
	Anasuya Sens luggage mostly contains books  from Tagores Gitanjali to Amitav Ghoshs The Shadow Lines  for Binayak, and sometimes narkol narus (sweets made from coconut).        
	But not all of them go past the grille gates. Ghoshs English novel made the cut, not Tagores Nobel winner.         
	The Bengali book was suspected to be Maoist literature, Anasuya said, sitting in her single-storey house in Kalyani, 50km from Calcutta.        
	She has been running a kindergarten school in the town and, of late, a campaign for her sons release.        
	Binayak, 57, a doctor by training, had quit his job as a community medicine teacher at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, in the 1980s to work in backward, tribal-dominated Bilaspur.         
	He was arrested in May last year under two laws that allow detention without right of appeal.                        Anasuya with her sons Binayak (right), Gautam and Deepankar. Gautam (centre) is a math teacher in Istanbul while Deepankar is an engineer with an oil trading company in Belgium      
	Binayak, an alumnus of Calcutta Boys School, did his MBBS and masters in paediatric medicine from Christian Medical College, Vellore. He has been selected for the Jonathan Mann Award for Health and Human Rights in 2008.         
	Four years ago, he got the Paul Harrison award, which is given to the medical colleges alumni for a lifetimes service to the rural poor.         
	Last month, 22 Nobel laureates from across the world wrote to the President and the Prime Minister demanding Binayaks release.         
	Anasuya last visited her son at the Raipur jail a fortnight ago. He told me, Dont worry, Nobel laureates are fighting for my release. Take care of your health, she said.        
	I get a lot of strength and peace from the toddlers (in her school). I need a lot of mental strength to write to people politicians, academics and lawyers  for my sons release, Anasuya said.        
	The widow of an army doctor, Colonel D.P. Sen, teaches the children along with two other tutors. She set up the school 10 years ago after her husbands death.        
	The Chhattisgarh government has illegally detained my son. He could have easily led a cushy life, but he decided to spend his life taking healthcare to the poorest. Does his fight for their rights make him a Maoist?        
	In Bilaspur, Binayak had a free clinic. The national vice-president of the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, he also probed human rights violations and alleged murders by Salwa Judoom, a government-backed force of tribals that fights the Maoists.         
	Like Gitanjali, the jail also barred the entry of Shirshendu Mukhopadhyays Jao Pakhi, which are not even remotely linked to revolutionary literature, said Anasuya.         
	With the help of her friends in Kalyani, she organised at least 10 street-corner meetings in the town in April.        
	I tell people in my locality that I am not the mother of a Maoist but the mother of a doctor who worked for the poor and got a raw deal, she said.         
	Binayak had studied tribal life while in JNU. His wife Ilina is the dean, folk and culture and womens studies, at Mahatma Gandhi Hindi International University in Wardha, Maharashtra.         
	Asit Chakraborty, a professor at Kalyani agricultural university, said: Binayaks mother amazes us with her energy. She lives alone with a help, calls people on the road and tells them about her son to build public support.        
	Fellow Kalyani resident Jyotiprakash Chakraborty, a former professor of economics at Kalyani University and Binayaks friend, said efforts were on to create more awareness about Binayak.         
	The general notion is that our mashima is the mother of a Maoist.

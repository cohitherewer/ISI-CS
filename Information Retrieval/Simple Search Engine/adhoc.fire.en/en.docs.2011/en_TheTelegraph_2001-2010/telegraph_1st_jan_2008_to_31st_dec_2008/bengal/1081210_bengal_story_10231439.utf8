	Calcutta, Dec. 9: The Sarisha Ramakrishna Mission Sarada Mandir in Diamond Harbour today said it was likely to break an 80-year-old tradition and allow teachers to come in coloured saris.        
	Five teachers had revolted against the school dress code of white sari and blouse.         
	School secretary Swami Rajivananda said: I have been instructed by Belur Math not to make an issue of the matter. It appears that we will have to allow the five teachers to wear coloured saris in school.         
	However, he added, that to allow it, we will also have to break an 80-year-old tradition of the school. A formal announcement would be made at a staff council meeting tomorrow.

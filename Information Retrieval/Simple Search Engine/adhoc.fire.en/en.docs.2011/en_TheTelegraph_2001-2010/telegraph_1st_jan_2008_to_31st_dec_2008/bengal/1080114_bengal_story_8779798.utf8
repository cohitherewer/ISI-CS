     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 13: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today confirmed that the Centre had sounded his government on conferring the Bharat Ratna on Jyoti Basu and said his opinion was the same as Prakash Karats. 
    
	CPM general secretary Karat today iterated the partys opposition to state awards. 
    
	What (do) we have to with (the) Bharat Ratna? Our leaders do not accept state awards. This is our partys stated stand, he told The Telegraph after the Brigade rally. 
    
	Asked if Delhi had got in touch with him over the award, Bhattacharjee initially said: Its top secret.
    
	On much prodding, he added: Yes, they had asked for our opinion since that is the custom.
    
	Queried about the state governments response, a smiling Bhattacharjee asked: What did Prakash tell you?
    
	Told what Karat had said, he added: Thats my opinion, too. We told them that we were not interested (in the Bharat Ratna). 
    
	In 1996, Karat and some other CPM leaders had scuppered Basus chance to be Prime Minister.
    
	The Ratna figured in speeches at the rally. 
    
	Citu general secretary Mohammad Amin said: Politicking over the Bharat Ratna suits the BJP. What difference does the award make to the common man, the poor people of the country? They dont have any interest in it. 
    
	However, some of the leaders at the rally indicated their disagreement with Karat. 
    
	We should consider the peoples sentiments, too. After all, we are working in a parliamentary system and enjoying all the status and honour associated with power. Basu is no more a leader of our party alone but enjoys an appeal across generations, said a CPM state committee member.
    
	Knowing the partys position well, Basu had yesterday said he was not in the race for the countrys highest civilian honour.

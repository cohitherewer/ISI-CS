	Singur, Aug. 27: A person ferrying Tata Motors labourers and a worker were slapped by unidentified men this morning, prompting many to pack up and leave the factory for the day.        
	Pradip Das, a resident of Burosarti in Singur, was taking around 14 contract workers to the factory on his mechanised rickshaw van around 8.20am when a group of youths stopped him.         
	They wanted to know why he was bringing the men to work and then slapped him. The incident took place on the service road just outside the boundary wall, between Mamata Banerjees podium and that of the Samajwadi Party.         
	Barely 10 minutes later, another group slapped Lakesh Singh, a contract labourer, while he was walking down the same road.         
	Tata Motors authorities called up the police brass and sought their intervention to ensure that such incidents were not repeated.         
	This is the first time since Mamatas indefinite siege began on Sunday afternoon that Tata Motors officials have expressed concern about threats to workers.         
	Senior police officers were quick to assure them that any attempt to stop, threaten or attack workers would not be tolerated.         
	We have started specific cases based on the complaints of the two under different sections, including 323 of the IPC that deals with voluntarily causing hurt. A probe is on to identify the youths, Hooghly superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra said. No one has been arrested.        
	The police said the minor incident sparked panic among workers at the plant, many of whom went home as soon as they arrived.         
	The turnout was thin today. Barely 250-300 of the 2,500-odd contract labourers were at the factory. However, nearly 85 per cent of Tata Motors employees were present, said a senior official at the project site.         
	He added that todays incidents could have a serious impact on us.        
	The Trinamul Congress leadership claimed ignorance of the incidents and ruled out the involvement of its supporters. Im not aware of such a thing, leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee said.        
	Later, Trinamul leaders appealed to supporters to stay away from the Tata Motors gates and not get involved in any confrontation.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, Sept. 22: The government today extended by two days the deadline for Singur farmers to apply for compensation cheques if they want a 10 per cent bonus.        
	We have extended the deadline till September 24, said Hooghly district magistrate Neelam Meena. So far, 45 formerly unwilling landlosers have collected their cheques and 70 consent applications have been filed, she said.        
	The Singur CPM is disheartened because the total number of the unwilling is far higher  estimates by the two rival sides range between 870 and 2,500. We thought we would see better response, said Balai Sabui of the CPM. He said party workers were finding it tough approaching farmers in Trinamul Congress-dominated villages. So we are approaching their relatives.        
	Becharam Manna of the Save Farmland Committee said: The unwilling farmers with us have not collected cheques.         
	Katwa hearing        
	Fresh hearings began today in Katwa for acquisition of land for a power project. Sources said 72 of the 82 farmers heard refused to part with their land. The Burdwan administration declined to confirm the figure. The hearings will continue till Thursday.

	Bolpur, Oct. 16: A boy born last night was allegedly swapped with a girl at Bolpur Subdivisional Hospital.        
	Marjina Bibi, of Neturi village in Birbhum, who underwent a Caesarean section last night said she gave birth to a boy but was told this morning that it was a girl. My wife was awake during the surgery because she was given spinal anaesthesia, her husband Azizul said in the complaint.        
	A court has ordered a DNA test following another mothers boy-swap charge at Burdwan Medical College Hospital.

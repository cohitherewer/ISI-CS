          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Nov. 8: College students in the hills will hold relay hunger strikes from November 11 till the second round of tripartite talks begin in Delhi in the third week of this month.         
	Schools would not close during the strikes, Kismant Chhetri, president of the Gorkha Janmukti Vidyarthi Morcha, said. We will try to work out an arrangement so that students can take part in the strikes. The only worry is whether exams are scheduled then, in which case we may ask schools to postpone them, he said.         
	The talks centre around the Gorkhaland demand.        
	Today, school students gheraoed the house and office of Madan Tamang, president of the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League, who had alleged that the Morcha held a secret meeting with the home secretary before relaxing its protest in the hills.

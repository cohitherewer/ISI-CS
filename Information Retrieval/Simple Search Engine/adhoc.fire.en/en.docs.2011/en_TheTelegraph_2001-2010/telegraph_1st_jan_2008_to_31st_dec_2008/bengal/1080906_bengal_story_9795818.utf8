	Singur/Calcutta, Sept. 5: Trucks plied along one flank of Durgapur Express through the day for the first time since Mamata Banerjees siege began 13 days ago.        
	Nearly 3,000 trucks moved up and down the highway from 6 in the morning, when the Trinamul Congress cleared the flank. The other flank, however, remained blocked by Trinamul supporters who had assembled around Mamatas dharna dais.        
	Nearly 3,000 trucks plied along one flank, both from and towards Calcutta, said Kalyan Banerjee, the Chandernagore subdivisional police officer who monitored traffic movement through the day.        
	A district police officer said there was a brief snarl at Maheswarpur early in the day. The congestion eased as the flow of traffic started.        
	Officials of the National Highways Authority of India said the situation had improved since last night, when trucks were allowed to move from 10.30pm to 1am. The situation further improved today, said H.C. Aurora, the authoritys chief general manager in charge of Bengal.        
	The only hitch came around 9.30pm, when a Calcutta-bound mini truck laden with potatoes overturned while trying to speed past a lorry at Khaserchak, around 2km from Mamatas manch. The cleaner of the truck, in his 20s, died while the driver ran away.         
	The accident brought traffic to a standstill for an hour.        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi had requested Trinamul to let vehicles move on both flanks, but Mamata agreed to open one.         
	The chief minister sent home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti to Singur for a survey. The home secretary, who travelled 60km along the expressway, later said one flank was open, but there is no dispute that the blockade is on.

	Calcutta, Jan. 10: Bengal again reeled under long power cuts this evening. 
    
	The crisis has been severe over the past three days with power cuts ranging between 90 and 150 minutes in Calcutta. The blackouts have lasted many hours more in the districts. 
    
	An official said the situation might improve as a 210MW Bandel unit was restarted this evening.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Siliguri meeting disallowed
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 23: State chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb told Gorkha Janamukti Morcha leaders today that the government would not allow them to hold a meeting in Siliguri on Sunday as the situation there was still tense.        
	The Morcha delegation met the chief secretary at Writers Buildings.         
	On September 28 last year, there was large-scale violence in Siliguri and the army had to be deployed. Since then, things have not been normal, Deb told reporters.        
	He said the Morcha could consider changing the venue to either Birpara or Jalpaiguri.         
	The chief secretary gave the green signal to a Morcha meeting in Calcutta next month, but urged the leaders to change the date as it would clash with cricket.        
	We have no problem with their Calcutta meeting. The Morcha leaders told me they would set off from the hills on May 7 and reach Calcutta the next day. However, I told them that IPL matches would be held at that time and requested them to consider changing the date, Deb said.

	Tamluk, Dec. 17: People backed by the Trinamul Congress today resisted the construction of a boundary wall on a Haldia plot acquired by the government in 1996, and kicked and punched an official of the company building a refinery.        
	Administrative manager Debashis Bera was heading to the construction site on a motorcycle this morning when the protesters waylaid him and held him hostage for nearly five hours. Bera alleged that he was pinned to the ground and hit. I was subjected to physical torture for five hours. Pinning me to the ground, they kicked and punched me, he alleged.        
	The Haldia Development Authority (HDA) had acquired the 400 acres at Sovarampur, 140km from Calcutta, on which the Cals Refinery project is coming up. The company said it would invest Rs 23,000 crore and generate employment for 5,000.        
	Local Trinamul leader Milan Mondal said the party was backing todays protest but denied its role in the assault.        
	HDA chief executive officer Golam Ali Ansari said the compensation was paid according to norms in 1996. Asim Mondal, who had five acres, said he wanted more now.

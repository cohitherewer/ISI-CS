The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Minority board fires US barb at Centre
                                                                                                               Minority board fires US barb at Centre
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	Calcutta, March 2: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has attacked the Centre for toeing the US line on Iraq and Iran and improving ties with Israel.        
	The board usually confines itself to religious and legal issues. But sources said the approaching elections could have prompted it to comment on political matters.        
	The pronouncements came at the end of a three-day meeting in Calcutta  the first such conclave in Bengal since 1985.        
	The resolutions adopted at a rally on the Park Circus Maidan accused the Congress-led government of following US dictates blindly and failing to follow the countrys non-aligned policy.        
	The board blamed the current policy for the persecution of youths in the community. The increasing harassment and intimidation of Muslim youths accused of terror links (is) in tune with the US-led global anti-Muslim witch-hunt.         
	Board leaders said those now called global terrorists had been created by the US and its allies.        
	The board condemned terror attacks on innocent people, saying crimes against humanity go against the teachings of the Quran. The Darul Uloom had recently dubbed terrorism un-Islamic.         
	We condemn such acts whether carried out by individuals or the state. When a community does not get justice, it becomes alienated. The government should define terrorists and look into the factors that produce them and ensure justice, the boards resolution said.        
	Political overtones emerged as speakers at the rally accused the government of creating a fear psychosis among Muslims by calling madarsas cradles of terrorism and every Muslim a terror suspect.         
	Leaders known to be close to the Congress, like the Jamait Ulema-i-Hinds Maulana Arsad Madani, criticised the party for not fulfilling its pre-Partition promises to the community.        
	He warned against the growing danger of divisive forces  an allusion to the BJP  and stressed the need for unity of all democratic forces.         
	The board passed a resolution opposing the Centre and the state moves to make marriage registration compulsory for all communities.        
	We are not opposed to registration per se. But the board is opposed to making it compulsory since rural areas do not have enough social infrastructure. This will only add to the troubles of the common people, said Sultan Ahmed, a Trinamul Congress MLA who has been recently inducted into the board.         
	Ahmed said the board would oppose a state government bill amending Muslim marriage and divorce laws.        
	Some speakers called for the ouster of Taslima Nasreen from India but a board member said later: Individually, most of us want it. But the Taslima issue is not in the jurisdiction of the board.

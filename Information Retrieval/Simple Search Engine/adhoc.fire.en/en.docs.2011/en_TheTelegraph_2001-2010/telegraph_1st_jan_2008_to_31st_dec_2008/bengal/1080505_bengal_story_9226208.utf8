	Tamluk, May 4: Nearly 100 residents of Sonachura fled their homes today after about 50 motorcycle-borne CPM activists went around the village hurling bombs and firing from revolvers.         
	Hours later, police announced that eight camps in Nandigram would be withdrawn tomorrow so that the personnel can be deployed for the panchayat polls across the state .

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Riz was killed: Mamata
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Riz was killed: Mamata
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Sept. 20: A day before Rizwanur Rehmans first death anniversary, Mamata Banerjee claimed she had been told he was murdered.        
	The CBI has been given an option to take another look at the case and I think it should consider this aspect, the Trinamul Congress chief said.         
	Mamata, however, did not disclose her sources.        
	Rizwanur was found dead beside rail tracks near Patipukur. The CBI had said he committed suicide, and charged his father-in-law, businessman Ashok Todi, and six others, including three police officers, with abetment to suicide.        
	I believe he was killed under pressure from the forces of the state and if Kalyan (lawyer Kalyan Banerjee) fights it, I am sure he will win, Mamata told a gathering.        
	I am not here for politics but I believe there has been use of money and muscle power, she added before inaugurating a plaque in Rizwanurs memory near his Tiljala Lane house. The plaque read: It is better to have loved and won than never to have loved at all.

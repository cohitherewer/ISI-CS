	Calcutta, Sept. 17: Forward Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas will quit the Rajya Sabha after only a few months into his fourth term, appar-ently under pressure from the party.        
	The Blocs Bengal secretary, Ashok Ghosh, however, said Biswas had himself wanted to step down at a meeting yes- terday in the greater interest of the party organisation.         
	We have accepted his decision and the party nominee in his place will be named in the weekend, Ghosh said.         
	Biswas, he said, took the decision following a new one-man-one-post policy.        
	Insiders said both Ghosh and Biswas had drawn flak from the rank and file after asking second-rung leader Barun Mukherjee to vacate his Rajya Sabha slot for the general secretary as other Left Front allies had refused to concede a second seat to the Bloc.         
	The Bloc had then cited Biswass importance in the Left-UPA co-ordination committee to justify Mukherjees removal. Leader Hafiz Alam Sairani today said: If we had done this (asked Biswas to quit) a few months back, it would have been seen as surrender before the CPM.        
	Mukherjee, who had resigned in May, is likely to be nominated again.

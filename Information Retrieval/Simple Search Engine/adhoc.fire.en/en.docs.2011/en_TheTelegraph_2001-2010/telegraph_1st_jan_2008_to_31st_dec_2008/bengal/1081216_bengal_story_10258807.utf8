	Calcutta, Dec. 15: Pressure from the CPM-controlled college and university teachers association has forced the new West Bengal State University to reconsider its decision to introduce an internal assessment of BA, BSc and BCom students.        
	The university, set up last year in Barasat, North 24-Parganas, had decided to give 20 per cent weightage to mid-term college tests and 80 per cent to the Part I, II and III exams it conducted. A circular asking the 57 colleges affiliated to the university to complete the tests by December 22 was sent to the principals, most of whom had agreed to the move, a fortnight ago.         
	However, the West Bengal College and Teachers Association (WBCUTA) held a meeting on Saturday and wanted the decision shelved. Its difficult for a college to conduct a test on a 15-day notice. Its a major reform and the university should have finalised it after taking teachers opinion, general secretary Tarun Patra said.         
	No other university in the state has this system of computing 20 per cent of a students graduation marks from college tests.        
	The objective was to increase students attendance and ensure most of the syllabus could be covered in classroom lectures. Vice-chancellor Ashoke Ranjan Thakur said: The tests were to be held on the portions of the syllabus covered till December. The idea was to get a measure of the progress made in the middle of the term so it became easier for the colleges to help students do better in the finals.        
	A varsity official lamented the tendency among students to skip classroom lectures and take the help of private tutors. Because of the mid-term tests, students would have been forced to attend classes.        
	WBCUTA, however, felt the internal assessment would dilute the standards of the final exams. The colleges can give their the students more than they deserve, a leader said.        
	The VC said: Well place WBCUTAs suggestion before our executive council to reconsider the decision to hold the internal tests.

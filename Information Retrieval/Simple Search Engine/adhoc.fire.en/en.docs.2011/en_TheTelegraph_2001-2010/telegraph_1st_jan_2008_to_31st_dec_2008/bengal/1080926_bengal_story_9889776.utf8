          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Sept. 25: The Uttarakhand government today formally cleared an order to allot Tata Motors 50 acres more for its Pantnagar plant, though sources present at a meeting between state representatives and company officials insisted the embattled Nano project wasnt discussed.        
	S.P. Tripathi, general manager of the states industrial development corporation, said the Tata delegation didnt broach the topic. (So) why should we ask them?        
	Sources present at the meeting said the delegation, led by senior vice-president A.S. Puri, plant head N.K. Chaubey, and divisional manager Ashutosh Burman, focused on upgrading the project site.        
	It was our commitment to allot more land to the Tatas. We have met the commitment at least partially today by approving a government order to allot them 50 acres, chief secretary Indu Kumar Pandey said over the phone from Dehra Dun after the meeting.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Aug. 17: A 40-year-old mentally unstable man today hacked his father to death in a village in Murshidabad.        
	Police have arrested Jalaluddin Sardar, said to be under treatment for reactive psychosis.        
	Jalaluddin attacked his father Fakir with a scythe in the morning when he was in the courtyard of their house in Domkal, about 240km from Calcutta.        
	Jalaluddins brother, 18-year-old Manirul, said: I was inside the house when I heard father scream. I rushed out and found him lying in a pool of blood and my elder brother attacking him with a scythe. When I jumped to save him, Jalaluddin hit me below the shoulder with the scythe. I started shouting for help.        
	Hearing Maniruls cries, neighbours rushed in and caught hold of Jalaluddin, snatched the scythe from his hand and tied him to a tree near the house.         
	When we tied up Jalaluddin, he was sobbing inconsolably. The police arrived after about two hours and arrested him, said Niajuddin Sheikh, a villager.        
	The police said Jalaluddin owned a shoe store at Bhakuri near Behrampore town. He led a normal life until three years ago when his wife ran away with another man. She also took their seven-year-old son with her.         
	A police officer who questioned the villagers said: Jalaluddin was shattered and began showing signs of mental instability then.         
	A. Hasan, a psychiatrist in Behrampore who treated Jalaluddin, said he suffered from reactive psychosis.        
	Fakir was taken to Domkol sub-divisional hospital where he was declared dead.         
	Man hurls infant        
	A man hurled his 11-month-old son to the floor in Murshidabad after a quarrel with his wife on Friday. The child died two days later.        
	Police are searching for Zakir Sheikh, a labourer, after his wife, Lalbanu Bibi, lodged a complaint.         
	Zakir had told Lalbanu to get him Rs 5,000 from her father, the police said. But she was unable to get the money, following which the couple had a quarrel on August 15. Suddenly, Zakir picked up his son Golam and hurled him to the floor, said Tanmoy Ghosh, a police officer.

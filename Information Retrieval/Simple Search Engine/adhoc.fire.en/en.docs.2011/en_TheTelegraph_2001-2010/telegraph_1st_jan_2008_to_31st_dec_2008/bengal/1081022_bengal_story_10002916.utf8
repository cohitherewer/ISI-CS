          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 21: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today broke his silence on Darjeeling, saying the signs were extremely worrisome, but did not name the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, the prime mover of the agitation in the hills.        
	After meeting hill affairs minister Ashok Bhattacharyya at Writers Buildings today, the Bengal chief minister said in a statement: What has been happening in the hills of Darjeeling district over the past few days is extremely worrisome. Activities like changing of car number plates, defacing government buildings and naming them as offices of the Gorkhaland government and imposing a dress code... have certainly hurt the sentiments of the people and disturbed the rule of law in the hills.        
	He said the district administration had been instructed to ensure that law and order is maintained in Darjeeling and the state government was keeping an eye on the developments.        
	Such activities could affect the tripartite talks in Delhi, he pointed out. Based on a request by our state government, the Centre convened a tripartite meeting to discuss the Darjeeling issue and come to a solution to the problems being talked about by the protesters. Given that, the activities in the hills threaten to affect the talks atmosphere. So, the manner in which the present agitation is being staged should stop.         
	Bhattacharjee appealed to the right-thinking people of the hills not to give into such provocation.         
	What is necessary in this regard is the co-operation of all right-thinking people of living in Darjeeling district. Please dont give into any provocation.        
	He said the hill economy had suffered immensely because of the agitation and that people of Darjeeling would be hurt the most if the movement continued.        
	The agitation has cost the hill economy dear, affecting the life of every person living in Darjeeling. Tourism, education and the general condition in the hills have become the casualty. Consequentially, Siliguri, Dooars and the Terai regions have also been affected, he said.        
	DM order        
	The Darjeeling district administration has ordered that signboards reading Government of Gorkhaland were to be brought down at the earliest.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Sept. 21: The government today announced a compensation package for about 2,700 villagers set to lose their land for the proposed Videocon steel plant and power project near Asansol at an all-party meeting given the miss by Mamata Banerjees party.         
	Representatives of the CPM, CPI, RSP, Forward Bloc, BSP and the Congress unanimously accepted the package, which also promises land to the landlosers, and decided to speak to the villagers to convince them about the offer.         
	It offers between Rs 3.9 lakh and 7.5 lakh an acre depending on whether the land is barren, single-crop, low-lying, residential or marshy. The landloser will get 1 cottah in the township that will come up around the project against one bigha (20 cottahs make a bigha). The landlosers will be trained to increase their job prospects.        
	Most of the 3,500 acres earmarked for the Rs 21,000-crore project in Jamuria, 240km from Calcutta, is barren or single-crop.        
	A local Trinamul Congress functionary said: We dont understand why we should oppose land acquisition. But block party president Purnashashi Roy said he boycotted the meeting under instructions from Mamata Banerjee.

	Santiniketan, Feb. 12: A young man was arrested today for allegedly molesting an American woman on the Visva-Bharati campus.        
	The woman was part of a team of 10 from the US, visiting Santiniketan under Rabindra Bharati University teacher Arnab Roy.         
	The woman was in front of the landmark Black House around 12.45pm when Sunny Mishra, who was riding pillion on a friends cycle, jumped off it and pulled her hair.         
	The woman raised the al- arm, and a guard on duty at the nearby Sangit Bhavan caught the culprit.        
	Sunny, earlier arrested on charges of stabbing a constable, was on bail.        
	We cannot stop anybody from entering the campus but we are keeping a strict vigil, said Visva-Bharati registrar Moni Mukut Mitra.         
	Sunny had stabbed the constable in daylight in Bolpur town last year. The police today charged him under Section 354 of the IPC: assault to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty.         
	Roy, who lodged a complaint with Bolpur police station this afternoon, declined comment. The woman, too, refused to speak.         
	We have arrested the youth on the basis of the complaint lodged by Arnab Roy, said Birbhum superintendent of police L.N. Meena.        
	Custody death in city        
	A man in his mid-30s, who was picked up by Metiabruz policemen tonight for misbehaving in an inebriated state, died in custody.         
	Calcutta police said Rabi Das fell sick at the police station and was hospitalised but his family alleged foul play.

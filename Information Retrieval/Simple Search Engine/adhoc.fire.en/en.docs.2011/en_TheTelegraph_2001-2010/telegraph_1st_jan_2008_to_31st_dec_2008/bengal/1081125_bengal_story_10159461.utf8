	Durgapur, Nov. 24: Thieves broke into the house of a cement and steel factory owner in Ranigunj last night and took away Rs 10 lakh and jewellery at gunpoint.         
	They scaled the wall around Gopal Agarwals three-storey house and pounced on the guard. Police said he was tied up and left unconscious.         
	The robbers broke open a rear gate and when Gopals mother Monia Devi woke up hearing some noise and stepped out of her room with a torch, she saw masked men and a revolver pointed at me.         
	They took her to the second floor where Gopal was sleeping with his wife. The goons asked me to call my son. Then my son and daughter-in-law were also held at gunpoint.         
	Gopal handed over the lo- cker keys without resistance. The jewellery would be worth Rs 5 lakh, said Gopal, 45, who also owns a hospital in the town, 200km from Calcutta.         
	His son Sashi, 23, was sleeping on the third floor.

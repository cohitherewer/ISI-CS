     OUR LEGAL REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 21: A six-footer college girl from Nadia had landed in a police lock-up possibly because of her height.
    
	Calcutta High Court today granted bail to first-year BA student Putul Haldar, who was held six months ago for her alleged Maoist links and later charged her with possessing ganja (cannabis). 
    
	Her lawyer, Uttam Majumdar, said a six-foot woman was part of a Maoist gang that snatched a rifle from a policeman in Nadias Chapra on August 14 but it was not Putul. 
    
	On August 19, she disappeared on her way home from college. Her father went to lodge a complaint but Chapra police refused to accept it, Majumdar alleged. 
    
	On August 23, 19-year-old Putuls father approached the Nadia chief judicial magistrate, who ordered an inquiry. 
    
	A week later, the police claimed that Putul had been arrested from Chakdah on August 23 and nearly 3kg of ganja was found on her.
    
	The Nadia police chief, whom the magistrate told to conduct a probe, linked Putul with Maoists and said she had been caught with the ganja.
    
	According to Majumdar, the reason Putul was branded a Maoist was her height. They did not produce her befo- re a court initially but charged her under the drugs act when the CJM interfered. 
    
	Public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami said the court could not grant bail to someone accused under the drugs law. But the division bench of Justices G.C. Gupta and K.K. Prasad granted the bail.
    
	It is because the prosecution had failed to prove her guilt, said Majumdar.
    
	According to the law, no person booked under the act should be granted bail until the investigating agencies have completed their probe and reached a definite conclusion. 
    
	The court realised that the police had picked up the girl on suspicion. They did not produce her before a court in 24 hours. When Putuls father moved court, the police charged her with possessing ganja, a high court advocate said.

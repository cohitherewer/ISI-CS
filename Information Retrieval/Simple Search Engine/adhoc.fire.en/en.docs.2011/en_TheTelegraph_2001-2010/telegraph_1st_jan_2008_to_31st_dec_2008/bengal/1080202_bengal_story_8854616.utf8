	He said 27,26,840 chickens had been culled till yesterday. We have revised the target to a little over 29 lakh.
    
	Subhas Barui, who was part of a culling team in Rampurhat, Birbhum, was admitted to the isolation ward of the Tamluk District Hospital yesterday with symptoms of influenza. A resident of Janka village in East Midnapores Khejuri, he was engaged in culling between January 22 and 28. He returned home on January 30. 
    
	Baruis blood and mucus samples have been sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Calcutta. If there is a preliminary confirmation of bird flu, we will send the samples to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, or ICMR Delhi, said health service director Sanchita Bakshi. 
    
	The government today issued a directive asking officials to ensure that culling team members were quarantined for at least seven days before returning home.

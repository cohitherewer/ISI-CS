	Calcutta, April 3: A city-based developer will set up a chain of international retirement villages across the state.        
	The houses in these villages  a concept popular in developed countries  are a larger and more refined version of old-age homes.        
	Rajarhat and Bolpur have been picked to kick off the project, named Aporanhyo, which means afternoon.        
	We will engage international chains with expertise in running such projects. I hope to complete the project within two years, said Samar Nag, managing director of Bengal Shelter Housing Development Ltd.        
	Bengal Shelter today tied up with the Delhi-based Feedback Ventures, an infrastructure consultancy firm, to prepare a business plan.        
	Debasish Som, president, group business development (eastern region), Feedback Ventures, said the target customers would be non-resident Indians and Indian citizens from the higher income group.        
	The architecture will be such that even a person in a wheelchair would not face any problem while moving around, Nag said, adding that the residents would be encouraged to take up social work to keep themselves busy.

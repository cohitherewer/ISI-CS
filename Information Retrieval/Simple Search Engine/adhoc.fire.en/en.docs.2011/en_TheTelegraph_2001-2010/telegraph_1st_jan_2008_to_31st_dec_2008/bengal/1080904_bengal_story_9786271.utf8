   Girl recalls most unpleasant minutes										      FIRST PERSON                        Jhuma Mukherjee, Anirban Mukherjee (centre) and Ranjan Basu request Trinamul leaders to allow them to speak to Mamata Banerjee. Picture by Ananda Das				                                 
	Jhuma Mukherjee of The Chatterjee Group set off for Singur this morning from Sector V along with two colleagues, Ranjan Basu and Anirban Mukherjee, to meet Mamata Banerjee and discuss ways to resolve the land impasse.         
	But the three, who have started a website, wesupportindustry.silicogene.com//SR, were not only denied an audience with the Trinamul Congress chief but also harassed by those at the siege site.         
	Jhuma narrates the experience to Chandreyee Chatterjee of The Telegraph.        
	We had a very successful meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings on Tuesday.         
	Later, we thought that as an apolitical forum, we should also meet the chief Opposition leader. So, we set off for Singur to discuss the implications of the siege and put forward our suggestions for solving the impasse.         
	We started from Sector V around 9am and reached Singur around 11. We made our way through the people squatting and reached the main stage. I saw a man in white kurta-pyjama and approached him, saying we had come from the information technology sector and wanted to meet Mamata Banerjee for five minutes.         
	The man asked us to wait and went up to the stage. I think we waited for around three minutes, after which I saw a man in a red kurta (I dont know who he was) coming towards us.        
	He asked us, very rudely, to leave immediately, saying no one here had any time to talk to us. I pleaded with him to at least hear what we had to say but he was not ready to listen.        
	He said he knew we had gone to Writers, had organised a candlelight gathering and that we were the CPMs dalals. He said we had come to create trouble in Singur.        
	Around this time, Mamata Banerjee started speaking into the mike. She asked us to go, accusing us of being CPM dalals and taunting us to go to the CPM dais. She forbade everyone around from talking to us.        
	It was so frustrating trying to explain to them that we had no political agenda. I kept trying to persuade the man in the red kurta, saying we were common people with no political leanings and that all we wanted was to speak to Mamata Banerjee.        
	Weary, I asked him how the common people were supposed to reach her. They heard me and, though they did not respond, it gave me hope there may be a possibility of a meeting.        
	But, by this time, the Trinamul supporters had surrounded us.         
	Then, another person (again I dont know who he was) came up and said: I will count till three. If by that time you dont leave, you will be thrashed.         
	He started counting and when he reached two, I was so scared I turned around and ran.        
	We were there for 15 to 20 minutes but they were the most unpleasant moments I have spent in my life.

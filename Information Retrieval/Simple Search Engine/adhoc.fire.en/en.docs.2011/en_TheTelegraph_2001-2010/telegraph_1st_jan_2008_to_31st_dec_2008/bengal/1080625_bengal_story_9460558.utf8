	Calcutta, June 24: Salvage operations to bring up the Bangladeshi barge that sank in the Hooghly yesterday will begin tomorrow.         
	The Inland Waterways Authority will send a 20-tonne crane to lift the vessel, said Anindya Majumdar, the deputy chairman of the Calcutta Port Trust.         
	Inland waterways chief Arun Roy said it might take a fortnight to salvage MV Nilan, which sank off Noorpur in Diamond Harbour, some 60km south of Calcutta.

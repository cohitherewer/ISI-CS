	Calcutta, Dec. 22: The government will grant land conversion and mutation certificates within 90 days of receiving applications, minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah promised today.        
	Earlier, there was no time frame for disposal of applications for mutation and conversion certificates. So, we decided to frame a rule that would enable applicants to get their petitions cleared in 90 days, the land minister said.        
	The move would help pe-ople immensely in sale and purchase of land, he added. Those who want to change the nature of land use to utilise it for some other purpose would also benefit.         
	According to the minister, several thousand applications for conversion and mutation of land in the rural areas are awaiting clearance.

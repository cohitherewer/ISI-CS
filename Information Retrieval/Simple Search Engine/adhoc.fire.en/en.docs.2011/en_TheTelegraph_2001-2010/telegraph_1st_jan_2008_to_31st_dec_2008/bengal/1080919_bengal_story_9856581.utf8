          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Subrata at the Singur rally                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 18: Subrata Mukherjee was today removed as the state Congress spokesperson for sharing the dais with Mamata Banerjee in Singur on Tuesday.        
	State Congress president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi told reporters in Delhi this morning that he had written to Mukherjee seeking explanation for his conduct.         
	Sources said if Mukherjee failed to come up with a convincing explanation, he might be expelled from the party.        
	Mukherjee, who continues to be the partys joint working president with Pradip Bhattacharya, had seen the action coming. I may be punished for attending Mamatas rally. But I have come here to back a peoples movement being carried on by Mamata across the state on the Singur issue, he had told the Trinamul Congress rally in Singur on Tuesday.         
	A faxed message from Das Munshi reached the state Congress headquarters this afternoon confirming Mukherjees removal and Bhattacharyas appointment as principal spokesperson.        
	Mukherjees detractors in the party said they would call for his expulsion on September 22 when the Congresss newly appointed executive committee was slated to meet at the state headquarters.        
	He should be expelled for joining Mamatas Singur agitation. We shall not allow him to go scot-free, said a state Congress general secretary owing allegiance to Das Munshi.        
	Mukherjee refused to comment, but there has been speculation that he might be thinking of going back to Trinamul.        
	He had switched to Trinamul from the Congress in 2000, after which he became mayor. But in 2005, he went back to the Congress when Mamata refused to allow him a second term as mayor.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi, who had won the Chowringhee seat after beating Mukherjee in 2006, said the Congress leader would be welcome to return to our party.         
	Mukherjee, an aide said, has been unhappy over the growing clout of Das Munshis wife Deepa in the party. Subratada was being sidelined in the party ever since he became the state Congress working president. Deepa boudi interferes in everything concerning the organisation when Priyada is not in Calcutta, he said.

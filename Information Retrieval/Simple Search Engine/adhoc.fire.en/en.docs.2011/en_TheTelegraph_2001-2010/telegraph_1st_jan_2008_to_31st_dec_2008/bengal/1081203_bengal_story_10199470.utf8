	Calcutta, Dec. 2: Tata Motors moved a writ petition in the high court today challenging the state information commissioners decision to read out the entire agreement between the company and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) for the Singur plant in an open court.        
	The companys lawyer, Samaraditya Pal, told the court: If the entire agreement is made public, the concept of trade secret will be hard hit.         
	In mid-September, Tata Motors had moved court against the WBIDCs decision to post parts of the agreement on its website following the commissioners order.         
	The court had then asked the commissioner to re-hear the case and allow Tata Motors to be a party to it.         
	The company had submitted the agreement to the commissioner in a sealed envelope for its hearing, but the official decided to read it out in its court, prompting the Tatas to move the high court. They also challenged the Right to Information Act while demanding a stay on the decision.        
	The case will be heard again on Friday.

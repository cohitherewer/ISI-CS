          UTTAM DUTTA                              
	Singur, Aug. 25: A truck from Calcutta screeched to a halt about 20 feet from Trinamul supporters sleeping on Durgapur Expressway around 4.30 this morning.        
	Hearing the truck approach, some people woke up and raised the alarm, alerting the driver, who had somehow entered the stretch of the highway that had been closed to traffic yesterday.        
	Within seconds, Trinamul supporters armed with sticks surrounded the truck and tried to pull the driver out. The officers in charge of Mogra and Dhaniakhali police stations, who were on patrol, rescued him and ordered the truck to make a U-turn.        
	Just as the truck swerved, Mamata Banerjee, who was sleeping on the dais about 20 feet away, rushed to the road.        
	A mob went after the policemen, asking them how the truck could come that far, but Mamata called for restraint.        
	She vented her anger on Rajya Sabha MP Mukul Roy, who was in a camp about a kilometre away. Have you only come to do netagiri? Mamata shouted.        
	Mamata ordered Roy to lodge a police complaint.

	Calcutta: Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi today urged all concerned to shun violence, vengeance and vendetta, a Raj Bhavan official said.         
	He (the governor) is con-fident that the elected representatives, setting aside all differences, will commence their duties in the best spirit of the panchayat raj, said a Raj Bhavan release.

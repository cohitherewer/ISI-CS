	Calcutta, Feb. 13: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha withdrew its indefinite hunger strike in Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong today after the government promised to look into its demands by Saturday.         
	The Morcha is demanding the removal of Subash Ghisingh as caretaker of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council and a visit by the parliamentary standing committee scrutinising the Sixth Schedule bill. The four-month-old party wants a separate Gorkhaland.

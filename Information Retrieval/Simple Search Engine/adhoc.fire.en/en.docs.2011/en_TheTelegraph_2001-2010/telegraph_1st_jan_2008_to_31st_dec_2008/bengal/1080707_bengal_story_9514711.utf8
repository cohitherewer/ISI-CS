          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Calcutta, July 6: Mamata Banerjee today said the UPA government should immediately convene a Parliament session to seek a vote of confidence.        
	After the Left parties threat to withdraw support, the government should seek the confidence of the House without delay, she said.        
	L.K. Advani, the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, had yesterday said: The moment the Left parties withdraw support, it is incumbent on Manmohan Singh to seek a vote of confidence...         
	Asked if she would vote against the motion, Mamata ducked the question. We will cross the bridge when we come to it, she said.         
	On a days visit to the city, BJP president Rajnath Singh accused the Left of confusing people.         
	They are confusing the people by repeatedly speaking about their impending withdrawal. Let them first withdraw support, then they can claim some credibility.        
	Singh visited Shyama Prasad Mookerjees ancestral house in Bhowanipore, a stones throw from Mamatas Harish Chatterjee Street home, but did not call on her.        
	Officially, Mamata is still part of the BJP-led NDA. Asked why he did not meet Mamata, Singh said: It was not on my agenda.         
	Will the BJP fight the Lok Sabha polls with the Trinamul Congress? Singh said: You better ask Mamata.        
	BJP state secretary Rahul Sinha said the central leadership had asked him to choose candidates for all 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal.         
	Former foreign minister Jaswant Singh, who was also here today, said the Left and Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party had no principles but only greed for power.         
	Jaswant was speaking on the sidelines of an interactive session organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.         
	At the airport, the Bengal government had sent a convoy of seven cars to fetch Jaswant, who enjoys a cabinet ministers status being the leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. He said the government was preaching austerity measures, not practising them.        
	He wanted to send six cars away but had to retain two on being told that it was to avert a crisis in case the other broke down.        
	It took 15 minutes for me to make the officials understand that I did not need seven cars,Jaswant said at the chamber gathering.

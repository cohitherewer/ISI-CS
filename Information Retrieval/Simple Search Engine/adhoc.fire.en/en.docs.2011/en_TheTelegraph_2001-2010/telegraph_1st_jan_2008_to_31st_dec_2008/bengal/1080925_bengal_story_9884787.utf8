                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   DLF plan on, not acquisition
                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 24: The government today said the 4,800-acre DLF township at Dankuni was on course and land for the project would be directly purchased from owners and not acquired by the state.        
	Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said: I had a meeting with DLF representatives yesterday. The project is very much on. There will be no land acquisition in Dankuni (about 20km from Calcutta) but direct purchase.        
	After the panchayat polls in May, the minister had said the projects future was uncertain as the composition of the panel meant to facilitate land purchase would change because of Trinamul Congress candidates victory in some rural bodies. Today, he said: Now we are not thinking of routing the land purchase through the committee. Well go straight to the landowner.

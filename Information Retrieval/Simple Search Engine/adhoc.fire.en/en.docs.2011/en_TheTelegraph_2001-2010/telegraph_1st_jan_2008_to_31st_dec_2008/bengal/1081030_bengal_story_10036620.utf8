	Behrampore, Oct. 29: A Congress worker was killed in a Murshidabad village last evening when a suspected CPM gang attacked his group returning home after nearly a month.        
	Nearly 60 Congress supporters had fled home after a clash with CPM activists at Harischandrapur village in Barwan, about 255km from Calcutta, and had taken shelter in neighbouring Murutia.        
	A dozen of them had set off for home yesterday when alleged CPM activists hurled bombs at them. Mujibur Sheikh, 32, died on the spot.        
	Police said Mujibur had switched from the CPM to the Congress before the May rural polls and had helped defeat two CPM candidates, earning the ire of his former party.

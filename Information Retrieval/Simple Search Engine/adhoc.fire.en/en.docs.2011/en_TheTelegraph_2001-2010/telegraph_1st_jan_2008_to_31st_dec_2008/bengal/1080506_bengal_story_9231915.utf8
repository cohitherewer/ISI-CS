          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Balurghat, May 5: The father of a gang rape victim has come to the aid of a youth wrongly arrested for the crime.        
	Police picked up Anwar Hossain, 22, instead of Anwar Ali, 47, last month in connection with the rape that took place almost a year ago, on April 27, 2007.        
	The fathers of both Anwars have the same name, Sabur Mohammad.        
	Last May, Kabirul Islam (name changed) had lodged an FIR against a gang of nine, including Anwar Ali. A man named Saifur Rehman had allegedly lured his eldest daughter away with the promise of marriage and raped her along with the others.        
	The police arrested six, including Saifur, but could not track down Anwar and two others. The search for Anwar Ali, a resident of Gokarna village, led them to the house of Anwar Hossain, who lives in the adjacent Saidpur village.        
	Anwar Hossains lawyer Abdul Khalek Ahmed said: The fathers of Anwar Ali and Anwar Hossain bear the same name. But while Anwar Alis father died long ago, my clients father is still alive.        
	Kabirul told the police that the Anwar they picked up was not the Anwar they were looking for. I told them repeatedly that they were making a mistake but they did not listen, said Kabirul.        
	He promised all help to Anwar Hossains lawyer to ensure that he was released soon. I want the actual culprits arrested, Kabirul said.        
	The local court in Buniyadpur, 55km from South Dinajpur district headquarters Balurghat, has rejected Anwar Hossains bail plea.        
	His lawyer has moved the chief judicial magistrates court in Balurghat. Ive pleaded before the court that Anwar Hossain be declared innocent and released, Ahmed said.         
	The court will take up the matter tomorrow.        
	Ahmed said Anwar Alis father was a former CPM member of the Gokarna village panchayat. Some residents alleged that the arrest was politically motivated.        
	Block Congress president Subhasis Pal said Anwar Ali was a CPM member and the police wanted to shield him.        
	Rafiqul Islam, a CPM zonal committee member, admitted that the wrong person had been arrested.         
	But there is no conspiracy because both the accused and the innocent are CPM members, he said.        
	The inspector in charge of Harirampur police station said he would act according to the courts decision.
      What Anwar hossain can do
    Sue police 
  alleging that they
  maliciously arrested him and tarnished his image
    File a defamation case against the police saying 
  he incurred a financial loss because of them
  According to advocate Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee in Calcutta

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Promise of freedom
          RABI BANERJEE                          The Telegraph report on the missing Nadia man                                  
	Krishnagar, June 2: The Su-dan-based oil company with which the four kidnapped Indian employees used to work today said the Sudanese government had drawn up a plan to free the workers, one of them from Bengals Nadia district.        
	However, the company refused to say whether there would be an armed operation to get them out of the kidnappers clutches or whether a ransom would be paid.        
	Biplab Biswas, 23, of Shantipur, 70km from Calcutta, was abducted on May 13 along with three other Indians.         
	But the rebel Justice and Equality Movement, which had in the past kidnapped oil workers, denied having a hand in this abduction.        
	P. Avinash, the chief administrative officer of Petro Energy, where Biplab Biswas and the other three worked as fitters, spoke to The Telegraph from Sudan this morning.         
	He said the Indian ambassador to Khartoum, Deepak Vohra, had met Sudanese officials and security heads several times in the past week and they had assured the company that the government would rescue the four boys.         
	The Sudanese government told our company and the Indian embassy that they would soon rescue the boys. It could happen within a couple of days, said Avinash.         
	D.K. Abhilash from Kerala, Surjeet Singh from Punjab and Mohammad Abeed from Uttar Pradesh are missing along with Biplab.        
	On a possible compensation for the four, Avinash said: We are ready to compensate them after their safe return. All of them are safe now and being given food daily. We have gathered this from the Sudanese security (officials).        
	However, Vohra conceded that he had no idea of how soon the abducted employees would be rescued.         
	The Sudanese authorities have assured (us) that they will try and rescue them as soon as possible, Vohra told The Telegraph.         
	He said he was unaware of any ransom demand. Ask the Sudanese authorities about this.         
	However, Vohra added that he was hopeful that the four would return soon.        
	Back home, Biplabs mother Kanak has fallen sick, unable to cope with the anxiety.         
	My mother is fainting frequently, said Biplabs 17-year-old sister Rumi, in charge of the household now. Her father is physically challenged.        
	Last Monday, she travelled 10km to Krishnagar and pleaded with the Nadia district magistrate to help the family find Biplab. Sir, please save my dear brother, she said.

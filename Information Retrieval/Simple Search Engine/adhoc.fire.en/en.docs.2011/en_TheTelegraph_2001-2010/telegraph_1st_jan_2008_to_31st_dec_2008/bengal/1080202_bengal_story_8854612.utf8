	Burdwan/Calcutta, Feb. 1: Two siblings apparently jumped to death in front of a running train unable to cope with their mothers death after leaving words of advice for their father. 
    
	The mutilated bodies of Calcutta teenagers Smriti and Mohit Kakkar were found off railway tracks some 90km away around 6.30 this morning. 
    
	Burdwan Government Railway Police said a note found in the Mohits pocket revealed they were residents of 82B Kalighat Road. The note said the siblings were committing suicide as they could not come to terms with their mothers death.
    
	Father Ashwini Kumar Kakkar identified the bodies today. 
    
	Ashwini, 52, a bus owner, said his wife Niru, 40, had suffered a cerebral stroke last Saturday and passed away on Wednesday.
    
	Since then, my children had stopped taking food and were always crying, saying they wanted to be with their mother, Ashwini said, sobbing.
    
	Smriti, 18, and Mohit, 16, went missing from home last evening.
    
	Relatives found a note in Mohits room, which was written by the boy and also signed by the sister. 
    
	They wrote: Dont be angry with us. We are very sorry. But we are going to mamas (mother) house to live with her. Eat on time. And dont feel alone because all three of us will always be with you. 
    
	Ashwini remembered his childrens advice for him and broke down again. They were introverts by nature and very attached to their mother, he said.
    
	Smriti was a first-year college student and her brother was in Class X.
    
	Their uncle Ashoke said: It is a mystery why their bodies should be found in Burdwan. We dont have any relatives there.
    
	Sometime between 11.30pm and midnight yesterday, they called up one of Mohits friends, Saurav, who lives in Shyambazar, and told him they were in Bandel, the uncle added.
    
	Sauravs mother had apparently convinced them to come to her house. But, Ashoke said: Mohit called Saurav a few minutes later and said they were going to their mother and hung up.
    
	A railway police officer said daily passengers spotted the bodies near Debipur sta- tion this morning and called them.

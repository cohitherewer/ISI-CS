	Malda, July 9: A cab driver spurned by a married woman clambered atop the house of her parents, removed the roof tiles and poured acid on her sleeping mother and brother last night.        
	Police said Tulsi Sinha and her son Bablu had been admitted to the district hospital. Her right eye is said to be completely damaged.         
	A hunt is on for Shibulal Mondol, a neighbour of the Sinhas in Jainpur, 50km from Malda town. He had been making advances to Jharna whenever the 30-year-old came to visit her mother. She had snubbed him on Monday.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, April 21: Around 50 people today beat up the superintendent of Kalyani Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital after a five-year-old girl died allegedly because of negligence.         
	The mob also ransacked the childrens ward, smashing oxygen cylinders and furniture.        
	Kirti Mondal died at 5pm, hours after being admitted with severe headache. She had been suffering from an unknown brain disease.         
	My daughter lay unattended for over half an hour. I saw child specialist A.K. Samanta talking to nurses. When I tried to draw his attention, he told me to get lost, alleged Kirtis father Ashok, who runs a stationery shop in Kanchrapara.        
	Samanta fled when Ashoks neighbours went on the rampage. So they turned their ire on hospital superintendent Nirupam Biswas.         
	They abused and thrashed me though I promised to serve a showcause notice on the accused doctor, Biswas said.        
	He has lodged an FIR against his attackers and ordered a probe into the girls death.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Behrampore, Oct. 25: A woman in Behrampore has alleged that members of a club collecting Kali Puja subscription molested her when she tried to save her husband from their blows and a shalishi told her to withdraw her police complaint against them.        
	Sumana Tewari (name changed), of Banjetia village, said in her police complaint yesterday that five to six members of the Banjetia Yuvak Sangha went to her home, about 200km from Calcutta, around 11.45pm on Thursday.         
	We were asleep when the club members knocked on the ground-floor door shouting that they be given Rs 1,001. When my husband opened the door and pleaded that he could not give such an large sum, they tied his neck with a towel and started beating him. I ran down hearing his cries, but they pushed me and tore my night gown, Sumana said.         
	Last evening, she was called to a shalishi. Some village elders, led by Behrampore block Congress president Ashis De, called a shalishi meeting where I was asked to give in writing that I would withdraw my complaint. But today, I mustered the courage to tell the police that I was under pressure to withdraw my complaint. I shall meet the district police chief tomorrow if the club members are not arrested, she said, clutching her one-and-a-half-year-old son.         
	The police have begun a case against the club members and are hunting for the participants of the kangaroo court.         
	The club said the members had been framed, while Congress leader De said Sumana gave the undertaking on her own to withdraw the complaint.        
	Attack for Rs 501        
	A flower trader was allegedly beaten up by chanda collectors for refusing to pay up Rs 501.        
	Police are hunting for Chhotan Das and his two associates after Prasanta Sarkars wife lodged a complaint with New Town police station.        
	Pushpa said the New Town clubs members, led by Das, stopped Prasanta around 9.30pm on Thursday. When Prasanta refused to give them Rs 501, Das pushed him from his cycle and the trio beat him up.

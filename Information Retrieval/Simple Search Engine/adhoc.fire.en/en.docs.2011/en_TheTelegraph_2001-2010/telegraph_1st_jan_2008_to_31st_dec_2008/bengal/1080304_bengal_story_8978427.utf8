     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Durgapur, March 3: A school principal being tried for abetting her maids suicide is on the run after being accused of setting her next help on fire. 
    
	Joba Sahu, 42, is now in Durgapur Steel Plant Hospital with 80 per cent burns. 
    
	Subha Narayan, the principal of a private ICSE school in the steel township, was accused of driving Baisakhi Sain to death in 2003. The 16-year-old was found hanging in the teachers house. 
    
	Jobas son Laltu lodged an FIR last night. Police said an attempt to murder case has been started against Subha and her husband, who are absconding.
    
	Durgapur additional superintendent of police D.S. Rudra said she had been chargesheeted in the earlier case and her trial was on. Her husband is not an accused in that case. 
    
	This time, we are looking for the school principal and her husband. We will record Jobas statement when she recovers, said Rudra. 
    
	A doctor at the hospital, who is also a neighbour of the principal in the Kalidas Road area, said: She (Joba) is gasping and cant speak. She sustained at least 80 per cent burns. 
    
	According to the complaint, on the night of February 26, the principal and her husband tried to kill Joba after she witnessed something at the house.
    
	Police said the Narayans neighbours brought a severely burnt Joba to the hospital.
    
	The same night, Subhas husband called Laltu at Khatra in Bankura, where he works. The man told Laltu his mother had met with an accident and been admitted to hospital.
    
	The call came to my neighbours phone. He ask- ed me to rush to Durgapur. I reached the township early next morning and learnt ab-out the incident from local residents. The principal and her husband had disappeared from their home. I beca-me suspicious, said Laltu, 24, who works at a sweetmeat shop.
    
	I went to see my mother at the hospital but could not speak to her as her condition was critical, he added.
    
	The police said the couple had been missing since February 26.
    
	Their front door was locked today and a private security guard was on duty outside. He said: I dont know where madam is.
    
	The vice-principal of Subhas school said: Our principal is out of town and I do not know when she will return. Im not authorised to say anything more.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Air India scraps London flight
                                                                                                               Air India scraps London flight
          A STAFF REPORTER                                      
	Calcutta, Feb. 16: The Calcutta-London Air India flight will be available only twice a week from February 26.        
	The flight, introduced in early 2005, will not take off from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport on Tuesdays.         
	It used to fly three days a week  Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.        
	The frequency has been reduced temporarily because of the lean season and operational reasons, an airline spokesperson said.         
	Sources said lack of passengers was the main reason behind the reduced frequency. The passenger count on the flight, which used go full earlier, had come down to around 40 per cent, a source said.        
	The plane takes off from Delhi and goes to Dhaka before heading to Calcutta on the way to Heathrow.        
	A spate of cancellations and inordinate delays has led to passengers not using the flight, an airline source said. He said there had been last-minute cancellations of the flight because no aircraft was made available.         
	Calcutta businessman Manish Sharma is one of the many passengers who now avoids taking the Air India flight. Last year, he was on a business trip to London when the flight was cancelled. The plane did not take off the next day and I had to take a flight to Mumbai to go to London, said Sharma.        
	The travel industry said the decision to reduce frequency would send a negative message. It is unfortunate. It will have an effect on tourist flow, said Anil Punjabi of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	The airline source said the flight frequency could be reduced further.        
	British Airways now operates a Calcutta-London flight on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 11: Calcutta High Court today directed CPM top guns Biman Bose, Benoy Konar and Shyamal Chakraborty to appear by August 8 and explain why they should not face contempt proceedings.        
	The leaders lawyers pleaded for an exemption from personal appearance but the request was shot down.         
	The three are accused of criticising the judiciarys observations that the Nandigram police firing on March 14 last year was unconstitutional.         
	They will have to explain why proceedings should not be started against them for their adverse comments on the judiciary.        
	On November 27, 2007, the court had served suo motu contempt notices on the leaders, asking them whether they had criticised the judges over the observation.        
	On November 16, a division bench of the high court, comprising Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh, had observed, on the basis of a CBI report on the firing, that the police action was unconstitutional and against police regulations on use of force.         
	The judges had also asked the government to pay compensation to the families of the 14 persons killed and those injured.         
	The next day, on November 17, the three leaders had allegedly told a Calcutta rally that judges were politically motivated and democracy would prevail if their salaries could be increased.        
	Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, one of the lawyers appearing for the leaders, argued that his clients had every right to make a fair criticism of any judgment.        
	The contempt case was filed by the Calcutta High Court Bar Association after the alleged remarks were reported in the media.

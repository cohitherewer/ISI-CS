          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Siliguri on Sunday.  Telegraph picture      
	Siliguri, Aug. 17: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today described the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas agitation tactics as anti-national and undemocratic, but said his government would be patient in tackling the hills crisis.        
	The chief minister was addressing journalists at Phansidewa, 20km from here, this afternoon when he was asked to comment on the vehicles sporting GL (Gorkhaland) number plates and the way Gorkha National Liberation Front and CPM members were being driven out of the hills.        
	What they (the Morcha) are resorting to are anti-national activities. They are closing down government offices and hampering revenue collection. These are not democratically acceptable, Bhattacharjee said.        
	Asked how the government would tackle such lawlessness, he softened his tone.        
	We will be patient with them and not do anything that will turn into a law-and-order situation, the chief minister said. There will be several rounds of talks, both at the state level and at the tripartite level in Delhi, and matters will be resolved through them.        
	Asked how long his government was willing to carry on with the talks, Bhattacharjee said: We will be patient as long as it is required.        
	The chief minister welcomed the Morchas assurance to travel operators and tourists that there would be no strikes or disruptions during the Puja holidays.        
	This is a very positive development and I appeal to all to keep Darjeeling tension-free during the winter vacation too, when there is a huge rush of tourists to the hills, he said. Violence and bandhs have never helped anyone achieve anything but have harmed the economy.        
	Earlier in the day, Bhattacharjee held a meeting at the circuit house here to assess the situation in the districts of Darjeeling, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri.        
	Sources said he asked about the activities of the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation in Jalpaiguri and the Greater Cooch Behar Democratic Party in Cooch Behar. Like the Morcha in the hills, these two outfits have been demanding statehood.        
	The meeting was attended by the three district magistrates and the divisional commissioner of Jalpaiguri range, K.L. Meena, who is also the caretaker administrator of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council.        
	We have reviewed the situation in these three districts and the recent disturbances in the region. We have also decided on a plan of action, which we cannot reveal, Bhattacharjee said before leaving Phansidewa.

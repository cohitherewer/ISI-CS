	Calcutta, May 15: Calcutta High Court today passed an injunction against the governments land acquisition in Narayanpur, Malda, for Reliance Industries, says our legal reporter.        
	The land allegedly belonged to Malda doctor Shivaprasad Agarwal who claimed the state had not served any notice before acquiring it. Agarwal wanted to build an oxygen cylinder-filling plant there.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bloc cash for victims kin
                                                                                                               Bloc cash for victims kin
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dinhata, Feb. 11: Forward Bloc leader Debabrata Biswas today handed over cheques of Rs 3 lakh each to the families of the five party supporters who had fallen to police bullets on February 5.        
	The Bloc also warned the state government of law violation programmes in the district if all charges against party leaders and 40 supporters, who are behind bars, were not withdrawn by February 29.        
	Our movement does not end with the death of the five supporters. We will take this issue up at the national level. Many innocent people are in jail for taking part in an agitation programme that had been announced in advance. The police deliberately wanted this to happen, Biswas said.        
	The all-India Bloc general secretary said gram panchayats and municipal wards across the state will organise meetings from February 15-29 to pay tribute to the dead.         
	We will present gallantry awards to all those injured and arrested, Biswas said.        
	Accompanied by Udayan Guha, Paresh Adhikary and other local leaders, Biswas visited the victims homes, where he handed the compensation. We are with you always. You need not worry, he consoled Swapan Mahantas widow, Basanti.        
	The money will be deposited in Allahabad Bank accounts from where each family will get interest every month, Bloc sources said.        
	Former BJP president Murli Majohar Joshi, who was in Calcutta today, said the party would raise the police firing in Parliament. Some people demonstrated demanding jobs but instead they got bullets. The issue has to be raised in Parliament, he said.        
	Mamata ticked off        
	Joshi today accused Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee of inconsistency and double speak on her ties with the NDA.        
	Her statements depend on her mood and the circumstances she is in. In Bengal, Mamata is claiming she is not with NDA but the moment she reaches Delhi, she changes her mind, the former BJP chief told a news conference in Calcutta this afternoon.

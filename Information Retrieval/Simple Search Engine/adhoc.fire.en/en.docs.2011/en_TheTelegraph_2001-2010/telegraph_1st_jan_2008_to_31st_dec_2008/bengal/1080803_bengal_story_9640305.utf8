          JAYANTA BASU                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 2: The vaccine to treat type 3 polio, many cases of which have been detected in the country recently, will be used in the state for the first time tomorrow.        
	A type 3 polio case was detected in Howrahs Panchla earlier this year. Before that, the type was detected in 2003.         
	In 2007, of the 874 cases of polio detected across the country, 794 were type 3. Of the 336 cases this year, 346 were type 3. Of these, 209 cases were from Bihar.         
	Considering Bengals proximity with Bihar and that many migrants come here, experts saw the possibility of the type 3 virus spreading fast. We will have the first pulse polio round with the monovalent oral vaccine of type 3 tomorrow as there is a case in Howrah and also keeping in mind demographic factors, said state health commissioner Asim Das.        
	Studies say the monovalent type 3 vaccine gives greater immunity  almost five times more  to type 3 cases than the trivalent vaccine.

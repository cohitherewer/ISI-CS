          OUR BUREAU                           Mamata Banerjee                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: The Centre is examining the option of using recent amendments to the National Council for Teacher Education Act to rescue the careers of 75,000 trainee teachers.         
	They stand to lose the validity of their degrees after 138 primary teacher training institutes were declared illegal by Calcutta High Court.        
	The students plight today united Mamata Banerjee and the CPM in the Lok Sabha.         
	The Centre asked the NCTE, the apex regulator for teacher training institutes, to find a way to end the impasse after senior leaders sought its intervention.         
	HRD ministry sources said the Centre could appeal the verdict in Calcutta High Court or approach the Supreme Court, citing a 2006 amendment to the NCTE Act. Sec- tion 17A of the law allows institutions not recognised in 2006 to continue offering courses for a period to be deter-mined by the NCTE, while they apply for recognition.         
	We are evaluating whether this section can be utilised to challenge the court order, an NCTE official said.        
	The institutes were banned because they were not recognised by the NCTE, but were granted affiliation by the Bengal government. Graduates from these institutes formed the states cadre of trained primary teachers.         
	An HRD ministry official conceded that the Bengal governments grant of affiliation to unrecognised institutions may land the government in trouble. The law bars any examination-conducting authority from granting affiliation to unrecognised institutions.        
	The students are not responsible for this. Many of them are already working as teachers. There must have been a gap in co-ordination between the state and the Centre, Mamata said.         
	Speaker Somnath Chatterjee endorsed her views and asked the Centre to look into the matter. CPM leader Hannan Mollah said: I associate with her in this matter.         
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said the Prime Minister had been informed about the courts decision during his recent visit to Bengal. The PM asked me to take it up with the concerned ministries. I have already taken it up with the HRD ministry.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Plainclothes shock for puja goons
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Barasat, Oct. 23: Ratan Sarkar and his friends, extorting Kali Puja subscription on Jessore Road, got a nasty shock last night when they flagged down cops in plainclothes.        
	Officer-in-charge Shankar Chowdhury and his team were in a hired Tata Sumo. With no red light flashing, Sarkar and his Kalpul Club friends did not sense the danger.         
	Like they were stopping other cars on Jessore Road, about 30km from Calcutta, for Kali Puja chanda, they stopped the Sumo too.         
	When Chowdhury stepped out and refused to pay up, some in the group shouted abuses at him, Ashoknagar additional superintendent of police Sugata Sen said. But a few who knew the OC by his face scooted.         
	Chowdhurys team that was tasked to round up such extortion gangs, however, arrested Sarkar and later two others.         
	We went looking for members of several clubs forcibly collecting Kali Puja chanda following complaints from residents. We went in plainclothes and we saw one group stopping cars. They did not realise who we were and stopped us too, Chowdhury said.

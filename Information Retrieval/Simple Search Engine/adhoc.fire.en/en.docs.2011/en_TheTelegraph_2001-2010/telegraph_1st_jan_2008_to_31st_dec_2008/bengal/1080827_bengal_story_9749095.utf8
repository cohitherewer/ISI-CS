	Calcutta: In the gloom triggered by the Singur impasse and Mamata Banerjees refusal to sit at the talks table, some good news came from Jindal Steel.        
	Sajjan Jindal said the foundation stone for a Rs 35,000-crore steel plant would be laid on November 2. The chief minister will do the honours in the presence of foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee. Jindal said the Prime Minister had also been invited. The first phase of the project will be completed by 2011-12.

	Darjeeling, July 28: The chief judicial magistrates court in Darjeeling has taken cognisance of FIRs lodged against Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leaders accused of launching attacks on the houses of GNLF supporters.         
	Soon after Morcha activist Pramila Sharma died after bullets were fired allegedly from the house of GNLF leader Deepak Gurung on Friday, his home and that of others in Subash Ghisinghs outfit were torched or vandalised.         
	The attacks, limited to town areas on Friday, spread to villages across the hills in the next two days. Since yesterday, police have received seven FIRs from people whose houses had been vandalised or vehicles set on fire.        
	Aitaraj Dewan, a GNLF leader arrested on murder charges after Sharmas death, has lodged a complaint against Amar Lama and Pasang Lama, both Morcha central committee members.        
	Dewan has also filed three FIRs against others, without identifying them, for attacking Ghisinghs house on Dr Zakir Hussian Road on Friday. The two other FIRs, by Deepak Gurungs wife Tara and Dewans wife Reeta Subba, are against D.K. Pradhan, Urmila Rumba, Alok Mani, Dinesh Gurung, Puran Thami, Babita Ganguly and seven other Morcha supporters.         
	Most of the cases against the Morcha members have been lodged under Sections 380 (theft) and 427 (mischief, causing damage) of the Indian Penal Code.        
	The police said the FIRs were forwarded to the court after charges were framed. The judge has taken cognisance of the offence, said a source. This means that police will start investigating the cases and the people named can be arrested any time.        
	Amar Lama, whose name figures in an FIR, said: These are all false cases.        
	In Calcutta, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee discussed the Darjeeling situation with Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim.

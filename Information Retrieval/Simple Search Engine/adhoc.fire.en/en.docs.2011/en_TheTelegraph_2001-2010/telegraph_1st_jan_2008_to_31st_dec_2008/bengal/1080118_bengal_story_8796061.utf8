	Chinsurah, Jan. 17: A schoolgirl and her mother were beheaded by a train engine today while crossing the tracks to cope with a sudden change in the platform schedule. 
    
	Sritama Roy, a 12-year-old student of St Josephs High School for Girls at Chandernagore, and mother Shrabasti, 36, were on their way home when the accident occurred. 
    
	They arrived on platform number 2 of Chandernagore station around 3.30pm to catch the Howrah-bound train they usually took to reach their Rishra home, five stations away.
    
	However, this afternoon, an announcement was made that the train would arrive at platform number 1. The mother and daughter were hurrying down the tracks instead of taking the footbridge when the engine hit them. 
    
	They were crushed under the wheels of the engine. We saw the headless bodies lying on the tracks, said Sushil Mishra, a hawker.
    
	Sritamas father Prasenjit, a deputy general manager of a south Calcutta nursing home, later identified the bodies.

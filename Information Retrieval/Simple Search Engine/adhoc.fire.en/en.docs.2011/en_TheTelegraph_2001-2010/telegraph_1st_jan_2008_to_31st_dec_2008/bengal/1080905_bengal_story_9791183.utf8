The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Brand Mamata does not sell
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Brand Mamata does not sell

	Singur, Sept. 4: Subhendu Ghosh had thought he would do brisk business selling key rings and stickers with Mamata Banerjees face barely 50m from the dharna podium.         
	He was wrong.         
	Brand Mamata, going by the sales of badges and pendants Ghosh has been bringing to Singur, is not selling.         
	I thought that her popularity in Singur would be high and so I decided to sell Mamata merchandise. It seemed a good business opportunity, said Ghosh.         
	The plastic and brass items  the key rings with a smiling Mamata picture cost Rs 10, the pendants Rs 8 and the badges Rs 5  were sourced from a dyeing unit in Sodepur.         
	The first day of the dharna was the best with sales touching Rs 1,000. Then it dipped. Yesterday, I could only manage to earn Rs 200, of which I spent Rs 70 on travelling and eating, said Ghosh, who reaches Singur after changing four trains and a 15km bicycle ride from his home to Chakdah railway station.        
	Krishna Haldar of Belghoria, who thought selling photo frames with Mamatas pictures would fetch money, echoed Ghosh. I sell posters and photo frames with Mamatas pictures. I priced them at Rs 25. But more people are opting for the posters of Rabindranath Tagore and Swami Vivekananda, Haldar said.         
	He has been coming to Singur everyday since the siege began and for maximum visibility positioned himself where Trinamul supporters are served lunch, 500m from the dharna manch.         
	I go to several melas across the state. If it is a religious one, the theme is gods and goddesses. If its a cultural meet, I focus on film stars. Here, as the entire show is about didi, I thought these items would sell well, said Ghosh, while folding up at 6pm.         
	On the first two days of the dharna, he had returned home at midnight, but not anymore.         
	I cant understand politics. So, there is no point in staying back if there are no buyers, Ghosh said.

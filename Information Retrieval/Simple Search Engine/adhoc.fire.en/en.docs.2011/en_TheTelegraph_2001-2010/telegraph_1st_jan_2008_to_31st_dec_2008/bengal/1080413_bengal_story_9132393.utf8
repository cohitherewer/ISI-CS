	Calcutta, April 12: A Burrabazar businessman who lives in Salt Lake was arrested last night on the charge of smuggling gold and precious stones.         
	Gold jewellery, weighing 2.6kg and fitted with diamonds and pearls, were found in Bijan Halders third-floor office on Jogendra Kabiraj Row in the Posta area.         
	Police said their value would be over Rs 45 lakh.        
	Halder, 49, failed to produce papers to prove from where he had got the jewellery, said the officer in charge of Posta.        
	He has an export agency office, but he smuggled gold and other valuables using private courier companies, a CID officer said.

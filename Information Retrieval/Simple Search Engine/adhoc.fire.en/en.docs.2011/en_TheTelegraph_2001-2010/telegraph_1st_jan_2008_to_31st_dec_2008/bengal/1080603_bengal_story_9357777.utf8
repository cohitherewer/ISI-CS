          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Calcutta, June 2: The government doesnt favour allotment of shares to landlosers by investors as a means of rehabilitation because it feels naive villagers could become financially worse with fluctuations in the capital market.        
	The government has been conveying to every investor coming to the state to set up industry that shares could be a risky business and alternatives like pension schemes for those losing land should be thought of.        
	Commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen discussed the issue with officials of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) a few days ago.         
	He told them to persuade potential investors and those setting up plants in the state to think of other rehabilitation measures instead of the stock option.        
	The concept of offering equity to land losers was floated by the Jindals when they decided to set up a steel plant in Salboni, West Midnapore.         
	However, the corporate group did not ultimately make it part of the agreement that saw the formation of JSW Bengal Steel, which will build the plant.        
	Asked whether the government had reservations about people being offered shares, the industries secretary said: All of us know that an industry house has announced that it would allot equity to people who lose their land in Salboni. But the point is that poor villagers are grossly unaware of how a share market functions and the risks associated with the capital market. They may feel great while being handed shares of a company but would not know what their fate would be when it goes into the red or the sensex crashes.        
	In such events, they may suffer huge financial losses. Moreover, who is going to tell the landlosers the appropriate time to sell the shares and earn profits?        
	According to a WBIDC official, investors are being told to explore the pension plan as a fixed amount of money allotted to a landloser can fetch returns for a long period of time.         
	Based on the productivity of the land acquired, its prospective price in the next 15 years can be calculated to compensate landlosers. Part of this compensation can be treated as a pension package, the official added.        
	The money can then be given to the affected persons annually with an interest tagged to the pension amount. We are telling industrialists to consider this as part of their rehabilitation package.        
	The industries secretary said investors were also being asked to consider offering small pieces of land near their project sites to the landlosers.        
	Its quite natural that the price of land in areas around a project would shoot up after the industry gets going. If a company, after two or three years of operation, offers small pieces of land to those who had to part with their plots because of the project, they will benefit a lot by selling them in times of need. We are asking investors to consider this aspect, too, Sen said.

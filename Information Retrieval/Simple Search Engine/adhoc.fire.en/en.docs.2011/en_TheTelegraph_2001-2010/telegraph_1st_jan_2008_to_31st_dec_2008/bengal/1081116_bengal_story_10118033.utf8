	Jhargram, Nov. 15: Police suspect Maoists to be behind the alleged murder of a ration dealer whose body was found in a forest near Belpahari police station today.        
	According to the police, Ashoke Haldar was a known CPM supporter. There were several complaints against him for malpractice. Although he never reported any threat from Maoists, we suspect them for todays incident, said an officer.        
	The police did not conduct raids in the jungles today. Rajesh Kumar Singh, West Midnapore superintendent of police, said Ashokes killers did not leave posters behind. But the needle of suspicion points to the Maoists. We are planning a raid tomorrow morning.         
	Villagers of Tongveda found the body of the 45-year-old Ashoke with his head smashed and wounds on his chest.        
	Last night, Ashoke had a fight with some people who came to his house and demanded a quintal of rice, elder brother Murali said. This morning, some tribals Murali did not know told Ashoke to attend a march in Belpahari against the police atrocities in Lalgarh. He went with them. I saw him walking silently in the procession. That was the last time I saw him, Murali said.

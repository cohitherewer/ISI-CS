          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 13: A pregnant woman died this evening after she was allegedly pushed off a train by ticket checkers in South 24-Parganas.        
	Tarangini Mondal, a 37-year-old domestic help, was declared dead in Canning sub-divisional hospital where she was taken, bleeding profusely and with head injuries.        
	Railway police said the woman from Taldi in South 24-Parganas, about 60km from Calcutta, was travelling ticketless.         
	She got off a Canning local at Taldi, where she was caught by the checking squad. They told her to board the special train, Chetna. When the ticket-checking train reached Ghutiarysharif, she jumped off to escape but fell on the platform and injured her head, said Barun Mullick, the superintendent of railway police, Sealdah. There was no question of pushing her. She fell probably after losing her balance.         
	But Pintu Laskar, Taranginis neighbour who was coincidentally at the Ghutiarysharif station, said: Tarangini was pushed off the train by the ticket checkers. She fell on the tracks. She was pregnant and bleeding profusely.        
	Nearly 1,000 passengers blocked the tracks at Ghutiarysharif for four hours after the incident. Canning police lathicharged to disperse them.

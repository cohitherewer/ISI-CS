	Singur, Sept. 7: The possibility of Mamata Banerjee meeting the chief minister first sparked hope among her supporters that the impasse was about to end.        
	They had no clue then that hope and despair would be locked in a tussle for the next few hours.        
	There has to be a solution now. Something constructive will come out of the meeting. Its (the meeting is) good news for all of us, said Anurag Das, sitting on a chair close to the manch along with four party supporters.        
	Das, a resident of Nadia, called up several leaders to inform them of the big news.        
	His excitement was also proof of the fact that Trinamul Congress supporters wanted their leader to engage with the government.        
	A meeting between the two leaders seemed a distant dream till yesterday. But the jinx has been broken, Das said, smiling.        
	The meeting was on everybodys lips and the atmosphere around the manch underwent a sea change  from uncertainty to hope  within minutes.        
	Please be in front of the TV and keep me updated on the developments. Hopefully, I will return home tonight. Its good news for you as well, Arup Das told his wife over the phone.         
	Arup, also from Nadia district, has been camping in Singur since the siege started on August 24.        
	Applause greeted Mamatas announcement this afternoon that she was going to meet the governor.         
	Didi, aaj kichhu samadhan kore ashben (Didi, ensure a solution today), a supporter shouted as she set out for the talks. Mamata looked at him and nodded.

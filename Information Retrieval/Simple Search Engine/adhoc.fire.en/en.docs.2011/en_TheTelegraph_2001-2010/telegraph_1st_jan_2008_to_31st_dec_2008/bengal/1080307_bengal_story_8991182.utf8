          OUR BUREAU                          Police take Seema to Belur Math on Thursday. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                  
	Howrah/Burdwan, March 6: Seema Sai today confessed to drowning her two daughters in a Belur Math reservoir, apparently driven by regular taunts at her in-laws house for bearing girls.        
	Two days after the bodies were fished out, the 24-year-old home-maker told police that she was subjected to mental torture by her husband and in-laws.         
	But we are verifying whether she gave us the correct picture, an officer said. The woman first pushed Riya, 4, into the water and then threw her younger daughter, nine-month-old Shreya.        
	Seema was held last night.        
	Her father-in-law Ananda Sai and husband Kanchan, residents of Cha village under Khondoghosh police station, 185km from Calcutta, contested her claim.        
	We were very fond of the two girls. I used to play with them all the time. Its a blatant lie that we taunted and tortured her, Ananda said.         
	Kanchan echoed his father. I dont know why Seema has falsely accused us of torturing her for bearing girls, he said.        
	Howrah superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh took Seema to the Math reservoir at 9.30 this morning and asked her to reconstruct the crime sequence. She showed us how she had first pushed her elder daughter into the water and then the younger one. She remained calm while enacting the murder for about five minutes, an officer said.        
	Investigations have revealed that Seema had come to Anandanagar, near Belur Math, on Monday to attend the wedding of her sister. She was accompanied by her daughters, mother Archana and seven other relatives.        
	Around 10.30 the next morning, the group boarded a local train to Burdwan, 80km from Belur.         
	After getting off at the Burdwan station at 1.30pm, Seema told her mother and other relatives that she would take her daughters to a nearby nursing home for a check-up.         
	Seema and her daughters were back in Belur by 5.30 that evening. Then, they took a rickshaw to the Math.         
	The police said Seema had initially intended to drown her daughters in the Hooghly, which flows along the Math, and then jump herself. But she could not muster the courage.        
	When she entered the Math, she saw the reservoir and decided this was the perfect place to carry out her plan.         
	As the evening prayers were on, nobody saw Seema entering the garden where the reservoir is located. Besides, it was dark, Singh said. The deed done, Seema sat under a tree and spent the night there, the SP added.        
	The police said Seema left the Math in the early hours of Wednesday. She went to the Belur station by a rickshaw and took a train to Burdwan.        
	Seema was produced before the chief judicial magistrates court in Howrah today and has been remanded in 14 days police custody.

	Siliguri, July 19: Three elephants have been found dead in the Mahananda wildlife sanctuary near Siliguri in the past 24 hours.         
	There were no external injuries and foresters said they could have been poisoned by villagers wary of marauding herds.         
	A female aged about 35 and its two-year-old calf were found dead yesterday at the heart of the sanctuary. Forest guards on patrol spotted a four-year-old calf lying dead this morning, about a kilometre away.         
	There were no injury marks like those found when elephants die of electrocution or gunshots. After a preliminary probe, we suspect that the elephants died of poisoning but can confirm it only after receiving forensic reports from Calcutta, said N.C. Bahuguna, the chief conservator of forests in north Bengal.         
	Vets who conducted the post-mortem said they felt the elephants had been poisoned.         
	Corn was found in the stomachs of the two animals found dead yesterday. It is possible that the they were poisoned by tea garden residents desperate to save their property, said Bahuguna.        
	Elephants had last week entered Simulbari and New Chumta tea estates, bordering the sanctuary, and injured three garden residents and damaged six houses. In neighbouring Jalpaiguri, two men were killed and several injured.        
	Conservationist Animesh Bose said: The Mahananda fringe villagers might have put poison in foodgrain to prevent elephant intrusions.        
	Bose added that villagers had to be made aware of the loss that an elephant death brought. The forest department should also provide them with crackers and searchlights to thwart elephant raids.

	Santiniketan, Jan 8: A text message that could have been the trigger for Amaresh Kundu to kill the girl he loved was discovered in his cellphone today.        
	Aamar fiance ke barbar disturb korchhish keno? Oke disturb korishna please. Shore ja (Why are you repeatedly disturbing my fiance? Please dont disturb her. Stay away), said the message sent by a person named Anjan at 8.31pm on Saturday, a day before Amaresh shot Saswati Pal before turning the gun on himself at a Visva-Bharati hostel.         
	It is possible that after receiving the message from Anjan on Saturday evening, Amaresh decided to kill Saswati, a police officer investigating the case said.        
	Another message sent last week read: O aamar fiance, Oke chhere de (She is my fiance, leave her alone).        
	The police have also seized Saswatis mobile phone from the scene of the shooting. It, too, contained messages from Anjan but they were harmless inquiries about her health and classes, the police said.        
	However, the police are yet to find out if Anjan is the man from Maharashtra the 21-year-old Saswati was supposed to marry.         
	A relative of Saswati in West Midnapores Ghatal said she was engaged to a man named Anjan. He, too, is from Ghatal town and is a diploma engineer who works in Maharashtra.         
	The police suspect that Amaresh knew Anjan well because he had saved his number in his cellphone. We are now more or less certain that it was a love triangle and Amaresh was desperate to speak to Saswati who was not taking his calls, an officer said.         
	Amareshs mobile has thrown up a threat SMS that was probably never sent. Sabdhaney thakish. Start counting your last days. Etobar bollam, shunli na (Be on your guard Start counting your days. I told you so many times but you did not listen), says a message saved as draft.        
	Another one has Amaresh pleading with the third-year Sangit Bhavan student to take his calls. Ami to ekta manush, janwar noi. Phone ta please otha Sonai (I am a man, not an animal. Please pick up the phone, Sonai).         
	We dont know whether he had finally sent the message with the death threat because we did not find any message from him in Saswatis inbox, an officer said.        
	The police also found a packet of condoms in Amareshs wallet. How could a man in such a disturbed state of mind carry condoms? This indicates he had other intentions apart from just killing Saswati, an officer said.        
	The four bullets that the 29-year-old had fired were recovered this evening. Two of them were found in Saswatis body, one in Amareshs body and the fourth lay on the floor of the hostel room.

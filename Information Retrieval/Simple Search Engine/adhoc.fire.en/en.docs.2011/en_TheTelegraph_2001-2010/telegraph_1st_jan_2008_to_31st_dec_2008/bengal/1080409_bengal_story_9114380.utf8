	Singur/Calcutta, April 8: Swraj Paul, chairman of the Caparo Group and member of the House of Lords, wants to see more industrialisation and investments in Bengal.        
	I would like to see more jobs being created for the people of Bengal, he said on his way out of the Tata Motors plant in Singur where Caparo is investing Rs 120 crore.         
	It will supply sheet metal and frames for the Nano.         
	At the 25-acre Caparo site, Paul participated in a bhoomi puja. We came to Singurbecause Tata Nano has made quite an impression on the world, said Paul, accompanied by his wife, a UK parliamentary association delegation and Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim.        
	They went to the trim chassis fitment and welding shops and spoke to the workers.         
	Bengal has improved a lot the purpose of our visit is to see how we can help the state develop more, Paul said.        
	He was aware of the earlier unrest over the car plant. I dont think everybody in Singur is opposed to the developments here and I hope it will progress faster so that more and more jobs can be created for many more people, Paul said.        
	The team got a taste of the opposition when a handful of Trinamul Congress and SUCI supporters waved black flags and shouted go back at Maitypara, 20km from the plant site, and at Khasherbheri, about 15km down the road.        
	However, during a visit to Writers Buildings to meet the chief minister, Paul said: We saw smiles on the faces there.

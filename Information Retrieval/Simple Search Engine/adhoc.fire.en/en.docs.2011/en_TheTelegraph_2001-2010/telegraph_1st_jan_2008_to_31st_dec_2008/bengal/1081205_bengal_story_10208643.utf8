          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Dec. 4: Staff of a government hospital, including doctors, cooked a feast on the premises, sang and banged tables last midnight while patients unable to sleep almost choked in the fumes from the kitchen.         
	The Katwa sub-divisional hospital maternity ward, beside the makeshift kitchen in a hall, had 40 women patients of whom at least two had delivered yesterday morning. We could not breathe and almost choked in the smoke coming from the kitchen since afternoon, said a woman who delivered a girl.         
	I was given painkillers and was told I should sleep. But I couldnt because of the loud chatter and the smell of cigarettes. The hospital staff sang and banged on the tables, the woman said, requesting anonymity.         
	Shankari Paramanik of Katwa, whose sister Rama gave birth to a girl yesterday, had similar complaints. My sister told me she could not sleep till late last night. Some nurses and Group D staff were cooking and the smoke drifted into the ward, she said.         
	A doctor, among the 25 staff members at the feast, saw nothing wrong. We arrange the feast in the hospital every year. We also need a break. I dont see anything wrong.        
	But chief medical officer of health Abu Ershad said feasts inside hospitals were illegal. It is a serious offence. I have sought a report from the hospital, he said.

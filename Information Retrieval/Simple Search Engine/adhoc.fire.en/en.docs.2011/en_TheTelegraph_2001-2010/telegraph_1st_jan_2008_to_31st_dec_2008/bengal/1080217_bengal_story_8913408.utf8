	Darjeeling, Feb. 16: GNLF councillors who had sneaked into the Darjeeling municipality last midnight to defy a blockade were held hostage without food, water and power until late this evening.        
	Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supporters laid siege to the municipality around five in the morning, little realising that the GNLF councillors were already inside.        
	They were to elect a new chairman to the board, but the Morcha led by Bimal Gurung wanted elections to four vacant wards first.        
	When the 13 Morcha councillors realised that the 15 GNLF councillors were inside, they decided to attend the 10am meeting. But they got a taste of their own medicine. The gates were locked.         
	Even the government-appointed observer, Prem Bardewa, could not enter.        
	Morcha supporters, who snapped the buildings power connection, surrounded it through the day. Some of them climbed its 80ft clock tower to hoist the party flag.        
	The chairmans post fell vacant with B.B. Dewans death on January 1.        
	GNLF councillor Bimal Gurung, a namesake of the Morcha leader, said: Weve elected Pema Yolmo the chairman. I continue to be the vice-chairman.        
	Darjeeling district magistrate Rajesh Pandey confirmed that the holed-up GNLF councillors had elected the new chairman. The Morcha questioned the legality of the poll in the absence of either its councillors or the observer.        
	The GNLF councillors will send me the resolution of the meeting on Monday. I can comment only after going through it, Pandey said.        
	Morcha leaders filed a general diary with police, accusing the GNLF councillors of closing the municipality gates illegally.         
	Councillor Amar Lama said: There is no official witness to the election. We will go to court.        
	The party has called an indefinite strike in the civic body.         
	With the group that had blocked Ladenla Road getting restless, Morcha leaders held a meeting with the administration.         
	It decided that Morcha leaders, members of the media and district officials would check whether unauthorised persons had attended the meeting as a condition for safe passage to the holed-up councillors.         
	The key to the gate was handed to a policeman. The team, which was allowed inside, found 15 GNLF councillors in the vice-chairmans chamber. The exhausted leaders were in no position to speak.        
	The GNLF leaders could not walk free even after the Opposition had allowed them a safe passage. Morcha supporters who thronged the road continued with the siege. They relented around 9 tonight.

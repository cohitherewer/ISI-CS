	Nov. 21: Labour minister Mrinal Banerjee today met Citu and Intuc leaders at Writers Buildings and asked them to give it in writing that they wanted government intervention to end the Dunlop stalemate.        
	State Citu secretary Kali Ghosh and Intuc leader Pramathesh Sen told the minister something ought to be done to pacify workers as the management was in no mood to restart production, an official said.        
	The government cant interfere in the affairs of a private company unless its intervention is sought. Thats why I asked them to write the letter, Banerjee said.        
	He added that Dunlop chairman Pawan Ruia would meet him on Monday to apprise him of the situation.         
	Keen to fish in troubled waters, Maoists who were active in Nandigram and Singur urged the Dunlop workers to build a militant agitation to realise their just demands. The CPI (Maoist) issued a statement blaming the unions for the ills in the organisation.

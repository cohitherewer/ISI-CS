The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Farmer ties lost: CPM
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Farmer ties lost: CPM
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 21: The CPM has admitted that it has lost credibility and trustworthiness among farmers, which is making it difficult to convince them about the need to acquire land for industry.         
	A letter recently circulated among the partys rank and file blamed the Oppositions smear campaign for confusing people.         
	Titled Review of work on the peasant front and our future task, the document came in response to reports from the CPMs grassroots workers about the impact of land acquisition and other factors on the May panchayat polls, in which the party had lost four zilla parishads.         
	The letter did not reveal the extent of erosion in support but admitted that farmers perception of the party and the government had changed over the years. This confusion over land acquisition would not have occurred had there been an opportunity to set up industries during the earlier tenures of the Left Front that were marked by an intense movement for land takeover from zamindars.        
	However, the letter said, there was a generation gap with todays farmers.         
	Earlier, farmers would have easily believed what we said about industry in view of our partys bloodstained relation with the farmers movement. The people of that generation are gone.         
	The CPM admitted that it had overestimated the level of farmers consciousness about the current situation.         
	The letter said the party had realised its mistakes and taken corrective steps.         
	It stressed on land acquisition with the consent of farmers along with adequate compensation.        
	The party has asked the rank and file to start an intensive campaign in rural areas on the need for industrialisation, with special focus on agriculture labourers who fear loss of livelihood in case of acquisition.         
	Referring to Mamata Banerjees Singur agitation, the document tacitly accused the Opposition of helping the Tatas rivals. They are obstructing the production of cars here but organising festivals to sell cars produced outside the state, the letter said, hinting at a Maruti Udyog fair in Singur a few months ago.         
	They have not begun a war against our party and the Left Front, but against the people of Bengal, it added.

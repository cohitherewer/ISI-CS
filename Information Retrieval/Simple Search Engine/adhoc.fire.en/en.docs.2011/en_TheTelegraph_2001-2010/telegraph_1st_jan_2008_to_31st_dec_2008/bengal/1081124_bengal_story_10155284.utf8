  - Art class for a life more fulfilling           NARESH JANA                          Asit Das at his art class. Picture by Swarup Mondal                                        
	Midnapore, Nov. 23: An elderly man, the ever-so-common rickshaw-puller through the week, takes on a radically different mantle over weekends in Midnapore town. He turns art teacher for around 30 children who huddle around his three-wheeler.        
	Asit Das, 62, is not a rickshawallah for the children. He is their Aankadadu (grandpa who paints), a sketch board balanced on his lap and pencil between his fingers.        
	Pulling the rickshaw, Asit earns about Rs 100 a week. With this money, he buys drawing paper, pencils, crayons and watercolour for the children.         
	He also buys candies  the prize for a good sketch.        
	On Saturday and Sunday afternoon, Asit and his students gather in the courtyard of a club near Laldighi, about 130km from Calcutta.         
	He left his ancestral house, wife and son seven years ago because he felt he was living a life without purpose. I had studied up to Class IX at Midnapore Collegiate School. I quit school after my father died and started working as a labourer. I started pulling my rickshaw once I had a family. But I was not satisfied. I wanted to do something more fulfilling, Asit said.        
	His son Chandan, too, quit school, but because he fell into bad company. I tried to bring him to the right path but he would not listen. Now, he is a helper to a truck driver, said the father.        
	He could see other children in the neighbourhood going the way his son did. Many of them were leaving school and doing nothing of worth. I felt I should do something for the children so they learn something good in life. One of my teachers always told us to help build good human beings.        
	I decided to teach the children here how to draw, the only thing I knew, said Asit.         
	When Asit told his wife Kalpana and son Chandan that he was leaving home, they were angry, but still I left, telling my son to take care of his mother.        
	Asit lives under a shed built for bus passengers near Laldighi. When it rains, a local resident allows him to sleep in his garage.        
	Bhakti Sangha allows him to hold the drawing classes on a field in front of the club.        
	We were overwhelmed by his sincerity. We feel sorry we cannot provide him a room to open a proper art school. We hope to do that for Aankadadu some day, said club secretary Ashok Bhattacharya.        
	The parents see a blessing in Aankadadu. My daughter has not only learnt to draw well, she has won prizes in local competitions, said Lakshman Goswami, a goldsmith. His daughter Nisha is a Class V student.        
	Rupali, 8, and Sonali, 4, whose father is a cook, also attend the classes. Asitbabu really takes care of his students. They would not have got such training if I had admitted them to a conventional art school. I am grateful to him, said their father Chandi Das.

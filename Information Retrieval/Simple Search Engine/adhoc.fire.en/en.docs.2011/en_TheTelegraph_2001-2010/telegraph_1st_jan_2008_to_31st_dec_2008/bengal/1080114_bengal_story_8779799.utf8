	Santiniketan, Jan. 13: A sus-pected bird flu outbreak has killed over 15,000 chickens in Birbhum district over the past 10 days.
    
	The Centres department of animal husbandry said preliminary tests at the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal have suggested the disease.
    
	State animal resources development minister Anisur Rahman, who spoke to the livestock commissioner in Delhi, said: He (the commissioner) told me they are apprehending bird flu. We expect the final report by tomorrow.
    
	Most of the deaths had so far been reported from Margram and Mallarpur villages in the Rampurhat subdivision. But there were reports of more chicken deaths from other villages in Rampurhat and Suri subdivisions this evening.
    
	The administration sounded an alert across the district after a meeting with animal husbandry assistant commissioner Sujit Kumar, who came down from Delhi.
    
	Villagers have been told not to sell chicken.
    
	District magistrate Tapan Kumar Som said: Weve restricted the sale of chickens in the villages and told villagers to isolate diseased birds. A campaign will be launched to educate them on how to handle the affected chickens.
    
	Poultry keepers have been told to have their faces and hands covered while providing feed to the birds. We are asking them to use a piece of cloth covering their nose and mouth and plastic packets as gloves, the DM said.
    
	Director of health services Sanchita Bakshi said though there was no report of any person being taken ill in the affected areas, the districts chief medical officer had been asked to open an isolation ward in Rampurhat. 
    
	Weve sent Tamiflu tablets, used to alleviate the symptoms of bird flu, to the district. We are fully prepared and keeping a watch on the situation, Bakshi said. 
    
	There has been no bird flu in humans in Bengal so far but it has killed over 200 people in 12 countries since 2003.
    
	The residents of Margram first realised that their chickens were dying in large numbers 10 days ago. 
    
	Bhutto Sheikh, a chicken dealer, found some of the birds unusually drowsy. They went in a stupor before dying. I lost 50 chickens, he said.
    
	About 95 self-help groups in the village rear poultry in the area. 
    
	When we cut a chicken to sell its meat, we found blood clots, said Asmuda Khatun, who runs a group that lost 35 chickens.
    
	Another dealer, Bablu Mal, who ate one of his dead chickens, said he had invested money on them and thought he should not let it go waste entirely. He was feeling scared today.
    
	Thousands of birds were culled in 2006 following three outbreaks of the deadly H5N1 virus in Maharashtra.
    
	In Murshidabad, neighbouring Birbhum, police are guarding roads.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tibetan bid to set himself on fire foiled
                                                                                                               Tibetan bid to set himself on fire foiled

	Rangpo, March 26: A Tibetan from Shillong tried to set himself on fire here today to protest against Chinese brutality in Lhasa, but marchers accompanying him managed to douse him with water in the nick of time.         
	The march to Tibet through Nathu-la in East Sikkim was called off and so was the hunger strike after a plea from Sherad Tharshing, an emissary of the Dalai Lama, the head of the Tibetan government-in- exile at Dharamsala.         
	He told us that the Dalai Lama desired that we call off the hunger strike and return home in the name of peace, said Dawa Gyalpo, the president of the Tibetan Youth Congress for the Northeast.         
	Kalsang Damdul, 31, said his inner voice had driven him to end his life. Damdul, who runs a small restaurant at Barabazar in Shillong, had sprinkled himself with kerosene, which he got from a nearby tea stall. But before I could light up, others started pouring water on me, he said.        
	Since I saw the pictures of Chinese brutality, I became emotional. I got to know about the march from Salugarah to Tibet and readily agreed to be part of the protest. However, on reaching here, I was frustrated by the Sikkim governments refusal to let us in. Today, at the call of my inner voice, I tried to set myself on fire.         
	Police, however, said they were not aware of any self-immolation bid.         
	The Tibetans had been on fast at Rangpo, on the Sikkim-Bengal border, for three days after they were stopped from entering the hill state.        
	The march was part of the back-to-Tibet programme.         
	Tharshing said he had been in Siliguri for the past two days to form the Bengal-Sikkim chapter of the Tibetan Solidarity Committee in India. I received a message from our government-in-exile that the Dalai Lama wanted the fast and the protests in Rangpo to end because we respect the confidence that the Indian government has in us and do not want to create law and order problems, he said.        
	The protesters disbanded at 7pm and started heading to Siliguri or Kalimpong. They had set out from Siliguri on March 20 to protest against the Chinese crackdown in the Tibet Autonomous Region.        
	Buddhist monks had taken to Lhasas streets around 15 days ago to mark the 49th anniversary of the failed uprising against the Communist rule, triggering a crackdown.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh has denied that Uttar Pradesh police had fired on farmers when his party president, Mulayam Singh Yadav, was chief minister and he had dubbed the protest over land acquisition a nautanki (drama).        
	Amar said he was prepared to leave public life if this incident was proved true. He said that unlike the Left Front government in Bengal, the Samajwadi-led coalition did not barter away the rights and interests of farmers and landowners to please industrialists.         
	Amar said that as the head of the Uttar Pradesh industrial development council, he had invited the Tatas to set up the Nano plant in his state.         
	Yes, Mr Ravi Kant, the chief of Tata Motors, met me. I offered to extend all help to him to start the Nano project but I told him I could not acquire land for him as is done by the CPM regime in West Bengal. I can only facilitate a cordial meeting with the landowners, farmers and the Tata management. They will have to satisfy their material demands so that there is no controversy.        
	Ravi Kant said a progressive Marxist government in West Bengal is willing to facilitate the role of acquiring the land and handing it over to the Tatas. On that, I said thank you very much, Ravi Kant, I am not as helpful as Buddhababu is.         
	Referring to the allegation of police firing on farmers on July 8, 2006, Amar said: The report is unfounded, baseless and misleading. Far from bullet injuries, there was not even a mild charge in Dadri (where farmers had agitated, demanding a higher price for land acquired for a power plant).        
	On the contrary, just one week ago (on August 13), farmers in Noida and Ghaziabad were fired on by the police. Six of them succumbed... and 13 are seriously injured. While our progressive communist friends visited Dadri with V.P. Singh in Mulayam Singh Yadavs regime, they did not shed a tear for the dying farmers (in Greater Noida). They didnt even issue a statement condemning this incident. On the contrary, comrade Prakash Karat was busy breaking bread with his favourite prime ministerial nominee, Mayavati.

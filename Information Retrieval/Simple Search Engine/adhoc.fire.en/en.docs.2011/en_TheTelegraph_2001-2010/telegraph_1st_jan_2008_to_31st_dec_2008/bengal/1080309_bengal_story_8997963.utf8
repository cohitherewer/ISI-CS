                                                                                                               Power hope for city
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 8: Power cuts continued to plague the city and its neighbourhood today but the situation is expected to improve from tomorrow, CESC officials have said.        
	Parts of the city went without power for one to two hours as it grappled with a peak-hour shortfall of 166mw.        
	The officials said the conveyor belt of three units at the CESCs Titagarh power plant had been repaired and normal generation was expected by tomorrow. The plant, which has a capacity of 240mw, produced 191mw around 6.30 this evening.         
	A fire in the conveyor belt feeding coal to the boiler had shut down three of the plants four units on Thursday.         
	Our engineers worked on a war footing to repair the conveyor belt, and by tomorrow morning we expect normal generation, an official said.        
	The West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited, which runs the state-owned power plants, said three new units at the Bakreswar, Santaldih and Sagardighi plants wound start generation by the end of March.         
	We hope to contribute about 700mw to the states grid this summer, said S. Mahapatra, managing director of the corporation.

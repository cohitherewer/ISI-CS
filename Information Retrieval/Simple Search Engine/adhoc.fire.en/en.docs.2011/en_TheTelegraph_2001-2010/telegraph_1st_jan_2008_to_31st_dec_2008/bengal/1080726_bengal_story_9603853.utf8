                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Land trend alarming: Minister
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 25: Around 1.2 lakh acres of farmland have been converted for industrial use in the past five years, the land minister told the Assembly today and described it as an alarming trend.         
	Tabling the land and land reforms budget, Abdur Rezzak Mollah said: Over the past five years, the amount of farmland that got converted for industrial use is about 1.2 lakh acres. That is something alarming and, if this trend continues, we are going to face serious problems in the future.         
	The minister iterated his concern for food security.        
	The concern has become all the more serious in the CPM after the setbacks the party had to suffer in the panchayat polls in May, to a large extent because of farmland acquisition or the threat of it.        
	However, while voicing his concern over a possible food shortage in the future, Mollah also stressed the need for industry in our state.        
	Acquisition notices have been issued for the takeover of about 25,000 acres in West Midnapore, East Midnapore, Burdwan and Purulia for steel plants to be set up by 10 industry groups.         
	Objections are now being heard and the process (of acquisition) is on in all four districts, the minister said.

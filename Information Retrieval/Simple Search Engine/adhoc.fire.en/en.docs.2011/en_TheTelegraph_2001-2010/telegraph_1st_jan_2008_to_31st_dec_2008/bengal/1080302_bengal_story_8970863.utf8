The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | JU student in tussle over hot plot
                                                                                                               JU student in tussle over hot plot
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Satrajit on Saturday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Calcutta, March 1: A second-year college student who owns 33 cottahs of prime land in south Calcutta has alleged that he was kidnapped by a promoter and then harassed by police for five hours on Saturday.        
	Satrajit Ghosh Dass, 23, a student of English at Jadavpur University, was allegedly roughed up in front of his house around 9am and whisked away in a car by Dipak Bhattacharya, a local promoter. He was dropped back home within an hour.        
	Later, the Lake thana slapped a case of disturbance of peace and resistance to arrest against Satrajit.         
	The JU student, let off on a police bond, must seek bail from a court on Monday.         
	The dispute can be traced back to February 2003 when Satrajit handed over a plot at 10/1 Panchanantala Road, part of the property adjacent to AMRI Hospitals in Dhakuria, to Bhattacharya for construction.        
	Initially, Bhattacharya paid us Rs 10.76 lakh, but he refused to complete the work and make any further payment. A year later, he called Satrajit and his father Murari Mohan Das to Mahanirban Road and forced the youngster to sign on a blank stamp paper in the presence of policemen, alleged Satrajits lawyer Dola Adhikari.        
	Satrajit, who had inherited the plot from his mother, then lodged an FIR accusing Bhattacharya of acting at the behest of AMRI Hospitals, which had allegedly been eyeing the plot for its expansion.        
	Bhattacharya denied the charge. Satrajits family took Rs 30 lakh from me in January 2005 and asked me to develop the plot. But then, they suddenly said they were not interested in the construction. They havent returned my money and are making false allegations.        
	AMRI Hospitals refused to be drawn into the controversy. General manager P. Dasgupta said: We cannot react to such an allegation without going through the official records.        
	Satrajits father called up the Lake police station soon after the youth was allegedly driven away today.        
	By the time the police arrived, the young man was back home. The police, instead of charging Bhattacharya, said Satrajit had kidnapped the promoter, a classmate alleged.        
	When we reached the spot after receiving a complaint from Satrajits father, we saw Satrajit had locked up Bhattacharya inside their house, said P. Chatterjee, the duty officer at the Lake police station.        
	Satrajit was taken to the police station where he was reportedly detained and harassed, said his classmates. Some teachers from the JU department of English were with Satrajit at the police station.        
	The lawyer trained the gun on AMRI Hospitals. In mid-2004, Satrajit was called for a meeting with representatives of AMRI, which was trying to grab the land. But he did not agree to the offer of Rs 30 lakh for the 33 cottahs, said Adhikari.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Santiniketan, Jan. 9: Visva-Bharati University is planning recreation programmes and informal chat sessions at Ananda Sadan hostel to cheer up girls left traumatised by Sundays shooting.
    
	We realise that the inmates of Ananda Sadan are in a state of shock after Sundays incident. We want to help them overcome their trauma. So, we have decided to organise programmes for them and informal chats, said Sagarika Dutta, the dean of student affairs.
    
	The programmes would be held in one of the hostel rooms. Several boarders have already left for home.
    
	Boarders from the ground floor have been accommodated in other hostels after they complained of uneasiness in staying close to the crime scene. Many of them have gone to Sri Sadan, another hostel for Sangit and Kala Bhavan students.
    
	About a dozen students from north Bengal left Ananda Sadan today.
    
	A number of boarders had spoken to vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray yesterday about their need to spend time with their families to cope with the difficult times. 
    
	We feel suffocated and scared. We need to forget what happened on Sunday. Thats why we are leaving, said Sayani, before leaving for Bolpur station on a rickshaw.
    
	Police today handed over to the authorities keys to the room where the shooting took place and the one in which Saswati stayed.
    
	Body found
    
	The decomposed body of a young woman was found in a field in Purbapalli this evening. 
    
	Police said the woman was in her late 20s.

	Digha, Nov. 24: The body of a man believed to be from Calcutta was washed ashore on the beach at Old Digha this evening.         
	Police said it was that of Raja Bhattacharya, 30, according to Sanjay Singh, who went to Digha police station and identified himself as Rajas friend.         
	Any identification, however, is not official until a family member confirms it.         
	Sanjay, 32, told the police they had come to Digha from Dum Dum Nagerbazar along with another friend, Chanchal Chatterjee, who is missing. The trio apparently went to the sea drunk this morning.         
	Chanchal fled after Raja drowned, said Sanjay, who has been arrested.        
	A local police officer said there were some discrepancies in what Sanjay had told them.

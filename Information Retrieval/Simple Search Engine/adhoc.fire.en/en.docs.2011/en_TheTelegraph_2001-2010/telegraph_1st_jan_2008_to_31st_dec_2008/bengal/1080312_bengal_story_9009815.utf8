	March 11: Political parties are allegedly asking culling teams in Murshidabad not to pressure villagers to part with their birds because the rural polls are only months away.        
	We are handicapped. Political leaders are resisting our pressure on villagers because of the panchayat polls, animal resource secretary Dilip Chakraborty said.        
	Police are accompanying rapid response teams as the administration fears attacks by villagers.

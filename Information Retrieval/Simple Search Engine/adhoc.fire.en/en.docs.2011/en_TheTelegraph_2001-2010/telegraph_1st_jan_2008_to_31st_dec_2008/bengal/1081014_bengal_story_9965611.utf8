The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Comrades rush to see patriarch in autumn
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Comrades rush to see patriarch in autumn
          BISWAJIT ROY                          Basu being led back to his house after a photo session with party colleagues. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 13: CPM cen- tral committee members met the ailing Jyoti Basu at his home this afternoon to pay their respects to the last surviving founding father of the party.         
	Almost of all CC members were concerned about his health and wanted to meet him. So we decided to go together. Its like the mountain going to meet Mohammed, said politburo member M.K. Pandhe.        
	The younger members of the committee like Sudha Sundaram, who is in her 30s, were especially keen to meet the veteran. Basu had finished over three decades in politics when she was born.         
	He is our respected leader. We wanted to see him and he said he was very happy to see us too, said Sundaram, a leader of the womens wing.        
	Basu, never known to have expressed his emotions in public, came out to greet the visitors, who had assembled in the open space in front of Indira Bhavan. He thanked his comrades for coming over.        
	The CPM does not believe in the personality cult, but leaders from Kerala to Kashmir, Gujarat to Tripura posed with Basu, impeccably dressed  in a crisp white dhuti-panjabi and a grey sleeveless jacket  for the photo session.         
	After the central commi-ttee members were through, the women among them posed separately with the grand old man. Citu leaders, too, stood for a separate picture.        
	The central committees meeting was planned in Calcutta primarily to ensure the pa-triarchs presence, but Basu, 94, who had often made it to the partys Alimuddin Street office despite being unwell, failed to do so this time.         
	A clot in his brain, formed after he hurt his head in a fall earlier this year, got bigger after he fell again in August and forced hospitalisation. Basu was released from the hospital 10 days later after he declined to undergo a minor surgery to remove the clot.         
	As a fleet of cars and a bus carrying the central committee members arrived at Indira Bhavan in Salt Lake, a CPM veteran called it an unprecedented event in the history of the party.        
	Some party leaders put the number of visitors at over 80.         
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was not among them, though. A party leader said it was because the chief minister keeps meeting Basu.         
	Bhattacharjees Kerala counterpart V.S. Achuthanandan and politburo member Sitaram Yechury were also not there. They are in Delhi for the National Integration Council meeting.         
	Basu, a member of the council, wrote to the Prime Minister today. Central committee members, among whom copies of the letter were circulated, said he urged the Centre to show the political will and administrative firmness to deal with the attacks on minorities in NDA-ruled Orissa and Karnataka and Congress-ruled Andhra Pradesh.

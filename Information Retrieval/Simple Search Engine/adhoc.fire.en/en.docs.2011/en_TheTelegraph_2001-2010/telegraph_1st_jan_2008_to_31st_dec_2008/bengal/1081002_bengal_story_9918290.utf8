                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Warning to schools on hitting students
          RABI BANERJEE                              
	Krishnagar, Oct. 1: The Nadia authorities have warned headmasters of about 400 high schools against beating students after injuries caused by corporal punishment were found on at least 30 in a health survey.        
	The students had bruises on their hands and back and they told us they were either caned or slapped by their teachers, said a doctor who was part of the survey.        
	District inspector of schools, secondary, Anil Pramanik said he had received about a dozen complaints from parents against corporal punishment in the past year. All the complaints, but for five, were inquired into and settled amicably following discussions between the teachers and parents, he said.        
	The survey makes it apparent that many cases of thrashing go unreported and the practice is rampant.        
	Corporal punishment is banned in Bengal. The Supreme Court also has an order to this effect. We have asked the schools not to beat up students, Pramanik said.        
	If an injury is grave, a teacher might be suspended and even tried for attempt to murder, a police officer said.         
	No teacher, however, has got the stick in the past two years, which suggests the ban is hardly enforced.        
	Chhottu Mondal, a Class V student, was beaten unconscious by his headmaster in March for allegedly talking during a test.         
	My son was hit with a wooden ruler. The headmaster was showcaused. But he came to our house and apologised and we withdrew the complaint, said Chhottus father Sushil, a farmer.        
	The survey also revealed that students with vision problems were often scolded and punished by teachers for not being able to see what was written on blackboards.         
	Among the 16,000 students covered by the survey, almost 1,000 had vision problems.        
	Teachers should be more sensitive, said a doctor associated with the survey.

     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 14: The CPM and the government today further indicated their acceptance of mistakes made in land acquisition and the complimentary role of the government as well as the corporate sector in rehabilitating landlosers.
    
	Nirupam Sen, the minister for industries as well as development and planning, revealed the new realisation and bid to minimise the social cost of development at a seminar on the problems and prospects of industrialisation in Bengal. It was organised on the sidelines of the party state conference that began today. 
    
	No development and industry is sustainable if landlosers and other affected people in an area are unhappy and feel deprived. We think industrialists would also have to take a significant role together with the government to redress the feeling of deprivation among landlosers to make the growth inclusive, Sen said.
    
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told a rally yesterday that the government would take the responsibility to rehabilitate farmers losing their land to industry or infrastructure projects.
    
	The state party units political-organisational report submitted by secretary Biman Bose today also admitted the need for adequate compensation and proper rehabilitation and alternative livelihood of farmers and other affected people, including agricultural labourers. 
    
	It also stressed the need to take people into confidence to pursue the goal of development. 
    
	Sen, who used to harp on landlosers sacrifice for a greater good earlier, today focused more on the individual loss for farmers. 
    
	We, being in the government, can say only 1 per cent of the total cultivable land is being acquired for industry. But for the landlosing farmer, the loss is 100 per cent. Its natural that he would harbour a feeling of deprivation and dispossession, he said. 
    
	There was no dilution of the drive for industry, though, with Sen urging allies and Left supporters to root the debate on development in Bengal in the global and national economic reality.

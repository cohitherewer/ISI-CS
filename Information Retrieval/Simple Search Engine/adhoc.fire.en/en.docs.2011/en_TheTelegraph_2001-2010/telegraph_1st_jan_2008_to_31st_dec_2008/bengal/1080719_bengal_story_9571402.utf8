                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bangla soldiers fall in gunfight

	July 18: A BSF jawan trying to stop cattle smugglers on the Ganga was fired at by the Bangladesh Rifles, triggering an exchange of fire that left two Bangladeshi soldiers dead early today.        
	The hour-long battle began after Ramkushal Pandey, on a speedboat, spotted a group taking nearly 300 cattle across the river in Murshidabads Sovapur around 1am.        
	As the 30-year-old tried to stop the smugglers swimming with the cattle, BDR personnel on boats near the other side opened fire.        
	They fired indiscriminately. Pandey returned the fire, said Dilbag Singh Sidhu, the deputy inspector-general of the BSF in Behrampore.        
	The BDR personnel were killed when Ramkushal, hit in both legs, fired back from his automatic rifle.        
	BSF officers said other jawans at the outpost along the river joined Ramkushal in the firing.        
	Much of the firing from the Indian side was meant to provide cover to the injured Ramkushal, who swam all the way back. The river is about 500 metres wide at the point, 280km from Calcutta.        
	Bullets were flying all around me when I dived into the river and started swimming back. My colleagues pulled me out of the water as I reached the bank, Ramkushal said from his bed at the Malda District Hospital, around 50km from Sovapur.        
	The BSF fired 19 rounds in half an hour but the BDR allegedly continued to fire even after the guns on the Indian side had fallen silent, DIG Sidhu said. The BDR had fired about 100 rounds till early this morning. Two of our jawans seized 250 cattle, valued around Rs 70 lakh. The smugglers reached Bangladesh with some 50 cattle, Sidhu said.        
	In Dhaka, the dead were identified as Patrol Commander Mohammad Abdul Hannan, 53, and Lance Nayak Krishnapada Das, 45.         
	The Bangladeshi authorities said the two were shot dead inside Bangladesh territory, in Chapainawabganjs Shibganj area.        
	Col M.A. Halim, BDRs director of operations and training, claimed at a news conference that the BSF had opened fire on the BDR patrol.        
	Ramkushal, however, said the BDR had fired from their boat. I had no alternative. When I fired at them.        
	Tension ran high in the area after the shootout, with Murshidabad police asking villagers not to venture towards the riverbank fearing another strike from the other side. It is a precaution, said Mohammad Maskur, the officer in charge of Shamsergunj police station.        
	In the afternoon, BSF and BDR officials held a flag meeting at the Sovapur outpost.         
	We decided to ensure such incidents do not recur. We have agreed that if a soldier on either side crosses the border, the force on the other end will not open fire at the slightest pretext, Sidhu said after the meeting with BDR commander Iqbal Hossain.

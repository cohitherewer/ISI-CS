          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 14: CPM state secretary Biman Bose today skirted questions on whether there would be a discussion on Subhas Chakrabortys inclusion in the state secretariat and the central committee when the newly-elected politburo meets here.         
	I dont know whether it would be discussed, he said.         
	He said the April 29 meeting was being held in Calcutta not just to facilitate Jyoti Basus presence, but also for the benefit of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, industries minister Nirupam Sen, Citu general general secretary Md Amin and himself, keeping in mind the busy schedule for the May panchayat polls.        
	Politburo member Sitaram Yechury, who said Subhass inclusion could be discussed, met Basu in his Salt Late home today. He said: If he (Basu) wants, the Subhas issue can be discussed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha plea for peace in hills
                                                                                                               Buddha plea for peace in hills
  - CM chants democracy mantra, gurung sticks to Gorkhaland cry          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Siliguri, March 2: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today urged CPM leaders in Darjeeling to strive for peace, development and democracy in the hills.        
	Addressing a meeting at the recently inaugurated Anil Biswas Bhavan here, Bhattacharjee reviewed the situation in the Kalimpong, Kurseong and Darjeeling subdivisions, which have been hit by a spate of protests by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha.         
	The Morcha, led by Bimal Gurung, wants Subash Ghisingh removed as caretaker administrator of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) and favours statehood instead of special status.         
	The chief minister, who was here for the state Citu conference, said he was satisfied with the negotiations with the Morcha chief, which had made it possible for normality to return to the hills. In accordance with the talks, the government has asked Ghisingh to resign by March 10.        
	He (Bhattacharjee) has instructed party leaders to work towards permanent peace in the hills. For the moment, the emphasis will not be on Sixth Schedule status but on development and democracy, district Left Front convener Asok Bhattacharya said.         
	He told us that permanent peace can be attained through further discussions with the Morcha leaders.         
	The district CPM leaders said they were grateful for the chief ministers timely initiative.         
	The agitation in the hills has disrupted normal life in the plains as well, one of them said.        
	We told him there were four reasons behind the trouble. First, since no polls have been held in the DGHC for a long time, the peoples mandate is not known. Second, development has come to a standstill as the panchayats lack any power. Third, prices have gone up and fourth, there is a severe water scarcity.        
	Bhattacharjee left for Calcutta today.

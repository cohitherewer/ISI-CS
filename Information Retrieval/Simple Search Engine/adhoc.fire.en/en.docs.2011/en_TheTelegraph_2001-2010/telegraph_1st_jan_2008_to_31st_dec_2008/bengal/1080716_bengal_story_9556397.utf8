	Singur, July 15: A teacher was thrashed today after five Class III girls accused him of molesting them.        
	The father of one of the girls dragged Srikanta Malik to a club, in the Gopalnagar area of Singur, where other guardians and villagers beat him up in front of the headmaster.        
	About 100 villagers had dragged headmaster Uttam Das, too, out of the primary school after asking the three other teachers and students to go home.        
	Police rescued the two and arrested the teacher. Although Malik, 28, was accused of molestation, he was arrested on the charge of making obscene gestures.        
	According to the police, the drawing teacher had asked the five to stay back after school yesterday. He is said to have taken them to a first-floor classroom and molested them. Sir said he would teach us to draw something new. We went to the empty classroom after the school gave over, said one of the girls.        
	When the parents learnt what had happened, they contacted each other this morning. Then I decided to go to the school with a dozen boys from the local club, said Achintya Samanta, 40, who owns a stationery shop.        
	Das was in class when a group of people asked for the drawing teacher. I showed them the staff room and they pulled him out. After about half an hour, the villagers dragged me half a kilometre to the club. They ordered all 60 students and the three teachers out and locked up the main gate, said Das, sitting at Singur police station.         
	Malik, a teacher on contract, had joined the school only last month.

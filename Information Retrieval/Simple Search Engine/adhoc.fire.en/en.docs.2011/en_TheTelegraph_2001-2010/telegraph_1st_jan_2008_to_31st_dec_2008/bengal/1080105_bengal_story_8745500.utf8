The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Presidency autonomy
                                                                                                            Presidency autonomy
                            
	Jhargram, Jan. 4: Higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri today said the partial autonomy granted to Presidency College by the government was the most suitable option for it.         
	Opening a two-day workshop for college principals at Jhargram Raj College, 170km from Calcutta, he added: The college wont be able to excel if it is given absolute autonomy.        
	The workshop is being organised to train college heads in managerial work.         
	The responsibility of principals of government colleges has increased considerably with the introduction of new courses and subjects in emerging areas. They need to increase their management skills also to ensure better fund management, the minister said.

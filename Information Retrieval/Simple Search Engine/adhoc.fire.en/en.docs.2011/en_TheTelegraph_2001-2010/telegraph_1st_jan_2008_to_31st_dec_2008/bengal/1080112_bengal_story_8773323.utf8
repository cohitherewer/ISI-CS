     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 11: A Confederation of Indian Industry delegation today submitted a report on the investment scenario in Bengal to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and told him that a negative perception about the state persists.
    
	The report, titled Sustainable Development in West Bengal, was prepared jointly by the CII and consultant KPMG. 
    
	There is a general feeling that the state is affected by militant trade unionism, though that may not be factually correct. The government will have to work to restore its image, said KPMGs India head Pradip Udhas.
    
	The events in Singur and Nandigram have also dented the image, he said. We have noted with concern that whenever something happens anywhere, the agitation spreads across the state. Added to that is opposition to projects. Big investors deeply study deve- lopments and take a decision. Small ones get scared and go. The government should strengthen its campaign system.

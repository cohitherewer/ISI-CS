The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Talks on, Mamata in backroom
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Talks on, Mamata in backroom
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                          Dinesh Trivedi                                  
	Singur, Sept. 6: Long conversations on her cellphone and strategy sessions in the backroom kept Mamata Banerjee away from the dharna dais throughout this morning.        
	When she made a late appearance around 12.45pm, the Trinamul Congress leader was engrossed in painting, sitting in an area beside the stage. Her subject was Ma, Maati, Manush but unlike yesterday she did not hold forth on her art.        
	On other days, she is generally seen marching from one corner of the stage to the other from morning, organising supporters and railing at the government and the Tatas. But this morning, the Trinamul chief was huddled with senior party leaders in her makeshift office.        
	Around 11am, Mamata began talking animatedly on her mobile, sources said, after which she sat down for hour-long discussions with former party MP Dinesh Trivedi. Mamata then handed Trivedi some papers and told him to leave for Calcutta.        
	A Trinamul leader said Mamata was trying to get the support of national leaders by sending them details of the Tata project and her agitation. He added that Mamata received calls from two former Prime Ministers who wanted to know more about the protest.        
	Mamata is trying to build a national consensus on the Singur issue, another Trinamul source said. She is getting in touch with many leaders of national importance who, she thinks, will sympathise with her cause and her fight for the farmers.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamata stayed away from the manch this morning because she was formulating strategies to counter the arguments offered by the government at the Raj Bhavan talks.        
	She is in constant touch with her team, a Trinamul leader said. They need her guidance during the talks and she has to advise them. That is why she is discussing the situation with some senior party leaders here.         
	Another source said: Although the focus is on the Raj Bhavan talks, we are holding discussions with our party leaders to ensure that the negotiations do not go against our interests.        
	Mamata, the sources said, was tense since todays talks were crucial.        
	On other days, Mamata takes the microphone by noon. Party leaders like Madan Mitra and Maoist activist Dola Sen are seen whispering into her ears. But today she discussed matters only with a few senior leaders.        
	She was confident but reticent. Unlike other days, she kept her distance, never discussing anything with too many party leaders sitting on the manch, a source said.        
	Mamata also took time off to write the details of the negotiations. The sources said her jottings would be published in the party mouthpiece, Jaago Bangla.         
	Press corner        
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi today said he would arrange for a press corner inside Raj Bhavan. When told that journalists had to wait on the road outside for hours in the rain, he said: Your problem will be addressed shortly.

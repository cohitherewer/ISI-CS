The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | State snub to CBIs Rizwanur report
                                                                                                               State snub to CBIs Rizwanur report
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 6: The state government submitted an affidavit to Calcutta High Court today, declining to accept the CBI probe report on Rizwanur Rahmans death and accusing the agency of violating the courts order by registering a murder case.        
	The court had not enabled the CBI to lodge any information under Section 154 (criminal proceedings) of the Criminal Procedure Code, nor (did it give the CBI) the liberty to record a suo motu case of murder for which apparently there is no factual basis at this stage, the affidavit said.        
	The document was signed by Ananda Gopal Ghosh, joint secretary with the home department.         
	The high court had asked the CBI to only establish the cause of Rizwanurs death and did not give permission to the agency to lodge any case. But the CBI had violated the courts order by registering a murder case before starting its probe, the affidavit argued.        
	The government also said the states permission was mandatory to lodge a murder FIR for an offence allegedly committed in Bengal.        
	The Rahmans advocate dismissed the states arguments as baseless. Justice Dipankar Dutta in his order, dated February 28, had clearly mentioned that the petitioners do not have the right to question the legality of the investigation conducted by the CBI or validity of the report at this stage, advocate Kalyan Banerjee said.        
	In a separate affidavit, former police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee said he had been unnecessarily implicated in the case with a vexatious and malafide motive.        
	Mukherjee, who had been shunted out of the top post following allegations that he had a hand in pressuring Rizwanur and Priyanka Todi to part, argued that Rahmans petition does not contain any specific allegation against him.               
	Therefore, my name should be struck off the cause title of the writ petition.        
	On the CBIs interrogation, Mukherjee said: I was examined on November 6, 2007. The CBI officers made notes but they were not shown to me nor read out to me, and my signature was not obtained.

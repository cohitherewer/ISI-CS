          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharjee at the news conference. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Calcutta, May 8: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today described the violence in Nandigram in the run-up to the panchayat elections as small skirmishes.        
	CPM cadres have been accused of unleashing a reign of terror over the past two weeks, rendering hundreds of people homeless.         
	The chief minister described Nandigram and Singur as exceptions while defending his drive for industry. He, however, stressed that the outcome of the panchayat polls should not be seen as a referendum on the drive.         
	The two should not be mixed up, he said. But if you think it is a referendum, let us hope for the best. I believe the people of the state will vote for industrialisation since there is no alternative.         
	The chief minister claimed that things had changed radically in Nandigram since last year, when the campaign against land acquisition had taken root.        
	There is bitterness because of the problem Nandigram faced last year. But things have radically changed.         
	He said only some small skirmishes had taken place. Has there been any death?         
	The chief minister added that rumours were prompting people to flee their homes.         
	Bhattacharjee, addressing a meet-the-press programme at the Calcutta Press Club, said the Opposition, too, was interested in ensuring peace.        
	It is good that the ruling party and the Opposition are trying to settle disputes. All the homeless people have returned home and more central and state forces are being deployed there. I promise you a totally free and fair poll in Nandigram, he added.         
	The chief minister rubbished complaints from Opposition parties and even Left Front partners that the CPM was running a terror campaign in Nandigram and elsewhere, preventing candidates from filing nominations.         
	The election commission found the complaints baseless after checking the facts with the government, he said.         
	Poll agent killed        
	The election agent of a CPM candidate in West Midnapore was killed this morning when a group of eight masked men opened fire on a procession.         
	The CPM alleged that the attack on Manmatha Mahato, 35, in Binpur was the handiwork of Jharkhand Party (Naren) activists.         
	CPM supporters ransacked four houses belonging to Jharkhand Party supporters and set them ablaze.

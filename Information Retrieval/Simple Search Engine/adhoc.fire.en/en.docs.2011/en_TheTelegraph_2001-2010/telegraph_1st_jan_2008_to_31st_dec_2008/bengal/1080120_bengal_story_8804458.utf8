	Four taxis and a bus were involved in a pile-up on Red Road on Saturday afternoon after police flagged down a luxury cab for a pollution check. The driver slammed the brakes immediately, and the taxi  and three others and a bus behind it  screeched to a halt. But not before they had crashed into one another.
    
	The driver of the luxury taxi was injured and taken to SSKM Hospital. He was discharged after a few hours.
         
	The police said the officer had not done anything wrong in stopping the taxi abruptly on a busy road and blamed the driver instead. 
    
	He should have driven properly and stopped the car on the left side of the stretch, an officer said. Pictures by Sanat Kumar Sinha

	Durgapur, Dec. 27: Workers allegedly ransacked a companys premises in Bankura last night protesting its move to cut working days by half because of the global meltdown.         
	Police said around 70 Ferro Alloys workers, owing allegiance to the Citu and the Intuc, broke widowpanes and furniture in a plant building in Borjora last night. Company chairman R.S. Birla, who was inside, was rescued by the police.        
	No one has been arrested. Trinamul trade union Intuc admitted that some of its members had gone on the rampage.         
	The company has cut production by half and said its 500 contract workers would need to report for half the working days each month on a rotation basis. It is not clear if the company said it would cut pay.

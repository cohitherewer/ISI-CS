	Cooch Behar, May 13: Mamata Banerjee almost collapsed while getting off the dais after a 90-minute speech at an election rally in Tufanganj today.         
	She was quickly provided with a chair and her face was splashed with water. After a 10-minute break, she left for Mathabhanga, 80km away.         
	It was so hot that I almost fainted. I am feeling better, the Trinamul chief said.

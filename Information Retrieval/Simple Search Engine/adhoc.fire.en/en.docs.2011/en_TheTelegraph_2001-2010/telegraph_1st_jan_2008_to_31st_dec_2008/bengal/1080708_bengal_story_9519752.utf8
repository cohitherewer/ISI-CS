	Calcutta, July 7: Revenue intelligence officers arrested three men carrying fake notes worth Rs 7.6 lakh when they were about to board a train to Bangalore at Howrah Station last night.     
	The trio, in their mid-20s and Bangalore residents, said they had collected the notes from a middleman in Kaliachak, Malda. Gulam Ghaus, Mohammed Nayeem and Mansoor Alam had been allegedly assigned the task of circulating the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in Karnataka. This is the first time we came across a gang that came all the way from Bangalore to Bengal for fake notes, an officer said.

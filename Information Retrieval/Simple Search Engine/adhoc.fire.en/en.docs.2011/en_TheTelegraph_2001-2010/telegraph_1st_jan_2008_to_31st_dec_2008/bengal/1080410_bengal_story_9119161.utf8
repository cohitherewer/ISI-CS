                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Hill bandh till Friday, many tourists stuck
          OUR BUREAU                          An ex-serviceman being escorted away from Darjeeling More. Telegraph picture                                  
	April 9: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha reacted to reports of the clash in Siliguri the best way hill parties can, calling another bandh that will continue till 6am day after tomorrow.        
	In Darjeeling, posters announcing the shutdown appeared around 2.30pm, giving people a 30-minute window to stock up essentials before the bandh began at 3pm.         
	Morcha supporters in Kalimpong were slower off the mark. Jolted into action by the partys central committee, they went around the town in vehicles fitted with loudspeakers to announce the shutdown after 4pm.        
	Most shops downed shutters almost immediately and vehicles stayed off the road. Residents had to scurry to do some shopping, while tourists either caught the last cars out of the hills, or got ready to spend a couple of days in their hotel rooms.         
	Within half-an-hour, Darjeeling and Kalimpong were deserted.        
	Manoj Sarda from Delhi and his family were among those who had their tour plans in disarray. We wanted to go to Kalimpong this evening. Hopefully, we can leave for Gangtok on Friday, said Manoj.        
	Tapati Yash of Teghoria in Calcutta and her daughter Amrita had confirmed tickets on a Jet Airways flight from Bagdogra tomorrow. We couldnt arrange for a car to take us out of the hills today, said Tapati, sitting in her Darjeeling hotel.        
	National Highway 31A, which connects Gangtok and Kalimpong with the plains, was blocked for nearly two hours in the evening.         
	Some of the schools along the highway suspended classes midway through the afternoon to enable students to return home.         
	In Darjeeling, a government vehicle was damaged in the evening.         
	Indian Idol winner Pra-shant Tamang, coming home for the first time since the television reality show triumph, made it to Darjeeling via Mongpoo at night.        
	We are keeping a close watch on the developments, said Darjeeling additional superintendent of police Jayanta Pal. If the situation permits, we will escort tourists out of Darjeeling and other places tomorrow.         
	The Morcha brought out a procession in Darjeeling this evening to condemn the action against ex-servicemen.

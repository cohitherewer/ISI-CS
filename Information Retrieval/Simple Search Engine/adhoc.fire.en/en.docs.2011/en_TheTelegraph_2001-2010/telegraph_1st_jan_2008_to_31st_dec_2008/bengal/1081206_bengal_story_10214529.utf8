                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Three-day blackout for PMs 25 minutes

	Malda, Dec. 5: The Prime Minister has robbed over 5,000 villagers of power in Malda.        
	To ensure security for the VVIP visitor, the administration has brought down the high-tension cables around the helipad where Manmohan Singh is set to land on Sunday.        
	The result: some 40 villages in the area, which were blacked out this evening, will continue to remain without electricity at least till Monday.        
	The move  on the instructions of the special protection group (SPG)  has angered the villagers, who have seen dignitaries land at Netaji Ground earlier but not such a step.        
	Fearing protests, the district administration deployed 12 policemen, led by two officers, while the cables were being brought down.        
	Why should we suffer for over 72 hours because the Prime Minister will be here for a few minutes? asked Uday Mondal of Daibakipur village.         
	Uday recalled that Congress president Sonia Gandhi had landed on the same helipad in April, in the run-up to the panchayat elections.         
	The divisional engineer of the West Bengal Electricity Distribution Company, Dipak Mondal, said the high-tension lines would be restored on December 8. Till then, 65 transformers will remain deactivated. It will cost the power department over Rs 50,000 to deactivate and restore electricity. Nearly 5,000 people will be affected, Mondal added.        
	Malda district magistrate Sridhar Ghosh pleaded helplessness. Our hands are tied. We have to act according to the instructions of the SPG.         
	The decision to snap the power lines, he said, was taken at a meeting with the visiting SPG team yesterday.         
	Ghosh said Singh would land here around 11am on Sunday and head to the late A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhurys house in Kotwali, half a kilometre away. The Prime Minister will stay there for 25 minutes.         
	As part of its security drive, the SPG has been questioning people who live along the road the Prime Minister is likely to take. They asked us about our families, livelihood, where we had married of our daughters... said a Kotwali resident.

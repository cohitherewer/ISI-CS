          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Dec. 3: Nearly 500 CPM supporters who had fled homes in Nandigram following the May rural polls today abandoned immediate hopes of returning after Trinamul Congress mobs blocked their procession and hurled stones at them.        
	Led by Tamluk MP Lakshman Seth, the CPM had apparently organised the peace march to gauge the mood of the Opposition, which swept the polls, before its supporters could return home.        
	Trinamul activists first placed logs on the road to pre-vent Seth from reaching Sonachura for the march. From Sonachura, when Seth started on foot with some 3,000 people for Garchakraberia, 5km from Nandigram town, Trinamul supporters started hurling abuses and brickbats. Two CPM men had to be hospitalised.         
	Policemen chased the mobs away.        
	East Midnapore superintendent Ashok Prasad said the road was blocked at two places but there were no clashes.         
	Trinamul wants to keep the Nandigram fire burning till the December 27 bylection. How can we ask our men to return home? asked Seth.        
	Among the homeless are Naba Samanta, Anup Mondal, Tarak Mondal and Prabhati Pramanick, who won the panchayat polls in May but could not even take oath. The entire area is surrounded by Trinamul activists and we cant risk returning home, said Anup, who stays in a party office about 10km from home.        
	Trinamul leader Abu Taher accused the CPM of trying to create trouble. They were trying to bring in armed goons to Nandigram for the bypoll.

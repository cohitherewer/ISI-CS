	Calcutta/New Delhi, April 9: Subhas Chakraborty today likened Jyoti Basu to God and said Basus backing for his berths in the CPM central committee and state secretariat was the greatest gift he had ever got.        
	The CPM patriarch had yesterday said that Chakraborty should be inducted both into the committee and the secretariat. Asked for a reaction, Chakraborty said: If the concept of God exists, I would consider Jyotibabu to be my God. When he talked about my inclusion in the two committeesI got the greatest gift of my life.        
	In Delhi, politburo member Sitaram Yechury said: Jyoti Basu is a central committee member and he is also there in the politburo. He can raise the issue at the central committee meeting.        
	Clash death        
	A Congress supporter was killed during a clash with CPM supporters in Birbhums Mohammadbazar tonight.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Football field ache for IISCO
          ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE                               
	Durgapur, Oct. 31: A football field has now come in the way of IISCOs expansion plan in Burnpur after a land compensation case held up work for nearly two years.         
	On October 26, 226 villagers took their cheques after IISCO agreed to their demand for more money, heeding a Burdwan court order. But trouble started two days later when the villagers of Purushottampur  the mouza that had resisted the acquisition  objected to IISCO erecting a wall, saying the land was a field where boys played football.         
	Chandrasekhar Roy, secretary of the Purushottampur land losers committee, said: Now we demand that the plot be handed over to us to be used as a football field. Our children used to play on that land. That particular plot will not come in the way of the plants expansion.         
	The committee also wants jobs for a member of each landlosers family in IISCO.         
	Roy admitted that the villagers had stopped work at the site. We have already petitioned the administration and the steel plant authorities. We have asked them to stop work. The matter can be sorted out through talks, he added.        
	The plant authorities spoke to police and the district administration today as village boys playing on the plot quarrelled with contract labourers erecting the wall. The labourers ultimately left and the boys resumed their game.         
	Mihir Kumar Routh, the plants general manager, (personnel and administration), said IISCO was fed up with the villagers. They want nearly an acre, which is not possible. We paid Rs 40 crore to the government for the 305 acres. We again paid Rs 1.62 crore to some villagers. Now, they have come up with a new demand. We are fed up.

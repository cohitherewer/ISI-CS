	Chinsurah, Oct. 16: An ambulance carrying an ailing infant and his family hit a tanker parked on Durgapur Expressway early this morning, killing his father and two others but the baby had a miraculous escape.        
	One-and-a-half-month-old Saifuddin Islam suffered minor burns after the tanker toppled over and spilled some of the hydrochloric acid it was carrying.        
	The accident took place at Dadpur in Hooghly district, 50km from Calcutta.         
	The dead were identified as Khairul Islam, 32, Saifuddins father, Mohammad Aziz, 25, the driver of the ambulance, and Uttam Das, 45, a pharmacist.        
	Saifuddins mother Pinki Begum, 22, grandmother Lali Begum, 45, and grandfather, Shanawaz Haque, 50, were injured. Like the little boy, they, too, suffered acid burns.         
	None of them was critically injured, said Tarashankar Sahu, superintendent of the Imambara Sadar Hospital in Chinsurah.         
	The police suspect the driver of the ambulance had fallen asleep. That is why he couldnt see the tanker, said Debarshi Sinha, the officer in charge of Dadpur police station.        
	Saifuddin was diagnosed with meningitis yesterday, after which his father, an affluent farmer from a Birbhum village, hired the ambulance to take him to Calcutta.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 25: Three men who were to be hanged for murder were acquitted by Calcutta High Court today as the judges felt the victims body had not been properly identified.         
	It seems the investigation had failed to make proper identification of the body of the murdered person. Moreover, there was no witness to the murder, the division bench of Justices G.C. Gupta and K.K. Prasad said.        
	Sudhir Mahato, Birbal Mahato and Prabir Mahato, who have been in Midnapore jail since September 2005, will be released in couple of days.        
	Birbal, a wealthy trader of Lalgarh in West Midnapore, around 190km from Calcutta, suspected that his driver Tarapada Mahato was having an affair with his wife Kalpana.        
	On September 9, 2005, Tarapada went missing and his father Ajit Kumar Mahato lodged an FIR accusing Birbal and his friends Sudhir and Prabir of abducting his son.        
	On September 17, 2005, a beheaded body was found floating on the Kangshabati.         
	Tarapadas brother Nabakumar identified the body from the undergarments and a talisman on the right arm and police started a murder case against the trio.         
	Sudhir was held about a fortnight later. Within a week of Sudhirs arrest, Birbal and Prabir, who were absconding, surrendered to the police.        
	After an 11-month trial, Jhargram additional sessions judge (fast-track court) Biswanath De found all three accused guilty of abduction and murder and sentenced them to death by hanging. The trio moved the high court.         
	The division bench set aside the trial court order. Witnesses have mentioned various colours of the undergarments and the thread with which the talisman was tied to the arm. The body was not properly identified, the judges said.

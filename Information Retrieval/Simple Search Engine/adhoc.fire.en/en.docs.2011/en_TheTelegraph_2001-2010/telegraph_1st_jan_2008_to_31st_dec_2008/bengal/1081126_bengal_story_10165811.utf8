	Midnapore, Nov. 25: West Midnapore police today said the boycott of the force in Lalgarh would not have any immediate impact as there was an ample stock of ration.        
	Superintendent Rajesh Kumar Singh said he still hoped that the villagers would not resort to non-cooperation with the police. However, even if they do, there wouldnt be any immediate problem as there is enough ration at Lalgarh and Ramgarh.         
	An officer posted in Ramgarh had yesterday expressed fears that the tribals protesting alleged police atrocities could starve them by cutting off supplies.        
	A meeting of tribal leaders on Thursday will decide whether to enforce the boycott.

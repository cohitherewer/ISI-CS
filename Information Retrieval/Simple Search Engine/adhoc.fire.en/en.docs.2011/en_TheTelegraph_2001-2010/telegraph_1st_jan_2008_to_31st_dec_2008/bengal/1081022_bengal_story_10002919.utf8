          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Oct. 21: The East Midnapore district magistrate has called a meeting next week with farmers of Geonkhali who are unwilling to give up land for a shipyard, but no invite has gone to the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee.        
	Those invited to the October 27 talks would be represented by an NGO, Deulpota Seva Samity, which had written to governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi on September 9 saying the farmers didnt want to part with their plots.        
	About 50km from Nandigram, the Apeejay group and Bharati Shipyard propose to build the Rs 2,000-crore project on 500 acres. Owners of 250 acres have given consent to the acquisition, but owners of 55 acres have objected to it. Others have neither said yes or no.         
	District magistrate C.D. Lama said the Samity was called because it had approached the governor.         
	The Pratirodh Committee was miffed, though it said the Samity members were its members, too. Though we did not approach the governor, we submitted memorandums to the DM. But the administration never called us, said member Goutam Das.

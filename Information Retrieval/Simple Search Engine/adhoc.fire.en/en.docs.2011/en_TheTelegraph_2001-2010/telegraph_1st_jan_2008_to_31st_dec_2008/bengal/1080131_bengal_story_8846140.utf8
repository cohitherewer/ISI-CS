	Jakarta, Jan. 30 (Reuters): Bird flu in Bengal is coming under control, but authorities need to break the chain of transmission of the H5N1 virus, the UN influenza co-ordinator said today.
    
	I would say that it is coming under control, said David Nabarro. The final test of whether its under control would be whether or not the authorities are able to really dampen down the new outbreaks of H5N1.
    
	In Bangladesh, the disease has spread to 29 of its 64 districts since last March despite mass culling of poultry.
    
	Nabarro said: The key dilemma that the governments face is wanting to get the virus under control on the one hand and trying not to increase poverty among already poor rural communities on the other.

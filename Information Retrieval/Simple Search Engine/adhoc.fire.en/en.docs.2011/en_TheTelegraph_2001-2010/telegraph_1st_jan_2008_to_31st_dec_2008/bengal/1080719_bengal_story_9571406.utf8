The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Subhas wants say in CAB
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Subhas wants say in CAB
                            
	Calcutta, July 18: Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty today iterated in the Assembly what he had said last year: the need for a law to regulate all sports associations and settle their disputes.        
	There is a need to get the law passed to monitor the activities of sports associations and also for the settlement of disputes in the organisations. Let us see how soon we can introduce a bill, the minister said after tabling the sports and youth welfare budget.        
	Chakraborty had once expressed his desire to contest the Cricket Association of Bengal presidents post and has been a critic of its head, Prasun Mukherjee. CPM insiders said the desire to interfere in the CABs functioning had prompted him to speak about the law.        
	A sports department official said: Many associations do not conduct training in disciplines they are expected to. Now there is nothing to prevent a kabaddi association from giving football classes.        
	Trinamul-Cong deal        
	The Trinamul Congress today joined hands with the Congress to form the Midnapore municipality board.         
	Under an agreement, Trinamuls Pranab Basu was appointed chairman for five years. A Congress candidate will be the vice-chairman.

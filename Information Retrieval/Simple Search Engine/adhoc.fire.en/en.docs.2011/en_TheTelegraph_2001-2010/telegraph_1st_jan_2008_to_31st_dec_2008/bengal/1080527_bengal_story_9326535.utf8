                              An Indian bison                            
	Alipurduar, May 26: A gaur from the Diana forest died today while being chased out of the Chengmari Tea Estate by a group of workers.         
	Foresters said the heart, which is weak in the ferocious-looking animal, probably gave away.        
	This morning, two gaurs entered the garden in Nagrakata, Jalpaiguri, from the adjacent forest. When they were spotted near the labour lines, the residents tried to drive them away.        
	Suddenly, one of the gaurs slumped to the ground and died, said Tapas Das, the divisional forest officer who went to the garden.         
	We will conduct a post-mortem but, usually, the gaur has a weak heart. When the workers chased the animal, it ran around aimlessly. That could have caused its death.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Aug. 6: The CPM today launched a campaign to convince farmers in Katwa to give up their land where the government wants to set up a 1,320MW power plant.        
	The party is trying to tell the villagers that if the 1,033 acres are not acquired, the state will face a severe power crisis in five years. The government has offered about Rs 10 lakh for each acre.        
	CPM workers in Katwa, Burdwan, today held a rally in Koshigram, one of the 14 mouzas to be acquired.        
	The Congress and Trinamul Congress have already formed a forum  the Krishi Jomi Khet Majur Banchao Committee  to counter the land-acquisition drive.         
	The CPM will hold more rallies and go door to door as well as hold street-corner meetings.         
	Two hearings have been held for the acquisition of 350 acres in the first phase. Of the 403 farmers whose land the government wants, 205 have voiced objections. The administration postponed the third hearing, slated for August 4, after the refusals.         
	We are yet to finalise a date for the third hearing as most of the farmers refused to give their plots, said Asim Bhattacharya, additional district magistrate (land acquisition), Burdwan.        
	As of now the power plant plan stands. If we face problems, the project will be delayed, said S. Mahapatra, managing director of WBPDCL, which will build the plant.

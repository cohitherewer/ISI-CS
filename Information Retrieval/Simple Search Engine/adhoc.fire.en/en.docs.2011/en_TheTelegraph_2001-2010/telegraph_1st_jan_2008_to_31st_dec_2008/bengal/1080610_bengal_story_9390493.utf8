	Tamluk, June 9: The officer in charge of Nandigram police station, Debashish Chakraborty, and six CPM activists were today issued with summons to be present in Contai court in East Midnapore on July 30.        
	The court today passed the order after hearing the petition of Rekha Maity, a 50-year-old resident of Khejuri, who alleged that Chakraborty had assaulted her 84-year-old mother-in-law Billwabasini and molested her sister-in-law Kalyani, 21, and her own daughter Mausami, 18.        
	The OC had raided her home at Sherkhanchowk, about 175km from Calcutta, looking for her husband Satya Maity, 50, on the night of December 24, last year. Satya was wanted in connection with a murder.        
	Rekhas lawyer said she had filed a complaint with Khejuri police. Unable to get any justice, she move court, he said.        
	Earlier, a CRPF woman constable had alleged that Chakraborty had assaulted her during the panchayat polls.

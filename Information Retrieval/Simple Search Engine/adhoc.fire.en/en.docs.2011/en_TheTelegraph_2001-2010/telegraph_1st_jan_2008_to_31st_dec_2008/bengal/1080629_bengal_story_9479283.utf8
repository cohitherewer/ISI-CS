  - DECEPTION GAMES, FROM AIRPORT TO AGENCIES
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta, June 28: A Chennai resident desperate to reach Britain was arrested early today as he was about to take a Calcutta-Bangkok-Turkey detour to his final destination.        
	Senthil Kumar Chennikrishnan, 33, reached the immigration counter for the 2am Thai Airways flight where he told officer Anup Brahmachari that he would get his Thai visa in Bangkok. Thailand has a visa-on-arrival policy for tourists. But flipping through the passport pages, the official found Chennikrishnan had a visa for Turkey.        
	Asked about the discrepancy, Chennikrishnan denied he was headed to Turkey and claimed he was the proprietor of a company, Butterfly Home Appliances.        
	He produced a business card and a current account statement of a private bank showing a balance of Rs 74 crore. He claimed he was going to Bangkok in connection with his business, said Basab Talukdar, the regional registration officer in Calcutta for foreigners.         
	Not convinced, Talukdar asked Chennikrishnan to open his cabin baggage, which threw up papers about a booking in an Istanbul hotel from June 28 to July 10. Chennikrishnan confessed during interrogation that the bank papers and the card were forged. He said he was unemployed but had sold land to pay Rs 3 lakh to a Chennai agent, Kannan, to go to the UK.         
	The UK authorities had stamped his passport saying he was denied a visa, said Talukdar, who spotted some gum to erase the stamp.         
	Apparently, Chennikrishnan had been told it would be easier to reach the UK from Turkey, where an associate of the agent would have met him.         
	Chennikrishnan had also been advised to fly out from Calcutta since he had a chance to exploit the language barrier with the immigration here.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Calamity too piles pressure

	Sept. 1: Floods have forced over 1 lakh people out of their homes in Malda, three days after the governor cited such natural calamities in his appeal to Mamata Banerjee to suspend the Singur siege.        
	A 10-year-old drowned today trying to escape the waters of the Phulahar, fed by the rampaging Kosi in adjoining Bihar.         
	On Friday, governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi had prefaced his letter to Mamata with the calamity in Bihar and the threat of floods in Bengal. Our neighbouring state of Bihar is reeling under one of the worst natural disasters in recent memory. The probability of our own stretches of the Ganga becoming vulnerable to flooding are not to be ruled out. At such a time of challenge, political contestations in our state must take pause.        
	In Malda, the warnings appeared to be coming true, as water in the Phulahar rose to alarming levels. The level has not risen above 28 metres in the past decade, but today it was 28.8 metres, irrigation department executive engineer Soumen Mishra said.         
	Ratua I block development officer Lakshman Haldar said the problem arose in Bihar, where the Kosi swelled again today and the Phulahar was in spate.         
	In Calcutta, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said Rs 1.5 crore had been released to fight the floods in Malda and Rs 1 crore for neighbouring Murshidabad.        
	The Congress gram panchayat pradhan of Mahanandatola, Latika Mondal, said the floods had affected more than 40,000 people in her area and inundated 24 villages. District magistrate Chittaranjan Das said relief had been sent this morning.

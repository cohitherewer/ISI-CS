	Calcutta, Nov. 14: The government today agreed to send a panel of names to governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi for appointment of his press secretary.        
	Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said: As far as the appointment of the press secretary at Raj Bhavan is concerned, it is for the governor to decide. There cannot be any question of controversy or debate when the issue concerns the governor. He had asked for a panel of names... accordingly, we will send it. Whoever the governor wants will be his press secretary.        
	The government had earlier transferred the press secretary, Dhruba Basu, replacing him with another nominee.

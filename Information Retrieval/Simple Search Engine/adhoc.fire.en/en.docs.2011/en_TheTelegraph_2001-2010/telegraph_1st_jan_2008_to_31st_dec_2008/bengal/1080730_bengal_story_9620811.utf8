	Calcutta, July 29: NRI businessman Prasoon Mukherjee will buy land directly from the people for his 10,000MW power plant in Bengal but go elsewhere if the acquisition fails.        
	I dont want the government to acquire the land for me, he said after talks with power minister Mrinal Banerjee at Writers Buildings.        
	Universal Success Enterprise, the company he has floated for power projects in India, will carry out the acquisition.         
	Asked if he would shift the Rs 50,000-crore project out of Bengal if he couldnt buy the land, Mukherjee said: I want to build the plant with peoples consent... (but) the plant cannot be built in the air.        
	He said he would ship in his own coal for the plant, build a port and use saline water. If, in spite of my good intentions, the venture falls apart... we would have to take the project elsewhere. It would be unfortunate for Bengal.        
	The project, he added, would help the state by way of taxes, jobs and power.

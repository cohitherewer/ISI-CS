                                                                                                            Party, babus in firing line
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Tehatta (Nadia), Jan. 20: Well-to-do leaders yesterday, hapless villagers today.        
	About a dozen of them, who have lost all their chickens to suspected bird flu, alleged that officials and senior leaders who did not pay heed to complaints of bird deaths earlier.        
	Seven days ago, we complained about large-scale deaths in our homes. But the local panchayat and the administration did nothing. Some officials even told us chicken deaths were normal, said Abdul Mannan Mondal, the CPM branch committee member of Kanainagar.        
	Eleven CPM leaders  in Balarampur, Srirampur and Kanainagar  have lost all their chickens. Staring at an empty cage in his courtyard, Mondal said: The government will give money for every chicken culled. I wont get a paisa, though Ive lost all my chickens.        
	Mehboob Islam, the branch committee member of adjoining Ghatpara, lost 35 chickens.         
	I, my wife and three children used to live off the chickens. Expenses for my childrens studies also came from them, said Islam, on the way to a paddy field in faraway Karimpur, where he has begun working as a labourer.         
	Kazi Biswas of the Palpara branch committee was unhappy with the decision to distribute chicks three months after the culling.        
	Mondal said they had informed senior party leaders about the impending crisis. We want our party to come to our rescue at least now.        
	District committee member and farmer leader Nayan Sarkar promised to discuss the issue.         
	The administration denied any delay.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Tie-up blow to Trinamul
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 30: The Congress today ruled out an alliance with the Trinamul Congress for next months civic polls in Behrampore and Krishnagar, dealing a blow to the ongoing talks for a pact in Howrah and Jhargram.         
	The Congress said it could not offer any seats to Trinamul in Krishnagar and Behrampore because Mamata Banerjees party had hardly any presence in the two civic bodies.        
	Trinamul slammed the Congresss double standard.        
	The Congress is desperate to forge an electoral alliance with us in Howrah and Jhargram, where we are a force to reckon with, but is showing us the door in Behrampore and Krishnagar because of our weak presence there. We condemn this dichotomy in the Congresss stand, Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said.         
	Going a step further, a Trinamul leader said the Congresss narrow politics would jeopardise the prospects of a seat adjustment in Howrah and Jhargram. How can they politically justify forging an alliance with us only where they need our help to sail through? he asked.        
	The municipal polls are scheduled for November 30.         
	The Congress has all the 23 seats on the Behrampore civic board and 22 seats.         
	In the 24-member Krishnagar municipality. The other two belong to the Socialist Party and an Independent candidate.         
	Congress leaders from Howrah and Jhargram will meet their Trinamul counterparts tomorrow to work out seat adjustments after clearing some minor hitches.

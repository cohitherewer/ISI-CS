          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	Calcutta, Oct. 25: A wet, not crackling, Diwali is the Met office forecast with a warning of heavy rain in Calcutta and the districts in the next 48 hours.        
	G.C. Debnath, the director of the weather section in the Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, said: The depression now lies about 700km south-west of Calcutta. Under its influence, heavy rain is expected in coastal districts and some parts of Calcutta. The depression is likely to intensify further and Kali Puja may be affected.         
	Met officials said the inclement weather had led to a day temperature drop and a sense of chilliness.         
	Yesterday, the maxi- mum temperature was pegged at 29.3C. Today, it dropped to 26.5C, which is four degrees below normal, a Met official said.        
	The sea has also turned rough, the weather office added.        
	Gusty winds with a speed between 45kmph and 55 kmph are expected to lash the coast and fishermen have been advised not to venture into the high seas, the official said.        
	The depression, the Met office said, has shown signs of moving northward. However, it is yet to be seen if it travels towards Bengal or moves towards Orissa or Bangladesh at the last moment, the official added.        
	October-December is the cyclone season and low pressures and depression often develop in the Bay of Bengal at this time.         
	Today, the city woke up to cloudy skies. By 1pm, a drizzle had started, but heavy rain was not reported from anyw- here in the city or the dist-ricts.         
	This is because the depression is still far away from the coast, the Met official said.

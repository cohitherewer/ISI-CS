     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Behrampore, Jan. 21: A mother who had three miscarriages and lost three babies was so obsessed with her nine-year-old sons education that she committed suicide after he refused to leave bed at 4am and sit down to study.
    
	Like every morning, Sikha Dutta tried to shake Arunava out of sleep at four today. It was cold in Behrampore town and the boy did not want to get up. He was forced to. 
    
	Sikha asked Arunava to pull out his books, but he was groggy and refused to do so.
    
	Her husband Rabindranath, a schoolteacher, said: She started scolding Arunava and I woke up. I told her not to scold him and took him back to bed. 
    
	Sikha said Arunavas final exams were drawing near and he needed to study hard. She told me she wont be able to show her face to anyone if he did badly. I didnt realise the possible consequence of her outburst this morning, Rabindranath said.
    
	As the father and son went to sleep, Sikha, 42, bolted herself in a room in the attic and set herself on fire. 
    
	Arunava, who studies in Class III of a local English- medium school, would sit for his annual exam in February.
    
	He studied for most part of the day he spent at home. Sikha, a nurse at the Behrampore New General Hospital, had kept three private tutors for him.
    
	Sikhas mother Anupama said she had three miscarriages and lost three children while they were infants. When Arunava was born, she became obsessed with him. As he grew up, she became obsessed with his studies. My daughter always wanted her son would be the first boy of his class, said Anupama.
    
	Rabindranath had always tried to shield his son from the excessive pressure. He tried to convince Sikha that the pressure may not be good for the boy, said Anupama.
    
	Neighbours saw smoke coming out of the Duttas house and called the fire brigade. But they broke open the door before the firemen arrived and found Sikha burnt and dead.

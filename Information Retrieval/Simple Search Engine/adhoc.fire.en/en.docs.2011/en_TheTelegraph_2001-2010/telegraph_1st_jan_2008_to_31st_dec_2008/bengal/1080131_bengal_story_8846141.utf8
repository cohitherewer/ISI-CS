     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 30: The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) will stay in Nandigram until the panchayat elections, the government said today.
    
	No decision has been taken to remove the CRPF jawans from Nandigram. They will stay there till the panchayat elections, home secretary Prasad Ranjan Ray said at Writers Buildings.
    
	The polls are due in May.
    
	Ray said Nandigram has been peaceful of late but added that the government would keep a close watch on the area over the next few months. The CRPF could also be asked to stay back after the polls. We are waiting for things to get better in Nandigram, so we want the CRPF to stay. Normality is returning gradually. If needed, we will change our decision to keep the CRPF till the panchayat polls.
    
	In Nandigram, both the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee and the CPM welcomed the decision. 
    
	It is only because of the CRPF that we are living in peace. Motorcycle-borne CPM cadres had attacked our house and we had to take shelter in Nandigram High School as refugees. We returned home after the CRPF arrived, said Narmada Sith, 60, of Sonachura.
    
	Lakshman Mondal, the CPM chief of the Sonachura village panchayat, was forced to flee home after trouble started in Nadigram in January last year. Sonachura had been a Pratirodh Committee stronghold till early November.
    
	We believe that the people of Nandigram will benefit if the CRPF stays on for some time, said Lakshman.
    
	After the CRPF was deployed on November 12, CPM leaders had accused it of being partial towards the Opposition. 
    
	The CRPF is much more restrained now and is working along with police. We have no complaints against the force, said East Midnapore district secretariat member Ashok Guria.
    
	Asked about the pending criminal cases, the home secretary said the government would concentrate on those on rape, murder and arson. Well ask both parties (the committee and the CPM) to sort out the petty cases among themselves after normality is restored completely, Ray said.
    
	Mamata poll plan
    
	Mamata Banerjee today said her party would neither be with the Congress nor the BJP in the panchayat polls. 
    
	She told a rally at Belda, West Midnapore, 170km from Calcutta, the Trinamul Congress would only have seat adjustments with 18 minor parties in her fledgling Progressive Democratic Secular Front.

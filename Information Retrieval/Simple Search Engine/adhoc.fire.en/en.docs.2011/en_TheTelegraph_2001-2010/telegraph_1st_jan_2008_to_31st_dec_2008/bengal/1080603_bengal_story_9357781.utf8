	June 2: In his first public meeting since the panchayat polls, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee did not once mention the partys setback.        
	However, at the opening of a college in Amdanga, North 24-Parganas, where the Trinamul Congress has wrested the panchayat samiti, the chief minister addressed one of the perceived reasons for the CPMs defeat: the minority communitys unhappiness with lack of development.        
	We need to modernise the madarsa education system, Bhattacharjee said with Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim and minority affairs minister Abdus Sattar by his side.        
	Halim was elected to the Assembly from Amdanga in 2001. Sattar won the seat five years later.         
	Education is the backbone of a country and, realising this, we have upgraded our educational institutions, including madarsas, he added.        
	There was no mention of the rural polls even at the opening of a diagnostic centre in Barasat, 10km from Amdanga, where Bhattacharjee was joined by CPM state secretary Biman Bose.         
	We want private participation to improve healthcare in the state, Bhattacharjee said.        
	Mamata Banerjee today iterated that she would main- tain equi-distance from the BJP and the Congress in the run-up to the elections to 13 municipalities on June 29.         
	There will be no tie-up with other parties, she said while reacting to Congress MLA Somen Mitras appeal at a rally yesterday that the Trinamul chief lead a secular democratic front, including the Congress, in the Lok Sabha elections due next year.         
	Somenda had expressed his opinion. But the fact remains that the Congress, which is running its government at the Centre with the CPMs support, cannot fight the communists in Bengal, she added.

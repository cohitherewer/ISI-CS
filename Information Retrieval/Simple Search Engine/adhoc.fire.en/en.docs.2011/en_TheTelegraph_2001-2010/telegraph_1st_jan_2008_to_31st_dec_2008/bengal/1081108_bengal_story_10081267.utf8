The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Stones rain on school minister
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Stones rain on school minister
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Nov. 7: About 200 students of primary teachers training institutes today blocked school education minister Partha Des car in Bishnupur and hurled stones at it protesting the states inaction in legalising the centres.         
	De, an MLA from Bankura district, about 180km from Calcutta, sat grim-faced in his Ambassador as the agitators shouted slogans, thumping the bonnet and showing him slippers. Some lay in front of the car while the outnumbered policemen in the pilot car stood and watched.         
	De was in Bishnupur for a conference of the Bengal Library Association when he was gheraoed around 3.30pm. The attackers fled after 10 minutes when CPM workers came running out of the venue and escorted the car to the conference.         
	De suffered an injury to his right foot when a shard of glass from the cracked wind screen fell on him.         
	Shakti Ranjan Basu, Bankura primary school council chairman and working president of the reception committee at the conference, said the police had been warned that the minister may be heckled. It is a security lapse, he said,         
	But a police official said: The inspector-in-charge of Bishnupur police station was present. Policemen were deployed but the protesters could not be identified as they were not carrying flags.         
	In September, Calcutta High Court declared the 130-odd primary teachers training institutes illegal. The Centre promised to find a way out after De met HRD minister Arjun Singh last month.        
	De today said he was pained to see how future primary teachers behaved. Demands cant realised by strong-arm tactics like throwing stones and waving shoes at a minister. We are trying to solve the problem. I have asked the police to take appropriate steps against the troublemakers.

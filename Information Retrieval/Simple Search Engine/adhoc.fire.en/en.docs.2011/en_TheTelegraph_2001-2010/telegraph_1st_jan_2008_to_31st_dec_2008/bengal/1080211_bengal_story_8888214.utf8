	Calcutta, Feb. 10: Four men barged into a Baishakhi Abasan flat in Salt Lakes AG Block this evening and allegedly left with money and jewellery worth Rs 2 lakh.     
	They had split into two groups. Four entered my apartment and six stood guard outside, said Pronab Dey of flat No. C13/1. The goons sprinkled chilly powder to overpower the Deys when one of them responded to the bell and opened the door.         
	Krishnagar: About 1,500 chickens have died over the past two days in a farm in Ranaghat, about 65km from Calcutta. The poultry owner had dumped the dead chickens and 1,500 live birds in a septic tank. Samples from the dead birds have been sent for tests.         
	Tamluk: The CPM has lost two more Nandigram schools. All 12 seats in the governing bodies of Maheshpur and Kanchannagar high schools went to the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee on Sunday. The party has lost four schools since the November recapture of Nandigram. In Calcutta, Benoy Konar called for introspection to figure out the cause of the defeats.        
	Durgapur: A mother allegedly hanged herself in the toilet of Durgapur Steel Plant Hospital. Suman Shaw, 22, had been staying there with her 18-month-old daughter, suffering from pneu-monia, since February 1. They were to be released on Friday but her husband urged doctors to keep the baby under supervision for a few more days.

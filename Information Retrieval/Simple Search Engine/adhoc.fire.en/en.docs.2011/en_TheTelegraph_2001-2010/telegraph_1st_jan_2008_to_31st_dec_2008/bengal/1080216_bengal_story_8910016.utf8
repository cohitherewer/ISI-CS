The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Aftabs cry for torture balm
                                                                                                               Aftabs cry for torture balm
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: For ordinary people like Aftab Alam Ansari, a name can make a big difference.         
	With a different name, he wouldnt have had to live through 22 days of police torture to prove that he had never been to Bangladesh, received terror training or supplied RDX. Around the time Uttar Pradesh police thought the 27-year-old Calcuttan was preparing for a blast, he was busy trying to support his widowed mother and unmarried sisters with his modest job at CESC.         
	At a news conference in Delhi today, he tried to make a case for some compensation.        
	Uttar Pradesh police picked him up from Cossipore in Calcutta on December 27 and took him to Lucknow. He was released after they realised he was not the one they were looking for.        
	I was picked up only because I was a Muslim, Ansari said. Thats what seems to be happening all around, he said with a stoic acceptance of what had happened.         
	Everyone knows that you cant fight the police. They can do whatever they want. I dont want to go against them, he said when asked if he wanted action against the officers who tortured him and then brushed him off.         
	For days, he was asked if his name was Mukhtar alias Raju of the Bangladesh-based terror outfit Huji and shown blast tapes. He was stripped of his mobile, belt, Rs 500 and photograph. He got back the money and the mobile, not the belt or the photograph.         
	Back from jail, he shuns company for fear of fresh trouble. It has also broken me financially, he said.        
	Mother Ayesha Begum had told the Bengal chief minister her family was being ostracised for her sons arrest and she was finding it difficult to marry off her daughters. She said she had to borrow money to get him released.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said: Ill see to it that he gets back whatever he lost.         
	The government has sanctioned Rs 30,000.        
	Ansari broke down while recounting what his mother went through when he was thrown into Lucknow Central Jail. She sat on the road after the shops outside the jail closed.

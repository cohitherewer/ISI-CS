          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Nov. 22: A private bus knocked down a 27-year-old teacher, allegedly busy on her cellphone, and ran over her arm at the Rajabazar intersection this afternoon.         
	Police said Sushmita Das, who teaches at Brahmo Girls School, was speaking on her phone while crossing APC Road at 1.50pm.         
	Witnesses said the Kasba resident seemed in a tearing hurry and did not notice the bus (route 34C) speeding down the road. The driver saw her and screeched to a halt, but the front wheels went over her left arm.         
	Todays was the third accident in three days apparently caused by pedestrians carelessness.         
	Yesterday, a truck crushed a 13-year-old cycling down a road with an I-Pod in his ear. On Thursday, 20-year-old Kakoli Mondal was hit by a train while she was chatting on her cellphone.

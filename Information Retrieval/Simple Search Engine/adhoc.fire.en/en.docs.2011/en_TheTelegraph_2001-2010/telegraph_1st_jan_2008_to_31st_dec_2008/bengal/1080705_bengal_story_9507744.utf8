	Malda, July 4: The district administration has shut down the orphanage where a 13-year-old died yesterday after allegedly coming in contact with an exposed live wire.         
	Rajib Sorens death had prompted other boarders to attack officials on a visit and torch government vehicles.         
	A dozen boys have been arrested and the rest shifted to the Bharat Sevashram Sangha hostel.        
	Seven of those held have been sent to a juvenile home in Cooch Behar. The chief judicial magistrate has asked police to keep the other five in a safe house till Monday, by when their age has to be verified.        
	There was confusion in the court today when the police said they were above 18 and the boys claimed otherwise.        
	Malda district magistrate Chittaranjan Das said the home would remain shut until it was totally safe. He has ordered an inquiry into the death.         
	We are also shocked at the way the subdivisional officer and officials from the mass education department were attacked. We suspect someone, or some group, had provoked the boys, he added.        
	The mass education department finances the hostel.         
	Subdivisional officer Arunima Dey, the chairman of the committee that runs the hostel, said: The department pays Rs 660 for each boy every month, but the amount is meagre. So we run the facility with help from the government and private sources. She added that Rs 8.34 lakh had been sanctioned for renovation and work was about to begin.        
	Mass education department officials said hostel superintendent Sukumar De, who had been accused of misappropriating funds and was about to be replaced, could have had a hand in the violence.        
	De accused the officials of, among other things, asking the boys why they ate more.

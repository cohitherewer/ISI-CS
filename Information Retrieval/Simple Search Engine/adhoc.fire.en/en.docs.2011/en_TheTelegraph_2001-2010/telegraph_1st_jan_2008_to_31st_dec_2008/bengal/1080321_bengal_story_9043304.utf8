	Midnapore, March 20: Ballistic experts today said foreign firearms and the Indian Armys bullets had been used in the 2001 Chhoto Angaria massacre.         
	Eleven Trinamul Congress supporters are believed to have been killed in the West Midnapore village in January that year.         
	Deposing before a judicial magistrate in Midnapore, senior forensic scientist Ardhendu Sengupta said police had seized a semi-automatic rifle made in the US from Sheikh Bhola, an accused in the Chhoto Angaria case.        
	Quite a few of the spent cartridges found in the house of Baktar Mondal in Chhoto Angaria had been fired from the semi-automatic rifle. There were also many bullets used by the Indian Army, Sengupta said.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 24: Representatives of the Nano Bachao Committee today called on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and asked him to write to Ratan Tata to consider bringing the Nano back to Singur         
	The chief minister told us he would shortly write to Ratan Tata with a request to reconsider his decision (to shift the project to Gujarat), committee president Udyan Das said. We badly need the Nano plant, we want it back in Singur.        
	An eight-member delegation of the committee had earlier met industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen and submitted a memorandum. A fortnight ago, the team had knocked on governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis door.        
	Das said a majority of Singur residents were backing the committee. Several unwilling farmers, too, have now agreed to accept cheques. Moreover, the youth have come forward to stand by the project.        
	The CPM indicated that the government would ask the Tatas to return the acquired land in Singur if they had no immediate plans of starting another automobile project there. Party secretariat member Benoy Konar said the government had received proposals from some investors.         
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen, however, clarified that the government had not taken a decision yet. We are still discussing the possibilities. It is not yet time to write to the Tatas, Sen said, indicating that the government would not put pressure on the company before some other deal was cemented.

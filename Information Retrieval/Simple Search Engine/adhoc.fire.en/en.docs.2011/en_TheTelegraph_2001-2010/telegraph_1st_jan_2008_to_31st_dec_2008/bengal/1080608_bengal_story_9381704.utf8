          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, June 7: Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya today said threatening and abusing a minister did not constitute an act of heroism, as Dilip Singh was trying to portray.        
	On Thursday, the Darjeeling Mail on which the minister was travelling was held up at Kishanganj station for over seven hours because of the bandh called by the Left Front.        
	Bhattacharya was apparently planning to travel to Siliguri by road because of pressing engagements when other passengers led by Singh, a sales representative, threatened and abused him for deserting them when the train had been stranded because of a bandh called by his party.        
	Eventually, Bhattacharya did not leave the station after the protests and said he had no intention of travelling to Siliguri by road but had merely been requested by police to go to the circuit house to freshen up.        
	Today, Bhattacharya said: The youth (Singh) had insulted me and spoken to me abusively. He was almost on the verge of assaulting me but the presence of the police prevented him from doing that. Such action shouldnt be encouraged.        
	The minister explained that encouraging such an act would only make people to indulge in such unruly behavi- our, forgetting the dignity of a minister.        
	I was interacting with several other passengers at regular intervals. There were no problems with them, Bhattacharya said. They saw me trying to sort out the problem of the blockade and reject the local administrations offer to go to the circuit house. But it was this one person who was constantly hurling abuses at me.        
	Singh, however, denied abusing or intimidating the minister. I know the status of a minister. How can I, a common man, have the courage to do so? But it is true that I was excited and agitated, he said.

	Calcutta, March 1: Labourers at a construction site in Garia today stumbled on the body of a youth near a pond by EM Bypass.         
	Police said the youth, about 30 years old, was probably strangled. A chain was tied around his neck. He was wearing jeans and a checked shirt.        
	This was the third body to be found along the bypass in 10 days. Last Thursday, a chartered accountancy student was found dead at Dhapa on the eastern side.

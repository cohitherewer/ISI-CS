     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 18: The first places to be hit by bird flu are restaurants and clubs. 
    
	If dining out meant chicken tandoori, tengri kebab or chicken butter masala to you, many eateries here will say Sorry. 
    
	The first to put a full stop were the five-stars. Weve stopped serving chicken and chicken-based meals since Wednesday. Guests have not requested for them either, said a Hyatt Regency official. 
    
	At ITCs The Sonar, chicken is being served only on request. 
    
	We are serving chicken only on request, but the demand for it has definitely gone down. The demand for fish, sea food and lamb has gone up, said the catering department of the Bypass hotel. 
    
	Restaurateurs have also struck off chicken. At Melange, we have stopped serving chicken. It is more of a precautionary measure, but guests have not been missing it either, said restaurateur Naveen Pai. 
    
	Mutton is the new chicken, said a man at Hot Kati Rolls on Park Street. 
    
	The bird has also gone missing from the menus at Saturday Club on Wood Street and the RCGC.

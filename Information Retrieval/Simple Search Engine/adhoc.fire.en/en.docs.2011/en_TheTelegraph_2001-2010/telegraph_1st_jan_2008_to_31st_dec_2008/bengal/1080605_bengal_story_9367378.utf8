                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   TVS enters Bengal on bike
  - Southern company to manufacture at Salim site        A STAFF REPORTER                                                      
	Calcutta, June 4: TVS Motor Company, the countrys third-largest two-wheeler maker, today announced its entry into Bengal with a manufacturing contract with Salim Group company Mahabharat Motors.         
	TVS chairman Venu Sreenivasan and chairman of Universal Success Enterprise Prasoon Mukherjee, co-owner of Mahabharat, met the chief minister this evening to apprise him of the deal in the presence of industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen.        
	Launched in October 2005, Mahabharat had not taken off as the Zongshen Industrial group of China, with which it had tied up, withdrew from the venture. The Zongshen deal has fallen apart, it is scrapped. But we must look at the brighter side.... We have been able to bring a two-wheeler manufacturing giant into Bengal. We told the chief minister people from Bengal will be employed in the huge set-up, manufacturing 100,000 motorcycles annually from June 2009, Mukherjee said after the meeting.        
	Mahabharat will invest over Rs 400 crore in three years to set up the factory.        
	TVS will have a contract-manufacturing arrangement at Mahabharats complex in Uluberia, 50km from Calcutta.        
	Weve tied up with Mahabharat not only because Prasoon and I go back a long way, but also because we in TVS have great faith in the potential of the East. This is our first foray in this part of the country and we are looking forward to a great deal of success, said Sreenivasan.         
	The Eastern market contributes over 20 per cent to our sales now. The number should rise to over 25 per cent within 2013, he added.         
	Initially, Mahabharat will produce 100cc motorcycles under the TVS Star brand. The models to be rolled out from the factory are Star, Star City, and Star Sport.         
	In the next phase, TVS will explore the possibility of manufacturing established brands like Fiero, Centra, Victor, Flame and Apache.        
	The factory will employ several thousand people, said Sreenivasan.        
	The Chennai-based company will market the motorcycles and provide technology for production. It will also extend training facilities to develop skilled manpower.        
	It is great news that the third-largest two-wheeler manufacturer is entering the state with a huge project that will have an initial investment of $100 million (Rs 430 crore), said industries secretary Sen.        
	Asked if the chief minister had anything to say about the brand name, Arjun, he had suggested for bikes manufactured in the Mahabharat factory, Sen said: It doesnt matter whether they are called Arjun or Bheem or Duryodhan. What matters is that they will be manufactured in our backyard and the set-up will employ thousands of people.

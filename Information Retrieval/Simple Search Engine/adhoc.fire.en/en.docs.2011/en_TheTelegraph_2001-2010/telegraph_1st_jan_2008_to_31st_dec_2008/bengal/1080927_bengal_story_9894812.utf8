	Calcutta, Sept. 26: The high court today set aside the state information commissioners order asking the government to make its agreement with Tata Motors public.        
	In his order today, Justice Dipankar Dutta also directed the commissioner, Arun Bhattacharya, to hear the Tatas within eight weeks before passing a fresh order. The state government or any of its agencies will not be allowed to make the deal public before that.         
	The order followed a petition by Tata Motors challenging the legality of the commissioners September 9 order.        
	The companys counsel told the court that the Right to Information Act, 2005, did not allow a document involving a third party to be made public.         
	The third partys consent is needed and my client does not want to make the agreement public because its trade secret is also involved in it, advocate Samaraditya Pal said.        
	Following the commissioners order, the government had posted parts of the agreement on a website.

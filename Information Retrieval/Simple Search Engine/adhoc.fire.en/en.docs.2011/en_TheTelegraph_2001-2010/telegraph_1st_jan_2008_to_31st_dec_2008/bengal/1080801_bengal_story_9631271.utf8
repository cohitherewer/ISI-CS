  - One family looks for son, other gets money          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Behrampore, July 31: The body of a patient reported missing from an unlicensed nursing home was ferried to the police station in a surgeons car by his driver, triggering allegations of foul play.        
	Abdul Jabbar Sheikh, 28, was admitted to Subarno Nursing Home in Behrampore town with stomach ache on July 26.         
	His mother Maleka Bewa, lodged a police complaint last night against T.K. Ghosh, the surgeon, who runs the nursing home that has no licence to operate. The doctor, who was running the nursing home at his home, is absconding.        
	After an ultrasonography, the doctor concluded that Abdul needed an appendicitis operation and claimed that the surgery was carried out, relatives of the patient said. But no sign of such a surgery was found during the post-mortem today in the Behrampore General Hospital.        
	After the supposed operation, Abdul continued to complain of stomach pain. Whenever I told the doctor (about the pain), he gave Abdul an injection. Yesterday afternoon, when my son was writhing in pain, I called up home from a phone booth and told my family that Abduls condition was deteriorating, Maleka said.         
	The mother said that when she returned after buying an injection yesterday, her son could not be found.         
	Ghosh first told her Abdul had been taken to Behrampore Sadar Hospital and later to a private hospital, Maleka said. But Maleka and her family did not find him in either place.        
	We went to the nursing home and enquired about Abdul. Around 11pm, his body was brought to the police station in the surgeons car, said a police officer, declining to reveal what the clinic told the force. A case of negligence has been started against Ghosh.

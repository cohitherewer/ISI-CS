The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Make profit, sour career
                                                                                                               Make profit, sour career
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, March 26: A milk co-operative managing director has been suspended for selling milk to Amul instead of the government dairy that offers a much lesser price.        
	Paritosh Sarkar said he had done no wrong as the health of the Bhagirathi Co-operative Mil Producers Union was foremost in his mind. Amul is paying Rs 15.55 a litre. Mother Dairy would have paid Rs 13.3 a litre, he said.        
	The co-operative as well as the farmers selling milk to it will earn more from the arrangement, he argued.        
	Bhagirathi, the largest state-owned milk co-operative in the district, is profit-making. So long, it had only sold milk to Mother Dairy, run by a milk producers federation chaired by animal resource development minister Anisur Rahman.         
	Amul, which started selling milk in Bengal three years ago, now sells about 2 lakh litres a day, 1.5 lakh lakh litres less than Mother Dairy.         
	Amul has a processing plant near Dankuni, in Hooghly.        
	The MD cant sell milk to any private dairy without the permission of the chairman of the West Bengal Co-operative Milk Producers Federation (read Rahman), said district magistrate Subir Bhadra, also the chairman of the Murshidabad co-operative. I have sus- pended him for not following the rules and asked the Behrampore subdivisional officer to take charge.        
	Sarkar said: If the DM wants to suspend me, he has to call a board meeting.        
	The minister had no doubt that Sarkar was at fault. He cannot sell milk to whoever he wants, Rahman said.        
	Bypass crash        
	Three youths on a motorcycle were seriously injured in a crash on EM Bypass late tonight. A matador van hit them near Hiland Park.

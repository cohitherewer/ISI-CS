                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Dumpers set ablaze
                            
	Purulia, May 18: A gang armed with single-barrel guns and pipe guns raided a road construction site here last night and set ablaze three dumpers and a payloader.        
	The assailants shouted Maoist slogans and left behind posters saying machines made abroad could not be used.         
	The Japanese-make machines were badly damaged. But police are not sure if the men were Maoists. The Maoists write CPI(Maoist) or CPI (Maobadi) on posters. These had CPI-M (Maobadi) written on them, said Purulia police chief Ashok Prasad.

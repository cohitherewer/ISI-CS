          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, Oct. 29: Nearly 200 members of the Nano Banchao Committee today descended on three buses carrying Tata Motors employees, pleading with them not to remove any machinery from the project site.         
	The buses were allowed to move after half an hour, when the Tata officials and technical staff explained they had come only to inspect the machinery lying in the factory and not take them away.        
	Villagers on vigil at the project gates spotted the buses around 8.40 this morning and rushed towards them.        
	We had no intention of stopping them from entering the plant. We only want to ensure no machinery is removed because we want the Nano to be brought out from Singur, said Saday Kolay, secretary of the committee.        
	A Tata team on a similar recce had been blocked on October 22, but was allowed passage after villagers urged them with folded hands not to leave Singur.        
	The Nano committee has said it will not let Mamata Banerjee enter Singur, where she has lined up a rally on November 2. We will mobilise 10,000 villagers in Singur on November 2. We will block Durgapur Expressway at the approach to Singur, Kolay said.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief, however, said this evening that she would hold the rally at any cost.        
	I will go to Singur as planned on November 2. Let me see who can stop me. The CPM and the police are trying to create trouble ahead of my visit, Mamata said.        
	The Nano committee is also planning to greet Mamata with black flags when she passes Durgapur Expressway on her way to Ausgram in Burdwan tomorrow.        
	Police said adequate arrangements had been made for Mamatas rally. We are prepared to handle any situation. We will not tolerate any trouble in Singur on November 2, Hooghly superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Husband FIR
                                                                                                               Husband FIR
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 8: Srikrishna Saha, the husband of Ratna who set herself ablaze on Thursday, went to police today to lodge a complaint against neighbour Ashok Roy, accusing him of forcing his wife into an extra-marital affair.        
	Srikrishna, a hawker, had yesterday alleged that CPM workers stopped him from going to Maniktala police station and snatched a letter detailing how his wife, tagged a woman of loose morals by a kangaroo court, had been ostracised.        
	However, Srikrishnas FIR does not mention the CPM-backed committee that had set up the kangaroo court.        
	Srikrishna told the officer-in-charge that Ratna had gone away for a month, probably with Ashok, but he was ready to take her back when she returned to their Bagmari Road home on March 4. However, his two brothers raised a hue and cry and rushed to the committee to lodge a complaint against Ratna.         
	The 25-member committee set up a kangaroo court the next day and declared that Ratna was harmful to society and Srikrishna should take her and their two daughters away from the neighbourhood.        
	A day later, Ratna set herself on fire as Srikrishna went house-hunting.        
	My uncle said he was relieved after meeting the police. We hope Ashok will now learn the lesson of his life, Srikrishnas nephew Gopal said.

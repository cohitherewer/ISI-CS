          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, May 25: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha wants the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) dissolved.         
	Party president Bimal Gurung today threatened to give a call in the hills to disregard the council, as it had become a stumbling block to attaining a separate state.         
	The decision, if ratified by the Morcha central committee, will lead to the boycott of all DGHC activities, Gurung added.         
	The threat follows the chief ministers response to the Morcha demand for Gorkhaland.         
	A four-member Morcha delegation had met Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee last week and presented him with a proposed map of the new state, including Darjeeling, Siliguri, the Dooars and the Terai. The chief minister had rejected the demand and instead asked the Morcha to sit for talks so that DGHC could be strengthened.         
	Home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti had said the chief minister had also asked the Morcha to steer clear of organisations like the Kamtapur Progressive Party and the Greater Cooch Behar Democratic Party, which want Cooch Behar to be declared a state.        
	The Morcha was unhappy as the chief minister had not taken its demand seriously.        
	Today, Gurung said, he was not willing to hold further talks with Bhattacharjee. Since the chief minister has ignored our demand, we will now sit for discussions only with the Centre, he said, adding that the states representatives should attend the meeting.        
	It is now the final battle. The council has for 21 years been the main hurdle to achieving Gorkhaland, Gurung said at Pintail Village, 5km from here.

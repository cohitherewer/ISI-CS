	Calcutta, Sept. 10: Finance minister Asim Dasgupta today said work culture in government offices must improve, particularly at Writers.     
	There should be accountability of government employees, he added. The immediate provocation was yesterdays gherao and alleged assault on Swapan Maitra, an assistant secretary of the finance department, by some Writers employees.     
	At an Assocham meeting last month, the chief minister had assured the captains of industry that gherao was a thing of the past in Bengal.        
	Tamluk: The CPI MLA from Nandigram, Mohammed Ilyas, has submitted his resignation to the Speaker months after he was caught on camera allegedly taking bribe from an NGO.         
	Behrampore: A teacher on his way to school lost his legs after he slipped and fell between two compartments while trying to board a running train in Behrampore. Bhagirath Mondal, 45, took the train everyday.

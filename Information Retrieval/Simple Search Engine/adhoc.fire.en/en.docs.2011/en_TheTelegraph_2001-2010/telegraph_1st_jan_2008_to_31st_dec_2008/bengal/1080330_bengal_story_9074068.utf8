                                                                                                               Man found dead in family tank
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Rajesh, from a family album                                  
	Howrah, March 30: A 35-year-old businessman was found dead today in a godown owned by his family in Bally.         
	The body of Rajesh Kumar Shaw, who went missing yesterday, was found in an underground water reservoir of the godown near his home.        
	Rajeshs brother Sunil, the youngest of five brothers and two sisters, left the family home early this morning and was missing till late tonight.         
	Sunil usually stayed with his in-laws in Khardah, North 24-Parganas, but had been at home over the past month.         
	Some of Rajeshs siblings suspect Sunil. He was always fighting with Rajesh over property, saying our father, who died last month, gave him more, said sister Renuka.        
	Rajeshs widow Maya has lodged an FIR accusing Sunil of killing him. Howrah police chief N.K. Singh said a murder case had been started.        
	Sunil had been arrested last year for attacking Maya with a chopper following an argument over property.        
	Yesterday, Rajesh took a rickshaw van-puller who lives in a rented room in his house to clean the godown where a wedding reception had taken place on Thursday. After the clean-up, Shibshankar Mahato returned the key to the house at 3pm, around the same time that Rajesh was last seen at a tea stall outside the godown.        
	When he didnt return by 10pm, we lodged a missing complaint, said Rajeshs brother Dilip. We searched for him wherever we thought he could be till 3am. We didnt enter the godown because it was locked. Sunil did not join us. He woke up earlier than usual and left.        
	The godown was searched this afternoon. We saw traces of blood on the floor and the walls, Dilip said. Following the trail, the brothers reached the reservoir, where Rajeshs slippers were floating. A closer look revealed Rajeshs body, which bore many wounds.        
	Sunils mobile was switched off through the day.

	New Delhi, Dec. 21: Nine in 10 primary health centres in Bengal lack all-weather motorable access roads and hundreds remain without electricity or water, according to figures released by the Union health ministry.         
	The state has spent less than 15 per cent of the Rs 489 crore that it has received from the National Rural Health Mission to improve health services in rural areas, the ministry has told Parliament.         
	The figures, outlining the state of primary health centres (PHCs) across the country, show that 15 states have provided electricity and water to 100 per cent of their PHCs.         
	Bengals PHC statistics are closer to those of Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh. Not one of its 922 PHCs has an operation theatre and only 410 have a labour room.         
	Public health experts say the lack of all-weather roads, electricity and water would make a PHC virtually non-functional.         
	How does a clinic without electricity or water deliver immunisation  one of its most basic functions? asked Nilangi Sardeshpande, a public health specialist at Sathi-Cehat, a non-government organisation in Pune monitoring the National Rural Health Mission.         
	The lack of roads would prevent patients to be moved to a better-equipped health centre, she said.         
	But experts say the figures arent surprising because of lack of clarity in some states on implementing the rural health mission.         
	Some improvements have clearly taken place  rural health centres appear better staffed  but there are wide variations across states and some states have gaps, Sardeshpande told The Telegraph.         
	Not a single PHC among the 3,660 in Uttar Pradesh has a labour room or an operation theatre.         
	Despite transfer of rural health funds from the Centre, many states have yet to make use of the money, said Nitin Jadhav, member of a community-based monitoring group of rural health services in Maharashtra.         
	The Centre released about Rs 489 crore to Bengal between 2005 and 2008, but the state has an unspent balance of about Rs 419 crore  which means it has used only about 14 per cent of the money.         
	The health ministry figures show that not a single state has used all the funds disbursed under the rural health programme.         
	Mizoram has spent the highest proportion  84 per cent of the Rs 47 crore it received over the past three years.         
	Bihar has spent just 12 per cent of its share of Rs 331 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rs 1-lakh rule on Bloc wish list
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Rs 1-lakh rule on Bloc wish list
          BISWAJIT ROY                          The Metro Cash amp; Carry store on EM Bypass that is awaiting the Blocs licence                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 1: The Forward Bloc plans to bind German wholesaler Metro Cash amp; Carry by conditions that include prohibition of sale below a minimum amount, which may be Rs 50,000 to 1 lakh.         
	A party panel, framing the conditions before the state marketing board issues its licence to Metro to procure and sell farm products, met today. It will finalise its plans tomorrow before a meeting with the CPM on Friday.         
	Although Metro had promised that it would sell goods on the condition that they are for resale, commercial, business or industrial purpose and not personal consumption, the Bloc wants to tie the loose ends to ensure it does not disturb the retail market.         
	No way will we allow Metro and its ilk to make a backdoor entry into retail to snatch the livelihood of small traders. Nor will we allow it to introduce contract farming, which will make farmers subservient to its interests, said Barun Mukherjee, the convener of the Bloc committee.         
	Metro Cash amp; Carry has repeatedly said it would not enter retail and the company has so far not given any indi-cation that contract farming is on its radar.        
	A member of the Bloc panel said: As the price for the same quantity of farm goods and other products differs, we will ask them to ensure a minimum bill of Rs 50,000 to 1 lakh per customer.         
	In Bangalore, where Metro has been in business for several years, the minimum bill amount is Rs 1,000.        
	The CPM is said to have received an assurance from Metro that it would not sell less than 20kg of any item, but the Bloc is more eager to enforce a minimum bill amount.        
	It also wants to tighten the implementation of the Agricultural Produces Marketing Control Act, according to which Metro will have to procure farm produce from the principal markets under the Bloc-controlled marketing board.         
	The board will also ask the Metro bosses to allow its per- sonnel to be present at its EM Bypass outlet.         
	Naren Chatterjee, the chairman of the board that had held back Metros licence until the chief minister issued an instruction to grant it immediately, today said the firm would have to apply afresh for a licence with the promise to stick to wholesale business.         
	The party has also decided to ensure that henceforth no licence for procurement and sale of farm produce by big companies is issued or renewed by the Regulated Market Committees without Chatterjees approval. We wanted to undo the damage done by the South 24-Parganas committee that had issued the licence to Metro without informing then minister and board chairman Kamal Guha. The chief minister and the CPM now want us to renew Metros licence on the pretext of that mistake, a leader said.        
	Bloc leaders cited the CPM central committees concerns over hoarding of foodgrain by food retailers and agri-bus-iness companies to back their arguments against Metro.         
	The CPMs Shyamal Chakraborty and Benoy Konar said they had never suggested any bar on companies like Metro, which are in the wholesale vegetable business. We had opposed corporate entry in the foodgrain business to stop forward trading. Metro in vegetable wholesale will prevent farmers wastage, Konar said.

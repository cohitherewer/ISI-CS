	Singur, Jan. 11: Agitating temporary guards stalled operations at the Tata Motors plant for a few hours today, after halting work at the vendor park yesterday.
    
	The CPM has appealed to the government to rehabilitate the temps, all local residents, who were hired to protect the boundary wall while it was being built and now face the sack.
    
	The guards asked the contract labourers to leave the premises this morning. 
    
	A Tata Motors source said: Work resumed later in the day.
    
	Golok Santra, a Singur resident carrying a CPM flag, said: Outsiders cannot work here when we are being sacked.
    
	The chief of the CPM-led panchayat samiti, Ranjit Mondal, admitted that some of our supporters threatened others at the project site. We are trying to solve the problem through talks.
    
	Party state secretary Biman Bose said he would request the government to ensure jobs for them in the ancillary units. 
    
	Protest against Dankuni township
    
	Villagers today prevented a team from conducting a study in Dankuni where real estate company DLF will build a township. They vowed not to give land for the project, 20km from Calcutta, and allowed the team to leave only after it promised not to return.

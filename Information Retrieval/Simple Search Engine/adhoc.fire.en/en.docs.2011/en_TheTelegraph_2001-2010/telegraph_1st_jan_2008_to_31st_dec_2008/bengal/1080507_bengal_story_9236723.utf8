	Behrampore, May 6: A 15-year-old boy was killed this afternoon, apparently while being taught how to make bombs by his father in a Murshidabad village.    
	Police said Anisur Rahman, a farm labourer and apparently a CPM supporter, was making bombs in his thatched two-storey house about 185km from Calcutta. One of them went off. He is missing.        
	Calcutta: The state will get 25 companies of the Border Security Force and 15 companies of police from Orissa, Kerala and Tripura for the panchayat elections. Inspector-general Raj Kanojia said: We expect the BSF to arrive by May 8. The rest will come before the polls.

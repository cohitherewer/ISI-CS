          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Dec. 7: A fake doctor who used someone elses registration number to run a practice, and disappeared after being exposed in October, has been arrested.        
	Supriyo Bhaduri also ran a nursing home and became assistant secretary of the Indian Medical Associations Bengal unit.        
	He was found lying un- conscious on the roadside at Irrigation Colony in Durgapur town around 11 last night. Local youths, who knew him, called police.        
	The police arrested Bhaduri after reviving him by sprinkling water on his face and later admitted him to the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.         
	Bhaduri, 42, had used the registration number of a Burdwan Medical College gynaecologist to run a roaring practice as a general physician for 14 years.         
	The Durgapur chapter of the association had accused Bhaduri of cheating.         
	The police said Bhaduri appeared mentally unstable after he was taken to the police station.         
	We found him unconscious with a superficial cut on his forehead. He could not explain why and how he came to be lying on the street. We had been looking for him since October 26, said G.P. Shaw, the officer in charge of Coke Oven police station.

	Calcutta, Dec. 24: The high court today scrapped the appointment of a Haldia municipality surveyor and ordered fresh interviews.     
	Civic body chief Tamalika Seth has been told to arrange fresh interviews with the man who holds the post now and one who had stood first in a test conducted by the municipality for the job. On November 27, Ratan Mondal had received a letter that asked him to appear for an interview on November 25. Nityananda Karan, who came second in the test, bagged the job.         
	Krishnagar: A sec- ond-year MTech student of Kalyani University is missing since Monday. Kaustav Chowdhury had apparently left his mess to attend classes and disappeared. His mobile has remained switched off since. Kaustav is from Englishbazar, Malda. His uncle said he was worried about job prospects.        
	Purulia: The poll panel has put in place a network comprising NCC and NSS volunteers to keep itself informed about incidents on polling day in Para, Purulia. The bypoll to the Assembly seat is scheduled on Saturday. The chief electoral officer said the system would be introduced across the state during the Lok Sabha polls. In Para, it is a pilot project.

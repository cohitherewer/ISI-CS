	Singur, Nov. 2: Around 25 policemen watched as members of the Save Nano Committee and Trinamul Congress supporters battled on Durgapur Expressway today.        
	But the lathis and teargas came out soon after, when the Trinamul group began pelting the police with stones.         
	Singur had been simmering since an attack on Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjees vehicle. Things turned ugly when the Nano committee members tried to stop a Trinamul procession barely 3km from the abandoned Tata Motors factory.        
	All this while, the police exercised restraint.        
	They swung into action only when the Trinamul supporters threw stones at them, alleging the police were hand-in-glove with the pro-Nano campaigners. They said the police had allowed the CPM-backed protesters to blockade the expressway.         
	The policemen fired tear gas and put their batons to use to quell the Trinamul supporters led by Saugata Ray.         
	Thirty rounds of tear gas were fired. Five policemen were injured and one of them, with serious injuries to his head, had to be hospitalised. Five vehicles were set on fire by the Trinamul supporters, district superintendent of police Rajiv Mishra said.        
	We have received several FIRs from both sides. So far, five persons have been arrested for violence and rioting, Mishra added.        
	The cops had their job cut out  to stop Trinamul leaders from stepping into Singur.         
	Both the camps had been up in arms since last night. We knew the situation would go out of hand if the Trinamul leaders reached Singur to hold their rally, because the CPM supporters were determined to scuttle their plans, an officer said.         
	He added that police deployment was thin because the administration wanted to send a message across to the Trinamul and CPM camps that the situation was normal.

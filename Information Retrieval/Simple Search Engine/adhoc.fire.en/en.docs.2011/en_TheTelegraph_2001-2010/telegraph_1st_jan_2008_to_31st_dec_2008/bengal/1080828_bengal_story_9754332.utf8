                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Nano blurs politics in Maharashtra
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 27: Bengal may be bickering over the small-car project, but Maharashtras political rivals are singing in sync to roll out the red carpet for the Nano.        
	We want the Tatas here. They belong to this state. We do not want industry to choose a state where people say it is unwanted. Wed rather have the Nano project here so that hundreds of our poor people find job opportunities. We are one with the government on this, said the Shiv Senas Ramdas Kadam.        
	Our aim is maximum development for the state. We back anyone whose agenda is the betterment of Maharashtra. Political rivalries do not matter, he added.        
	Hours before the leader of Opposition issued the statement, his predecessor, Nitin Gadkari of the BJP, said: We have separate political goals. But on progress and development, we have a singular view. Differences in matters of implementation have never resulted in the stone-walling of a project in this state.

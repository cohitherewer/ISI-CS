	Calcutta, June 25: The RPG group wants to build an international-standard school in Calcutta.        
	It will be a full-fledged international-standard school from nursery to secondary classes. We need five acres and are looking for land in the Rajarhat area, RPG Enterprises vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said after a meeting with the chief minister.        
	He sought Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees help to find the land.        
	The two also discussed other projects  like a management institute, shopping mall, expansion of the Philips Carbon Black plant in Durgapur and the Haldia and Budge Budge power plants  that involve investments worth Rs 13,050 crore.        
	The third 250MW unit of Budge Budge will be commissioned next year and the first phase (1000MW) of the proposed Haldia plant is expected to begin generation by 2012. The power demand has increased way beyond anticipation. We are trying our best to minimise the inconvenience of the people, said Goenka, whose company also runs the power utility CESC.         
	The B-school will come up on Judges Court Road and the mall at Park Circus. The expansion of the carbon black (an ingredient for tyres) unit is expected to be over next year, Goenka said.        
	Acquisition protest        
	Former finance minister Ashok Mitra today criticised the land acquisition drive and asked the government to ensure shares for landlosers in the new units. At a seminar, he added: If the private sector needs the government to acquire land, the government should share ownership of the new companies. It should join the management to look after the workers as well as the landlosers.

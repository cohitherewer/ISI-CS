          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 28: A 12-year-old domestic helps body was found in a jute sack on a Howrah road, but the telltale shop name on the sack led investigators to a traders family which confessed to beating the child to death in a fit of rage, police said today.        
	The police arrested hosiery trader Vijay Agarwal, his wife, son and daughter from their Titagarh home in North 24-Parganas.        
	The police claimed that the arrested persons had confessed, saying the maid, Alo Sen from Canning, was killed when they beat her up on Thursday night. They kept the body in the house throughout Friday, looking for an opportunity to dump it, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the Howrah superintendent of police.        
	The body was spotted by a patrol party on Foreshore Road near Burn Standard Company on Friday night. A pillow was inside the bag, said an officer of Howrah police station.        
	The police patrol was stunned when they removed the pillow. We saw the body in a long skirt and a top with bruises all over, the officer said. We noticed the name of a shop, Sunita Stores, and the word Titagarh printed on the bag.        
	The police located the hosiery goods retail outlet, owned by Agarwal, and tracked down his house. Some people in the neighbourhood told me that Alo had not been seen from yesterday. They said the Agarwal family used to torture the girl almost every day, said a police officer.         
	Questioned, Vijay and his wife Manju broke down and recounted how Alo was killed, the police said. When the Agarwal couple assaulted Alo on Friday night, their son Vishal, 21, and daughter Preety, 18, also joined in, the officer said.        
	On Friday night, Agarwal and Manju hired a taxi, kept the bag with the body in the boot, got down at Howrah and dumped it on the road, the police said. They returned home by another taxi.

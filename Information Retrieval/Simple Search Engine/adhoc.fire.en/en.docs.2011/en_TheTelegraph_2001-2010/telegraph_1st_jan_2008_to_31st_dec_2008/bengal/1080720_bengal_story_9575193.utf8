                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Somen splits Cong for Mamata
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     Friends again: Somen Mitra and Mamata Banerjee on Saturday. Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta                                  
	Calcutta, July 19: Somen Mitra walked out of the Congress today, splitting the party again 10 years after Mamata Banerjee did so after being expelled.        
	Mitra, then said to be the reason for Mamatas exit, vowed to fight the CPM with her today. I am leaving the Congress to float a new progressive, secular, democratic party  the Pragatishil Indira Congress  to fight the ruling CPM. We shall join forces with Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress, he told a news conference this afternoon.        
	Mitra, whom Mamata had once dubbed a watermelon  green (Congress) outside and red (CPM) inside  had called on her last month to bury the hatchet.         
	At the one-to-one, Mitra had discussed the break with the Congress, formally anno-unced today.        
	The former state Congress president said the general perception was that the Congress was a stooge of the CPM. People in the districts have raised questions about our integrity. I have realised that it is better to come out of the Congress and collaborate with Mamata Banerjee, the lone anti-CPM force in Bengal.        
	Mitra would tour the districts next month to woo Congress leaders and supporters to join his party. He claimed that Congress MLA Sudip Bandopadhyay was with him.        
	Bandopadhyay, however, denied having any links with the new party.         
	Mamata welcomed Mitras decision to quit the Congress and said it was a step in the right direction.         
	She had earlier described her meeting with Mitra in June as a turning point in Bengal politics.        
	We will invite him to Mondays (Trinamul) rally at Esplanade, she said today.        
	Mamata said she had walked out of the Congress in 1997 with the sole objective of fighting the CPM.         
	The CPM would not have been able to rule for 32 years had we been serious about ending its misrule, she added.        
	However, several Trinamul leaders questioned Mitras moves. Once Didi had dubbed him the captain of the CPMs B team. Now he is overnight projecting himself as a bitter foe of the CPM, which is not believable, a key party functionary said.         
	Mitra iterated that he wanted to get rid of the humiliating tag of being the CPMs stooge. Why should I be labelled a CPM stooge after fighting the communists for so many years? he asked.         
	The Congress leadership tried to play down the split. Somens decision was unfortunate but it will not have any impact on the organisation because he has no support, said former mayor Subrata Mukherjee.        
	CPM central committee member Benoy Konar ridiculed Mitras decision and said: If Somen thinks Mamata is progressive (pragatishil), he is absolutely wrong.         
	The Congress legislature party will request Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim to allot a separate seat to Mitra, the MLA from Sealdah, sources said.

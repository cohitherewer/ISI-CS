The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Protest hurdle to shipyard 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Protest hurdle to shipyard 
  - Resistance to industry in East Midnapore, fruits of it in Hooghly        ANSHUMAN PHADIKAR                          No room for ships? Fishing trawlers anchored in the Hooghly at Geonkhali. Picture by Jahangir Badsa                                        
	Tamluk, July 8: Over half the 600 people who own the 500 acres required for a shipyard in East Midnapore have objected to the acquisition.        
	The Geonkhali residents have lodged their formal objections with the district magistrates office.         
	Bharti Shipyard had promised to invest Rs 2,000 crore over the next 10 years on the banks of the Hooghly in collaboration with the Apeejay Group.        
	The land acquisition notice for the project was put up in the local panchayat offices last month and the owners had to lodge their objections, if any, by July 23.         
	A good number of them have filed their objections. We will start hearing their objections after July 23, said district magistrate Anup Agarwal.        
	A district official said over 300 people, who own over 200 acres, had filed their objections. More could come.        
	According to law, owners cannot object to land acquisition. They can only complain about the compensation being offered. In Geonkhali, they will get 130 per cent of the market value plus a 10 per cent solatium and a 12 per cent interest on delay in payment.        
	Niranjan Sahu, 40, who owns a little less than an acre, said: I cultivate boro and aman crops and engage about 25 labourers in the harvesting season. I also grow paan (betel leaves) and vegetables. This is our only source of income. There is no question of giving up the land.         
	Housewife Bijoli Maity, 55, who owns over two acres, was equally adamant. We earn our livelihood from the land. How can we give it up? she said.        
	A Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee has been formed in Geonkhali to resist the acquisition, as in Nandigram, about 50km away.        
	Its convener, Gautam Das, warned of a Nandigram-like movement if the government tried to acquire land forcibly.         
	The Trinamul Congress, which is in the forefront of the resistance, wrested the Kukrahati and Betkundu gram panchayats, where the shipyard has been planned, from the CPM in the May polls.        
	Nearly 100 farmers marched to the Geonkhali block office today and submitted a memorandum to the BDO demanding that the acquisition notice be scrapped.        
	The chief minister had asked officials to tear up a notice issued in Nandigram after the bloody land war broke out.        
	In Geonkhali, Das said: When more than 50 per cent of the owners are unwilling to give up their land, the notification should be cancelled.        
	Bharti Shipyard, however, is hopeful. Subir Chakraborty, its vice-president, said he hoped that talks could solve the problem. We also feel that forcible acquisition does not help industry. To make an industry successful, the co-operation of local people is essential, he added.

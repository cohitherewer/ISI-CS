          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 24: The government wants to ascertain the actual number of unwilling farmers before disclosing any plans to rehabilitate them but a CPM leader today ruled out a land-for-land package.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose said: Let them (Trinamul Congress leaders) come back to the talks table to ascertain the actual number of unwilling farmers. At the last meeting between the Trinamul leaders and the government, it was decided that the Opposition would send some documents in support of its claim about the number of unwilling farmers. They are yet to send them.        
	According to the governments figures, only 167 acres belong to genuinely unwilling farmers. But Mamata Banerjee has been demanding the return of 400 acres. A CPM state secretariat meeting this evening, which rejected any possibility of slicing up the Tata Motors project area, put the figure at 308 acres, including 57 for which the owners had sought higher compensation.        
	Whatever the figure, there is no point in holding talks if they continue to insist on the return of any portion of the project area, CPM leader Benoy Konar later said.        
	According to some CPM leaders, the government may consider allotting alternative plots only if Trinamul accepts the formula and agrees to slash the number of unwilling farmers.         
	Konar, however, made it clear that land for land could not be the solution.         
	Its not possible to offer land in exchange for acquired land. If land were available in the market, people whose plots near the Durgapur Expressway were taken over could buy land in villages where prices are not so high.         
	He iterated the chief ministers promise to ensure the livelihood of poor and land-dependent marginal farmers with support from the government as well as the Tatas.         
	The specifics could be discussed only if Trinamul is interested in talks.        
	On Friday, industries minister Nirupam Sen had ruled out offering alternative plots or additional compensation as they would set a wrong precedent.         
	However, the chief minister yesterday said the government was working on several rehabilitation packages for all those affected by the Tata Motors unit.

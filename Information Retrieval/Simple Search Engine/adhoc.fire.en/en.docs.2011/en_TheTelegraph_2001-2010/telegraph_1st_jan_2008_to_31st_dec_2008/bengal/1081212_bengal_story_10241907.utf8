                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bandh blow in hills
                            
	Dec. 11: The 12-hour Gorkha Janmukti Morcha bandh today took tourists and Sikkim residents by surprise, stranding them in the hills and the plains.        
	Traffic came to a halt on National Highway 31A, snapping the main road link between the state and the rest of the country. More than 100 tourists were forced to stay back in Gangtok.         
	At the citys main taxi stand, Amit Jain from Howrah said: Ive been waiting here since morning. The cars will start only after 4pm because they cannot enter Bengal before 6.         
	The Jains could wait because they had Friday nights train tickets for Calcutta. Naval Kishore Sharma had to take a train tomorrow morning. In Siliguri, M.D. Murthy from Bangalore was waiting at the bus terminus, his Sikkim holiday with Kendriya Vidyalaya colleagues on hold.         
	A stone hurled at a Morcha procession demanding Gorkhaland injured a 16-year-old girl near Siliguri and triggered a clash.        
	Tripartite meeting        
	The Morchas meeting with the state and the Centre on the hill impasse will be held on December 29. A state official informed me about the Delhi date today, party chief Bimal Gurung said. In Calcutta, the state home secretary confirmed the date.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Potato death
                                                                                                               Potato death
                            
	Burdwan, April 2: A farmer who had spent Rs 300 a quintal to grow potatoes and was getting only Rs 120 a quintal for his produce killed himself in a Burdwan village today.         
	Basudeb Ghosh, 75, was found hanging in his house near Mangalkot in Katwa, 170km from Calcutta. His brother Bhairab said: Dada had spent Rs 120,000 on potatoes. Two acres had produced 400 quintals.        
	The government had said last week it would buy potatoes from farmers at Rs 250 a quintal.        
	But the district manager of Benfed, the government co-operative supposed to buy the crop, said all farmers could not be helped as there was no cold-storage space.

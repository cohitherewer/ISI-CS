The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tiger Attack
                                                                                                               Tiger Attack
                                          
	Calcutta, March 1: A tiger mauled a 35-year-old woman in the Sunderbans this afternoon when she strayed into the core area looking for crabs and shrimps.        
	Gayatri Sardar was standing in waist-deep water in the Benipheli canal in the Herobhanga core forest area when she came face to face with the tiger. It pounced on her, wounding her in the neck and spine.         
	Forest officials said Gayatri, of Kultali, cried out and some fishermen rushed in. Confused by their cries, the tiger let go of its prey and bounded back into the jungle.         
	Gayatri was brought to Calcutta tonight.

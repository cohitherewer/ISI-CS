The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | 17 stitches after fall in hospital
                                                                                                               17 stitches after fall in hospital
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, March 17: A 62-year-old woman smashed her head and face when she fell off her hospital bed last night, hours before she was to be discharged.        
	Niva Saha, a retired school headmistress, was given 17 stitches on the head, lips and nose.        
	Niva had been admitted to the Shaktinagar district hospital in Nadia, 90km from Calcutta, on Thursday after she complained of dehydration. She was supposed to go home this morning.        
	Her fall brought to light the lack of surveillance on patients at night. But doctors said Nivas family, too, would have to share the blame as they had flouted hospital rules by hiring a private attendant.        
	The patients family kept us in the dark about the private attendant. Of course, the nurses on duty, too, are guilty of negligence, a doctor said.        
	Nivas relatives said they wanted to ensure special care for her. My aunt is old and we thought it would be better to engage an attendant to look after her, said Bikash, her nephew.        
	The attendant had dozed off and Niva lay in a pool of blood for 20 minutes, after which the patient in the next bed screamed for help.         
	She bled profusely. She will take time to recover, a doctor attending to Niva said.        
	Her family has lodged a complaint with hospital superintendent Tapas Nandi.

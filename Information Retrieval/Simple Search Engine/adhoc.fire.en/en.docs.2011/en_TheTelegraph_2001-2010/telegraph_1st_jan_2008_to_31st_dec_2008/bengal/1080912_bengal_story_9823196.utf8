	Parota (Birbhum), Sept. 11: A suspect in the Nobel medal heist case was found murdered this morning in Birbhum.         
	Sunil Bagdi alias Jibon was arrested on March 30, 2004, five days after Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal was found missing from the campus. But he was released after the CBI found no conclusive proof against him.         
	In 2007, the agency closed the case.        
	Today, the 45-year-old fish seller was found lying next to his bicycle with his throat slashed. There were injury marks on his neck and head. Residents of Parota village in Nanoor, over 230km from Calcutta, called police. The body was sent for post-mortem.         
	A CBI official said: The case is being reviewed. We are checking for any connection the murder may have with the case.        
	Bagdis widow Sabitri told the police he had found two crude bombs near their house on September 6 and lodged a police complaint. But he withdrew the case the next day saying an understanding had been reached with those who had tried to kill him.         
	Sabitri named Congress leader Moni Mondal before the police, saying he may have had had something to do with this. She said Bagdi and Mondal had a quarrel a few days ago.

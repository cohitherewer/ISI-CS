	Margram (Birbhum), Jan. 16: Sadai Mal had only one thought on his mind as he handed over 21 chickens to the bird flu babus mdash; what to feed his wife and three children from tomorrow.
 
	The 38-year-old used to make around Rs 2,000 a month selling eggs, but now the rapid response team of the animal resources department has taken them away.
 
	These chickens were my sole source of income. From tomorrow, I will have to work in others fields as a day-labourer, said the resident of Bamdebpur village in Rampurhat.
 
	He isnt the only one staring at an uncertain future.
 
	Nearly 20,000 families in five blocks have been affected by the outbreak in Birbhum. Over 35,500 birds have died and over 3.5 lakh will be culled.
 
	Its like seeing your assets, built over years, being destroyed in front of your eyes, said Dhiren Mal of Sherpur. All 40 chickens he had have died.
 
	This was one of the reasons why many villagers didnt turn up today to hand over live poultry to the rapid response team mdash; or the bird flu babus as they have named the animal resources department officers.
 
	The main reason, however, was the loss of livelihood.
 
	We were told by block officials to ask villagers to hand over their live birds, said Salamat Sheikh, a member of the village council in Bishnupur. We told each villager to do so but very few turned up.
 
	Its not difficult to understand why. In most of the 100-odd villages in the five Birbhum blocks, 90 per cent of the residents run poultry farms in their houses. Selling eggs and meat account for 80 per cent of the family income. 
 
	Organised poultry farms are also getting hit. For three months I will not be able to sell chicken. I dont have any alternative income, said Jainal Sheikh of Bishnupur.
 
	The future of his four employees is also uncertain. It will be difficult to find another job now, said Nalu Sheikh, a 17-year old who earned Rs 500 a month. 
 
	Officials said there were no plans to rehabilitate unorganised poultry traders. 
 
	We are giving compensation for each bird if the villa- gers hand them over voluntarily. But we have not got any directive about providing alternative jobs, said the animal resources department director. 
 
	Nikhil Chatterjee, the man in charge of animal resources development in the Birbhum zilla parishad, said: Well request the government to provide compensation for chickens that have died.

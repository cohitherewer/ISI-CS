	Calcutta, Dec. 21: The Congress legislature party has asked the high command what it should do with MLAs Somen Mitra and Sudip Bandpadhyay, who have broken away to join forces with Mamata Banerjee.        
	While Mitra has floated his party and promised an alliance with Mamata, Sudip has joined her Trinamul Congress.         
	They have embarrassed the other Congress MLAs. I have sought the AICCs views on how to deal with them, said Manas Bhuniya, the Congress legislature party (CLP) leader. They cannot continue as CLP members, he added. The Congress has 19 other MLAs.        
	The Assembly speaker said he would take a decision on the two after Bhuniya formally told him that they were no more in the Congress.

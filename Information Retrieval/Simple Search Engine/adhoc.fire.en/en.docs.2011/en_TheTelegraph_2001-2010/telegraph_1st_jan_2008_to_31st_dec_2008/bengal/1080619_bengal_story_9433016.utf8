          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 18: Large swathes of Bengal reeled under power cuts today as none of the six units of the Kolaghat plant that collapsed yesterday after flooding in its basement switchyard could be re-started.        
	Power development corporation managing director S. Mahapatra said: We are trying to bring at least three units back in operation by tomorrow morning.        
	He had yesterday said engineers hoped to get two units running by last night.        
	The absence of around 1200MW generated in Kolaghat led to a nearly 650MW deficit in the districts. The shortfall in the city was 151MW, unlike yesterday, when the rain had brought down demand drastically.         
	Power cuts will continue to plague the state until at least four Kolaghat units are revived, an official said.         
	Flood toll nine        
	Floods in East Midnapore, where Kolaghat is located, and West Midnapore have claimed nine lives, the government said. It has sanctioned Rs 2.5 crore for relief and called in the army.

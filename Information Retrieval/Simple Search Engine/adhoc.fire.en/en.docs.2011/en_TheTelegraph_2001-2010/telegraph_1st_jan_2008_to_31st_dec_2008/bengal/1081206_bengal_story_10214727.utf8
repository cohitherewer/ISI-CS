The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Pay hike for state staff
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Pay hike for state staff
  - Raise from April could be 30 per cent: Asim        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 5: The fifth pay commissions report will be ready in two months and the raise it recommends for state government employees will be implemented from April 2009, finance minister Asim Dasgupta told the Assembly today.        
	We decided to set up the fifth pay commission in September. It was given six months to make its recommendations. However, the panel will send its report a month earlier, in February. So the government has decided to implement the pay hike for government employees from April 1, 2009. Well implement whatever the panel recommends, he said.        
	Asked what sort of hike could be expected, Dasgupta said: I have been hearing of late that there is a possibility of a 30 per cent increase in gross salaries. But I can assure you that if the pay panel recommends a hike of over 30 per cent, we will implement that.        
	The last pay revision was in 1998, when salaries went up by up to 39 per cent, Dasgupta said.         
	The hike would benefit 10 lakh state government employees and 4.3 lakh pensioners. Schoolteachers and non-teaching staff of schools and municipal and panchayat employees will also benefit.        
	A finance department official said the government was rushing with the pay hike because the Lok Sabha polls are round the corner. Last time, the commission took nearly two years to prepare the re- port. This year, the report is expected in five months. That shows the governments bid to keep employees happy before the elections.         
	The minister did not say whether the hike would have retrospective effect, as it had the last time. In 1998, the increase was with effect from January 1996. However, I cannot say whether it will happen this time as it will depend on the panel, Dasgupta said.        
	Higher generation of value-added tax will apparently help the government arrange for the additional funds. Before the introduction of VAT in 2005-06, our sales tax revenue had been growing at 9.6 per cent annually. In the past three years, the increase has been 19.6 per cent. This year, we expect VAT revenue to rise by more than 24 per cent. Therefore, making budgetary provisions to bear the salary hike will not be a problem for the government, Dasgupta told the House.        
	However, the minister also said the Centre should bear at least 50 per cent of the additional expenditure. We have told the 13th Finance Commission that the Union government should provide us with 50 per cent of the additional money we will have to spend to implement the panels report. This is vital for smooth Centre-state relations, said Dasgupta.

	The text of governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis letter to Mamata Banerjee, dated August 29               
	Dear Smt. Mamata Banerjee,        
	Our neighbouring State of Bihar is reeling under one of the worst natural disasters in recent memory. The probability of our own stretches of the Ganga becoming vulnerable to flooding are not to be ruled out.         
	At such a time of challenge political contestations in our State must take pause.         
	The darkening clouds of floods apart, the debate on the acquisition of sites for the small car factory at Singur and the tension on the dharna spot have already drawn heavily on our energies. They can, I am afraid, take an even more exacting price. I compliment you on your desire to keep the dharna peaceful but I do not know if in the complexities of the ground situation, non-violence can prevail.         
	You and others of your view have been unswerving on the demand that the acquired lands of owners unwilling to part with them, be returned. The House of Tata and the State Government have held their position.         
	I believe the time has now come for all of us to consider the social costs of these respective positions, as different from investment costs and political implications.         
	I had, through Shri Partha Chatterjee, suggested that a person with no political or industrial affiliations, be invited to act as an unbiased intermediator in the matter. He or she can go into the demand articulated by you and give carefully thought-out findings for the earnest consideration of all sides. If this thought is acceptable to you, please suggest a name or names. I would request the State Government to respond positively.         
	The grace of accommodation is not unavailable in the most obdurate of situations. Its value becomes inestimable when it comes before rather than after the situations have deepened into irremediable crises in which the weak and the voiceless suffer the most.        
	If my suggestion is acted upon, I could urge that the status quo on the sites belonging to the owners unwilling to part with them be maintained, even as you give pause to the agitation, until the intermediators recommendation becomes available and, hopefully, leads to a solution.         
	I am marking copy of this to the Honble Chief Minister. If you wish, you could share my suggestion with the media.        
	With regards,        
	Yours sincerely,        
	Gopalkrishna Gandhi

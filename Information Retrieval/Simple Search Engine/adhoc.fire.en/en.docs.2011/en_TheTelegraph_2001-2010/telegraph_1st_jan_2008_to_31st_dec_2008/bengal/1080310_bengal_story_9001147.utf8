	Alipurduar, March 9: Girl trouble has clai-med a makna (male elephant without tusks) in the Buxa tiger reserve.    
	A tusker chased its rival in love to a field of yam last night and killed it after a two-hour fight in front of villagers and forest officials. A tusker will never tolerate another elephant showering affection on its girl, the reserve director said.        
	Santiniketan: A former Visva-Bharati student slapped a lecturer this morning when he objected to the young mans smoking in the corridor of the varsity hospital. Physics teacher Swapan Kumar Mondal lodged a complaint with the university. We will lodge a police complaint, said the registrar.        
	Chinsurah: The body of a nine-year-old who went missing from her home in Hooghly on Friday was found floating in a pond. Residents of Jangipara, 30km from Calcutta, alleged that she was raped and killed.        
	Midnapore: CPM youth wing leader Buddha- deb Pathak, 22, was shot dead by suspected Maoists in Lalgarh, West Midnapore, on Sunday night.

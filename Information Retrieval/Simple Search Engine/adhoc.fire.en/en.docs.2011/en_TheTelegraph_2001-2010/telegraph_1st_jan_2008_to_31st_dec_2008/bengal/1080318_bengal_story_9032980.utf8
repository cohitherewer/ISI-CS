	Calcutta, March 17: A 40-year-old chartered accountant committed suicide today by gulping down pesticide.        
	Joydeep Bhattacharyas body was found in his flat in the Saptaparni complex on Ballygunge Circular Road.         
	Police said Bhattacharya, who lived with his father and brother, had been depressed since his wife and child left him two months ago.        
	We found him on the floor, foaming at the mouth. We have sent the body for post-mortem, an officer said.

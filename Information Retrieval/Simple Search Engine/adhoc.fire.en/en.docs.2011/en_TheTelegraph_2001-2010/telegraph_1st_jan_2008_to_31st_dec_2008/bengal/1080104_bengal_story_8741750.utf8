	Nandigram, Jan. 3: Mamata Banerjee today kept the Nandigram pot boiling on the land wars first anniversary today. 
    
	The Trinamul Congress chief cautioned villagers against trusting the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments assurance that land would not be acquired in Nandigram for a chemical hub. 
    
	She urged the people to keep up their vigil, saying there could be an attempt to grab land once the May panchayat polls were over.
    
	Mamata was addressing a rally in Garchakraberia, where the seeds of the land war had been sown a year ago. A mob had ransacked the gram panchayat office and torched a police jeep on January 3 last year to protest the Haldia Development Authoritys notice about land acquisition for a chemical hub.
    
	Dont forget that this government is eyeing your land and will take it away on one pretext or the other either for the Salims, Tatas or the Birlas, Mamata said, referring to the meeting the chief minister held yesterday to speed up the Salim Group projects.
    
	Sisir Adhikary, the Trinamul MLA from Egra, echoed his leader.
    
	Dont be fooled by the chief ministers assurance that no land would be acquired in Nandigram. The government and the CPM are waiting for the panchayat polls. After that, they will not only grab land in Nandigram but also in Mahishadal and other areas of East Midnapore. We will not allow them to do so, he said.
    
	Buoyed by the Balagarh bypolls, in which the CPM saw a sharp drop in its vote share, Mamata hurled a poser at the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee members who were once Left supporters.
    
	Will you forgive the CPM and the CPI and vote for them again?
    
	The crowd roared back a no. 
    
	Balagarh has shown the way. Now its your turn to stay united and fight the CPM to the finish, the Trinamul chief said.

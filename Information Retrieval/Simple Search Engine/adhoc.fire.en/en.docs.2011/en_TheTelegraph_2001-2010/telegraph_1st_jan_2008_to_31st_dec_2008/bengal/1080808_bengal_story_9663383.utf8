	Calcutta, Aug. 7: Biman Bose said a governor was supposed to play an impartial role, referring to Gopalkrishna Gandhis silence on the murders of two CPM members since yesterday. The governor had earlier expressed concern when Trinamul Congress men were killed. Now if he chooses to keep silent on the other side, it is up to him, he added.

	Hazampara (Birbhum), Jan. 19: For residents of this small village, words like bird flu and H5N1 virus mean nothing.
    
	None of the villagers in this virus-hit zone knows what the deadly avian influenza is all about. And strangely, even the administration doesnt seem keen on enlightening them.
    
	For the last few days, all we have been hearing are announcements from moving vehicles asking us to keep affected poultry isolated and hand them over to authorities when they visit, said Mohammed Safiulla, a diploma holder in mechanical engineering and among the few who have studied beyond Class X in Hazampara.
    
	All of us here want to know about this disease but theres no one who has taken the pains (to tell us) so far.
    
	Hasibha Khatun, a primary-school teacher, said they turned to the local administration for help after chickens started dying.
    
	Initially, the animal resource department passed it off as just another infection that would soon pass. Later, it realised the gravity of the situation. But even then, no one explained that this was something new in Bengal.
    
	Even a graduate in this area, he added, wont be able to tell you anything about bird flu.
    
	Mohammed Golam Zakaria, another resident of Hazampara, said because of the lack of knowledge about the virus, many villagers had at first packed off their poultry to relatives places or sold them off secretly.
    
	Earlier, when we tried to attract the attention of the authorities, no one bothered. Now funds have arrived and there is a lot of activity. But we still dont know what kind of infection the birds can transmit to us.
    
	State animal resource minister Anisur Rahman said song and dance programmes would be held in the affected areas soon to educate the villagers on the risks involved while handling sick birds. 
    
	But what is the infection? the villagers ask.

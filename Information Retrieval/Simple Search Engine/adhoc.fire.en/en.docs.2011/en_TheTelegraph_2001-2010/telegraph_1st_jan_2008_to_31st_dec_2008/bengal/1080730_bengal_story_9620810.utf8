                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Quit fallout on Speakers mind 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 29: Somnath Chatterjee is not averse to stepping down as Speaker after August 11 but he is worried about its fallout on the UPA government, according to those who called on him.        
	Chatterjee declined to speak to the media before leaving for Delhi this evening, but he apparently spoke of his worry to visitors at Raj Bhavan today. Neither did he conceal his anguish over his summary expulsion from the CPM.        
	Denying the CPMs charge that he had agreed to resign but went back on his word, Chatterjee made it clear that he would not appeal to the party to take him back or join any other party.         
	I would prefer leaving politics and spending my twilight years in social service in Santiniketan, he told another expelled CPM leader, Saifuddin Chowdhury.         
	Chowdhury and Samir Putatunda, also an expelled leader, found him worried about whether the Lok Sabha would be dissolved before its term.        
	According to them, Chatterjee may not like to continue as Speaker because that might prompt the CPM to launch a campaign dubbing him power hungry. Chatterjee had earlier insisted on meeting his parliamentary obligations till August 11.        
	The Congress and its allies want him to continue and the BJP has not objected to it.        
	However, if he resigns, there is a feeling that the UPA may consider dissolving the House and seeking polls, especially since the election of a new Speaker will mean a fresh trial of strength.         
	Chatterjee has already been informed of the governments intention to defer the monsoon session, scheduled to resume on August 11, by a few weeks.         
	Chatterjee told his two visitors today that he would like to spell out his decision after returning from Kuala Lumpur on the night of August 9.

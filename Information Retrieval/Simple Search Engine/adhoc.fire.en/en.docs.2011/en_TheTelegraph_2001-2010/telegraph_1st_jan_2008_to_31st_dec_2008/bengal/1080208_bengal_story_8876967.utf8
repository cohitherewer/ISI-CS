The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Coal belt cave-in
                                                                                                            Coal belt cave-in
                            
	Durgapur Feb. 7: A patch of land in the Ranigunj coal belt caved in today and smoke started billowing from the cracks, about 15 meters from Nimcha village.         
	The 100sqft stretch went in with a rumble around 7.30am and villagers, thinking it was an earthquake, ran out of their homes. Nimcha had felt yesterdays tremors.         
	The smoke also brought back memories of last months fire in an abandoned mine in neighbouring Jamuria that had raged for four days.        
	Eastern Coalfields Limited officials have started filling up the cracks with sand and mud. They have also cordoned off the area.

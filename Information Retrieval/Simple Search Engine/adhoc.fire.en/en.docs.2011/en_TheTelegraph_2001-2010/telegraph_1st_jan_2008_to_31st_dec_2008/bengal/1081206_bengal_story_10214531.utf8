                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Delhi nod to Andal airport city
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 5: The Centre has given its final approval to the proposed airport city project at Andal in Burdwan.        
	The steering committee on greenfield airports headed by the civil aviation secre-tary has accepted the tech-no-economic feasibility study submitted by the project promoter. The letter of approval is expected next week.        
	Bengal Aerotropolis Project Ltd, the promoter company, will take about two years to operationalise the airport after the land is acquired.         
	The onus is now going to be on the Bengal government to settle issues with Coal India, which has objected to the project saying the land has substantial coal reserves.        
	Several local panchayats have pledged support to the airport city, but the Trinamul Congress remains non-committal. We are yet to see their package. Our state leaders will take a decision, said Prabhat Chatterjee, the partys Burdwan secretary.         
	Aerotropolis is set to come up on 3,500 acres. In the first phase, the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation has to hand over 2,300 acres.         
	The Rs 10,000-crore project will have an airport equipped to handle Boeing 737-800 and Airbus 320-200 planes. Changi Airport of Singapore will be the operator. A city that will include IT and industry clusters will be developed around the airport.        
	A state government source said : Now that Delhi has approved it, the state can move with confidence.        
	The promoters plan to give a cottah for every one bigha (20 cottahs) acquired in addition to the cash compensation.

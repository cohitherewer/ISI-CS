                                                                                                               Bullets break Nandi lull
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, March 2: Violence reared its head again in Nandigram today, leaving a 32-year-old man seriously injured.         
	Debashis Mondal, a Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee supporter, was shot in the abdomen and left thigh by CPM workers, police said.        
	This is the first time bullets have been fired in Nandigram since last Novembers CPM recapture.         
	The incident comes two days before chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees visit to distribute patta to landless farmers.         
	Around 1 this afternoon, armed CPM activists went around Brindabanchowk village warning residents against supporting the Pratirodh Committee, the police said.        
	When they spotted Paritosh Das, a 22-year-old Pratirodh Committee supporter, they caught him and beat him up. As the news spread, about 500 Pratirodh Committee supporters from neighbouring Keyakhali rushed in with sticks. Seeing the mob, the CPM men turned back towards Satengabari, an officer of Nandigram police station said.        
	To reach Satengabari, the CPM activists had to cross Keyakhali, where a Pratirodh Committee crowd was waiting.        
	Some of the CPM activists whipped out revolvers and pipe guns and began shooting as they made a dash towards Satengabari. Two bullets hit Debashis Mondal, the officer said.        
	He was taken to the Nandigram block hospital from where he was referred to Calcuttas SSKM Hospital.        
	The Pratirodh Committee has called a 24-hour bandh in Nandigram tomorrow.        
	Trouble had been brewing in the land war zone since February 19, when two CRPF camps at Khodambari High School had to be wound up after the jawans were shifted to Orissa to fight Maoists.        
	Patrolling, too, has become infrequent following a cut in the CRPFs allotment of vehicles and fuel, East Midnapore superintendent of police S.S. Panda said.        
	 The Congress is milking the Nandigram row as it vies for Opposition space in the run-up to the panchayat polls.         
	State Congress chief Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today said he would visit Nandigram on March 14, the anniversary of the police firing.

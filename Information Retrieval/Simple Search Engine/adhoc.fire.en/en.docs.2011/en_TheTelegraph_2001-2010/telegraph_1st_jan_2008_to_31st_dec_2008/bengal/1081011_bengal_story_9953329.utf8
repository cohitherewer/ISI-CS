                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CPM finally disagrees with the Tatas
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, Oct. 10: The CPM has criticised the Tatas for the first time since the company took the Nano project out of Bengal, saying like Mamata Banerjee, it had a right to be unreasonable.        
	Adequate protection was provided (in Singur) and the state government was discharging its responsibilities towards the maintenance of law and order, an editorial in the forthcoming issue of Peoples Democracy says. The Tatas, however, took a stand that unless everybody co-operates, they are not going to remain in Singur. One can surely disagree with such a position.        
	According to the editorial titled Defeat these anti-people policies, the Tatas had been unduly worried. After all, no one can say they shall build their house in a locality only when all others living there will give an assurance that their house will not be burgled.        
	With a touch of sarcasm, it adds: However, like Mamata Banerjee, the Tatas also have an equal right to take an unreasonable position.        
	The editorial also accuses Mamata of facilitating the relocation of the plant to Narendra Modis Gujarat.        
	Remember, she continued to remain with the NDA and, thus, in a way endorsed the communal carnage unleashed in the state by BJPs Narendra Modi government, it says.         
	Mamata Banerjee has not merely ensured the exit of the Nano project from Bengal but being the loyal steadfast ally of the BJP in the NDA, she facilitated the projects relocation to Gujarat.        
	The editorial blames Mamatas Trinamul Congress for putting the future of thousands in jeopardy. It says the party, with the mere support of less than 10 per cent of the owners of the acquired land, who have not taken the compensation cheques, adversely affected the future prosperity and improved livelihood for a large number of people in the area.        
	The article rounds off with a suggestion to prevent a rerun of Singur. The politics that led to the relocation of the Nano project from Bengal also needs to be relocated elsewhere in the interests of greater prosperity of Bengal and its people.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 5: Calcutta High Court today ordered police to post pickets at three Reliance Fresh outlets if Keventer felt they were needed.        
	Keventer Fresh, which sells imported fruits in three Reliance Fresh stores in and around Calcutta, moved court fearing trouble.        
	In response, Justice Nadira Patherya directed the police to take action on the basis of the complaint. The court also told the police that a picket should be in place if Keventer Fresh felt it was necessary.        
	Debanjan Mandal, the counsel for Keventer Fresh, said: It is their (Keventers) fundamental right to continue business and... the obligation of the police to ensure fundamental rights are not infringed.        
	Two upcoming Reliance stores were vandalised last year, allegedly by Forward Bloc and Trinamul Congress activists, forcing the company to put off its Bengal launch.        
	Last week, the company opened stores in Budge Budge, Swabhumi and Rajarhat. Security was tightened in all three stores by this evening.         
	Yesterday, Naren Chatterjee, chairman of the Bloc-controlled state marketing board, had claimed that Keventers business was illegal.

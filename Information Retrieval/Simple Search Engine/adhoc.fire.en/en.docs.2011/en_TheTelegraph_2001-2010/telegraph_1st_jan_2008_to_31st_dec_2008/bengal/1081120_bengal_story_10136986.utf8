	Nov. 19: The government is mulling whether to call Dunlop owner Pawan Ruia or an official for talks with the labour minister to discuss the stalemate at the Sahagunj factory.        
	We are considering whether Ruia or some official can be asked to meet the labour minister, said Anadi Sahoo, the minister of state for labour.        
	Neither the workers representatives nor anyone from the management got in touch with labour minister Mrinal Banerjee today.        
	Dunlop suspended production indefinitely on Monday and said it could resume after the company arranged for a Rs 100-crore loan. It proposed to give Rs 2,000 a month to the workers till work started. The unions rejected the offer.

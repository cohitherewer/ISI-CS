                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Prasada slams police for casual security
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              Prasada, Paswan				                                 
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: Union minister Jitin Prasada added his voice to Ram Vilas Paswans criticism of the lax VIP security in Bengal a day after a blast by suspected Maoists hit their convoy.        
	Prasada, minister of state for steel, wrote to Union home minister Shivraj Patil today requesting him to take up the matter of VIP security with the state government and said Bengal police had adopted a casual approach.        
	It was reported wrong that the West Bengal chief ministers convoy was attacked. In fact, central ministers were targeted by Maoists and the state government has totally failed in providing adequate security to the central ministers, the letter said.        
	The vehicle that took the brunt of the blast was the lead pilot car. Prasada was in the same car as his boss, Union steel minister Paswan.        
	Prasadas letter said Bengals security agencies did not do their job properly in a Maoist-hit area. This shows the casual approach of the state police when it comes to security of Union ministers.        
	In Calcutta, asked about Prasadas allegations, home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said: It was an unfortunate but serious incident, particularly since the convoys of the chief minister and two central ministers were passing through that area. A high-level inquiry is being done and the moment lapses are detected and responsibility fixed, serious action will be taken.        
	State police chief A.B. Vohra said: I will clarify and explain what happened in my report to the chief minister.        
	Paswans Lok Janshakti Party today asked the Prime Minister to enhance their leaders security from Z to Z-plus. Paswan complained that though he had been attacked in the past by Naxalites, his security had been scaled down from Z-plus to Z.         
	My party members had warned of a possible attack but the SP (district police chief) and the district magistrate had no knowledge, Paswan said. The Prime Minister has promised to upgrade his security, sources said.        
	Report to Centre        
	The Bengal home secretary said he had sent a report to the Union home ministry on the blast today. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee confirmed that the Prime Minister and Union home minister had called him to discuss the blast.

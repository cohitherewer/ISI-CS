          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 25: NRI businessman Prasoon Mukherjee today said the Salim Group would take up pending projects or go for new ones only when there was a consensus on land availability.        
	Mukherjee, who has acted as a point man for the Indonesia-based company, and Salim managing director Benny Santoso met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings today.        
	We briefed the chief minister on our projects in Bengal. As for the Barasat-Raichak expressway project that has been put on hold by the government, our stand is that once a consensus is reached on the availability of land, and the moment we get clearance from the government, we will start work, Mukherjee said.        
	Santosso described the meeting as very cordial and fruitful. We told him (Bhattacharjee) we are still committed to our projects, he said.        
	Asked if he thought it was safe to invest in Bengal in the wake of the Singur trouble, Santosso said: Yes, I think so. But please dont ask me questions about somebody else.        
	Cyber crime        
	Nasscom today said a task force had been set up to train police officers in detecting and tackling cyber crime.

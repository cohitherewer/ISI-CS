	Calcutta, June 27: Congress leader Somen Mitra, whom Mamata Banerjee had dubbed the captain of the CPMs B team, called on her tonight for a meeting she said was a turning point while hinting at a possible reunion.        
	Mitra was the Bengal Congress president when Mamata was expelled from the party in August 1997.        
	Although we often talk to each other over the phone, this is the first time we have met in 11 years, Mitra said after the hour-long meeting at Nizam Palace.         
	Todays meeting marks a turning point in Bengal politics, a smiling Mamata said.         
	I must welcome Somenda if he wants to work with me by joining my secular democratic front. But he may have some problem as his party is running the government at the Centre with the CPMs backing, she added.        
	Mitra has not made up his mind on quitting the party. I havent decided anything, he said. But touring the districts after the panchayat polls, I have realised that people want us to float an anti-CPM platform to take on the ruling Left coa-lition. I believe only Mamata can lead such a platform.        
	Asked if the Priya Ranjan Das Munshi-led party had failed to live up to the peoples aspirations, Mitra avoided a direct answer. He said: In the rural polls, the people did not vote for us as heavily as they voted for Trinamul.         
	The meeting, he added, was my personal initiative.         
	However, sources close to Mitra said his quitting the party was a matter of time. Somenda will take a decision before the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee, known to be close to Das Munshi, said: If someone floats a platform without resigning from the party, he will definitely be expelled.        
	Mitra had to quit the state party chiefs post after the Congress won a lone seat and Mamatas Trinamul Congress bagged seven in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections. Mamata had once called him a watermelon  green (Congress) outside and red (CPM) inside.        
	Today, determined to get Mitra by her side, Mamata said: I dont think Somenda was behind my expulsion from the party. He was the Shikhandi (the eunuch Arjun used as a shield in the Mahabharat) for some Congress big guns.         
	A section in the Congress said Mitra had been sidelined since Das Munshi took over as party chief. He is not left with many options.         
	Somens Sealdah constituency will be abolished after the delimitation of Assembly constituencies. He is banking on Mamata for a ticket for ne- ighbouring Chowringhee, a Congress leader said.

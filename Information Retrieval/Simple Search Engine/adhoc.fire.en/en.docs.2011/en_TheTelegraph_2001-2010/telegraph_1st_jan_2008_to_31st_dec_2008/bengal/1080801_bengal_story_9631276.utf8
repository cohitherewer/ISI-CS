	Calcutta, July 31: Police in North 24-Parganas have arrested a Bangladeshi infiltrator today who was caught by BSF jawans in Basirhat last night.         
	The police found six SIM cards of different Bangladesh- based cellphone service providers and a map of Bangalore from the arrested person, who claimed he was Subhasish Deb from Chittagong.        
	Sleuths also found a fake ration card and a voters identity card on him.         
	On Tuesday, CID officials arrested Mohammad Mustaque and Nazrul alias Hasanuzzaman from Gopalnagar in Raghunathgunj area of Murshidabad on charges of providing shelter to Lashkar-e-Toiba militant Sikandar Azam for over a month.         
	Sikandar was arrested eight days ago in Jammu. His statement helped the police track down Mustaque and Nazrul.        
	The intelligence wing of the BSF got a tip off that Deb was staying in a guesthouse in Basirhat.         
	They raided it and picked him up, said Supratim Sarkar, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.        
	The police have also learned that Deb had purchased land in Barasat and had travelled to Mumbai.        
	He was remanded in police custody for 10 days.

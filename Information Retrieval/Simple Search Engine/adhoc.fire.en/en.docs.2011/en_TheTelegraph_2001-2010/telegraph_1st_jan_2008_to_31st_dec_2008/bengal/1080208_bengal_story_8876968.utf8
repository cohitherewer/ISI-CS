The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Nandigram quiz
                                                                                                            Nandigram quiz
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Feb. 7: The CBI, probing the March 14 Nandigram police firing, today questioned East Midnapore district magistrate Anup Agarwal and then superintendent of police G.A. Srinivas.        
	This is the first time such senior officials have been quizzed on the incident that left at least 14 people dead.        
	We interrogated the DM and the SP at Nizam Palace (in Calcutta). It is not possible for us to divulge anything more, CBI joint director Arun Kumar said.        
	The agency also summoned for the first time nearly a dozen front-ranking CPM leaders from Nandigram.        
	The sabhapati of Khejuri block I, Himangshu Das, and the zonal committee secretary of Khejuri block II, Bijon Roy, were among those questioned.        
	According to CBI sources, the move followed complaints from Nandigram villagers and a scrutiny of video clips showing the leaders were present at Bhangabera and Adhikarypara on the day of the firing.        
	The Trinamul Congress-led Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee had told the CBI that Das and Roy had marshalled outsiders into Nandigram on March 14.

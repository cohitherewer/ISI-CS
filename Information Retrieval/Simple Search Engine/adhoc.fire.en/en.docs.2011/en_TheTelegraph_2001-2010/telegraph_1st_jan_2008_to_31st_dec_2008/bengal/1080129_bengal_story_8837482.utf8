The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lover dead, fiancee in hospital 
                                                                                                            Lover dead, fiancee in hospital 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 28: A young man working for a telecom firm in the city was found dead in his rented flat. His fiancee, a woman from Assam, is fighting for life in hospital.        
	She is believed to have attempted suicide seeing Somen Das, 26, hanging in the flat on Ajanta Road in Santoshpur.         
	Police have found a note apparently left behind by Somen where he has blamed parents for disapproving of their relationship.        
	The man from Bankura had rented the flat a month ago. Supriya Gogoi, 25, (name changed) is studying for masters in social welfare in Vidyasagar University, Midnapore, through correspondence. Her father is an insurance company officer in Dibrugarh.        
	Additional superintendent D.P. Singh said: She used to stay with Somen whenever she came to Calcutta.         
	One of Somens neighbours told the police that the woman came to the flat early in the morning and entered using the duplicate key she kept with herself.         
	She slashed her throat, wrists and palms, an officer said.         
	A neighbour, Tamal Deb, said what they saw on entering the flat was horrific. There was blood everywhere in the flat and oozing from the womans wounds.         
	At Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, doctors said it was too early to comment on her condition.        
	The parents have been informed about the incident, the officer said.

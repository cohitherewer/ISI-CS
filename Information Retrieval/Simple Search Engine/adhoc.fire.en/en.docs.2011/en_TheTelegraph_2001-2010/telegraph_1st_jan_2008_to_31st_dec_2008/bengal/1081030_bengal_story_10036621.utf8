          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 29: A crocodile crept up behind a young woman fishing in the Sunderbans this morning and bit off a part of her ankle.         
	Forest officials said Bishnupriya Samanta, 28, a resident of Pathar Pratima in South 24-Parganas, 210km from Calcutta, had gone fishing with husband Kanai in Thakuran river around 8.30am.         
	The crocodile bit into Bishnupriyas ankle and tried to drag her into the river. Bishnupriya raised the alarm and her husband beat the crocodile with a bamboo stick. The crocodile then disappeared into the river, an official said.        
	The woman was first taken to a local health centre but had to be shifted to Calcuttas SSKM Hospital after her condition deteriorated.

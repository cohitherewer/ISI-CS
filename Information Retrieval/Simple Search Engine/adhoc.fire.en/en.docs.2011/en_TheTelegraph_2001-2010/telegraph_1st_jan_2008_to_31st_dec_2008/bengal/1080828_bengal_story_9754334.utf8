The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | An offer difficult to refuse: jobs for all
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   An offer difficult to refuse: jobs for all
          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 27: Job offers to all affected by the Singur land acquisition could be one way of addressing the issue, according to sources who were associated with similar controversies.        
	They felt that if jobs were guaranteed to those who lost their livelihood after their land was taken over for the Tata project, it would be difficult for the Opposition to keep turning its back on the governments efforts to end the stand-off.        
	The state may also consider bringing in all bargadars within the ambit of the job formula, suggested the sources who did not want to be named.        
	Day labourers who used to work on plots acquired for the plant could be offered jobs, too.        
	There is no data available on how many families could benefit from such a largesse. But since many investors like Jindal and Videocon have promised a job to each family that has given up land for their projects in the state, the same model could be followed here.        
	If the government takes up such a suggestion, its focus is likely to be on three categories  families that have lost all land, bargadars, and day labourers who used to work on the land acquired.        
	Migrating daily-wagers will not be part of the plan.        
	Those who have sold a part of their land  whose price has gone up from Rs 10 lakh an acre to Rs 45-50 lakh an acre in the past two years  will not be on the priority list. The state may not include absentee landlords in this deal at all.        
	If it wants, the government can ensure jobs at the Tata Motors mother plant and assembly units in the vendor park or in the economic activities the project generates in the region.        
	There is also a provision in the government rulebook, which says in case all landlosers cannot be accommodated at the mother plant or at the vendor park, they could be provided jobs in the government.        
	To make the offer click, the state has to ensure that the jobs will bring home more money than what the farmers used to make earlier, the sources said.        
	If the formula takes shape, landlosers stand to benefit twice: interest on the compensation and a job that pays more than tilling land.        
	The character of the small-car project would remain unchanged if the formula cuts ice with the Trinamul Congress.        
	According to latest data, 8,890 landowners and 237 registered bargadars have partially or fully given up land for the Nano project.        
	The state has acquired 997.11 acres for the project. Owners of 691.64 acres have been fully compensated.

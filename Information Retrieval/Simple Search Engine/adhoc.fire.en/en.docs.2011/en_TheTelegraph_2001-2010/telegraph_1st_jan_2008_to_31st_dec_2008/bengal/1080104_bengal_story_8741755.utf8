	Chinsurah, Jan 3: An athletes family allegedly beat up a footballer after he asked her to leave the field where he was coaching children. 
    
	Sheikh Sanjib, who has played for Mohammedan Sporting, lodged an FIR last night against 16 persons, including members of Mamoni Khatoons family.
    
	He said he was coaching a group of local children on a playground at Garbati in Hooghlys Chinsurah yesterday afternoon when Mamoni, his neighbour, landed up with another set of kids saying she wanted to train them there.
    
	When Sanjib asked her to leave, she threatened me that she would send her brothers to beat me up. That is exactly what she did, the footballer said in his FIR. 
    
	According to Sanjibs complaint, Mamonis father Momin Naskar, her four brothers and some criminals barged into his house last night and beat him up, said a police officer.
    
	They allegedly slashed the footballer with a razor. They also beat up his physically challenged sister and pushed his aged parents to the floor, Sanjib said in his complaint. 
    
	Sanjibs sister has been admitted to the Chandernagore subdivisional hospital.
    
	We have received an FIR from the footballer and registered a case. We had gone to arrest the accused but they are absconding, said Rajeev Mishra, the Hooghly superintendent of police.
    
	The SP said Mamonis house was locked.

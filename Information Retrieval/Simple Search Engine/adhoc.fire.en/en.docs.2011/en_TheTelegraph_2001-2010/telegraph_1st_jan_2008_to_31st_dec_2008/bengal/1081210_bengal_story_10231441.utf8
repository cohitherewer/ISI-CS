	Durgapur, Dec. 9: A herd of six elephants killed two men at Ranibandh in Bankura this afternoon.         
	People were chasing the elephants that had entered their village from a Purulia forest when Dilip Singh, 45, and Biswanath, 17, found themselves in the elephants path.         
	Police said the elephants hurled Dilip on the ground while Biswanath was crushed. Dilip died on the spot and Biswanath succumbed to his injuries in hospital.         
	The villagers said a herd of 22 elephants had entered Ranibandh, Ambikanagar and Rudra two days ago but forest officials did nothing.         
	An employee at the Ranibandh forest range said the herd was being pushed back when it suddenly changed route and entered the villages, triggering panic.

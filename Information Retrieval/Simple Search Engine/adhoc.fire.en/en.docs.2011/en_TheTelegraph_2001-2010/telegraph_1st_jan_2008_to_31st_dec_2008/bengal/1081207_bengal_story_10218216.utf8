          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Dec. 6: An anti-land acquisition activist was allegedly raped by CPM supporters in Nandigram on Friday.        
	The womans husband, a Trinamul Congress supporter, lodged a police complaint today accusing six local CPM workers of gangraping his wife in the presence of his 60-year-old mother.        
	Sahadeb Maity (name changed) alleged that the gang came to his house after most Trinamul men had fled the area following a series of CPM attacks. This was retaliation for a Trinamul bid to block the convoy of MP Lakshman Seth, who went to Nandigram to address a rally on Wednesday.         
	We were so scared that we ran away to Tekhali. My wife and mother were at home. Around 2am on Friday, six CPM workers tied up my mother and raped my wife, he said.        
	We have started a case of rape and sent the woman for tests, said East Midnapore police chief Ashok Prasad.         
	Rabindranath Maity, the head of the district hospital, said: She didnt have any external injury, but we wont make any further comment.         
	The CPM denied the partys involvement in the alleged incident. The allegations are baseless, said district secretariat member Ashok Guria.        
	Sahadeb said the alleged rapists had threatened his wife and mother against going to the police. The goons told them they would be killed if they spoke a word to anyone. So they did not venture out yesterday. My mother slipped out this morning and came to tell me about what happened.

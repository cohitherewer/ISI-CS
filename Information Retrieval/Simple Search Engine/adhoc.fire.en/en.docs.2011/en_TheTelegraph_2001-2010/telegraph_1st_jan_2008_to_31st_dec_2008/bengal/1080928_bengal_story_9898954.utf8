          A STAFF REPORTER                          Milan Molla leaves North Port police station on Saturday. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                        
	Calcutta, Sept. 27: Police have zeroed in on the officer who had threatened to brand Milan Molla a terrorist unless he paid up Rs 1.5 lakh after a freak blast in north Calcuttas Cossipore in August.        
	A senior IPS officer confirmed today that Milan and his mother Anwara Bibi had identified the sub-inspector of the Special Staff of Port Division (SSPD) as the main accused.         
	Police sources said the others involved would be tracked down within days and made part of an identification parade.        
	A top-level meeting took place at Lalbazar this morning after which Milan and the other victims of the bribery case were called to meet a senior officer at the North Port police station. They were assured of full co-operation and support in the case. The guilty officers would be suspended from service, the officer said.        
	Milan, who owns a tea stall and occasionally deals in scrap, had lost four members of his family in the blast.         
	Police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti ruled out any terrorist link to it within hours of the incident on August 3. But a group of policemen from the SSPD, which tracks criminal activities in the port area, set a trap for the illiterate Milan.         
	With her son in lock-up and not many to help, Anwara Bibi borrowed Rs 35,000 and paid the first instalment of the bribe to an officer.        
	Milan was today asked to bring to Lalbazar his mother and all those who had contributed to his bribe fund  father-in-law Ayub Ali, a relative, Musha Ali, and a local trader. They met assistant commissioner, port division, S. Das.        
	The officer spoke to us for over an hour and our statements were recorded. We have already identified one of the policemen. They have noted all details and promised us prompt justice, Milan said, outside the North Port police station.        
	The Telegraph reported Milans plight today.        
	His cousins Ramzan and Shaqib were trying to break open a discarded shell they had brought home from the banks of the Hooghly when the blast occurred. Milans younger brother Deedar and granduncle Hasan were the other two killed.        
	The bribe trap that followed remained under wraps until a fortnight ago, when CPM leader Mohammad Salim visited Cossipore and some residents told him about Milans ordeal.         
	After the MP called the police commissioner, two officers of the SSPD went to Milans shanty and offered to return the money if he withdrew his complaint. Milan and his mother refused.        
	I hope all those involved in our torture are adequately punished, Anwara said today.        
	I have told the officers, though, that I do fear conse- quences of pursuing such a complaint against policemen. We are people of modest means and easy prey, she added.        
	Asked if any senior officer was involved, additional commissioner Shivaji Ghosh, the investigating officer, said: I cannot divulge that right now. But once proven, the guilty will be severely punished and exemplary action would be taken.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 6: Dhoot Developers Pvt Ltd has tied up with Columbia Asia to set up seven hospitals in the east, three of them in Calcutta.        
	Each hospital will have around 200 beds and entail an investment of Rs 40 crore. The charges will start from as low as Rs 1,200 a day, said Pawan Dhoot, managing director of the Calcutta-based company.        
	Columbia Asia specialises in healthcare has set up several speciality hospitals across the continent. It has tied up with DLF for establishing a presence in India, but for its hospital project, it has chosen Dhoot Developers as its partners.        
	The other cities where the hospitals will come up include Ranchi, Bhubaneswar and Guwahati.        
	If a patient does not get proper treatment at a particular Columbia Asia hospital, he or she can be easily transferred to any other hospital in the country and, if required, to an overseas facility, Dhoot said.

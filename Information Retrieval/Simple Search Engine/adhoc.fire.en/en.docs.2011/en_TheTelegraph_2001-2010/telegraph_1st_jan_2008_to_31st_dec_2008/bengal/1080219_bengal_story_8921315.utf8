	Durgapur, Feb. 18: Unemployed CPM supporters marched into a party office here, dragged out their leaders and beat them with broomsticks and sandals because they had reneged on their promise of jobs.        
	After a round of thrashing, local committee members Badal Ghosh and Naren Ghosh and two other leaders  Gour Bauri and Nemai Bauri  started running. The Bauris fled but the Ghoshes were chased and locked up in a grocery. Police rescued them later.        
	Thirty youths armed with red flags marched into the party office in the Coke Oven area around 9am. Villagers said the leaders of the Namo Sagarbhanga local committee initially denied promising jobs but went on the defensive later.         
	The youths ransacked the office and battered two motorcycles parked outside.         
	They said the leaders had promised them unskilled labourers jobs at local sponge iron and steel units when they were being set up.         
	Sanatan Bauri, 28, who had studied till Class VIII, said all the attackers were CPM supporters. We work hard during polls and other occasions. We had no option but to revolt.         
	He added that complaints to the Durgapur zonal committee had proved ineffective.        
	Zonal secretary Sukhen Sarkar promised an inquiry. Ive sought a report from the local committee secretary, he said.        
	The leaders have a good time over alcohol and films in office. Their relatives get the jobs, said Ranjit Mondal, 25.

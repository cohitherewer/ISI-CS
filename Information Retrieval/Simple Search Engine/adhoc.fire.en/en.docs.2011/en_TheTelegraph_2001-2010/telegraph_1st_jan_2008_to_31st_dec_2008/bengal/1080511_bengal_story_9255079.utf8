	Calcutta, May 10: A squall with wind speeds touching 81km an hour hit the city tonight, bringing some much-needed relief and trouble.    
	The temperature dropped seven degrees because of the rain, between 9.42pm and 11pm. But the wind, which blew for a minute, uprooted several trees. Traffic was disrupted on EM Bypass, Vivekananda Road and Strand Road. Parts of central Calcutta were waterlogged.         
	Calcutta: Four men who allegedly specialised in stealing phones from bus passengers have been held. A police raid on a hideout off Park Street led to the arrests.         
	Calcutta: Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya on Saturday asked the Bharat Sevashram Sangha not to fill a pond adjoining the ashram on Cornfield Road. Local residents had accused the Sangha of trying to fill up the water body. A portion of the pond has indeed been filled up, Bhattacharyya said.         
	Calcutta: Heads of ICSE and ISC schools discussed on Saturday ways to create awareness about changes in math syllabi. The changes were brought about to make them similar to those followed by tests like the IIT-JEE and WBJEE.

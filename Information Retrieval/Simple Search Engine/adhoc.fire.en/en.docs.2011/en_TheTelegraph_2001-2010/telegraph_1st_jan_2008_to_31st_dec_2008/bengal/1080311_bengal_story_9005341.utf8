	Chinsurah, March 10: Thirty-three corrected Madhyamik geography answer scripts were found lying by a road in Hooghlys Haripal this evening.        
	Local resident Tushar Singha Ray first spotted the bundle, wrapped in a polythene bag. He opened it, saw the papers and called police.         
	Swapan Sarkar, the secretary of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, confirmed that the papers were this years. He promised necessary action against the examiner who was given the scripts for correction.        
	The Madhyamik geography examination was held in the last week of February.        
	A preliminary probe has revealed that the bag containing the scripts had fallen on the roadside, 60km from Calcutta, while the teacher was taking them to his head-examiner on a motorcycle.        
	Forty-nine physical science answer scripts went missing from Surya Sen Street in Calcutta on Wednesday.         
	A retired teacher, an examiner, lost them while heading home to Taherpur in Nadia from the head examiners house in Howrah. A young man who claimed to be his former student and offered to help carry the papers allegedly fled with them.

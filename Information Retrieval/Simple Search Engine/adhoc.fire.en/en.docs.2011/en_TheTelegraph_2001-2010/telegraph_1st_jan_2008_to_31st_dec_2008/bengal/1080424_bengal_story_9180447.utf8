The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | SSKM rebuts rape claim
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   SSKM rebuts rape claim
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta/Nandigram, April 23: The woman from Nandigram who had accused CPM workers of raping her had not been sexually assaulted, an SSKM board said today.        
	The medical board formed to examine her gave the report ruling out rape. The report said she has suffered several injuries during a scuffle and after being beaten with sticks, medical superintendent Ashok Ghosh said.        
	The board also detected a cyst in her brain and suggested that she be referred to Bangur Institute of Neurology.        
	The boards report says the woman can be released because her condition does not require her to remain in hospital, Ghosh said.        
	Two of her relatives have been informed who will come and take her home, he added.        
	The 45-year-old woman had alleged that a group of CPM workers had raided her house and raped her on the night of April 18, a year after another suspected CPM gang had raped her.        
	Her husband was also allegedly beaten up. He was brought to SSKM along with her.         
	Mamata Banerjee, who came under attack from CPM supporters on her way to visit the womans family in Gokulnagar on Sunday, led a procession to her house today, dubbing the SSKM report false and fabricated.        
	Elaborate security arrangements had been made for the Trinamul Congress chief.        
	The woman has said she was raped. How can a woman lie about being raped? It is the CPM that has influenced SSKM authorities to suppress the original report and produce a fake one, she said.         
	Mamata then held a rally about 100 metres from the womans house.         
	Please try to be neutral and play a pro-active role in maintaining peace in Nandigram, the Trinamul leader urged the nearly 1,000-strong crowd.        
	Mamatas claim found an echo in writers, actors and social activists in Calcutta.         
	How come the doctors report confirms bruises in the lower part of her body but rules out rape? She told me and Aparna Sen that she was raped when we met her in hospital. The tearful account of the bleeding victim was enough for us to believe her, said stage personality Shaoli Mitra.         
	Human rights activist Sujato Bhadro pointed out that according to a Supreme Court ruling, a womans complaint of rape is enough to take cognisance of the crime.

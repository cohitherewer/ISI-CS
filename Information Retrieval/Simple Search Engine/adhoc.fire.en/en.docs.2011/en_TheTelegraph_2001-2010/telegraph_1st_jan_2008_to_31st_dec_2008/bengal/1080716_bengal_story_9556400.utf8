          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 15: A high court judge today asked an estranged couple to spend a night in a hotel room before taking a final decision on divorce.        
	Mousumi Chakraborty, 25, had walked out on husband Sandip, 32, eight months ago following a tiff over returning to her in-laws after the birth of their daughter Monalisa, now six months old.         
	Mousumi is now with her parents at Salanpur in Asansol. Sandip, a businessman, lives in Chinsurah, Hooghly.        
	The couple have to attend my court the next day after spending a night in a hotel in Calcutta. Any other order from this court will increase legal hazards and bitterness among the two, Justice Asim Banerjee said.        
	The court has sent many warring couples to neutral places for a reunion in the past four years. Thirty couples have been sent to neutral places so far and it has worked wonders, advocate Jayanta N. Chatterjee said.         
	Except one, all of them have patched up.        
	Mousumi had petitioned the high court in June, asking for a Chinsurah-to-Asansol shift of the case filed by Sandip seeking restoration of his married life.        
	But the high court today said: If the legal battle is allowed to continue, bitterness between the couple will increase. So let this court try to reunite them.

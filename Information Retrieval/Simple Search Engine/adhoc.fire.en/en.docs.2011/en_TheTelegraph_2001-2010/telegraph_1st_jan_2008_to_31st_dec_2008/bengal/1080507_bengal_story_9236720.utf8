	Darjeeling/Siliguri, May 6: Schools have declared a holiday, tea garden labourers are willing to work on Sunday instead of Wednesday and government employees in the hills have applied for casual leave.         
	The turnout at our Siliguri rally will be between 2.5 lakh and 3 lakh, claimed Binay Tamang, the media and publicity secretary of the Morcha.        
	Around 10,000 vehicles are expected to bring the Morcha supporters from the hills tomorrow. Several hundred were in Siliguri by this afternoon.         
	The ex-servicemen in our ranks will brief 1,500 volunteers, who are already in Siliguri, on traffic management. Another 1,500 volunteers are expected to reach the town early tomorrow, said Tamang.         
	The Morcha has recently revived the demand for a Gorkhaland state.         
	Bimal Gurung, the Morcha president, today faxed a memorandum on the statehood demand to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The chief minister had said in Calcutta on Sunday that the people of Darjeeling should submit a memorandum, stating their exact demands.

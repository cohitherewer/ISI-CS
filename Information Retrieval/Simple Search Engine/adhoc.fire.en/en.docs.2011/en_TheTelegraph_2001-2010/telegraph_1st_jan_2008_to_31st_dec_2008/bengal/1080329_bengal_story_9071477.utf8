          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Singur, March 28: A dumper driver was found with his head crushed at the Tata Motors project site this morning.         
	Rajkumar Biswakarma, 24, was from Andal, Burdwan. The cause of death and the possible motive, if it is a murder, are yet to be ascertained, said a police officer.         
	A murder case has been started nonetheless on the ba-sis of a complaint lodged by Rajkumars elder brother.        
	Some labourers found Rajkumar in a pool of blood around 6.30am and informed the officials supervising construction at the project site.         
	Hooghly police chief Rajiv Mishra said: Vinod Biswakarma alleged that his brother was murdered by his co-workers, but failed to explain why he suspected that.        
	Rajkumars fellow workers were questioned.        
	Since a boundary wall has been constructed around the project area and policemen keep watch, it is not possible for outsiders to enter the site, said a senior police officer.         
	The workmen said Rajkumar had worked till 2.30am.         
	Nandi clash        
	Three persons were injured in a clash between Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee and CPM supporters in Nandigram last night.         
	Police said both groups were trying to extend their base ahead of the Sunday election to the managing committee of the high school at nearby Rajaramchak.         
	The CPM has lost control of five schools in Nandigram since its November recapture of the area.

	Calcutta, Sept. 26: The new US consul-general in Calcutta wants Bengal, where the rule of law and respect for agreements are facing questions, to take a lesson from Rwanda.        
	Beth A. Payne, who was posted in the African nation earlier, said Rwanda was an example in how economies could adapt to best suit its people.        
	Rwanda was facing a challenging situation and is more densely populated perhaps than Bengal and India. Subsistence farmers comprised the majority. But it was not enough to minimise the violence and feed the millions so the country chose to move to agri-business, which has reaped great results. Premium coffee, tea and flower exports have made the country realise that subsistence farming was not enough to feed the millions, she said.        
	Among Paynes former postings are war-torn countries like Senegal, Rwanda and Afghanistan.         
	Speaking on problems in the state of her current posting, Payne said American investors were keeping a watch on how the Singur conflict was being handled.         
	Unfortunately, conflicts like the one we are seeing in Singur cause American investors to question whether Bengal can offer these essential elements  stability, transparency, rule of law and a respect for agreements and contracts. They worry that their workforce will not feel secure if there is a disagreement about contracts that are signed with government agencies.         
	The Bengal governments perceived inability to ensure smooth work at the Nano project in Singur has put its agreement with Tata Motors under strain.        
	However, Payne pointed out that Bengal had pluses like an educated and reliable workforce, low attrition, govern-ment leadership that supports a pro-business environment and a vibrant cosmopolitan city, which American investors were looking for when deciding to open new business.

          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, Aug. 30: A 26-year-old man was found dead in a central government housing complex on Ironside Road early this morning with injuries to the back of his head, elbows and hands.        
	Police said the preliminary post-mortem report suggests Arnab Das had fallen from a height but does not clarify if it was suicide or murder.        
	A general diary has been lodged and we will wait for the viscera report before deciding our course of action. Arnabs parents have not lodged a complaint yet, said an officer of Karaya police station.         
	The son of a Central Public Works Department engineer, Arnab was a resident of Biratis Ramkrishna Pally. He had been working as a consultant with a private company in south Calcutta since completing his BBA a few months ago.        
	Arnab was last seen drinking with some friends on the eighth-floor landing of one of the buildings in the complex.        
	The police said most of his friends left late at night while he sat alone, drinking.         
	A senior central government officer spotted his body this morning near a garbage vat. Arnab was rushed to a hospital in Dhakuria where doctors declared him dead.         
	He went out with his friends last evening. Around 10.30pm, he called up his mother from his cellphone to say he would not return home. This was not the first time Arnab was staying the night at a friends place, so his parents didnt worry, an officer said.         
	Arnabs phone is missing and the watch stopped at 2.10am. This was probably the time he fell. Primarily, it appears to be suicide. We have not found any suicide note, though, the officer said.

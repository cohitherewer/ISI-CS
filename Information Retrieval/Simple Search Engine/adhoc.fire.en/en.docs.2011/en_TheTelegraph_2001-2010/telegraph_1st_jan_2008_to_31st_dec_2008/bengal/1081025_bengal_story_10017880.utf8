          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 24: Calcutta Port Trust chairman Anup Chanda today said big ships would have no problem moving in and out of Haldia port with dredging under way, and that no crisis was expected.        
	We have three dredgers at Haldia and all of them have been pressed into service. Another two will come from Paradip and Vizag ports. We are also trying to hire two dredgers from abroad to de-silt the Hooghly, Chanda said after meeting chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen.        
	As of now, the entry and exit of big ships at Haldia port will not be a problem. We have also dispelled the state governments fears that Haldia could face a major crisis in the next two-three months, he added.        
	Later, speaking at the Merchants Chamber of Commerce, the CPT chairman said 10 dredgers would be put to use in Haldia by December.

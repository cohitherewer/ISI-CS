          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 24: The government will table an amendment bill in the next Assembly session to initiate penal action against mayors and councillors charged with corruption.        
	Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya told the Assembly today: We have decided to introduce a public disclosure law in the state. It will empower us to take action against the mayors and councillors if they are found guilty of misappropriation of funds.

     OUR CORRESPONDENT
               
	Krishnagar, Jan. 18: Two senior doctors have been showcaused in Nadia for announcing the outbreak of bird flu in the district before tests could confirm it. 
    
	The assistant chief medical officer of Tehatta, Swapan Haldar, and the superintendent of the Tehatta Subdivisional Hospital, Buddhadeb Mondal, had on Wednesday led a team of doctors and paramedics to six villages to alert people about the impact of bird flu.
    
	About 5,000 chickens have died in the six villages over the past week but what caused the deaths is still not known.
    
	The doctors told the villagers over loudspeakers: Finish off the chickens which are alive in your houses. Dont let children and aged people touch the chicken. Stop eating the birds at any cost. The chickens died because of bird flu.
    
	Nadia chief medical officer Mrinal Kanti Biswas said: This is not done. 
    
	Ive asked the doctors to explain why they decided to launch such a vigorous campaign on their own without informing the district health authorities or the administration.
    
	He added that it was the Centres job to declare the outbreak of bird flu after confirmatory tests. 
    
	A senior official of the district health department said the doctors were served notices yesterday and told to respond within three days. 
    
	All doctors of the district have now been told not to carry out any campaign on their own, said the officials. 
    
	Hospital superintendent Mondal said he was sorry for being overzealous. It was a mistake. I have apologised to the chief medical officer. We did not realise our campaign will attract such a sharp reaction. We only wanted to caution the villagers. 
    
	Haldar declined comment.

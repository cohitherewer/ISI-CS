The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Back from tiger jaws
                                                                                                               Back from tiger jaws
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, March 2: Whenever Gayatri Sardar shuts her eyes, the menacing yellow and black stripes flash across her mind.        
	A day after surviving a tiger attack in the Sunderbans, the 42-year-old (in picture by Aranya Sen) knows she is lucky to be alive.         
	Gayatri was brought to SSKM Hospital with severe injuries to her skull and neck.        
	The resident of Kultali, South 24-Parganas, was part of a group of seven villagers looking for crabs and shrimps in the forests, unaware that the core area is out of bounds.        
	Suddenly, I saw something moving in a bush and thought it could be a tiger. I let out a shriek but before I could warn the others, it pounced on me and I fainted in fright, she said. The tiger dragged her 10-15 yards into the forest.         
	The villagers joined my father and uncle to chase the tiger with sticks. It then let go of my mother and fled into the jungle, Gayatris elder son Prabhat said.         
	Doctors at SSKM described her condition as serious but stable.

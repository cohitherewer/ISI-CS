          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Aug. 21: The Congress today chanted Mamata Banerjees land slogan during a march in Singur, but the Save Farmland Committee made it clear that the party would have to give a written request to join their movement.        
	Abdul Mannan, a former Congress MLA from Chapdani in Hooghly who led a march to the Tata car factory, was seen embracing Trinamul youth leader Madan Mitra, overseeing the construction of tents for the indefinite dharna from Sunday. But Prabir Banerjee of the Trinamul-led Save Farmland Committee said the Congress would have to give us in writing expressing its desire to join us.        
	At a gathering in front of the plant main gate, Mannan said the Congress had collaborated with Mamata two years ago when she had first launched her protest against forcible land acquisition.         
	But later, we had to distance ourselves from her as those at the helm of affairs did not want our association with Trinamul Congress. But things have undergone a sea change since Priyada (Priya Ranjan Das Munshi) took over as state Congress chief. We are keen to collaborate with Mamata once again.         
	On August 10, Mannan had led about 50 supporters towards the car plant and planted a flag near it.         
	Today, around 3,000 Congress supporters squatted on the Durgapur Expressway for four hours.         
	Sources said Trinamul seemed reluctant to let the Congress ride piggyback on its land movement in Singur.         
	On the strength of the movement, Trinamul has won the recent panchayat polls. Besides, Mamata said she wanted the siege to be peaceful. She felt that in case the Congress gave it a violent turn, her party would be blamed.         
	In Calcutta, Congress spokesman Subrata Mukherjee said the party would not hold any event on Sunday  the first day of the Singur siege.

          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 1: The high court today declared 120 of the states 140 primary teachers training institutes illegal for running without certificates from the National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE).        
	A division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice P.C. Ghosh asked the institutions to refund within a month the money deposited by students in the current session. The certificates issued to the students by these institutions stand invalid.        
	The court, however, did not clear its stand on those who are already working as teachers after obtaining certificates from these institutions. The institutes admit over 100 students every year.         
	Around 16,350 students get admitted to these illegal institutions annually. So, in the past four years, over 65,000 people have obtained their certificates. Of them, 30,000 have got teachers jobs and they might lose them now, said lawyer Lalit Mahato, who had moved the PIL against the colleges on behalf of a Malda social worker.        
	In the ongoing session, over 16,000 students have been admitted to the 120 colleges.        
	Two years ago, the court had passed a similar order against 136 BEd institutes that had not obtained the NCTE approval. Following a state government plea, the Centre had promulgated an ordinance allowing the institutions to obtain NCTE certificates with retrospective effect by depositing a certain amount.        
	The state may follow the same path now. As the ordinance is still effective, the NCTE will have to allow these 142 institutions to obtain its certificates with retrospective effect, a senior state government lawyer said.        
	In 2002, the state had enacted the West Bengal Primary Education (Amendment) Act and allowed private institutions to run primary teachers training institutes with the state primary education boards approval.         
	In 2003, the Centre enacted the National Council for Teachers Education Act and made it mandatory for all teacher training schools to obtain its nod.         
	The high court today said: In case a state-enacted law is in conflict with a central law, the central law will prevail.

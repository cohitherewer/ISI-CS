          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Oct. 5: A group of Puja organisers locked 24 teachers in their school after they refused to pay Rs 51 each on Friday.        
	Residents of Berugram, Burdwan, broke the lock and let them out around two hours later, when it was well past six in the evening.         
	The club members came to my office around 3pm on Friday and said every teacher would have to give Rs 51. We told them there are two more pujas in the area and we will have to pay subscriptions to them also. We also said we had decided to pay Rs 600 to each committee. But they would not accept a paisa less, said Hasim Mullick, the headmaster of Dubrajhat High School.        
	A quarrel followed and the organisers of the Berugram Dakshinpara Sarbojonin Puja left the school in a huff.         
	At that time, there were no students in the school, which got over at 1.30pm  the Puja vacation began yesterday. Only the teachers and the headmaster had stayed back.        
	When we were leaving for home around 4pm, we realised the main gate was locked from outside, Mullick said.         
	We did not know what to do. We started yelling for help. Finally, some villagers came and rescued us.         
	The headmaster today lodged an FIR at Khandaghosh police station against the club members.         
	Piyush Kanti Pal, the officer-in-charge, said: I summoned some of its office-bearers. They admitted what they had done and apologised.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 11: The Trinamul Congress today complained to the state election commission that over 500 candidates could not file nominations for the panchayat polls because of the CPMs intimidation.        
	Our candidates were today threatened by CPM cadres in Jangipara and Arambagh of Hooghly and Jamuria and Pandaveswar of Burdwan, general secretary Mukul Roy said.        
	I want the commission to provide security to our candidates in the two districts.         
	Commission joint secretary Jayanta Dutta Gupta said the complaints  first since filing of nominations for next months polls began on Wednesday  had been registered. Weve asked the district magistrates, designated as district panchayat election officers, to look into them, he added.         
	The poll panel has also sought reports from 205 observers on intimidation.         
	We are determined to en-sure that all candidates can file their nominations for the polls, commission secretary S.N. Roychowdhury said.        
	The government had earlier made a similar promise.         
	In 2003, the Opposition had said over 30,000 candidates could not file nominations.        
	Thirteen Trinamul leaders from Nandigram block I filed their nominations today, belying expectations that they will fight as Independents under the Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee banner.        
	The RSP and the Forward Bloc accused the CPM of declaring the Left Fronts Nandigram candidates unilaterally.        
	School plea        
	The government today urged the poll panel not to occupy schools for a long stretch as that would hamper the academic session beginning on May 2. State-run schools will close for summer vacation in May-end.

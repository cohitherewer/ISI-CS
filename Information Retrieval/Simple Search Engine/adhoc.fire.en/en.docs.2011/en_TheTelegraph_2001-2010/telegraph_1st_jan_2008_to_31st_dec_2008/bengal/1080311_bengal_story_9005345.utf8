                                                                                                               Mamata bug
                            
	New Delhi, March 10: Mamata Banerjee today accused the Union government of tapping her phones.         
	Communications minister A. Raja promptly refuted the charge in the Lok Sabha.         
	The Trinamul Congress chief said it had become difficult for her to talk a single line on the phone and sought an inquiry. My land phones and mobile phones are being tapped, she alleged.        
	Speaker Somnath Chatterjee asked Raja if it was true and he said: Not at all.         
	Mamata was pacified after the Speaker told her to give her complaint in writing.

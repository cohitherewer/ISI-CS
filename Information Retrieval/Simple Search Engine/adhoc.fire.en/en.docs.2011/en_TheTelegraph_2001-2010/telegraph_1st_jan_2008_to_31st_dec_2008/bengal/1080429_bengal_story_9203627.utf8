          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta/New Delhi, April 28: The Congress president may have taken the CPM-led state government to task on a string of issues from Nandigram to price rise, but the CPM reacted with caution.        
	As the Congress president, its natural she would speak against the CPM, party general secretary Prakash Karat said after landing in Calcutta for the politburo meeting starting tomorrow.         
	State CPM secretary Biman Bose said: Sonia is a mature politician. But her advisers are misleading her by feeding her wrong information.        
	He added: She defended the Centre saying the UPA government had served the interest of the farmers. But the truth is that the agricultural crisis has reached its peak. She should have been told that Bengals farm growth stands at 4 per cent while the national average has come down to 2.        
	In Delhi, Sitaram Yechury reacted to Sonias support for the oppressed in Nandigram, saying: The Congress should explain how it was part of a grand alliance with the Trinamul Congress, Maoists and RSS-BJP elements in Nandigram.        
	Karat said: We have nothing to say about her being on the side of the Nandigram people or in front of them.        
	Referring to her attack on political violence, he said about 160 CPM cadres had been killed by political opponents since 2005. Who is doing this? We are the victims and are also being accused of perpetrating violence.         
	The Opposition, Yechury said, has to create a space for itself with alternative policies. What alternative has the Congress given to the people of Bengal?         
	On Sonias rap to the Bengal government over black marketeering, Karat said the states powers to act had been taken away with the dilution of the Essential Commodities Act. The act lost teeth under the NDA government, Karat said, adding that the UPAs failure to stop forward trading encouraged foodgrain hoarding.        
	In Parliament, Yechury termed the Prime Ministers remark at the Lefts attack on price rise  desist the temptation to politicise the misery of the people  callous and very insulting.        
	But despite the acrimony, Karat made it clear in Calcutta that the Left would not try to stall the finance bill in Parliament. We want the government to accept our demands on the price rise. But we havent linked it to the finance bill.

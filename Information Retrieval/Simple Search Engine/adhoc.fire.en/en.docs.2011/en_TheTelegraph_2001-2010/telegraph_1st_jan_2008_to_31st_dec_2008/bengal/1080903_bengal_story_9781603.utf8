          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 2: The Left Front partners today supported the position of the government and the CPM that the land acquired from unwilling farmers could not be returned to them.         
	The allies joined the CPM today in stressing sustainable economic rehabilitation packages, including jobs, additional compensation and pension for all those affected by the small-car project.         
	Their realistic stand came as a relief to the CPM and the government.         
	The Forward Bloc, RSP and the CPI had earlier criticised the CPM and the government on Singur and Nandigram. The Blocs Ashok Ghosh had even demanded that the Tata project shift from Singur.         
	Front chairman and CPM state secretary Biman Bose described governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis initiative to end the impasse as positive.         
	However, he parried questions on whether the front would like Gandhi as mediator and accept his proposal to maintain status quo on the disputed land until arbitrator gives his ruling.         
	We welcomed his move but didnt discuss whether he should play the role of mediator. Also, we didnt go into the details of his proposals, Bose said.         
	RSP sources said the party wanted the government to maintain status quo on the disputed land.         
	The three allies submitted their wish list for the rehabilitation of the unwilling farmers at the front meeting.         
	The lists would be forwarded to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

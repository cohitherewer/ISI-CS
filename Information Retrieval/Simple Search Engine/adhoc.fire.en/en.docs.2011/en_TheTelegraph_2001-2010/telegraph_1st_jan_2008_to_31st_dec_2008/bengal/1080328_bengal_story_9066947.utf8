                                                                                                               Third front
                            
	Calcutta, March 27: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the CPM party congress on March 29 would discuss threadbare the possibility of floating a third front.         
	While the BJP-led NDA had brought disaster for the country, the Congress-led coalition has miserably failed to improve the lot of the people. That is why we are looking for a viable alternative, the chief minister told a rally at Shahid Minar.

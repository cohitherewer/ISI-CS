	Chinsurah, Dec. 17: Two Dunlop managers were allegedly beaten up by members of the Intuc union at the Sahagunj factory this afternoon after being accused of trying to smuggle out machinery from the closed unit.        
	One of them is under observation in hospital.        
	According to an FIR lodged by the company, the officials were attacked while trying to intervene after the mob stopped a vehicle carrying diesel for a generator around 2.30pm.        
	The FIR said deputy manager S.L. Pande was beaten up by the mob led by Intuc executive member Sunil Malakar while trying to explain what the vehicle was meant for. Human resource manager Ashok Singh, who tried to pacify the mob, was the next target. The company described the assault on Singh, who has been hospitalised, as an attempt to murder.         
	Malakar denied the assault. He said the workers protested after seeing a truck carrying factory equipment.         
	Hooghly deputy superintendent of police Tathagata Basu said both sides had filed FIRs. We are looking into both complaints.

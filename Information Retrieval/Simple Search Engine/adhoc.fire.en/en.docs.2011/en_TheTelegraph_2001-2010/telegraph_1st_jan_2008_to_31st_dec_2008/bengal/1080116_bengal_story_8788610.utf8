	Ramnagar, Jan. 15: Eight members of a family heading to the Bay of Bengal for a holy dip were killed when a train from Digha hit their motor-fitted cycle van in East Midnapore this morning.
    
	The crash at the unmanned level crossing 180km from Calcutta occurred after the van driver  the ninth victim  accelerated to overcome a steep climb of the kutcha road leading to the tracks. 
    
	Tapas Kumar Das, a farmer at Bara Rangkua village, said: As the van approached the crossing, it slowed down because of the steep slope. We could hear a train honking away and found the van increasing speed to get across before it arrived.
    
	Kulranjan Giri, 55, died with his wife Arati, 48, daughter-in-law Madhabi, 24, daughter Gita Mondal, 28, grandson Barun Mondal, 14, and nephew Pritiranjan. 
    
	Moyna Mondal, 7, a niece of Kulranjans son-in-law Uday Mondal, Udays nephew Tarun, 12, and driver Siddheswar Patra, 35, were the others killed. 
    
	Uday, 30, and Satyaranjan Giri, 14, who is Kulranjans nephew, are in hospital.
    
	Kulranjan of Tajpur village in Ramnagar was travelling with his family to the beach at Jalda.
    
	Villagers said a clump of bushes to the left of the road must have obstructed the drivers view. He could not ga-uge the Digha-Shalimar trains speed, said Manas Das, 50, a farmer. 
    
	The van was hit in the middle of the tracks.
    
	I was cooking around 11.15am when I heard a loud crash. We rushed to the tracks and found mangled bodies on the slope, said Niyati Jana, 37, a housewife.
    
	The villagers surrounded Kharagpur divisional railway manager Ranjan Tiwari demanding compensation for the victims and a station at the spot.
    
	Tiwari said the railways were not bound to pay compensation as the accident was not caused by their negligence. However, we will give Rs 15,000 for each dead person and bear the expenses of the treatment of the injured, he added.

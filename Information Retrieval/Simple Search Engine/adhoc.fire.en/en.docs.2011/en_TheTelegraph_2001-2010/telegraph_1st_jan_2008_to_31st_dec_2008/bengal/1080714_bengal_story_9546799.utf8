	Calcutta, July 13: Five employees of an airline have been caught stealing goods valued at Rs 60,000 from a retail outlet in the domestic terminal of the airport.    
	They were not arrested as they returned the goods but they will lose their jobs, sources said.    
	The shoplifting came to light when employees of the first-floor shop found several items missing and alerted the air- port manager. Closed- circuit cameras had apparently picked the five lifting the items.        
	Calcutta: The body of a CPM supporter was found floating in a pond in Kulpi, South 24-Parganas. Gopal Haldar, 40, was attacked while returning from the party office.        
	Bhubaneswar: A man from Burdwan died of suffocation near the Puri chariots on Sunday. Ranjit Singh, 40, an asthma patient, was among thousands in the town to see a ritual called suna besha.        
	Barasat: Relatives of patients ransacked Bongaon Subdivisional Hospital after the authorities failed to remove a dead patient from the female ward in 24 hours.

	Calcutta, April 8: The Left Fronts panchayat poll manifesto will have no mention of the controversies over land acquisition and Nandigram.         
	In a meeting to finalise the draft at the CPM headquarters, the allies said the mention of Nandigram would hand the Opposition an opportunity to make it their poll plank.

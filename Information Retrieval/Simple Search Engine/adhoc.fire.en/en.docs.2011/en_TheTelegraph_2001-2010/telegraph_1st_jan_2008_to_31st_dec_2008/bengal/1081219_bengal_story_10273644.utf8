          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Dec. 18: Culling teams in Malda refused to go to the Narhatta bird flu zone this morning without police protection, delaying the operation back by several hours.         
	Yesterday, teams that had gone to Anandipur and Durgapur were pushed around and chased by villagers reluctant to part with their poultry for half the market price.         
	The Malda district administration managed to convince the officials around 3.30pm to venture into Englishbazar and Ratua I blocks. Around 50 policemen escorted teams to six mouzas, only where authorities were expecting trouble.        
	Utpal Saha, a civil defence staff member who went to Budhia village today but was in Durgapur yesterday, said no policeman accompanied his team. The manner in which we were chased in Durgapur was scary. We hid in a bamboo grove, he said.        
	Till 10.30pm, 6,100 chickens had been culled, district magistrate Sridhar Ghosh said. But later in the night it was found that seven farms with 15,000 birds within the 3km flu zone had escaped the culling teams notice. Ghosh said: I dont know how the (animal resource) department missed them.

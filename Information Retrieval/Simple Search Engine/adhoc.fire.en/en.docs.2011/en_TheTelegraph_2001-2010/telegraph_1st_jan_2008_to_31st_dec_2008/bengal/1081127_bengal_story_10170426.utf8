          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 26: Told by an industrialist that nothing is moving after Singur, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today tried to calm business nerves by saying things are not that bad in Bengal.        
	At a Ficci meet, Mahendra K. Jalan, chairman of Keventer Agro, said: After Singur, everybody is talking to all (political) parties, but nothing is moving. Earlier, there used to be action.         
	Jalan was possibly referring to a hawkers encroachment near his Barasat food-processing.         
	The chief minister told him: Things are not that bad. My secretary is sitting here. After the meeting, you talk to my secretary.         
	Sources said the sub-divisional officer of Barasat today called up the Nilgunge panchayat and asked it to submit a survey report on the encroachments by Monday. A meeting was held last Monday with the 60 squatters and the panchayat was asked to prepare the survey report.         
	Bhattacharjee made a grim forecast for the tobacco industry. The future of the cigarette industry is doomed, he said. Turning to ITC chairman Y.C. Deveshwar, he said: When I meet him, I tell him, the cigarette (industry) is in serious trouble. The health minister keeps writing that I should quit smoking.         
	ITC has diversified into other areas and now earns over half its revenue from non-tobacco businesses but is still the leading manufacturer of cigarettes in the country.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 6: Seven chambers of commerce in the city issued a joint statement today expressing concern over disruptions affecting industrial projects, but did not mention Singur by name.         
	The statement  issued by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce amp; Industry, Bharat Chamber of Commerce, Calcutta Chamber of Commerce, Confederation of Indian Industry (eastern region), Indian Chamber of Commerce, Merchants Chamber of Commerce and Oriental Chamber of Commerce  said the frequent and recently intensified disturbances were not just delaying projects but also showing the state in a poor light.        
	The... still-persisting bandh culture and retrograde steps can cruelly wipe out the positive image which Bengal has been able to create vis--vis its industrial regeneration, the statement said.         
	We are turning the clock back and fuelling negative perceptions that will unarguably slow down the current growth momentum, it added.

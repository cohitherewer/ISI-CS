          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Aug. 9: Trinamul Congress youth leader Subhendu Adhikari will fight CPM strongman Lakshman Seth for the Tamluk Lok Sabha seat.        
	Making the announcement at a rally near Haldia today, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee said: I have nominated Subhendu well before (the Lok Sabha elections) to foil Seths terror tactics to get re-elected from Tamluk. I am confident my candidate will prove more than a match for Seth.         
	Adhikari is the Trinamul MLA from Contai (South). His father, Sisir Adhikari, represents Egra in East Midnapore.        
	Trinamul sources suggested a different reason for Mamatas move. They said she announced Adhikaris name early because of the growing scramble for the Tamluk seat.        
	Over a dozen hopefuls have been eyeing the seat ever since the party won the East Midnapore zilla parishad and several gram panchayats and panchayat samitis.        
	Mamata also announced that the Trinamul would hold protest rallies and marches across East Midnapore from August 24, the day the party begins its indefinite dharna at Tata Motors small-car plant in Singur.        
	Ours will be a sustained agitation involving Singur and Nandigram. It will continue in both places until the 400 acres taken from unwilling farmers in Singur are returned, Mamata said.         
	She alleged the state government was not re-deploying the CRPF in trouble-torn Nandigram because it wanted its cadre to unleash terror on the villagers.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee rejected the Opposition demand for CRPF re-deployment at an all-party meeting in Tamluk today. Mamata boycotted the meeting.        
	She alleged that the recent outbreak of violence in Nandigram was a result of the CPMs desperate bid to recover lost ground. The CPM holds our men responsible for the murders. But I know they were killed over intra-party squabbles. I want a CBI probe into the deaths.

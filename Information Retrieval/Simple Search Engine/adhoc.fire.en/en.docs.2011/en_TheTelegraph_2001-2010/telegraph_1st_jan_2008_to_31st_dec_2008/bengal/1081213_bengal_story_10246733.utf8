	Calcutta, Dec. 12: Labour minister Mrinal Banerjee today ruled out providing any incentive to Dunlop as the company had not been declared sick.        
	The government cannot provide incentives or special concessions to a plant that has not been identified as sick. Dunlop chairman Pawan Ruia has said his intention is to reopen the Sahagunj factory by next March. So it is clear that his plant is not sick, he said.        
	The government had earlier ruled out providing the Rs 100-crore working capital that Ruia had sought. Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee had then demanded tax cuts.        
	The minister said: If tax concessions are given, other private units may seek similar favours. What will we do then? Ruia took over Dunlop from the BIFR (Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction), not the state, and it cant be our responsibility.

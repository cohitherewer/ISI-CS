	Singur: Mamata Banerjee told a crowd here today that Fridays road blockade would last an hour  not two as she had said yesterday  and would start from 4pm.         
	But later in the evening, Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee said he wasnt aware of any change of plan. No such change was discussed. Maybe she was unmindful when she said it. It will be a two-hour road blockade from 3pm, he said.

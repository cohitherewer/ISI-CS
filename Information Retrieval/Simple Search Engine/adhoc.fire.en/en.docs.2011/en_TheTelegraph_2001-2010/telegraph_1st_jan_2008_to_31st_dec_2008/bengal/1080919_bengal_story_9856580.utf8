          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 18: A Calcutta High Court judge has reunited a couple, saving a 10-year-old from being brought up in a broken home.         
	Justice Asim Banerjee asked Subhendu Bhattacharya, 36, to spend a night with Tanusree, 30, at his in-laws house in Hooghlys Goghat. Tomorrow, Tanusree and her son Rajdeep will go back to live with her husband, the judge said.         
	The court has used this method to mend at least 30 marriages over the years.        
	Accusing Subhendu of torture, Tanusree had gone to live with her parents in 2007. She had taken her son along. Subhendu filed a case in a West Midnapore court, saying he wanted his wife back.         
	The matter came up before the high court when Tanusree filed a petition to shift the case closer to her parents home.        
	The judges order came after Tanusree told him she would go back to her husband if he promised not to torture her.

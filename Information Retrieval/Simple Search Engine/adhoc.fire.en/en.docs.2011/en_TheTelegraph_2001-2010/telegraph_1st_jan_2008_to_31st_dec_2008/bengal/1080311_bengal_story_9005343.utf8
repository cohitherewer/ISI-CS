The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ghisingh rule ends
                                                                                                               Ghisingh rule ends
  - Hill duo rebel in Assembly        OUR BUREAU                          No time to relax                                        
	March 10: Subash Ghisingh today resigned as caretaker administrator of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, ending a 20-year rule that lost popular support in the last few months because of its failure to push the statehood demand.        
	In the Assembly, three MLAs of Ghisinghs GNLF today raised the demand for Gorkhaland and walked out.         
	Two of them  P. Rai and G. Lepcha  later said they had resigned from the GNLF and formed a breakaway group called GNLF (Rebels).        
	Ghisingh, who is down with flu and has been coughing, handed over to Darjeeling district magistrate Rajesh Pandey his resignation letter, addressed to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	I cant reveal the letters content. I will forward it to the government, Pandey, also the DGHC principal secretary, said on stepping out of the bungalow where Ghisingh has been staying since March 6.         
	In Calcutta, the chief minister said he had received Ghisinghs letter and accepted his resignation. He added that Jalpaiguri divisional commissioner B.L. Meena will take over the councils charge tomorrow.        
	A source said the letter, drafted by Pandey on Ghisinghs instructions, reminded the chief minister that he was eligible to continue in the post till March 24. But he stepped down considering the state of affairs in the hills and a request from the chief minister.        
	Pandey said the septuagenarian leader will continue to get Z-category security.        
	Ghisingh, who has always held a council post since its formation in 1988, is likely to leave for Darjeeling on Thursday.        
	Now he can devote more time to the party. Well meet soon to plan our fight for a new state, said Dawa Pakhrin, the GNLFs Kalimpong president.        
	Ghisingh will have to deal with the rebellion first. Weve requested the Speaker for separate seats. We dont belong to the GNLF anymore, Rai said.        
	GNLFs other MLA, Shanta Chhetri, is with Ghisingh but demanding Gorkhaland.

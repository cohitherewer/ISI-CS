	Durgapur, June 6: About 100 junior doctors of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital today went on a strike after a father lodged a police complaint blaming some of them for his daughters death in labour.         
	The authorities said services were not affected, not even in the emergency and outpatient departments. Senior doctors maintained round-the-clock vigil, said hospital superintendent T.K. Ghosh.         
	The strike was called off late tonight.        
	Daily wager Banshi Mohanta said his daughter Puja, 28, was left unattended last night. Some of the junior doctors allegedly hit him when he accused them of negligence.

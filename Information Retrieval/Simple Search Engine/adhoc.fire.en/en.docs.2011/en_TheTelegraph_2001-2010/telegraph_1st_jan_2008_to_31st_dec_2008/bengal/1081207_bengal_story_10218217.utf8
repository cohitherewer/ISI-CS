          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Vah Tukvar (Darjeeling), Dec. 6: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has called an indefinite bandh in all state government offices and a complete halt to development projects in the hills from Monday in a bid to infuse fresh enthusiasm in the sagging Gorkhaland movement.         
	At a meeting with party leaders here, about 20km from Darjeeling town, Morcha president Bimal Gurung said many supporters who had bagged government contracts for development projects were showing signs of betrayal.         
	Many of you are now betraying the cause and are only interested in running after the governments funds and building (your own) houses. I am not telling this to the people but you are representatives of the party and must give all your time (to the Gorkhaland cause) for the next 16 months.        
	Gurung has promised the new state to his supporters by March 10, 2010.         
	If you have invested a lot of money (in the projects), I do not care, said Gurung. I am only bothered about Gorkhaland and nothing else.        
	The Morcha womens wing has been told to ensure that all development work comes to a stop.         
	It is not yet clear whether the strike would affect tourism because when government offices were shut down during the previous phase of the agitation, sites like Tiger Hill, Nightingale Park, Rock Gardens and Gangamaya Park were kept open but entrance fees were not collected.        
	Justifying his decision not to close down central government offices, Gurung said: Our fight is mostly with the state now and that is why we are closing their offices.

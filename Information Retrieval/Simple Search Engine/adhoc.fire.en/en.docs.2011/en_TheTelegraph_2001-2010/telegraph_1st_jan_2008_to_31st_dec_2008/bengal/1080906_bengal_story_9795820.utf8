The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Canada hotel skirts Calcutta
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Canada hotel skirts Calcutta
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Sept. 5: The Singur stand-off had its first repercussions on Bengals business with a Toronto-headquartered hotel group today saying it had dropped Calcutta from its map while scouting for properties in India.        
	Thomas W. Storey, presi- dent of Fairmont Hotels amp; Resorts that manages luxury properties across the world, said the row over Nano had prompted the group to shelve its plans for Calcutta.        
	Calcutta does not excite us as it is a difficult destination and lacks what every foreign investor looks for  safety and security of their investment, said Storey, who was in Hyderabad to ann-ounce a 350-room five-star hotel for the city in collabo-ration with the Maheswari group.         
	He said the Fairmont group, which does not build but manages hotels, was in the process of selecting a partner for its Calcutta project.         
	But Calcutta is no longer our priority. We are now focusing on Delhi, Mumbai, Jaipur and a few other places, said Storey.        
	Fairmont operates in 19 countries with over 56 properties.         
	It is developing 20 more in Abu Dhabi, Shanghai and the Anguilla islands.        
	The Fairmont boss said the land controversy surrounding the Tata small-car project had forced the group to reconsider its plan for Bengal, which did not come across as a healthy and attractive destination for foreign investors.         
	We are not very happy with the value system of the local administration. We feel it is difficult to make them understand the business ethics of international investors, he said.        
	We are not so much concerned about terrorism as we are about insecurity of investment and safety of properties, Storey added.        
	Girish Mallpani, chief executive officer and executive director of Maheswari, a Hyderabad-based realtor, echoed Storey. The negative publicity over Singur has dissuaded many foreign investors he said.         
	Storey said the group chose Hyderabad as its first destination in India because the city has more international business travellers seeking five-star comforts.        
	The hotel industry cannot survive only on tourists who want cheap accommodation at three-star luxury. Conventions and business travellers are the thrust areas.        
	The development of the information technology sector, the new international airport and Hyderabads emergence as a hub for travellers to South and West Asia have made it an attractive destination for hospitality investment, Storey said.

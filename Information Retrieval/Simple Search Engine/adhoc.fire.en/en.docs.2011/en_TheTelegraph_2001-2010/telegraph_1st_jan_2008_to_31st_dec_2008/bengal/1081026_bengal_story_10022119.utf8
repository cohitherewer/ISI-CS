          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, Oct. 25: The end of the puja season means Mamata Banerjees rallies are round the corner.        
	We have kept quiet for a pretty long time, Mamata said at her Kalighat home today.        
	During the festival season, we had suspended protests against the ruling party for about a month. Now that Kali Puja and bhai phonta will be over by October 30, we will begin our agitation against the government from October 31.        
	Four days ago, she had said the Trinamul Congress would refrain from blocking rail and road traffic over trivial issues.         
	Mamatas first rally will be in Burdwans Ausgram where Trinamul men were allegedly being threatened and minorities attacked by CPM goons.         
	After that, she plans to gherao the offices of the superintendents of police across the state. Our agitation would spread to every district in the form of an SP office abhijaan between November 10 and November 20, Mamata said.         
	The CPM is now realising that its end is pretty near. It will get the answer in the Lok Sabha polls. This has to be told to the masses. Thats why, I will visit some districts.        
	A party leader said Mamatas decision to re-launch the agitation against the government is aimed at winning support in the districts ahead of the Lok Sabha polls next year and elections to the Howrah Municipal Corporation and the municipalities in Krishnagar, Behrampore and Jhargram on November 30.        
	Didi spoke to some of our district leaders who told her that the agitation against the ruling party has to be kept alive as Lok Sabha elections are near. She is expecting an announcement for the general elections in January-end or February next year, the leader said.        
	Mamata said she would go to Singur on November 2 to demand that 400 acres be returned to the unwilling farmers. I will hold a meeting supporting the unwilling farmers. Their land was taken forcibly. Our meeting would again demand the return of 400 acres.         
	She added: Industry is welcome on the remaining part of the acquired land and the government can float global tenders to set up units there.         
	On November 10, Mamata would be in Nandigram addressing a meeting denouncing the armed recapture of land by CPM goons. Dont forget it was the CPM, with police as onlookers, which recaptured Nandigram on November 10 last year, she said.        
	Today, the Deolpota Seva Samity, the NGO invited for talks on land acquisition for the Geonkhali shipyard, said it would boycott Mondays meeting with the East Midnapore district magistrate.        
	Singur OC transfer        
	The officer in charge of Singur police station, Priyabrata Bakshi, has been posted in Pandua. Bhadreshwar OC Ashok Mishra will take his place.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   AIDS patient left with ants
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Dec. 13: A comatose AIDS patient was left on the floor of a government hospital for nearly 24 hours with ants crawling all over him.        
	The nurses at Behrampore Sadar Hospital allegedly told the patients elder sister, Seema Pohit, they would not touch an AIDS patient.        
	I admitted my brother to the hospital yesterday afternoon. This morning when I went to see him, I found he had not been allotted a bed. Red ants were crawling all over him. His hands and face were swollen and the ants were scampering over the ulcers around his eyes. Blood was oozing from there, said Seema, a resident of Behrampore town, about 200km from Calcutta.        
	She said that when she informed the nurses, They told me to my face they would not touch him because he is an AIDS patient. No doctor or nurse came to see him.        
	She then called up a reporter of a Bengali channel whom she knew. The reporter and another journalist, who works with a Bengali daily, went to the hospital.         
	A nurse allowed them into the ward but when the TV reporter took out his camera, she raised the alarm.         
	Immediately two Group-D employees arrived and pushed the journalists into another room and locked it.        
	I rang up the superintendent of police from my cellphone and he sent policemen to rescue us, the TV reporter said. He later lodged a complaint against the nurse.        
	Hospital superintendent Bhaskar Samanta said: I will inquire why the patient was not allotted a bed and why he did not get treatment.         
	Later in the night, the 28-year-old man was given a bed in the isolation ward and a doctor examined him. Samanta said his treatment had started.        
	Seema said her brother was treated at NRS in Calcutta for several months before being sent home. A sudden worsening of his condition led to him being admitted to the Behrampore hospital.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 7: The back-to-back bandhs have dealt a severe blow to international cargo trade from the city.        
	Hundreds of tonnes of cargo could not be loaded on freighters and passenger flights as the warehouse of the international cargo terminal remained shut.         
	Airlines put their losses at well over Rs 1 crore.        
	Singapore Airlines freighter, the only one flown by an international carrier out of the city, took off empty on Friday. It was scheduled to carry 35 tonnes of cargo, including leather goods, live fish, machinery and cotton products.         
	A consignment of 500kg of flowers for Amsterdam, also booked on that flight, had to be cancelled.         
	The airlines passenger flight that day was supposed to carry 15 tonnes of cargo but went without any.         
	The warehouse was closed and so no export agent brought their goods, said Amin Khan, manager, eastern India, Singapore Airlines Cargo.         
	The airline said it lost over Rs 50 lakh.        
	Emirates, which carries gold, leather goods, perishables and machinery among others out of Calcutta, was similarly affected.         
	Airport sources said todays Emirates flight also could not carry any cargo, though the warehouse started operating this morning. Only a tonne could be made ready by 6pm, when the warehouse closes, because of the backlog.        
	Other airlines like Lufthansa, Thai Airways, Gulf Air and British Airways faced similar problems. Tonnes of telecom equipment, laptops, mobile phones and computer accessories, which were brought in by these airlines, lay on the tarmac for two days, exposed to rain.         
	They could be taken inside the warehouse only this morning after it opened.

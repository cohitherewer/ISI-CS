	Cooch Behar, July 6: A Kamtapur Liberation Organisation militant wanted for the past five years was held in Chandamari market in South Dinajpur last night.         
	Ranjan Barman, 26, had recently sneaked into India from Bangladesh, said Cooch Behar police chief Anil Kumar.        
	He is said to have fled to that country with KLO chief Jiban Singha after the Indian Army carried out a flush-out operation in Bhutan in 2004.

	Calcutta, Oct. 6: Tourists cruising down a Sunderbans ri-ver hoping for a glimpse of a Bengal Tiger saw one today, but it was dead.        
	The tigers body was fo- und floating in the Bidya in Gosaba, some 260km south of Calcutta.         
	The tourists, on a motorised launch, alerted the crew who called officials at the forest department camp at Dobanki, 50km away.         
	A Sunderbans Tiger Re- serve team arrived in about three hours and took away the full-grown male for post-mortem.         
	Officials said the place where the carcass was found was at least 100km from human habitat.         
	We havent found any external injury marks. The post-mortem will reveal whether it was poisoned by poachers or it died of some disease, an official said.         
	Reserve director Neeraj Singhal could not recall another instance of a dead tiger floating on a river.

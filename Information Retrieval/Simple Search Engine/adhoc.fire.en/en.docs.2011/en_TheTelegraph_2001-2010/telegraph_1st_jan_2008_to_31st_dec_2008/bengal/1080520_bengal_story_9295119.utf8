	New Cooch Behar, May 19: A group of policemen beat up railway employees and ransacked the station here because a train that was supposed to take them back after election duty had not arrived on time.        
	Around 1,200 Howrah district police and railway police personnel had been deployed in Cooch Behar for yesterdays polling. Today, they were supposed to go back to their place of posting by the special train.        
	When it did not arrive till 4.15pm, they lost patience.        
	The battered stationmaster, Monomohan Das, and his assistant, Niranjan Burman, had to be hospitalised.         
	Passengers were chased off the station and at least three trains were stranded until late tonight.        
	One of the policemen said: We were on duty at a place where there was no proper arrangement of food, lodging or transport. The delay in the trains arrival only added fuel to the fire.         
	The special train was supposed to reach here at 1pm. We were tired after a hard days work yesterday. When the train did not arrive by 4.15pm, we lost our patience, he added.        
	In Calcutta, inspector-general of police (law and order) Raj Kanojia described the incident as unfortunate and said an inquiry would be ordered.         
	Cooch Behar police chief Anil Kumar refused to speak. His force distributed food packets among the gun-wielding men in khaki who chased away passengers who came near them on the platform.         
	The men in khaki barged into food stalls and ransacked them and stormed railway offices.         
	Several hundred passengers ran out of the station and took shelter outside.        
	Im taking my brother for treatment to Chennai and was waiting for the Howrah-bound Saraighat Express when the trouble started, said Ashok Mustafi of Dinhata. We somehow ran out of the station and have been waiting here, he said, sitting in an eatery.        
	The train, which was supposed to come at 5pm, finally chugged in at a quarter to nine.        
	The Delhi-bound Brahmaputra Mail and Lohit Express, which goes to Jammu, were also delayed by several hours.        
	They suddenly went berserk and started beating us up, stationmaster Das said from his hospital bed.        
	A railway official said the Cooch Behar police chief, too, was locked up in a room. But Kumar denied being held hostage.         
	In Calcutta, Kanojia said a preliminary investigation had revealed that the fatigued policemen had lost their cool.        
	We had paid an advance for the train, but the railways failed to arrange it on time. However, the policemen should not have gone on the rampage, he added.        
	The rampaging policemen were finally herded into the special train at 9.34pm.

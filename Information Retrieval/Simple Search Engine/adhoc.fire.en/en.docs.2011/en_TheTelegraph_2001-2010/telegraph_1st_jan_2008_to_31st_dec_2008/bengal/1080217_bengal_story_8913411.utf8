The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Private guard plan for JU
                                                                                                               Private guard plan for JU
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 16: Jadavpur University is considering a proposal to engage a private security agency on the campus.        
	The one-man commission of Ashoke Mohan Chakraborty, constituted by the chief minister to probe the violence that rocked the university last April, had recommended the deployment of private guards.        
	Although the commission had submitted its report to the government in October, it was placed before the universitys executive council in January.         
	The council did not discuss the report immediately after it was placed as its members wanted to study the commissions observations and recommendations thoroughly.         
	Members of the CPM-backed non-teaching employees union, Karmachari Samsad, have resented the possible outsourcing of jobs to tighten security and keep the campus clean. They have threatened an agitation if the proposals get the nod.         
	The proposals to engage private security and conservancy staff were recently placed in the executive council but no decision was taken. We are strongly opposed to the proposals and will be compelled to launch an agitation if they are okayed, Swapan Ghosh, its general secretary, said today.         
	JU has its own security system  about 130 guards to keep vigil on the campus and the hostels. But the authorities feel that the existing security and conservancy arrangements are not adequate.         
	Samsad members had clashed with the anti-SFI students union after it won the university elections. The Samsad alleged that the students set its office on fire and ceased work for around a fortnight, bringing all academic activities to a stop. The chief minister then intervened and formed the panel headed by higher education secretary Chakraborty.        
	Officials said a series of inspections over the past few weeks had revealed warts in the existing system. There is no check on the entry of outsiders. Thefts are frequent and the guards can never give the sequence of events after an untoward incident.         
	The commission had also pointed out lapses in the existing system and said: The authorities may consider engaging an outsider professional agency to guard the university premises and maintain peace and law and order.

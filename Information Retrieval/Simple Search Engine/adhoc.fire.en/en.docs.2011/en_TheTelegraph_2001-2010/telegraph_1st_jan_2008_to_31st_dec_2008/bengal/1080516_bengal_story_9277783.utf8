          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, May 15: Three accident victims bled and groaned for over an hour on Jessore Road last night but no passerby offered to take them to hospital fearing police harassment.        
	By the time a police officer took Shekhar Ghosh, Tarun Das, and Sushanto Chanda to hospital, Ghosh was close to breathing his last.        
	The 32-year-old died soon after reaching Habra State General Hospital where Jyotirmoy Dutta, an assistant sub-inspector of Habra police station, took them.        
	Around 11.30 last night a trailer hit their auto  Sushanto, 28, was the driver  near Ashokenagar, around 30km from Calcutta.         
	The driver of the trailer fled. The three men were bleeding, but no one came forward, said Rahim Seikh, a resident. Police harass those who help mishap victims. So, I did not want to take chances.         
	With three injured men and a trailer in the middle, traffic slowed down on Jessore Road. Dutta, returning from an election booth with ballot boxes, also got stuck. I came out of the jeep to check what had happened and saw the three. There were people around, but no one would come forward, he said. I hailed a truck and asked bystanders to put them in the vehicle, he said.         
	Sushanto and Tarun, 40, were later taken to RG Kar Hospital, where till this evening their condition was critical.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Nov. 23: A transporter who had left his home in Kulti near Asansol with two prospective business partners yesterday has allegedly been kidnapped.        
	Anil Goyals family realised that he had been kidnapped when they received a ransom call around 1.30pm, three hours after he left. The caller demanded Rs 20 lakh.        
	Police traced the calls to a public booth at Anara in Purulia, about 50km away.         
	According to the family, the duo with whom Anil, 35, left home own a wrought iron factory in Anara. Their partnership had apparently been finalised on Friday.         
	They (the duo) had approached Anil to become their business partner. Around 10.30 yesterday morning, they left for a factory visit. We are probing whether the partnership proposal was a trap, said Asansol deputy superintendent of police U.S. Mukherjee.        
	A Kulti police officer said the callers had told the Goyals they would inform them over the phone later when and where the money had to be delivered.         
	We are in touch with Purulia police, said Burdwan superintendent R. Rajsekharan.        
	At Niamatpur in Kulti, about 270km from Calcutta, Anil and his father run a transport business and own an automobile spares store.         
	The police said Anil also traded in iron ore.        
	Anils father Gajanan said: My son went out with some of his new business associates yesterday. He told us he was going to visit a factory in Purulia and would return later in the evening. But around 1.30pm, I got a call on our landline from an unknown person who told me that my son had been abducted. Initially, I thought someone was playing a prank but became nervous after I found my sons mobile phone had been switched off.        
	The Goyals said they did not know the names of the duo with whom Anil had apparently struck a deal.        
	According to the police, Gajanan received the next call around 4pm yesterday, when the same male voice demanded the ransom.        
	We dont want to speak anymore. It might complicate the case, said Gajanan.

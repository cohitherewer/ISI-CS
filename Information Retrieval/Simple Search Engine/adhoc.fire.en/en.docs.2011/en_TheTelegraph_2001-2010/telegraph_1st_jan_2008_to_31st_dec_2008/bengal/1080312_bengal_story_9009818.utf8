The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Answer scripts lost
                                                                                                               Answer scripts lost
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Malda/Calcutta, March 11: Another set of Madhyamik answer scripts has gone missing: this time from Malda. But the rules in place dont have the teeth to punish callous teachers.        
	Ashok Kumar Bera of Malda Town School apparently dropped 72 corrected Bengali second paper answer scripts while going to his head examiners house on his motorcycle yesterday.        
	The board of secondary education can at best blacklist Bera, which means he will never be an examiner again. In a state where most teachers are reluctant to take up an examiners assignment, blacklisting may well be a blessing rather than punishment.         
	Forty-nine physical science answer scripts went missing from Surya Sen Street in Calcutta a week ago. A retired teacher lost them while heading home from the head examiners house. A young man who claimed to be his former student and offered help to carry the bundle allegedly fled with them.        
	Thirty-three corrected geography answer scripts were found lying by a road in Hooghlys Haripal last evening. A local resident spotted the bundle and called police.        
	A board official said: Such frequent loss of answer scripts has never happened before.        
	The board has decided to meet school education minister Partha De to work out a way of making teachers more accountable. An emergency meeting of the boards examination committee will also be called. We have to punish errant examiners, said secretary Swapan Sarkar.        
	The board is working out the modalities on how to ensure students dont suffer.        
	In many earlier cases, lost answer scripts were found before the publication of results, a board official said.        
	Bera had been given 206 answer scripts to correct. He had completed 72 and was taking them to the head examiner after school. Midway, I realised that the bag in which I was carrying the answer scripts was missing. I retraced my route, asking people if they had seen it. But no one had a clue, said the teacher, who lodged a complaint with Englishbazar police station.         
	Head examiner Susmita Som, a lecturer in Gour College, Malda, said Bera should not have taken the answer scripts to school. It was irresponsible on his part.        
	Police said they were trying to find out whether Bera lost the bag in the school itself.

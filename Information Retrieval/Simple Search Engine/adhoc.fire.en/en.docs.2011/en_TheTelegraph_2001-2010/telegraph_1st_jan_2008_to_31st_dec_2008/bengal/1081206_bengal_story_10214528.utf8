	Tamluk, Dec. 5: The government has sought 36 companies of central paramilitary for the Nandigram Assembly bypoll on December 27.        
	The administration wants a part of the force at least a fortnight in advance to prevent the entry of outsiders who can create trouble.         
	We have sought 36 companies (over 3,500 personnel) because we want to ensure peace during the bypoll. We have urged the Election Commission to see to it that a part of the force reaches us by December 12, said East Midnapore district magistrate C.D. Lama.        
	Only four companies of the CRPF had been deployed during the May panchayat polls, which the Trinamul Congress won. We have become extra alert after the renewed violence over the past two days, an official said.        
	At an all-party meeting in the Nandigram block office today, both the CPM and the Trinamul Congress demanded central forces. Lama said the parties had agreed not to hold simultaneous programmes in the same area.

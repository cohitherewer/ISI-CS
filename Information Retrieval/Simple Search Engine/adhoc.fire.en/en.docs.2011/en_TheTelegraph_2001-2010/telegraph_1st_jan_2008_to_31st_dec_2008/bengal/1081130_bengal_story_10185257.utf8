	Calcutta, Nov. 29: The city police top brass has told officers in charge (OCs) of all 48 police stations to ensure that closed-circuit TVs are installed in high-rises and the footage preserved for at least 30 days.         
	The officers were not given any specification regarding high-rises but were asked to be vigilant about buildings over five storeys.        
	The OCs will hold meetings with housing societies and associations by Sunday and persuade them to instal the gadget. The officers have been told to persuade the residents to instal the CCTVs. The stored data can be of great help, said Vineet Goyal, DC, headquarters.         
	The move comes days after police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti said house owners not providing details of tenants to the police could be arrested.         
	The OCs will submit a report on high-rise and hotel security to their respective deputy commissioners. The New Market and Taltala police station OCs were told to be particularly vigilant as the areas have many lodges and hotels where foreigners stay.        
	A police team also met principals of 50 schools and asked them to instal CCTVs.

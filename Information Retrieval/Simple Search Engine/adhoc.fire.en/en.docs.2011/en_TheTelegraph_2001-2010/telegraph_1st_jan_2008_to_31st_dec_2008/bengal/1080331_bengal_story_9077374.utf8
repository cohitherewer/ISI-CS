	Krishnagar, March 30: Mamata Banerjees kitchen has been hit by the rise in prices, with her mother giving her a taste of the problem.        
	At a party meeting here, Mamata said she had a tiff with her mother, who complained that running the household with the Rs 5,000 she provided had become difficult.         
	My mother is the source of all my energy. But I had a big fight with her on Friday after she asked me what she should bring me for dinner, Mamata said. I asked her why she made such a comment and ma said: Dont you know how much oils, vegetables and other stuff cost?        
	Mamata shouted back at Gayatri Devi: I give you Rs 5,000 a month to run the household you, me and a help.         
	The Trinamul Congress leader said she thought Rs 5,000 was enough to feed three mouths. But her mother asked her to go to the bazaar.

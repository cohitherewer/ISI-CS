                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Buddha date with Nepal Maoist
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 3: Prachandas deputy in the Commun- ist Party of Nepal (Maoist), Baburam Bhattarai, is likely to meet Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee later this month.        
	Nepals consul-general in Calcutta, Suresh Man Sreshtha, met the chief minister at Writers Buildings this afternoon for a 20-minute informal discussion.        
	The chief minister greeted the people of Nepal and said that the peoples verdict must always be respected. He also praised the efforts made to re-establish democracy in the country, Sreshtha said after the meeting.         
	I did inform Buddhadebbabu about Baburam Bhattarais arrival in India on June 22. We told him that Bhattarai might meet him the following day, but we havent sent an official intimation yet, Sreshtha added.        
	Bhattarai is primarily coming to meet his many old friends in India.         
	Asked about the possibility of Prachandas trip anytime soon, Sreshtha said: It would not be correct for me to comment without proper information.        
	He expressed hope that the dwindling number of tourists from Bengal would rise once the image of a politically stable and safe Nepal reaches the people here. Of the 96,000 Indian tourists to Nepal annually, a majority are from Bengal. The number has taken a hit in recent times, Sreshtha said.

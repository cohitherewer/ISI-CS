          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Suri, Nov. 12: A woman who ran two beauty parlours and did bit roles in television soaps was throttled to death, dragged about 50 yards and tied to a tree with a shawl in a forest near Suri town.         
	In a handbag found near her, sleuths got phone numb- ers of several Birbhum district police officers, a hand-written note saying she had kept Rs 15,000 with a certain Ramda for power bills and two bus tickets for Katwa in neighbouring Burdwan, where her mother stays.        
	Villagers saw 45-year-old Anjali Goswamis body this morning. She had been dragged through the forest (about 250km from Calcutta). Her face was mutilated and dress torn, a police officer said.         
	The Suri resident was also a moneylender and an enlisted anganwadi worker. She was last seen leaving her parlour in Suri with a stocky man on a red motorcycle . She had told employees she was supposed to join the cast of a TV serial for shooting, said an officer.        
	Anjalis husband Kanan, who owned the beauty parlours, was run over by a truck eight years ago. Her 18-year-old daughter committed suicide two years ago and her 21-year-old son was killed in a motorcycle crash this year. Anjali stayed alone in the two-storey house, said her neighbour Supriya Ghosh.        
	Birbhum superintendent L.N. Meena said: We expect a breakthrough soon.

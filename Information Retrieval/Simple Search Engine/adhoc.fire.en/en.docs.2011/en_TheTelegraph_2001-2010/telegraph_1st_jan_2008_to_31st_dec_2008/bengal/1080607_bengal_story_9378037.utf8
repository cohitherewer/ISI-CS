          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bolpur, June 6: A management college lecturer here was arrested today after he allegedly poured kerosene on his wife and tried to set her ablaze.         
	Utpalendu Mondal, who is said to have taken Rs 5 lakh from his father-in-law over seven years of marriage to Sudipta, wanted more.        
	Police said he had a fight with his wife at their rented house in Udayanpalli, 200km from Calcutta, over payment of Rs 100 for a blood test of their four-year-old daughter Pragyata today.         
	He poured kerosene on my head to set me ablaze when I asked him to pay Rs 100 for the test, Sudipta, 32, said in her police complaint.         
	When I cried out at the top of my voice, my parents, who had been staying with us for three days, and neighbours came to my rescue. They brought us to the police station, she said, clutching her weeping daughter.         
	Sudipta told the police her husband had been torturing her for dowry since their wedding in 2001.        
	Police said Mondal, 35, a postgraduate in English from Burdwan University, had joined the Bengal Institute of Technology and Management last year after getting a management degree from Orissa. He earns Rs 15,000 a month.        
	We have booked Mondal, originally from Sainthia, Birbhum, for an attempt to murder his wife and torturing her physically and mentally for dowry, said Kamal Bairagya, the inspector in charge of Bolpur police station.        
	Sudiptas father Santunu Chowdhury, a retired central government employee, said he gave Mondal Rs 52,000 and 140 grams of gold ornaments for the wedding.         
	Sudipta is my only child. So whenever she approached me for money, I gave it. Ive paid Rs 5 lakh in cash to Utpalendu over the past few years. But he was not happy, he said.

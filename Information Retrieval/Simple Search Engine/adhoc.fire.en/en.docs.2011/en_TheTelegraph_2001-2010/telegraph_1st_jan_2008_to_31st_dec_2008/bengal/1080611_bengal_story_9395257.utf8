	Darjeeling, June 10: Boarding schools across the Darjeeling hills are apprehensive about what might happen if their food stocks do not last till the indefinite bandh is lifted.        
	With tea and tourism, education forms the backbone of the hill economy with around 30 private schools in the three subdivisions of Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong boasting of students from across India, Nepal and Bhutan.         
	There are around 9,000-10,000 boarders in the hills, said Robi Subba, one of the directors of Himali Boarding School, Kurseong.         
	Many schools said their stocks could at best last a week.         
	We have 460 boarders and since the strike was called suddenly, we can only carry on for a week. We are simply hoping that it does not continue for long, said Father Kinley Tshering, rector, St Josephs School (North Point), Darjeeling.         
	Even if the foodgrain stocks last a week, we cant give the children vegetables.        
	Many schools in Darjeeling are expected to close for a short summer break from June 21. Others like Mount Hermon and St Pauls have just opened after a weeks vacation.         
	The level exams of the International General Certificate of Secondary Education are being held now, but Himalis biggest worry is its dwindling food stocks. We have 16 exam candidates, but they are boarders, said Subba. We dont know what will happen when the food stock finishes.        
	Gorkha Janmukti Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri promised a relaxation in the bandh timings for shoppers. This is just the first day. We will definitely provide a relaxation later, he said.         
	Business loss        
	Siliguri will lose Rs 4.5 crore a day because of the hill bandh, a business lobby said.        
	The average daily transaction in Siliguri is Rs 6 crore, of which 75 per cent is with the hills, said Biswajit Das of the Federation of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry, North Bengal.        
	The figure does not include losses in the tea industry, whi-ch could be hit with the Morchas call for supreme sacrifice. Workers of at least 10 gardens close to the hills did not report for duty today.

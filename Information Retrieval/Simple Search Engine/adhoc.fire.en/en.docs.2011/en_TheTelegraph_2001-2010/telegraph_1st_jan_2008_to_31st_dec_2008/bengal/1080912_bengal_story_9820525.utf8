          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Becharam Manna at the meeting. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: Trinamul Congress nominees on the committee set up to find land to rehabilitate Singur farmers signalled today they might need longer than a week for the job.        
	We held talks in a cordial atmosphere and there will be further discussions tomorrow. But if talks cannot be completed within the seven-day time frame, we will submit an interim report to the government. In that case, we will seek a time extension, Singur MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya said after a two-hour meeting with the government representatives on the panel.         
	Hooghly district magistrate Neelam Meena and WBIDC managing director Subrata Gupta are Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees nominees on the committee that is looking at ways to implement the Sunday agreement. The committee is scheduled to submit its report on Monday.        
	A Save Farmland Committee leader said the objective of continuing discussions is to precipitate the crisis and thereby keep the Tatas from resuming work.        
	We lifted the dharna because of the governors intervention that saw the leader of the Opposition and the industries minister signing an agreement at Raj Bhavan that land in the project area would be returned. That process is on and can always need time beyond the given time frame. The more the time needed, the more inconvenience can be caused to the Tatas. Why should we allow them a smooth run and help the government earn credit? the leader asked.        
	Becharam Manna, Trinamuls other land scout, is said to have told the government at todays meeting that both sides should carry on talks now and take a decision only after the Supreme Court hears an appeal against the Singur land acquisition. The case is to come up on Monday.        
	We think some 150 acres are already there in Bajemelia, Beraberi and Joymollah as ancillaries are yet to start work. What would be the big problem if they are asked to shift to the opposite side of the highway? I request the government to consider this, he was quoted as saying.        
	Although the Trinamul team has identified only 150 acres, they insisted that 300 acres must be found from within the site. The government had said yesterday no more than 40 acres could be spared.        
	After the talks, Bhattacharya said: We visited the site yesterday and submitted certain proposals to the government during todays meeting. We also talked about certain places inside the project area from where land can be identified and given back to farmers. But the government did not mention the quantum of land it was ready to return. Neither did government representatives give us any assurance that land would be returned.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Shah Rukh seeks CM date
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Shah Rukh seeks CM date
          A STAFF REPORTER                                              Shah Rukh Khan and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee      
	Calcutta, May 20: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may have resolved not to watch any Indian Premier League match, but that has not deterred Shah Rukh Khan from seeking an appointment with him.         
	A letter from the Calcutta team owner reached the Bengal chief ministers office two days ago.        
	Sources in the chief ministers secretariat said Shah Rukh had requested Bhattacharjee to spare some time when the actor came to cheer his team at the Eden on Sunday.        
	We have received a letter from Shah Rukh Khan where he has expressed his desire to meet the chief minister. However, the time and the day have not yet been finalised. We are trying to fix an appointment at a time convenient for both, an official said.        
	He hinted that it could even happen on Saturday, if Shah Rukh comes to the city on the eve of the teams last league match. But nothing is definite.        
	It remains to be seen whether King Khan can persuade the chief minister to watch the Sunday match if he gets to meet him the day before.        
	Bhattacharjee had said he was not interested in IPL matches.         
	Asked whether it was because of reports that the Knight Riders owner had not invited him, the chief minister had said: Even if I had been invited, I would not have gone to watch the matches.        
	When the row over the presence of cheerleaders at the stadium had broken out, the chief minister had said: I never keep track of such things. Nor do I intend to.        
	An official in the chief ministers office said: He has always loved the traditional form of the game.

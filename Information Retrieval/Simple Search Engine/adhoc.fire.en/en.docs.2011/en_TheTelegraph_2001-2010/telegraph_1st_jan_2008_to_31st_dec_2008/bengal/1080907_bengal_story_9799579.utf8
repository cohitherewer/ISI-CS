          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Sept. 6: Contract workers loyal to CPM labour arm Citu allegedly beat the manager of a private pig-iron unit unconscious last night while the government was putting up an industry-friendly face in Singur.        
	The workers have also been holding seven permanent employees of the factory hostage since yesterday morning, days after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said gheraos would never return to the state.        
	The Neo Metallics Limited unit, located in the Banskopa Industrial Complex at Kanksa, Burdwan, had announced a fortnights shutdown yesterday citing maintenance work. Permanent employees were asked to come to work but the contract labourers were told stay at home.        
	Suspecting a layoff ploy, the contract workers detained seven employees inside the plant and later attacked personnel manager Tapas Bagchi, 55.        
	Bagchi was returning home around 8pm when the workers stopped his car outside the factory gates. They started pounding on the bonnet, demanding they be allowed to join work immediately.        
	Some of them dragged Bagchi out and started hitting him. I tried to rescue him but was threatened. I have been detained inside the plant since yesterday morning, Arup Majumder, a chemical engineer, said over the phone.        
	Bagchi somehow freed himself, ran back inside the factory and slumped to the ground unconscious.        
	The victim is now at the ICU of a private hospital in Durgapur with a broken collar bone and severe chest and abdominal pain. He has developed neurological problems, a doctor said.        
	The agitators had tried to prevent us from taking the unconscious Bagchi to hospital, said Sanjay Gulati, general manager (works).        
	Yesterday, around 110 contract workers were asked not to come till the maintenance job was over. But about 100 of them, carrying Citu flags, began a protest in front of the gates of the factory, about 180km from Calcutta.        
	We had shut the plant for maintenance with prior notice but the contract workers wouldnt listen, Gulati said.        
	The company lodged a complaint with Kanksa police and the Durgapur sub-divisional officer this morning. SDO R.N. Basu Roychowdhury said: We are negotiating with the Citu (over the hostages).        
	Tapan Pal, the Citu secretary of the union at the plant, said the management had shut the factory without notice and denied that Citu supporters had attacked Bagchi.        
	We had thought the maintenance job would be over in 15 days. But going by the situation, the shutdown may be longer, Gulati said.

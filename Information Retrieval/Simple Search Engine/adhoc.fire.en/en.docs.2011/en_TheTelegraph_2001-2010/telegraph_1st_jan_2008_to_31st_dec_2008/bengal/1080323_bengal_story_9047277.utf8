	Krishnagar, March 22: A member of the DYFI, the CPM youth wing, was called out of his home in Kalyani and hacked to death last night.        
	Sukanta Biswas, 24, was found dead with his throat slit in a field near his house, a few hundred yards from the Birpara primary school where he was a temporary teacher.         
	Biswass cellphone, on which his assailants had called him, was lying next to his body.         
	Biswas had been a secretary in the SFI-run students union in Kalyani University when doing his MCom there.        
	We have started a murder case on the basis of a complaint from the victims father. However, we are yet to ascertain the motive behind the murder, Nadia police superintendent H.K. Kusumakar said.         
	Some of Sukantas friends are being interrogated, the officer said.        
	Kusumakar added that the body had been sent for post-mortem.

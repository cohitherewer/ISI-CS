          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, March 14: Two lady teachers came to blows on a school corridor yesterday over their staff-room love interest, a new math teacher.        
	The ongoing annual exam at Kajora High School in Andal has been postponed after the cat-fight in which the teachers pulled hair, hit each other and hurled abuses.         
	Students rushed out of their exam halls and saw them trading blows.        
	Police said the 28-year-old math teacher had joined the school, 220km from Calcutta, recently. A 35-year-old English teacher and a 25-year-old junior school teacher lodged police complaints accusing the other of trying to snatch their love interest.         
	The headmaster said he was ashamed of the incident.

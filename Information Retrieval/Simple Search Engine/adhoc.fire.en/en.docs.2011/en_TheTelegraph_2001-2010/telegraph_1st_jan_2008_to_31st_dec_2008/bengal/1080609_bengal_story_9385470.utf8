                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Jail for parent tormentors

	Calcutta, June 8: The government will activate in the next Assembly session a central law to ensure that the heirs of the aged provide them with accommodation, food, medicines and recreational facilities.        
	According to the law, all legal heirs, whether they are in India or abroad, must also ensure the protection of their life and property.        
	We have already drafted the rules of the central act and they will be placed in the Assembly for approval next month, social welfare secretary Rinchen Tempo said.        
	The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, was passed by Parliament in December.        
	The state governments chief whip in the Assembly, Syed Mohammed Masih, said the rules of all central acts had to be placed in the House before implementation. Once placed, the central act will come into effect in Bengal.        
	Any violation of the law will result in three months imprisonment and a fine of up to Rs 5,000.        
	Under the new rules, the state will set up homes for the aged and tribunals in every subdivision.         
	The tribunals can take suo motu cognisance of reports of adult children or legal heirs, including grandchildren, neglecting senior citizens.        
	The elderly can approach the tribunals to speed up claims of maintenance  food, clothing, residence, medical attendance and treatment.        
	District magistrates will head appellate tribunals at the district level. If an applicant is not satisfied with the verdict of the maintenance tribunal, the person can move the appellate tribunal.        
	Only a few cases of negligence towards the aged are reported. Thousands more are in need of protection and support, said Tempo.        
	A committee, set up in April by the directorate of social welfare, has finalised the draft rules.         
	We have tried to make the draft rules as inclusive as possible, said Indrani Chakravarty, the chief of the Calcutta Metropolitan Gerontological Institute, who was part of the committee.        
	The act does not define recreational facilities, but Tempo said it means arranging for indoor games, books, newspapers, television and scope to socialise with peers. If a mo-ther likes playing caroms, she must be given the opportunity. Books and newspapers must be made available if the person likes to read. If she wishes to meet friends or relatives, it must be facilitated.        
	Officials said the government was concerned over increasing instances of parents moving court and going through lengthy trials after being tortured or humiliated by their children.        
	Last month, 88-year-old Hiranprabha Bhowmik was provided shelter by an NGO in Jalpaiguri after she was turned away by her six sons. She was suffering from severe nutrition deficiency and put on oxygen and saline.         
	After her plight was reported in The Telegraph on May 28, her sons brought her back.         
	Bengal now has 44 old-age homes and 30 day-care centres. A scheme is being worked out to increase the number of day-care centres and old-age homes, Tempo said.

             Chickens being taken for culling in Birbhum 
                 
	Sainthia (Birbhum), Jan. 23: CPM leaders campaigning among villagers to hand over their birds for culling fear that some of their resentment might reflect in the rural polls this summer.
    
	We are in a fix. The administration has asked us to ensure villagers hand over their birds to the culling teams. But many of them are reluctant first and angry once they have parted with them for a measly compensation, said Bhabani Pal, a member of the Bhromorkol village panchayat.
    
	The government is giving only Rs 40 for every country chicken or duck culled. They fetch Rs 80-100 at other times.
    
	The flu has come before the wounds from last years ration riots could heal. CPM leaders had been accused of colluding with corrupt ration dealers and attacked in many places.
    
	During the first few days of the outbreak, village leaders had stayed away from the culling campaign. Many are still averse to joining it. 
    
	Pal does not want to tell villagers to get their live birds killed. But a meeting on Monday decided the panchayat had to be more active in tackling the virus.
    
	Some of our partners, like the RSP, have been holding meetings highlighting the CPMs failure in handling the ration rage and the flu, Pal said. 
    
	Any miscalculated move now will affect our vote bank. 
    
	District leaders were tight-lipped on the possible flu fallout. This isnt the time to discuss such things, said Birbhum secretary Dilip Ganguly. 
    
	Yafat Seikh of Nalhati lost 26 full-grown chickens. They were dying one after the other and we had no clue to what was going on. No one from the party cared to tell us about the bird flu outbreak and suddenly we were told that a team was coming to kill our birds, he said. The party failed us.
    
	Ganguly admitted there was tremendous resistance to culling in the villages. We are trying to convince the villagers that its better to take the compensation while the birds are alive. If the birds die, there will be no compensation.
    
	The governments delay in disbursing compensation for culled birds has compounded problems. 
    
	They would give me a slip and ask me to collect the money from the panchayat office, 4km away. The babus could not even say when we would get the cash in hand, said an elderly resident of Budhigram.
    
	The culling team was heckled in the village last week by residents demanding on-the-spot compensation. 
    
	Former CPM chief of Bu-dhigram panchayat, Prabhat Mal, said: It is natural for villagers to turn against us if we fail to protect their interests.

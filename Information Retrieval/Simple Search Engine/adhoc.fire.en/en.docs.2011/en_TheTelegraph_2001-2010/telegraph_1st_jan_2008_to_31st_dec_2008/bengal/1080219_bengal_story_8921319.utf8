                                                                                                               Harass slur on DM
                            
	Feb. 18: The district information and cultural officer of Murshidabad, Mala Maitra, has accused district magistrate Subir Bhadra of sexual harassment.        
	In her complaint to the principal secretary of the information and cultural affairs department, Dilip Chakraborty, Maitra said Bhadra often visited her quarters in Behrampore town at night.        
	Sir, I was subjected to sexual harassment by him several times in the past three to four months. I cannot describe the magnitude in which the district magistrate harassed me sexually using his official position, she wrote. I was harassed at such length that I had to take a long leave. I could not concentrate on work.         
	Bhadra, 59, denied the allegations but admitted having a soft corner for Maitra. Yes I have a soft corner for her. But her allegations are baseless.        
	Maitra, 45, said she first lodged a complaint with the information secretary on November 17. Then she went on a months leave. Two subsequent complaints were lodged in January and February.        
	Im waiting for a response to my complaints. If I fail to get any, I will appeal to the President of India, said Maitra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Holes in blast claim
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Holes in blast claim
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 17: Forensic experts who visited the Basanti blast site yesterday have found inconsistencies in the explosion theory.        
	A second forensic team will visit irrigation minister and RSP leader Subhas Naskars ancestral home tomorrow.        
	The RSP has claimed that CPM activists hurled a bomb at the ministers house, killing Naskars nephews wife Gouri.        
	But the preliminary study by Central Forensic Science Laboratory experts has not thrown up any clear evidence to suggest that a blast had occurred. Rather, the house was reduced to ashes because of a devastating fire that spread through the room in a minute. Had a massive explosion taken place, debris would have been found scattered around the spot as things would have been flung away in its impact, said one forensic expert. But there is no such evidence.        
	The officials said it was possible some explosive material, like gun power, was there in the house and caught fire.        
	But a doctor at SSKM Hospital, where Gouri was admitted, said she mentioned before dying that she heard a loud sound.

	Margram, Jan. 17: Urine is more lethal to Birbhum police than the bird flu virus.
    
	Swadesh Chakraborty, a member of a rapid response team, had to pay a price today for responding to natures call on the premises of Margram police station, about 280km from Calcutta.
    
	A constable caught the flu fighter with his pants down and raised a stink. Chakraborty was soon rounded up, prompting his colleagues to cry foul. 
    
	Members of the animal resource development (ARD) team gheraoed the police station for about half an hour and forced its officer-in-charge, Swargadip Bose, to apologise and free Chakraborty.
    
	Chakraborty, a livestock development assistant, is stationed at the Margram block development office, which has been transformed into a makeshift control room for the anti-flu drive in Birbhum.
    
	As many as 450 ARD employees have been put up here but we have only four toilets, said a member of the rapid response team.
    
	All the flu fighters had been asked to report at the control room at 9 this morning. There were long queues in front of all the four toilets and it was impossible to get ready on time, an ARD employee said.
    
	So, Chakraborty decided to go to the Margram police station to relieve himself. But he got the timing wrong. 
    
	He (the constable) dragged him by the collar inside the police station and Chakraborty was detained, an ARD official said.
    
	When news reached the ARD employees, they were up in arms. With the situation threatening to spin out of control and the culling operation getting delayed, senior district officials intervened.
    
	Around 10am, the OC apologised and Chakraborty was released. 
    
	The culling teams set off for work around 11am, two hours behind schedule.

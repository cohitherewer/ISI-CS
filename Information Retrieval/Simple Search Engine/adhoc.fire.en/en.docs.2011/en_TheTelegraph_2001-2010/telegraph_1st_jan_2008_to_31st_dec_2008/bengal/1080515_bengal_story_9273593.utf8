	Darjeeling/Siliguri, May 14: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today decided against calling an indefinite strike in the hills, though police had failed to meet its seven-day deadline for arresting three CPM leaders.        
	The hill party had demanded the arrest of Jibitesh Sarkar, Mukul Sengupta and Shankar Ghosh, who had been named in an FIR for allegedly assaulting Morcha supporters on their way to a hunger strike at Hospital More in Siliguri on May 2. The Morcha deadline for their arrest elapsed yesterday.        
	The CPM has denied the charges against the trio.        
	Since the police have arrested six persons based on video recordings of the inci-dents and have forwarded them to court, we have decided not to start a fresh agitation from tomorrow, said Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri.         
	Political observers believe that the Morcha, which has revived the demand for a new Gorkhaland state, was under pressure to not call strikes as tourists have finally started trickling into Darjeeling. The hill economy largely depends on the two tourist seasons of the year.

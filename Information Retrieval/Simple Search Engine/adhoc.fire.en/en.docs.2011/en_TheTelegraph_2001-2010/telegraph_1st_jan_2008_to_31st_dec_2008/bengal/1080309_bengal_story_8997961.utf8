The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cops question Rizwan probe
                                                                                                               Cops question Rizwan probe
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 8: Four police officers accused in the Rizwanur Rahman case have challenged the legality of the CBI probe.        
	In their affidavits placed before the high court yesterday, Gyanwant Singh, Ajoy Kumar, Sukanti Chakraborty and Krishnendu Das also alleged that they had been falsely implicated.        
	Actually, they had tried to help settle the dispute between the Todi and Rahman families over Priyankas marriage with Rizwanur, a source close to the policemen said today.         
	The quartet have been charged with pressuring the couple to part at the behest of Priyankas industrialist father, Ashok Todi, and driving Rizwanur to death.        
	Since it has been already proved the Rizwanur Rahman had committed suicide and was not murdered, the charges brought against them by the Rahman family do not stand. So the court should acquit us, they said in the affidavits.        
	The four, however, said they would not be able to spell out their stand on the charges without going through the entire text of the CBI report.         
	The court had asked all nine respondents to reply to the allegations made by Rizwanurs family through affidavits before March 8. The four officers are the only ones yet to comply.        
	After hearing the arguments of the petitioners and the respondents, the court will decide if it should allow the CBI to proceed with the investigation and register criminal cases against those accused of abetting Rizwanurs suicide, legal experts said.

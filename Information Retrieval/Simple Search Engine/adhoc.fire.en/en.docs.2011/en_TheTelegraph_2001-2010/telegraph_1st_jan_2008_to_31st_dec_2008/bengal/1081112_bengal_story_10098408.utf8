	Cooch Behar, Nov. 11: A teacher of a well-known school in Cooch Behar was arrested last evening for allegedly molesting and attempting to rape the four-year-old daughter of his colleague who lived in the same building.         
	Ranjan Talukdar of Jenkins School was today remanded in police custody for 14 days.         
	The 32-year-old Bengali teacher hails from Jagachha, Howrah. In Cooch Behar, he lived in a rented house in Chitrakarpara.         
	There are serious charges against Talukdar. His colleague lodged an FIR with the Kotwali police station yesterday saying he had molested his daughter and tried to rape and sexually assault her. We arrested him last evening from a hotel in the town, said Cooch Behar police superintendent Devendra Prakash Singh this afternoon.         
	Medical tests were conducted on the child as well as Talukdar at MJN Hospital today.        
	The police said Talukdar and his colleague had been staying in the same building for the past few years.         
	The teacher had allegedly tried to rape the girl on November 8 at a time his wife, who had given birth to a child 20 days ago, was away in Howrah.         
	That day, the girl came back from his flat and told her parents the things he had tried to do to her. The parents understood that he had tried to molest her. The child was traumatised, as were the parents, said a police officer. It took them two days to decide to come to us and give details of the incident.        
	When he learnt an FIR had been lodged, Talukdar moved to a hotel and was planning to flee this morning.         
	The police vehicle in which he was brought to court today was surrounded by a mob that clamoured for tough punishment. If we have teachers with such character, what will we learn from them? That we study in a school which has been drawn into this dirty controversy is a shame, said a Class XI student of Jenkins School, established in 1861.

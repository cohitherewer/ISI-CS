	Sukna, July 22: An elephant, around eight years old, was knocked down by a train near Siliguri last night.    
	Foresters said it was crossing the tracks when hit by the Guwahati-Jhajha Express. The elephant was dragged for 100 metres before the train came to a stop near Gulma station, 15km from Siliguri. The stretch in the Dooars has been a death trap for animals since the tracks were made broad gauge a few years ago. Broad gauge trains run faster and their drivers find it difficult to stop on spotting animals.         
	Darjeeling: Hill lawyers have decided to end their strike from Wed-nesday following the home secretarys written assurance that the powers of the district court here would not be vested in Siliguri courts. Such a possibility had emerged as work in the hill courts was being frequently disrupted by bandhs.        
	Behrampore: The government has dissolved the Congress-controlled board of directors of the Bhagirathi Milk Co-operative in Murshidabad. The move followed allegations of corruption.        
	Calcutta: The state has 12 prisoners on death row, the jails minister told the Assembly on Tuesday.

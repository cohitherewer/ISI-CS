                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Karat in Calcutta today
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 4: CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan will be in Calcutta with senior comrades tomorrow as the Left decides when to formally withdraw support to the Centre.         
	Both leaders will attend a programme to mark the birth centenary of parliamentarian Hiren Mukherjee. Karat is li-kely to call on Jyoti Basu while Bardhan attends the CPI state council meeting.         
	The CPM state secretariat met today before apprising Karat about the latest poll setback in the municipal polls.         
	A large section of the CPM is worried about further erosion in its support among the educated urban middle class on the nuke deal. The opposition to the deal will also not cut ice with rural voters, a state leader said.        
	CPM central committee member Benoy Konar, however, said: If our position costs us some Lok Sabha seats, we are ready to pay the price.

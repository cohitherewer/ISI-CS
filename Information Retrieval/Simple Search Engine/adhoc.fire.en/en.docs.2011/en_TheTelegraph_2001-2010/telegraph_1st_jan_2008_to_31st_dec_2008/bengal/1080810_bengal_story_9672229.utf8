          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, Aug. 9: A labourer fell 100ft to his death after he slipped off a ladder in a welding shop at the Singur car plant this afternoon, in the second fatal plunge at the site in two days.         
	Twenty-five-year-old Ramprasad Ghosh, a resident of Dhubulia in Nadia district, had joined work at the Tata Motors plant only three days ago.        
	Yesterday, Jamshed Alam, a 24-year-old labourer from Bansberia in Hooghly dis-trict, died after falling off the roof of the same welding unit.        
	Eyewitnesses said Ghoshs head was smashed when he fell on a slab of concrete. There were at least 20 other labourers working at the unit when Ramprasad fell off the ladder.        
	The labourers took Ramprasad to Singur Rural Hospital, about a kilometre from the project site, but he was declared dead on arrival.        
	Ramprasad was climbing up the ladder and slipped while tying his safety belt to one of the rungs, said Rajendra Chowdhury, 35, a fellow labourer.        
	I saw him lying in a pool of blood with his head smashed.         
	The officer-in-charge of Singur police station, Priyabrata Bakshi, who visited the site, said the death was accidental.         
	The body has been sent for post-mortem and his relatives have been informed, the police officer added.        
	A spokesperson for Tata Motors said tonight Ramprasads family would be given compensation.

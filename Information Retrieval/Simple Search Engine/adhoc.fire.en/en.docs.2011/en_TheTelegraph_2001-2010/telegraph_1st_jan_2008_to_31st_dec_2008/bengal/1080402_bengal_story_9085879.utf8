The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hope to avert Haldia strike
                                                                                                               Hope to avert Haldia strike
          OUR BUREAU                              
	April 1: The Haldia Petrochemicals management today expressed hope of averting the April 8 strike citing its long-standing relationship with the CPMs labour arm, Citu.         
	The management is in talks with representatives of the union over the demand for permanent employment of 183 casual workers.        
	The discussions have progressed significantly, a statement issued by the management said. In the light of the long-standing, healthy and positive relationship with the union, we are confident that the issues under discussion will be resolved soon.        
	In Coimbatore, where top CPM leaders are attending a party congress, industries minister Nirupam Sen said the government did not want production hampered by labour trouble. Workers may have their demands. But we always call for talks to sort out differences so that production doesnt get hampered.         
	The minister has asked both sides to look for an amicable settlement.        
	CPM central committee member and Citu state president Shyamal Chakraborty, too, tried to strike a balance between workers grievances and the partys industry-friendly policies. Both the government and the Citu wants industrialisation without compromising workers rights.         
	However, he accused the management of not heeding the unions demand until the strike was called.         
	If the 24-hour strike is not called off, it will be the first such industrial action since the company began operations seven years ago.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was not in the mood to face queries over the strike when he entered the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University to meet industrialists. Amaake eshob proshno korben na. Ekhane eshob shunte ashini (Dont ask me such questions. I havent come here to listen to these), he said.        
	Haldia Petro union leader Ashok Patnaik said a final decision will be taken after Lakshman Seth, the district Citu president, returns from Coimbatore on April 5. He had approved the strike before leaving town.        
	Around 2pm today, Citu supporters demonstrated in front of the plant gate. We will campaign in favour of the strike till April 5, Patnaik said.

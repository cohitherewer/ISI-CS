	Krishnagar, March 2: At least 500 chickens were roasted alive when 50 houses caught fire in a Nadia village around 1am today.         
	The blaze started from a mosquito repellent coil burning in a hut and spread to 49 others in Dhapariya in Nakashipara. Most villagers are backyard poultry farmers.

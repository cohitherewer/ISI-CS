	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Saturday discussed the Darjeeling situation with Pranab Mukherjee when the foreign minister came to Calcutta with President Pratibha Patil.        
	Asked if Bhattacharjee spoke to him about Singur, Mukherjee said no, but sources close to the minister said the problem had figured in their chat at the airport.

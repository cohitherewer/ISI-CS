                                                                                                               CRPF thin, clashes in Nandigram 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Feb. 19: CPM and Trinamul supporters have resumed clashes in Nandigram since some CRPF and Indian Reserve Force personnel were pulled out yesterday and rushed to Orissa and Darjeeling.        
	At least 10 people have been injured and several houses ransacked, said a senior police officer.         
	East Midnapore superintendent of police S.S. Panda said two CRPF camps out of five at Khodambari High School had to be folded up as the jawans left for Orissa to tackle Maoists. There are about 100 personnel in a camp.         
	Two days ago, an Indian Reserve Force camp was withdrawn from nearby Daudpur and its personnel were sent to the hills in the wake of the anti-Subash Ghisingh agitation.         
	Over 400 Indian Reserve Force personnel had been on patrol in Nandigram since November.        
	The violence since yesterday is the first since central paramilitary forces were deployed in November after the CPMs bloody recapture of Nandigram.         
	Police said 33 CPM supporters were arrested yesterday on charges of stockpiling arms, attempt to murder and looting houses between January and November last year.         
	Of them, 18 were denied bail by the Haldia court today and remanded in a fortnights jail custody.        
	The clashes started around eight last night at Keyakhali near Takapura, about 4km from Daudpur.         
	Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee member Paritosh Das, 39, was hit with iron rods while returning home after being granted bail by the high court in connection with a rioting case.        
	He was admitted to the Tamluk district hospital with injuries on his head.         
	Over 200 supporters of the Trinamul-led committee came to Saifullachak, adjoining Daudpur, this morning and attacked CPM supporters. At least four CPM supporters were injured seriously.        
	Reinforcements were sent to Keyakhali and Saifullachak from Nandigram town. Armed police personnel are camping in the two villages.         
	Committee convener Abu Taher alleged that the CPM was behind the withdrawal of the paramilitary. It was done to help CPM cadres carry out attacks on us before the May panchayat polls.         
	CPM district secretariat member Ashok Guria said: The central forces were sent to Orissa and Darjeeling. We have nothing to do with their withdrawal.         
	Guria accused the committee of starting the clashes. Its members ransacked nine houses and looted them. Our supporters were attacked at many places. At least 30 people were rendered homeless.         
	A district official said both sides had been preparing for a showdown and took full advantage of the withdrawal of some central forces.

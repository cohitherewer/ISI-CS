          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 1: The Bengal Engineering and Science University has accepted a committees recommendation that the institution should not display grace marks on students mark sheets as it could affect their careers.        
	The board of management of the university accepted the recommendation of the committee at its meeting held on Friday, a university official said today.         
	The panel, headed by Bhaskar Sen, a member of the institutes board of management, was set up in July following protests from students and teachers against the decision to mention grace marks in mark sheets for the mid-semester examinations.        
	The students, some of whom had boycotted the June-July semester exams, and teachers had said the mark sheets should show only the total score on a subject.        
	The panel has also suggested to the authorities to take back the mid-semester mark sheets from the students and issue fresh ones without mentioning the grace marks.         
	The panel, however, urged the authorities to ensure that the universitys controller of examinations maintained a record of the total scores and the grace marks.

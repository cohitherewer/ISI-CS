          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 28: A blaze broke out in a rubber footwear factory in a Picnic Garden neighbourhood that was celebrating Diwali, prompting a firefight that stretched beyond four hours at 1am.         
	Factory authorities blamed firecrackers but law-enforcement officials refused to confirm this and the local MLA disputed the claim.        
	No casualties have been reported till late tonight. The factory was closed because of Diwali.        
	As many as 30 fire tenders  22 first and eight later  were sent to the two-storey factory located along Kushtia Road under Tiljala police station but the blaze could not be doused till 1am. Officials said the fire had been brought under control.        
	Flames from the 15,000sqft factory leaped to houses on the adjacent Raicharan Lane and licked some window frames. But firefighters, assisted by residents, doused the flames.        
	Our primary focus was to make sure that the nearby houses do not catch fire. So, we focused on keeping the fire confined to the factory, said Gopal Bhattacharya, the director of fire and emergency services, whose hand was injured in the operation.        
	The unit did not have any fire-prevention equipment. We will lodge an FIR against the factory authorities, Bhattacharya added. The officials could not establish the cause of the fire till 1am.        
	The factory authorities said crackers ignited the fire. However, MLA Javed Khan said: The factorys doors and windows were closed and no firecracker could have made its way into the unit.         
	The fire broke around 8.40pm. I was bursting firecrackers with my 12-year-old niece when I noticed flames behind my house. Soon, the flames started leaping towards my house. I vacated the house at once, said Sanjay Guha.        
	Fire services officials said the factory stocked rubber, adhesives, chemicals and sandals.        
	Around 9pm, another fire broke out at an embroidery unit on Rifle Range Road, under Karaya police station. Three tenders brought the fire under control within an hour.        
	Cracker arrests        
	More than 600 people were arrested in Calcutta for bursting or possessing banned firecrackers. In Salt Lake and Lake Town, 11 people were arrested for the same offences.

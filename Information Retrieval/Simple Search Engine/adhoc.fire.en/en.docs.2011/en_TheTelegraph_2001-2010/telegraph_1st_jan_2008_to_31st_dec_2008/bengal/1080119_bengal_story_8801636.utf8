 - Singur leader hints at shift of gear
    OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 18: Mamata Banerjee tried to put up a brave front today after the high court put a seal of approval on the land acquisition in Singur but her local MLA suggested a possible change of gear in the campaign.
    
	At a hurriedly convened news conference in her Harish Chatterjee Street house, Mamata said: The high courts verdict was not a setback for us... There will be no let-up in the anti-land acquisition movement.
    
	In Singur, Trinamul Congress MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya said: We are now stressing on a door-to-door campaign. We will tell landlosers not to lose heart. We are moving the Supreme Court.
    
	Many farmers were demoralised by the courts ruling, admitted the MLA whose supporters had launched smash-and-scoot attacks on the wall around the car plant over the past year and a half. A door-to-door campaign in Singur is the need of the hour, he said today. 
    
	The convener of the Save Farmland Committee, Becharam Manna, said the party would have to organise small group meetings among the disheartened farmers. 
    
	Mamata said she was up against a combined opposition put up by the Centre, the state government and the Tatas. We dont consider it (the verdict) a defeat. It has paved the way for us to move the Supreme Court. We have faith in the apex court.
    
	Asked about industries minister Nirupam Sens appeal to unwilling farmers to accept compensation cheques, an agitated Mamata said: He is acting as the Tatas agent. 
    
	Wherever the government tries to grab land from unwilling farmers for industrialisation, we shall launch protests, come what may. There will be no let-up in our anti-land acquisition movement, she thundered. 
    
	But the mood in her party reflected Bhattacharyas change of gear.
    
	MLA Sadhan Pande, who had opposed the movement against the states industrialisation drive, today said the party should have agitated demanding more compensation for the landlosers. A demand for more compensation would have benefited poor farmers whose land has been acquired for the Tata project. 
    
	A senior party functionary said the high court verdict would not only show the party in poor light but send a wrong message across the state about its stand against industrialisation.

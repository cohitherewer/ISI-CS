                                                                                                               4 injured in Nandi clash 
                            
	March 15: Four CPM and Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee supporters were injured in Nandigram this morning in a clash over a school poll.        
	Police said a CPM duo were attacked while campaigning for the March 30 Rajaramchak High School managing committee elections, triggering the fight. Manoj Das, a committee conveners brother, and Trinamul Congress leader Gouri Panda had to be hospitalised. Their shops were ransacked.        
	The trouble erupted a day after the anniversary of the police firing that left 14 dead.        
	East Midnapore police chief S.S. Panda said 11 committee members, including convener Ashok Karan and panchayat member Ashok Mondal, were held early this morning in connection with murder and looting last year.

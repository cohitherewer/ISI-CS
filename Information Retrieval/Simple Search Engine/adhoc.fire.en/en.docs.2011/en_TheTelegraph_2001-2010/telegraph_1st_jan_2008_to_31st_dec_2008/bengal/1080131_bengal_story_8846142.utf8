     OUR LEGAL REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 30: The high court today ordered the government to give pension with interest to a retired Dum Dum municipality resident medical officer whose appointment had not been sanctioned by the state.
    
	Justices Tapen Sen and Tapan Kumar Dutta said: There is no point holding the employee responsible. It is the responsibility of the government to approve the appointment. The employee cannot be denied of the statutory benefit for the fault committed by the state.
    
	Debanjan Biswas, who retired in 2000 after working for 17 years in the municipality, will be entitled to 9 per cent interest on his arrears if the government pays him within 30 days. Beyond that, the government will have to pay 10 per cent.
    
	The order will help at least 20,000 municipal employees in the state whose services were not sanctioned by the government till retirement. 
    
	Municipal employees come under the purview of the directorate of local bodies, a part of the municipal affairs department, which bears the expenses on account of their salary and other benefits.

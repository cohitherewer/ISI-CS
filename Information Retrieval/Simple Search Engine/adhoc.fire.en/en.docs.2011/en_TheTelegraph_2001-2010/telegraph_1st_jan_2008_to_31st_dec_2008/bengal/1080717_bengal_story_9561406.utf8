                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bridge across Torsha, 55 years on

	Cooch Behar, July 16: Fifty-five years to cross the Torsha, less than 500 metres from one bank to the other.         
	A bridge, the first survey for which was conducted six years after Independence, was thrown open to the people 12km from Cooch Behar town today.        
	We had given up hope. But now it is there, said Basudeb Barman, 72, who used to see engineers take measurements with tapes and other tools wearing shorts in the50s        
	Better late than never, Burman said. The bridge will cut travel time to Siliguri by two hours.        
	Siliguri will now be only a two-hour drive. The bridge will reduce the distance between Cooch Behar and Siliguri by about 45km, said Nirmal Mondal, the PWD executive engineer of the department here.        
	Part of National Highway 31, the 454m long and 11m wide bridge connects Pundibari with Falakata.        
	After the first survey in 1953, problems cropped up one after the other. In the mid-70s, a movement for the bridge began, following which a fresh survey was held in 1981.        
	After 10 pillars were erected in 1993, the contractor, Macintosh Burn, stopped work, demanding more funds because of losses in floods. The company quit the project in 2001. Delays plagued the bridge even after construction was completed in January this year. The opening had to be put off because of the rural polls in May.        
	Work resumed in 2006 under a north Bengal-based organisation, Gaur Chandra Dutta and Co, the third firm to take up construction.        
	Three ministers  Kshiti Goswami, Ananta Roy and Monohar Tirkey  were present at the opening today.         
	The record set by the bridge is not something to be proud of, admitted Goswami, the PWD minister.

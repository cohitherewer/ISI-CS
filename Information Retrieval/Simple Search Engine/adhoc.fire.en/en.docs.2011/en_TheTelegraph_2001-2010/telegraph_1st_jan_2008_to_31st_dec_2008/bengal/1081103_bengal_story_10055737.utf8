                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Many plans for Singur: Buddha

	Salboni, Nov. 2: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said there were many proposals on the governments table to use the land left by Tata Motors in Singur.         
	We are going to announce our next project there soon, the chief minister said after inaugurating the Jindal steel plant at Salboni.         
	He said he was discussing the proposals with industries minister Nirupam Sen.        
	Of the 997 acres marked for the Nano plant, 647 acres were leased out to Tata Motors for 90 years. Bhattacharjee said the state could get the land back from the Tatas any day it wanted.         
	He also said Singur was an exception as things are happening in other parts of the state.        
	This (industry) is our future. You should forget what happened in Singur and look ahead.         
	Bhattacharjee expressed happiness that residents of Salboni had come out of their homes to support the project. What I liked best here is that the local people came out and supported the project from the core of their heart. They are sincerely co-operating with the company, he said.        
	Asked why this support was missing in Singur, he said: Ask the Opposition.        
	At Singur, unwilling farmers had launched an agitation with the Trinamul Congresss support that subsequently drove the Nano project out of Bengal.        
	If a factory goes away, it is not an insult to the government, but an insult to Bengal. Its not the governments loss but the states loss. I urge the Opposition not to be destructive, Bhattacharjee said.        
	Asked what had gone wrong in Singur that was corrected in Salboni, he shot back: I dont think so. We wanted to set up an automobile plant (in Singur). There was nothing wrong in it.        
	At the public meeting that soon became like a rally venue with thousands of villagers in attendance, Bhattacharjee urged the Opposition to settle differences of opinion through dialogue.         
	He thanked state Congress representatives for attending the meeting.         
	The Trinamul put up posters to erected gates to welcome Jindal.        
	Paswan assurance        
	The Union minister for chemicals and fertilisers, Ram Vilas Paswan, said Bengals case for the chemical hub at Nayachar would be sent to high-powered committee next week and then to the cabinet for the final approval.        
	He also said the Centre would ask private players to revive fertiliser plants in Haldia and Durgapur soon.

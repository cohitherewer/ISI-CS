	Chennai, Aug. 4 (PTI): A 30-year-old call centre trainer here has been arrested for raping a colleague after spiking her drink.         
	The victim had accompanied her trainer, Jijulal Nair, to his friends house in Thoraipakkam after work in Perungudi on Saturday.         
	Late at night, when she was about to leave for her hostel, Nair gave her a drink. Soon after, she blacked out. Next morning, she allegedly found herself naked in bed with Nair.         
	The woman, from Kallakurichi in Villupuram, returned to her hostel in Saidapet and got a scolding from her warden for staying out without permission. She was asked to vacate the hostel immediately or bring her parents.         
	The girl told her father, a sugar mill employee, about the incident. He rushed to Chennai and lodged a complaint with Thoraipakkam police.         
	Nair said he had the womans consent and that she knew she was drinking beer and not a soft drink.         
	The police booked Nair under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ore rush leads to port jam
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Ore rush leads to port jam
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Dec. 25: A shortage of tug vessels and a sudden surge in iron ore export have led to a congestion of ships near Haldia port.        
	Calcutta Port Trust sources said over 40 ships were stuck near the sand head since the past two days. A sudden rise in the number of vessels coming in to load iron ore for export led to the congestion, said A.K. Chanda, chairman of the port trust.         
	A port trust official said two of the six tug vessels, used to tow big ships in and out of the port, have been idle for the past two days after mechanical defects.        
	One tug has been sent for from Calcutta and two others have been hired from other places to tackle the problem. We expect things to improve from tomorrow, said Chanda. Other port officials, however, said it would take four to five days for the situation to become normal.        
	The second problem is the rise in the number of ships waiting load iron ore for export.         
	Chanda said ore exports slumped had in the past four to five months because of the economic downturn.         
	On average, 0.75 million tonnes of ore are shipped from the Haldia port, which had dipped to around 0.2 million tonnes.         
	But two steps by the government boosted ore exports. As the government has waived export duty on iron ore and even the railways have reduced the freight charges, ore exports have got a big push, said Chanda.         
	Today, 14 ships were anchored at the port, all to load iron ore. Loading each ship takes nearly three days and Haldia has four separate berths for the purpose.         
	This is the reason why the ships have to be kept waiting at the sand heads, Chanda said.

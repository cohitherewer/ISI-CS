	Bolpur, Sept. 21: Nearly 200 people, including 100 children from four Birbhum villages fell ill this evening after having ice cream from a street vendor.        
	Residents of Sherpur, Bataspur, Badha and Panisile villages in Rampurhat, about 270km from Calcutta, caught hold of the vendor and handed him over to police.        
	Villagers began trickling in to the Rampurhat subdivisional hospital from 6.30pm.         
	They complained of severe stomach cramp, vomiting and headache.        
	By 10pm, about 100 children had been admitted and a dozen of them were put on saline drip.         
	The adults were released after preliminary treatment.        
	The ice cream vendor is very popular and we often buy popsicles from him at Rs 2 a piece. This afternoon, I had ice cream with some of my friends. After I returned home, I vomited several ti- mes and had a splitting headache, said Debasish Modal, 12, of Bataspur.        
	Giving him company at the hospital was four-year-old Sabina Khatoon, from Badha, who had bought an orange ice lolly.        
	As news of people falling ill spread, the villagers launched a search for the ice cream seller.         
	When he was found in Sherpur, he had sold all his ice creams.         
	The villagers grabbed the vendor by his collar and slapped him. Then they took him in a bus to Rampurhat police station, around 8km from Sherpur.         
	The police have detained the vendor.        
	The man told the police that the ice creams were from a factory at Kamarpatti in Rampurhat town.         
	We are interrogating the ice cream seller and health officials have sent samples for tests, Birbhum superintendent of police L.N. Meena said.         
	District chief medical officer of health Sunil Kumar Bhowmik said tests would be conducted to find out if the ice creams contained any toxic substance.

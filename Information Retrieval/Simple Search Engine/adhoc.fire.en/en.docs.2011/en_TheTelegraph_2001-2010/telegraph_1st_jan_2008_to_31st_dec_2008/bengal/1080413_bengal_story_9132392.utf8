          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Calcutta, April 12: The widow of SUCI leader Bidhan Chatterjee, who had held rising corruption in the party responsible for his suicide, today said she had no such complaint.        
	As my husband, I respected him. But he was working against the interests of our party, which I cannot support. I agree with what the party has said about him, said Bulbul Aich, herself an SUCI member.        
	In a statement to police this evening, she said she did not believe the party was responsible for her husbands death.         
	Chatterjee (in picture above) had been expelled from the SUCI after his letter to state secretary Pravas Ghosh blaming him for corruption in the party reached its office on Tuesday night.        
	In the letter, Chatterjee, 59, had said he was going to take his life in protest against the corruption and held Ghosh responsible for the death.         
	He was found dead in a Puri hotel on Thursday.        
	His body was today brought to the city unsung. Chatterjees nephew, niece and po-licemen from Behala, where he lived, came with it.         
	None of the top SUCI lea-ders were there to pay tributes to Chatterjee at the funeral parlour where the body was kept initially.         
	Bulbul said: An FIR hasnt been filed as we have no allegation or complaint against anybody or the party. I gave the letter saying this to the police today.        
	South 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar admitted that Bulbuls statement would weaken any possible case of abetment against Ghosh.        
	As Chatterjee had pledged his body for research, it was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital.        
	Kharba bypoll        
	The bypoll to the Kharba Assembly seat in Malda was held peacefully today.         
	The death of its Congress MLA had necessitated the poll. The result would be declared on Wednesday.

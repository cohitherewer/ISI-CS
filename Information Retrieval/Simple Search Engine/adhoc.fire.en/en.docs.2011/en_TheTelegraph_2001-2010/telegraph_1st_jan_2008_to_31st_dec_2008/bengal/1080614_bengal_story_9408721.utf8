                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Left allies call for tactical flexibility 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Calcutta, June 13: The CPM state secretariat today tried to accommodate two shades of opinion in the party and the Left Front on how to tackle the Darjeeling situation, approving the governments move to invite the Morcha for talks on June 18 while subtly rejecting its demand for statehood.        
	The chief minister had earlier said talks could be held only if the hill party dropped the demand for Gorkhaland but sections of the CPM and the allies want the government to be tactically flexible.         
	Before the Gorkhaland movement of the 1980s revisits us, we must ensure that our party is not isolated. The all-party meeting is aimed at making both the Opposition and the allies committed to the cause of the states integrity, a CPM state secretariat member said. The talks offer is to prove we are not rigid. Now the ball is in the Centres court.        
	The chief ministers invite asking the allies and the Opposition to join the all-party policy-making meeting on June 17 said: I invite your constructive suggestions to protect the states integrity and peaceful atmosphere in the wake of recent movements in Darjeeling hills and adjoining areas.         
	His letter to Bimal Gurung stressed on restoration of normalcy and maintenance of law and order while offering to discuss the Morchas grievances, if any.         
	The allies didnt like the mention of the chief ministers resolve to protect the states integrity. Its imposing a condition on the talks and ultimately hindering the peace move, said Manju Majumder, whose party, the CPI, supports demands for a separate Telengana and Vidarbha.        
	For RSP leader Kshiti Goswami, it is a question of tactical flexibility. No mainstream party can support Bengals split but its better not to make it a condition for talks.        
	The Blocs Ashok Ghosh felt the grievances of north Bengal for lack of development were making communities restive.

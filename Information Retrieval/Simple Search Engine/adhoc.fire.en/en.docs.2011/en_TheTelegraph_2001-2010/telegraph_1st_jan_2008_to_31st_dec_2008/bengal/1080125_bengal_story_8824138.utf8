     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Jan. 24: Nandigram couldnt do it, but the bird flu has brought Mamata Banerjee on board. 
    
	The Trinamul leader has for the first time decided to collaborate with the government by attending all-party meetings across the state on fighting the flu.
    
	We are really impressed with the presence of Trinamul Congress representatives at almost all the all-party meetings, animal resource development minister Anisur Rahman said today. 
    
	The Trinamul had been boycotting all-party meetings on land acquisition for industry for over two years. 
    
	Sources said Mamata had directed party functionaries to stand by the government at this hour of crisis.
    
	We dont oppose the government simply for oppositions sake. We believe in constructive politics and that is why we should all stand by the government, shedding our anti-CPM stand, Mamata told a meeting of some of her key aides.

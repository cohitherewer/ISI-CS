	Saurav Saha Roy, a Class VI student of Don Bosco, Liluah, was allegedly abducted after a pool car dropped him near his house at Belurbazar around 3pm. Sauravs father, a doctor, called police when he did not return home. Two men in jeans  one of them had long hair  allegedly took him away. They took me to the Ganga bank and asked me to wait.

	Calcutta, Feb. 4: A young man was beaten to death last night by neighbours who accused him of throwing stones at their house in South 24-Parganas Baruipur.
    
	Debasish Sardar, 25, and his father Kamal, 51, were both hit. Debasish died.
    
	Police said some unidentified persons had allegedly hurled stones at Ananta Sardars tin roof. 
    
	Around 11 last night, Anantas family rushed out hearing stones hit their roof. They knocked on their neighbours door and Debasish stepped out. The beating began immediately.
    
	There were two attackers initially, but the number grew soon. Hearing Debasish scream for help, his father came out and got beaten up, an officer said. The attackers fled as Debasish slumped to the ground. 
    
	Two persons, both neighbours, have been detained.
    
	Debasishs uncle Gopal accused Anantas family of picking fights regularly over farmland or fruit trees. The murder was planned, he alleged.

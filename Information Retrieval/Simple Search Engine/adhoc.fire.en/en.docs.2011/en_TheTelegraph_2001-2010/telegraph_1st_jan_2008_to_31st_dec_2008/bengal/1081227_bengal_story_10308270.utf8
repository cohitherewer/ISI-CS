                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Dread shuts up charred village

	Madhupur (Salboni), Dec. 26: Maoists may be trying to foist a polite face in Calcutta, but Madhupur village clammed up today out of fear for the rebels.        
	Around 25 armed Maoists had descended on the West Midnapore village yesterday and set ablaze the home of a CPM leader who had organised protests against their violence.         
	Dont ask us about yesterdays Maoist raid. We may be the next target if we are seen talking to you, said a farmer who lives next to Niranjan Deb Singhas gutted house.        
	Two bullocks belonging to Niranjan have been starving outside his burnt house since yesterday. We didnt dare to provide them a drop of water, let alone fodder since the Maoists had told us yesterday not to have any links with the CPM leader, said the CPM leaders neighbour.        
	The Maoists had also raided the home of another CPM leader, Kamalakanta Deb Singha, in a neighbouring village.         
	Both Niranjan and Kamalakanta had fled their homes with their families before the attack.         
	The Maoists had grilled villagers to find out who all had joined Wednesdays procession against them. Some were even forced to join a pro-Maoist procession.         
	Posters and leaflets saying how Saktipada Mahato, a CPM leader at Gadra village, 2km away, had given an undertaking promising to snap ties with the corrupt CPM were distributed among the villagers in the procession.         
	They asked us to follow in the footsteps of Saktipada, said Pabitra Deb Singha, 55, a widow who stays alone after her four daughters got married. I walked in the procession out of fear, she said.        
	All shops in the village mart were shut today. We are living in fear, said Bapi Deb Singha, who owns a cycle repairing shop.

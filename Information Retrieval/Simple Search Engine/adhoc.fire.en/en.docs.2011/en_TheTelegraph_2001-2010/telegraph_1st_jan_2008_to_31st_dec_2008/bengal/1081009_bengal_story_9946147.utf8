          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Oct. 8: A boy born to a 22-year-old woman yesterday morning was allegedly swapped with a girl child at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.        
	Ayesha Begum of Alampur, about 8km from Burdwan town, claimed that she had given birth to a son before she could be wheeled into the labour room.         
	My sister was admitted on Monday night. Around 6am on Tuesday, she was in labour and the boy was born on her bed in the maternity ward before she could be taken into the labour room, said Ayeshas elder brother Ujjwal.        
	Her elder sister, Marjina, said she saw the baby before Ayesha was wheeled into the labour room. Relatives of other patients were also there when the boy was born, but the nurse handed over a girl to the mother three hours later. We will not accept it.        
	Following the mothers complaint, hospital superintendent Tamal Kanti Ghosh has set up a five-member probe panel headed by his deputy.        
	Deputy superintendent Dilip Kumar Jha said that the committee would hold a meeting with the parents of both newborns. If we can solve the problem through discussions, well and good. Or else, we will have to go for a DNA test.        
	According to the complaint, about half an hour after Ayeshas child was born, Tapasi Khetrapal, 23, went into labour.        
	Tapasi, 23, of Raina, about 35km from Burdwan town, left the hospital with a boy around 11am yesterday.        
	Ayesha, 28, claims that the girl child handed over to her is actually Tapasis. We have asked Tapasi to bring the child immediately. However, the Khetrapals told us they could not hire a vehicle to reach Burdwan town because of Puja, said Jha.        
	If we find there has been a case of baby swapping, we will take action against the doctor and nurses on duty, said Jha.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Kshiti calls Buddha a kid
                                                                                                               Kshiti calls Buddha a kid
                            
	Tamluk, March 30: RSP leader Kshiti Goswami today called Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee an overgrown kid.         
	Buddhababu often behaves like a kid and I wonder when this buro khoka (overgrown kid) will learn not to say such things, he said, referring to the chief ministers distinction between us (CPM cadres) and them (Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee activists) after the CPMs November recapture of Nandigram.        
	Bhattacharjee had said: We (the CPM) paid them (committee supporters) back in their own coin.        
	Goswami, the PWD minis-ter in Bhattacharjees cabin-et, had threatened to quit over Nandigram but did not. He had been elected to the Assembly from Dhakuria with CPM support.        
	At Chandpur, about 15km from Nandigram, Goswami today called ally Forward Bloc the backward Bloc for its flip-flop on going it alone in the panchayat polls.

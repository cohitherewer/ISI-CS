          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Singur, Aug. 8: The CPM is finalising plans for an indefinite dharna at the Singur car plant to counter a similar demonstration lined up by Mamata Banerjee from August 24.        
	The agitation to push for security of project employees will be given final shape at a meeting of the Left Fronts Hooghly district committee on August 12. No date has been finalised so far but it is likely to begin before Mamata kicks off her serial demonstrations from August 24.         
	We have convened a meeting on August 12 to discuss the nitty-gritty of our indefinite sit-in, Hooghly MP Anil Basu said today.         
	Makeshift camps  similar to the ones Trinamul has lined up along the Nano plant boundary  will be set up. The Left Front workers plan to peacefully demonstrate demanding safety and security of the project employees, Basu said.        
	On August 22, two days before the Trinamul starts its protests, industries minister Nirupam Sen will address CPM workers in Singur. Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty and state secretariat member Benoy Konar will also be present, Basu said.        
	The build-up to the agitation will begin this Sunday, when the CPMs youth wing will organise a rally at the Singur station grounds, Basu said.         
	On August 13, members of the Ganatantrik Mahila Samity, the womens wing of the CPM, will march from Kamarkundu station to Singur to protest Mamatas disruptive politics, he said.        
	Plant worker dead        
	A temporary day labourer died this evening after falling six metres at the Tata Motors main plant. Jamshed Alam, 24, was scaling down an iron structure when he slipped and fell, police said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Tehatta (Nadia), May 7: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said he had wanted to transform Nandigram into a bustling industrial hub and that he was fed up with the Oppositions movement against it.        
	I am fed up with what the Opposition is doing in Nandigram and Singur, the chief minister said at a campaign meeting in Nadias Tehatta, about 150km from Calcutta.        
	We had wanted to transform Nandigram into an industrial hub like Haldia but it was not possible because of the resistance put up by the Opposition. Because of the Opposition, even today I have to repeatedly explain the land acquisition for the small-car factory (in Singur), he said.        
	Singur will wear a new look once the factory comes up, he said. Go to Singur after some time. You will understand whether we committed a mistake by acquiring farmland for industry. Around 6,000 people will get jobs.        
	The chief minister iterated that the proposed chemical hub at Nayachar would draw companies from across the world. Industries like polymer, rubber and textile will provide jobs to thousands of people.        
	Efforts to industrialise Bengal will continue, the chief minister said. We have excess workers in agriculture. They are not well paid. The need of the hour is to shift these farm hands to industry.

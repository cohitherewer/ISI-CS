                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Guns blaze across Nandi canal
                            
	Tamluk, July 29: After a night-long gunfight across the Talpatti canal that divides Nandigram and Khejuri, some 50 Trinamul Congress supporters fled their homes in CPM stronghold Sherkhanchowk.        
	The trouble started last evening when Trinamul supporters in Khejuris Sherkhanchowk and adjoining areas organised a procession with the help of the party unit at Gokulnagar in Nandigram. That was the first Opposition procession in Khejuri in 15 years.        
	CPM cadres allegedly hurled bombs to disrupt the procession. From 9pm, gunshots were fired and bombs hurled from both the CPM and Trinamul sides of the canal.        
	Gauranga Hazra, 48, crossed the Tekhali bridge and fled to Gokulnagar this morning.         
	After winning all 10 gram panchayats in Nandigram, we had gathered the courage to organise the rally, said Gauranga, now hiding in a bakery.        
	East Midnapore police chief S.S. Panda said: These are small incidents.

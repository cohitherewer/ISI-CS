The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Kshiti girl takes SFI to police 
                                                                                                               Kshiti girl takes SFI to police 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                           Kasturi Goswami outside Gariahat police station. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)      
	Calcutta, March 11: RSP minister Kshiti Goswamis daughter Kasturi has gone to police, accusing SFI supporters of preventing her from filing nomination for her college polls.        
	The South Calcutta Law College student alleged that the queue for nomination forms was crammed with supporters of the CPM students wing this morning so that Opposition candidates could not make it to the counter at all. They kept pushing in their people into the queue. By the time we reached the counter, it was past 10. The principal refused to hear us out, Kasturi said.         
	With no opposition member filing nomination, SFI won the 18 seats uncontested.        
	SFI supporters were accused of pushing Kasturi and her two comrades  of the RSPs Progressive Students Union  against a wall.        
	The SFI, too, lodged a police complaint, accusing Kasturi of creating trouble on the campus.        
	Kasturis father, PWD minister Kshiti, has been a bitter critic of the CPM of late, though he continues to be part of the CPM-led government.

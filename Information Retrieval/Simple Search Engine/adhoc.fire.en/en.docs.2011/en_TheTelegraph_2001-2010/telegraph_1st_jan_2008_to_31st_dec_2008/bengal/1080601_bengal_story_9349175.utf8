The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | IBM Research to test waters
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   IBM Research to test waters
  - Minister says US computer giant keen on centre         A STAFF REPORTER                          The Thomas J Watson Research Centre of IBM in New York                                        
	Calcutta, May 31: IBM Research has shown interest in investing in Bengal, IT minister Debesh Das said today.         
	The company is one of at least 14 US infotech firms that are expected to explore the state from June onwards.        
	Officials at the Thomas J. Watson Research Centre of IBM Research have shown keenness to set up a research and development centre in the state. We are really excited, Das said at the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce today.        
	IBM Research, established in 1961, has eight laboratories in six countries and has many Nobel laureates working on its projects. The Watson centre is IBM Researchs headquarters.        
	During my visit to the US and the UK this month, I met 30 IT companies in the Silicon Valley and Boston. Not all are coming to India. A few have operations in other states. But more than 14 have expressed keenness to explore investment possibilities in this state, Das said.         
	Some of the companies will come to finalise MoUs with local partners.        
	The Watson centre officials visited Calcutta in April. More visits are expected in the next few months with the Watson lab asking Dass department to outline a proposal highlighting areas of possible collaboration.        
	Although they are interested in supercomputers, we see more synergy in working on silicon chips and solar-based photovoltaic cells, Das said.        
	Early last year, Christopher Caine, vice-president of government business at IBM, met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Das to discuss the companys engagements in government initiatives.        
	The areas of interest included partnering the state in the first chip design centre in the city (a Rs 400-crore venture), e-governance, the education sector and IT security applications.        
	Signet Solar, a US-based silicon photovoltaic cell-maker, is keen to set up a manufacturing facility in the state. It has expanded its production capacity in Chennai. Such solar-based projects would entail an investment of around Rs 200 crore, Das said.        
	There are also companies like UniSolar, which manufactures thin film solar laminates, looking for a joint venture partner in the state.        
	LED Engine Company, which specialises in new-age lighting technology, has signed an MoU with the Bengal-based Jain Group of industries, Das said.        
	An American company that provides radio-frequency identification solutions to Walmart will also come to Calcutta to explore the opportunities for a development centre.        
	The IT department will sign an MoU with Mobidough, which enables bill payment and money transfer through mobiles.

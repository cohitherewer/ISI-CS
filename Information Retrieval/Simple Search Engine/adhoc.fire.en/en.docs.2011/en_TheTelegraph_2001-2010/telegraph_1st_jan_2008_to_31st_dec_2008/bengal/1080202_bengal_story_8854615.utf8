     OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
               
	Calcutta, Feb. 1: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and other leaders of the CPM told partner RSP at a bilateral meeting today that they would stick to their drive for industrialisation. 
    
	The chief minister asked RSP leaders Kshiti Goswami, Biswanath Chowdhury, Debabrata Bandopadhyay and Manoj Bhattacharya to go through his speech at the CPM state party conference and find out the deviations that they had been complaining about.
    
	At the December meet, the chief minister had described the violence in Nandigram as an aberration and urged his partys rank and file to move ahead with the task of industrialisation with the courage of conviction. He also stressed on complimentary development of farm-based economy. 
    
	The RSP leaders said the delegates at the CPM conference had supported industrialisation but cautioned against a repeat of Nandigram. 
    
	The delegates had also sought better compensation and rehabilitation packages for landlosers and warned their leaders against playing up the possibility of job generation in capital-intensive industries. 
    
	The concerns within the CPM had vindicated our position, an RSP leader said.
    
	Goswami said: All we want is that the partners should not be bypassed before major policy decisions are taken. 
    
	The CPMs other recalcitrant ally, the Forward Bloc, has decided to contest the rural polls in Bengal and the Assembly polls in Tripura on its own. 
    
	RSP state secretary Bandopadhyay made it clear that his party will not leave the CPM- led ruling front. It fears political isolation in a state where voters are divided between the front and the Trinamul and the Congress. Weve been with the CPM since 1966 except for our brief estrangement in 1971, which did not help us much, an RSP veteran said.

	Calcutta, Jan. 14: The high court today rejected the anticipatory bail pleas of 20 Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee leaders apprehending arrest in connection with the murder of four CPM supporters in Nandigram.
    
	Among the 20 was conve-ner Abu Taher, who alleged- ly led a mob that chased Dil- ip Mondal across paddy fields last April, dragged him out of his house and hacked him to death in Garchakraberia. 
    
	On November 6, Taher was said to be at the forefront of a gang that hurled bombs and killed three people.
    
	The petitioners lawyer said the allegations were politically motivated, but the court did not accept the argument. Sheikh Abdus Samad, Sheikh Sufiyan and Swadesh Ranjan Adhikary were among the others denied anticipatory bail.
    
	The court, however, granted the pleas of at least 800 other committee members apprehending arrest in 45 cases in Nandigram between March 15 and November last year.
    
	Taher said: I have been falsely implicated in 21 cases. It will take some time to get anticipatory bail. 
    
	Starvation death
    
	A 77-year-old man has allegedly died of starvation in Bel- pahari, West Midnapore. The Binpur II BDO, however, said Kunu Sabar died of age-related ailments on December 21.

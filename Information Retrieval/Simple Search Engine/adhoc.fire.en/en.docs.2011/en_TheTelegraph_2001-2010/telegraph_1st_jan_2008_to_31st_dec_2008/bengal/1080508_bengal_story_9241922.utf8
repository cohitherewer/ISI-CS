	Purulia, May 7: A rampaging herd of elephants trampled to death two villagers in Purulia this evening.         
	The herd from Jharkhand crossed the Silli forest and descended on Kanakpur village in Jhalda, about 350km from Calcutta.         
	Janki Mahato, 35, was tilling her land when she was attacked. The elephants then headed towards Rangamati village in Bagmundi where Sudhir Singh Sardar, 50, was taking his goats back home.         
	Divisional forest officer K. Bala Murugan said a team has been rushed to drive away the elephants.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Non-BEd, but better in SSC test 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 4: Candidates without BEd degrees have fared better this year in teachers recruitment test by the School Service Commission (SSC) than those who have done the course.        
	As many as 10,332 candidates have been selected to fill vacancies in state-aided secondary schools across Bengal. Of them, 6,748 candidates did not have BEd degrees.         
	We started noticing the trend last year. A preliminary analysis reveals that the non-BEd candidates are more meritorious than those who are BEd-qualified, said Ranajit Basu, the chairman of the West Bengal School Service Commission.         
	The performance of non-BEd candidates was better than the BEd-qualified examinees last year, too.         
	Of the 13,431 posts, 3,099 will remain vacant as sufficient numbers have not qualified for some reserved posts, particularly in the Scheduled Tribe category.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          Sneha                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 6: A 14-year-old girl died when the rickshaw taking her to school came under the wheels of a mini-bus in Regent Park this morning.        
	Sneha Roy was thrown on the road after an auto-rickshaw hit the cycle rickshaw. The driver of the mini-bus, coming from the opposite direction, did not see her and ran her over.         
	The Class IX student of Swami Pranabananda Vidyapith near Kudghat was to have written her environmental science paper today.        
	A resident of M.B. Sarani in Regent Park, Sneha was the only child of Jagadish Chandra Roy, a senior customs officer, and Tandra Roy, a central government employee.         
	Her father was away in Durgapur when the accident took place.        
	Krishna Biswas, the familys domestic help who was taking Sneha to school, said the girl was sitting on her right.        
	We had just reached the crossing of Chandi Ghosh Road when the auto-rickshaw hit us from behind. Both of us and the rickshaw-puller fell on the road. Within seconds, the mini-bus crushed her under its wheels. Then I briefly lost consciousness, Krishna said.        
	A group of passers-by took the three to M.R. Bangur hospital, where Sneha was declared dead.        
	Krishna and the rickshaw-puller were given first-aid and discharged.        
	A crowd blocked Chandi Ghosh Road for an hour and blamed the traffic policemen on duty for the mishap.        
	The traffic policemen posted at the site are always busy collecting money from passing trucks, alleged Bimal Mondal, a local resident.         
	Police have seized the mini-bus and the auto-rickshaw. The drivers of both vehicles fled the spot.        
	The headmistress of Snehas school said no classes would be held on Monday. We will hold a condolence meeting on Tuesday, Sreela Sengupta said.

	Midnapore, Oct. 2: Hawkers clashed with police in Midnapore town after their stalls near the police superintendents bungalow were demolished this morning.        
	The pitched battle went on for four hours till the Rapid Action Force and State Armed Police personnel arrived.        
	The hawkers, who sell garments, utensils and stationery, said their stalls were demolished without prior notice. They were upset as the drive was carried out when they were doing brisk business before Puja. We have been doing business here for over five years. Todays drive was sudden and unjust, coming before Puja, said Sankar Das, district secretary of the All Bengal Small Hawkers Samiti.         
	Asked about the eviction, a police officer said the rise in Maoist activities in the district had forced them to clear the area adjoining the police chiefs bungalow. Maoist posters were found in some stalls. The eviction was necessary as surveillance in the area was becoming difficult, he said.         
	Two policemen were injured as the hawkers hurled bricks at the cops. Two police vehicles were also set ablaze.

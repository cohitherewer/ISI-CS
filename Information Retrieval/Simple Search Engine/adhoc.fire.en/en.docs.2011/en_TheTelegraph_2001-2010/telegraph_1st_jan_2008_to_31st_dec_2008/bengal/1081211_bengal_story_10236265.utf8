                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tribals welcome govt at protest hub
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Dec. 10: Government officials today ventured into the interiors of Lalgarh for the first time since tribals began their agitation against alleged police atrocities by blocking roads over a month ago.        
	Block development officer Chinmoy Mondal went to Dalilpur, the place where the protesters had wanted the superintendent of police to go and apologise, with a doctor and a mini truck laden with blankets, clothes and rice.        
	The relief materials were sent to the Sijua gram panchayat office, 4km away. We took the relief with us because the area was cut off from the rest of the district for over a month. We also took a doctor and two health workers, said a Binpur-I block official.        
	Villagers welcomed the officials and took them under a shamiana where Mondal and the leader of Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, Chhatradhar Mahato, lit 29 candles as a gesture of goodwill.         
	Asked why 29, Chhatradhar said: The police had said we had planted 29 mines in the area during our agitation. The police denied having made such an allegation.        
	Addressing the 200-odd people who had assembled outside the shade, the BDO admitted that there had been inadequate development in the area. We will hold talks with panchayats at all the three tiers and draw up development schemes, he said.        
	Chhatradhar said the tribals had expected the officials to arrive earlier. Maybe they were scared that we will create trouble once they reached here. Perhaps that is why they sent the BDO with relief material to placate us. We want to tell them dont be scared of us. Please come and come again for the sake of developing this backward area, he said.        
	Mondal and the committee against police atrocities held a brief meeting. We told him that we have only suspended our agitation, not withdrawn it, Chhatradhar said. But he softened his stand on what had been the bone of contention in the peace talks earlier: the superintendents apology.         
	Whether the SP wants to come or not is his choice. We no longer demand his presence in Dalilpur and apology. We only want development, the tribal leader added.        
	The community, he added, was not against the police entering their villages. We only wanted to say we wont allow the police to unleash terror.        
	The police had earlier said Maoists were steering the agitation in the heart of Lalgarh and egging the tribals on.        
	Maoist scare        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the Maoists were emerging as a big threat to Bengal.         
	Addressing a human rights commission programme in Calcutta, he said: The CPI (Maoist) is an outfit that openly practises killing individuals and their political opponents. No one knows their agenda, they just go around killing people. The party, he added, had grown very strong in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, which is especially worrying because we share our border with that state.

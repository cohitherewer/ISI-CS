          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jamalpur, Aug. 30: A farmer in debt after years of uncertain rain and failed crops jumped in front of a rushing train with his wife and two children in Burdwan this morning.        
	Sushil Pakirah had 4 bighas (over an acre) of farmland but it did not fetch him enough to feed a family of four. He had borrowed Rs 60,000 to set up a grocery but could not. The lenders had been after him.        
	The driver of the Howrah-bound local train saw the four jump to their death at Mohonpur, 95km from Calcutta.         
	The place where Sushil grew vegetables is some 70km from Singur, where Mamata Banerjee is telling villagers their best hope lies in agriculture.        
	The mutilated bodies of Sushil, 31, Jyotsna, 25, Nandagopal, 8, and Anamika, 3, were found on the tracks.         
	Sushil and Jyotsna were married for 10 years. Their eldest child, Putul, lives with her aunt in Allahabad.        
	Sushil was the only member of his family who depended on farming for a living. His father works in the railways and mother in a government farm, together earning around Rs 13,000 a month.        
	He had told his mother about his debts, but she said she did not have enough money to repay it. He apparently could not summon the courage to tell his father about it.        
	The moneylenders were chasing him. He often told his mother Arati to help him out of his debts, a local police officer said.        
	A sobbing Arati said her son had threatened to kill himself if she did not help. But I could not have cobbled together such a huge amount.        
	Around 8.15am, Sushil told his wife to get ready with the two children to go to her parents house in Raina, 45km from their village, Panchra. The four left half an hour later.         
	Dipak Sikdar, a daily passenger on the train from Burdwan, was in the first compartment. I saw it. It was horrible. The father held the son and the mother gripped the daughter. They leaped before the train.        
	Driver M. Ahmed said it was too late to slam the brakes when he saw them. They waited till the last second before jumping. There wasnt anything that I could do, he said.        
	Sushil was a CPM panchayat member. His friend, Ratan Badyakar, said: Sushil had been hoping to repay his debts with what he earned from the land, but he failed.

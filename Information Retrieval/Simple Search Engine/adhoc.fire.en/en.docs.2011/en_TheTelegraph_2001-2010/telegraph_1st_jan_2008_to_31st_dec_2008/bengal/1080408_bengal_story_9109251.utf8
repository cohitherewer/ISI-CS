	Durgapur, April 7: The Durgapur school where a math teacher stabbed his colleague on Saturday is the one whose principal is absconding after being accused of abetting her domestic helps suicide.        
	Guardians today held teachers of the private CBSE school, 200km from Calcutta, hostage for an hour demanding the removal of principal Subha Narayan and the teacher.         
	What will we tell our children when they ask why a teacher stabbed another teacher? There is no principal, she is on the run, said Jainal Haque, whose son is in Class IX.        
	Police rescued the teachers around 10am, but the demonstration went on till 1pm, when principal-in-charge Soumen Chakraborty promised to take up the matter with the managing committee. The school, affiliated to the CBSE board, has about 3,500 students.        
	Subha had also been accused of abetting her previous maids suicide. She is facing trial in that case.        
	Asish Swarnakar, 30, stabbed his colleague during a meeting of the science department because she wanted to snap her relationship with him. She suffered four deep cuts in her head and shoulders. A finger was almost severed.

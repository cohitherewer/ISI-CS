	Calcutta, Dec. 15: The high court has told police to provide security to a family after they were prevented from entering their home by villagers despite securing bail in a case of abetting their daughter-in-laws suicide.         
	Justice Dipankar Dutta said policemen should be posted in front of Nityapada Ghoshs house in Barasat till the end of trial. If this court does not intervene, jungle raj will prevail, he said.         
	The order came after a plea from Ghosh, a trader in bell metal utensils. He was held with his wife, two sons and two daughters after daughter-in-law Jhuma allegedly jumped into a pond. They got bail in June but local residents prevented them from returning home and beat them up, lawyer Anjan Bhattacharya said.

          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, July 20: The Congress central leadership today accused Somen Mitra of having lied about his intention to split the party and float his own outfit.        
	Mitra, who was the Bengal Congress chief for over six years, left the parent organisation yesterday and launched the Pragatishil Indira Congress to join forces with Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress.        
	Only three-four days ago, Somen told me he was not leaving the party when I enquired about media reports on his plans. He had lied to me about his intentions, said Mohsina Kidwai, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal.         
	I know Somen since his early days in the Congress. I did not expect a senior party leader like him to lie to me, she added.        
	Mitras aide Jayanta Bhattacharya said they were not bothered about what the leaders in Delhi had to say. Everybody knew that Somenda will float a new party after he called on Mamata to jointly fight the CPM, he added.        
	Mitra, busy through the day visiting the Kali temple in Dakshineswar and Furfurah Sharif in Budge Budge, was not available for comment.        
	Asked if the party will expel Mitra, Kidwai said: Somen is an AICC member and the matter has to be referred to the partys disciplinary committee. But we shall think about all that only after Tuesdays trust vote.        
	Congress sources said Mitra would be first asked to resign as MLA from Sealdah before any disciplinary action is initiated.        
	The AICC had expelled Mamata in December1997 after she had publicly announced a breakaway from the Congress to float a new party. The Trinamul Congress was born in January 1998.         
	Several Congress leaders from Bengal today called upon the high command to immediately ask Mitra to quit as party MLA. Somenda should be ashamed to continue as a Congress legislator after leaving the party, one of them said.         
	However, Bengal Congress president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, now in New Delhi, said no decision on Mitra could be taken before the trust vote. I am aware of Somens moves. But at the moment, we are all busy with Tuesdays vote.        
	Mitra is likely to attend with supporters Mamatas rally tomorrow to mark the death of 13 Youth Congress supporters in police firing 15 years ago.         
	State Congress leaders said not many of their colleagues would break ranks and follow Mitra.

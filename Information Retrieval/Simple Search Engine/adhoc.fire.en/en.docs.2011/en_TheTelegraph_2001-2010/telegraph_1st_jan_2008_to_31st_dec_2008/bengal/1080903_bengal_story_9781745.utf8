The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Award for tata
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Award for tata
          AMIT ROY                                                  Angad at the awards night          
	London, Sept. 2: Leading promoters of Indo-British business last night acclaimed the iconic Ratan Tata in a summit followed by a banquet, with Singur inevitably entering into the discussions.        
	Lord Swraj Pauls youngest son Angad, who has invested in an ancillary unit at the Singur complex, told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the summit that the consequences of a Tata pullout would be extremely damaging for Bengal.        
	Tata was not present himself to collect the award at the banquet, thrown by the Lord Mayor of London at Mansion House, to mark the first birthday of the UK India Business Council.        
	The award was presented on behalf of the council, which promotes Indo-British bilateral trade and business (currently worth 8 billion a year), by the British high commissioner in India, Sir Richard Stagg, who had flown over from Delhi.        
	The award was collected by Anwar Hasan, managing director in the UK of Tata Ltd. The citation reflected the high regard in which Tata is held on the UK-India business scene: UK India Business Council honours Mr R.N. Tata of Tata Sons Ltd for his significant contribution to our Indo-British Partnership with thanks and appreciation.        
	Indeed, right through yesterday when the council held a summit, Next Generation India, to review the state of Indo-British trade, Tatas name figured repeatedly as a man who had enhanced Indias prestige, not only in the UK but throughout the corporate world, after his acquisition of, first, Corus and then Jaguar and Land Rover.        
	Among those at the summit was Angad Paul, CEO of Caparo plc, which makes automobile components in factories across India. He has set up a Caparo components unit inside the Tata Motors complex in Singur.        
	We went there because Ratan Tata went there, he told this newpaper. Caparo, he said, had made a substantial investment in Singur.        
	He would not be drawn on what he thought would be the final outcome of the Singur siege.        
	I dont want to offer uncalled-for advice  the situation is so political, he said carefully. But if Mamata Banerjee wants to talk to me, I will talk to her; if Buddhadebbabu wants to talk to me, I will talk to him.        
	Since his father was brought up in Calcutta, Paul added: We consider Calcutta our home.        
	At the summit, the keynote address was delivered by Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of the global advertising and media group, WPP. He was momentarily thrown when asked during the question-and-answer session whether a Tata pullout from Singur would affect inward investment into India generally and Bengal specifically.        
	His opinion was that India was too big and the momentum too fast for the process to be derailed by one specific incident. But his considered opinion was: I dont know.        
	The summit culminated with the banquet in Mansion House, hosted by David Lewis, who himself took a business delegation to India earlier this year in his capacity as titular head of the City of London.        
	Announcing the award to Tata, Stagg described the recipient as the most iconic figure in India. He mentioned that the Tata group now employed 50,000 people in the UK in everything from tea to Land Rover and Jaguar.

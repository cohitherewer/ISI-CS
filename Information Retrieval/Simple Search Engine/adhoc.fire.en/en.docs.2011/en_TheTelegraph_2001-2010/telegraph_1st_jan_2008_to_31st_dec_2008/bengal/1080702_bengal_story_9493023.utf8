	Krishnagar, July 1: Six out of the 14 peacocks seized by the forest department from the Iskcon temple in Mayapur last month have died, apparently unable to cope with weather fluctuations.         
	Although seized, the birds were left behind in the temples cages as the forest department had failed to decide on an alternative accommodation.        
	A government veterinary doctor, who went to see the birds on a call from the temple on Saturday, informed divisional forest officer Lipika Roy about the death of six chicks only yesterday.        
	Roy has ordered an inquiry to find out the cause of death. She has also asked the temple authorities to explain the delay in informing her.         
	The birds apparently died four days ago. I have sought a report from the temple on the deaths and why I was not informed earlier, Roy said.        
	The forest department had last month asked Iskcon to hand over all 14 peacocks  eight adults and six chicks  kept illegally on its premises. But we kept the birds in the temple because we had not decided where to send them. In the temple for many years, they would also have been better there rather than a makeshift shelter. So we decided to take them away in phases, Roy said.        
	The vet, N.K. Das, who had first seen the birds, is now probing the deaths. He went to the temple today to conduct a post-mortem.        
	All the chicks died of necrotic enteritis. In this disease, birds cannot cope with weather fluctuations, he said, adding: The birds should have been kept more carefully.        
	The temple authorities in Mayapur, 100km from Calcutta, said they did their best while looking after the birds.        
	The birds are now the forest departments property. But even then we tried to look after them well. The government should have taken away the birds if it thought they were unsafe with us, said Iskcon publicity manager Ramesh Das.        
	But Roy is not convinced. She said: I have ordered a forest official to visit the temple to know how the rest of the peacocks are being treated.

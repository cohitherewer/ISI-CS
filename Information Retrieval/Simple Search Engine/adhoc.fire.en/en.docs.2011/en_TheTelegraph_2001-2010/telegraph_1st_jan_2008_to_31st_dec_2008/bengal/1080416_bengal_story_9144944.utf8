	April 15: The Congress today filed a complaint with the state election panel alleging that many of its panchayat poll candidates could not file nominations because of intimidation by CPM cadres.         
	A Pradesh Congress Committee team called on state election commissioner Ashok Gupta this afternoon. Later, Gupta said he had told all district magistrates to look into the matter. We want the candidates to lodge complaints with the commission directly if they are not entertained at the district level, he said.         
	Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee said Ruznal Bibi, in the fray for a gram panchayat seat in Barasat, North 24-Parganas, had to be escorted to the SDOs office after being threatened by CPM men. We are worried because tomorrow is the last date for filing nominations for the first phase, he said. The polls are in May.        
	Mukherjee said some CPM supporters today beat up Sheikh Samiruddin and wife Jahanara in Burdwans Natungram for campaigning for the Congress. But a CPM district leader said Samiruddin had ransacked a candidates home last night.         
	In Ketugram, Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury escorted candidates on their way to file nominations. Ketugram falls under his Behrampore constituency. Ten people were hurt in Nandigram when Trinamul Congress and Congress workers clashed over the filing of nominations.        
	The last date for withdrawal is April 21, when Mamata Banerjee has called a 12-hour bandh. Keeping that in mind, Mukherjee requested the poll panel for an extension. But the commissioner ruled it out.

	Jan. 22: The state government today banned sale and purchase of chickens and ducks in the seven districts where bird flu has been confirmed. 
    
	Home secretary P.R. Ray said in Murshidabad: We will have to stop the sale of chicken and duck meat and their movement to neighbouring districts for the next 10 days.
    
	In Birbhums Nalhati, police seized six trucks carrying 2,500 broilers and 12 lakh eggs. The drivers were held.
    
	The chickens from the flu zone were allegedly being taken to Kanksa in Burdwan. The eggs were being transported in four trailer trucks registered in Andhra Pradesh. 
    
	The police were not sure where the eggs were loaded.

   OUR BUREAU
   
	Jan. 9: Saswati Pal may or may not have had an affair, but a whiff of it could have ruined her marriage prospects. 
 
	Mahadeb Karak, who had finalised his son Anjan rsquo;s wedding with the Visva-Bharati MA student, today said he wouldn rsquo;t have gone ahead had he known about ldquo;her relationship with another boy rdquo;.
 
	Saswati rsquo;s Sangit Bhavan classmate Sriparna Haldar, however, said she was not in love with ldquo;another boy rdquo; Amaresh Kundu, who shot her dead in her Santiniketan hostel on Sunday.
 
	At Ghatal in West Midna- pore, Mahadeb said: ldquo;If we knew about an affair between Amaresh and Saswati, we would not have gone ahead with the matchmaking for our only son. rdquo;
 
	Mahadeb is a deed writer at the block land and land reforms office at Daspur in Ghatal, 130km from Calcutta, where Saswati rsquo;s father Shyamal is an upper division clerk.
 
	Mahadeb said Shyamal, his classmate at the local Rabindra Shatabarshiki College, had approached him with the marriage proposal last month. ldquo;We knew each other for a long time. When Shyamal told me about his proposal, I suggested that the boy and the girl speak to each other first, rdquo; he said.
 
	Anjan and Saswati were in regular touch since then, but Mahadeb said he was not aware of it. ldquo;I had only told my son I was negotiating his marriage with Saswati. But I don rsquo;t know what transpired later and whether they had already developed a relationship. rdquo;
 
	Anjan, a field officer with a pharmaceutical company in Maharashtra, had studied in the same school in Ghatal as Amaresh, a cook at the Tollygunge police station who shot himself after killing Saswati.
 
	Sriparna, in whose room Saswati was shot, said her friend never regarded Amaresh as a lover. ldquo;I was not there on the day of the shooting as I had left home for the weekend. But Saswati was a very good friend of mine and she told me that she had never thought of marrying Amaresh. rdquo; 
 
	Amaresh wanted to marry Saswati, though. Sriparna said: ldquo;I myself spoke to him twice over the phone to talk him out of the relationship. rdquo;
 
	Amaresh was ldquo;adamant rdquo; and had repeatedly told Sriparna that he loved Saswati. 
 
	Sriparna said she was not aware of the existence of Anjan. ldquo;Saswati didn rsquo;t tell me anything about him. rdquo;
 
	A senior Birbhum officer said police would like to question Anjan and Tanya Chakraborty, the Sangit Bhavan student who was in the hostel room where Saswati was shot.

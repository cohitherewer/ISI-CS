	Siliguri, May 28: Six persons, including three engineering students, were arrested last night for the abduction and murder of call centre employee Abhishek Chachan here on May 22.        
	One of the accused, Surojit Das, is a former boyfriend of the girl Abhishek had apparently been seeing.         
	Police said Surojits friends Roman Sarkar and Shahidur Rehman, who study in an engineering college here, sat with the body between them on a motorcycle and rode out of the town. The body of the Siliguri Commerce College student was found 20km from here on May 24.        
	Surojit, who works in a medicine shop, wanted to teach Abhishek a lesson. In the past two months, Abhishek had become close to a girl who once had an affair with him, said Darjeeling police chief Rahul Srivastava.         
	Abhishek had been keen to acquire a particular model of a motorcycle and Surojit used it as a bait to bring him to a flat which Roman, Shahidur and their friend Ananda Gupta had rented. Surojit had befriended them at a Christmas party last year.         
	They allegedly laced Abhisheks drink with sleeping pills, tied his feet, gagged him and left. When they returned, he was dead.        
	Surojit made ransom calls to Abhisheks family with the help of Amit Mondal, who also worked in his medicine shop, said Srivastava.

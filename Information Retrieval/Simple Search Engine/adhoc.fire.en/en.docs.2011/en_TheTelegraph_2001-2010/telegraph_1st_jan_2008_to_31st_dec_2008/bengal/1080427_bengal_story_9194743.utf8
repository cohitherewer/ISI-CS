	Calcutta, April 26: A woman pretending to be a salesgirl robbed jewellery worth nearly Rs12 lakh from two flats in south Calcutta when their elderly owners fell unconscious after having the health drink she gave them to taste.        
	The heist at 106/1, Manoharpukur Road took place on Friday. But Uma Banerjee, 71, and Sushma Neogy, 74, regained consciousness this afternoon and went to police realising that their almirahs had been cleaned out.        
	Sushma, who is unmarried, and Uma , a widow whose son stays abroad, live alone, said an officer of the Lake police station.

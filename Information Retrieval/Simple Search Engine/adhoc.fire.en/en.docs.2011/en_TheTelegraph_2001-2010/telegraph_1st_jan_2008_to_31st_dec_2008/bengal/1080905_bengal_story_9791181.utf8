The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Protest can wait, first a peek at the plant 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Protest can wait, first a peek at the plant 
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                                        Biswajit Majumdar      
	Singur, Sept. 4: The Tata plant seems to be a greater attraction than the dharna for the busloads of Trinamul supporters coming to Singur from other districts.        
	Arriving from Kalna, Burdwan, Biswajit Majumdar and friend Arup Kumar Biswas first went to see the Nano plant, which, according to them, should stay in Singur.        
	Aamra chayi Tata ekhane thak. Tata darkar. Shilpo oboshyo darkar (We want the Tatas to stay here. We need the Tatas. Industrialisation is necessary), said day labourer Biswajit, who came with 80 people in a bus.        
	His voice drowned as a Trinamul Congress leader shouted slogans into a microphone, so Biswajit repeated: We hope the Tatas stay here.         
	Arup, who is jobless, said: The Tatas should not leave as people here need jobs. Asked about their political affiliation, he paused, then said: Aamra Trinamul Congress kori (We are Trinamul supporters).        
	What had brought them to Singur, if not the dharna?         
	We came to see the factory as there has been so much trouble over it, said Arup, smiling. We hope something good comes out of tomorrows talks with the governor. The government and Mamata should work out a solution.         
	Mosiar Gazi, from Burdwan, also came to see the factory. Asked about its fate, he said: Its all up to our leader.         
	Seeing a Trinamul leader of his village coming towards him, he changed tack. Agricultural land is important. How many people will the unit employ?        
	Manoj Biswas, who had come from Kalyani with wife Bina and six-year-old son Anirban, also wanted the Nano to roll out from Singur. The Tatas should stay, there is no doubt about it, he said, but the state should also think about farmers.         
	Bina grinned. We showed the factory to our son, she said.

          TAPAS GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, June 6: An elderly mother who had identified a decomposed body as her sons by mistake four months before he was found alive has been charged with giving false evidence and misleading police.        
	Krishna Banerjee, 62, of Basirhat in North 24-Parganas has got anticipatory bail in Calcutta High Court.        
	A week after her son Soumen Banerjee, then 29, went missing on August 30, 2007, police showed a photograph to the distraught mother and she thought it was his.        
	The Government Railway Police in Ranaghat, Nadia, who had found the body, apparently burnt it before the woman could go for a physical verification as it was highly decomposed.         
	Banerjees lawyer Subir Debnath told the court that the Ranaghat GRP had cooked up a story, saying Soumen had an affair with a girl whose other lover had conspired to kill her.        
	Four youths, the alleged other man in the girls life and his three accomplices, were arrested and sent to jail by a Krishnagar court.         
	They got bail four months later. The trial against them is pending.        
	On December 24, 2007, the GRP found a youth roaming in Khardah station in North 24-Parganas, 25km from Calcutta. He identified himself as Soumen Banerjee and said that he had gone missing from Basirhat.         
	The Basirhat police asked Banerjee to go to Khardah to see if it was her son. It was.         
	Banerjee then informed the Ranaghat GRP, who had shown her the picture of the decomposed body, that her son had returned home.         
	The railway police charged the widow with giving false evidence and misleading them in February this year.        
	Last month, the Krishnagar court refused to grant the woman anticipatory bail.         
	However, in the high court, Justices D.P. Sengupta and P.K. Deb said the allegations were baseless. Wrong statements before police should not be termed as false evidence. The evidence is considered false when wrong statements are made before the court.

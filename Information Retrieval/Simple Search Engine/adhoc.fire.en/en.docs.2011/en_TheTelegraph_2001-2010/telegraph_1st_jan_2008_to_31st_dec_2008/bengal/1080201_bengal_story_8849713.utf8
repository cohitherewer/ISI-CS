	Mumbai, Jan. 31: Industries minister Nirupam Sen has tiptoed to Mumbai and begun a renewed bid to attract investments to the state after over a year of turmoil in Singur and Nandigram.
    
	The minister has been closeted in meetings with leading industrialists, including Ratan Tata and Mukesh Ambani, in the countrys commercial capital. The two meetings took place yesterday. 
    
	Sens low-key visit was organised by the Tatas and CII mentor Tarun Das.
    
	The talks with Tata centred on the progress of the small car plant in Singur, which had kicked off the land war.
    
	With the Reliance Industries chairman, Sen discussed Bengals plans in the petrochemicals sector. Ambani also apprised the minister of the progress on the gas pipeline from the Krishna-Godavari basin, which is crucial to the fortunes of his company. Gas is expected to flow from the KG basin later this year.
    
	Sen also met Ashok Hinduja and they spoke about the possibility of truck-maker Ashok Leyland, a group firm, investing in Bengals fledgling automotive industry.
    
	ICICI OneSource chairman Ashok Ganguly, Crompton Greaves MD Sudhir Trehan, Tata International chairman Shyamal Gupta, HSBC country head Naina Lal Kidwai and Thomas Cook chief Udayan Bose were some of the other business leaders Sen met.

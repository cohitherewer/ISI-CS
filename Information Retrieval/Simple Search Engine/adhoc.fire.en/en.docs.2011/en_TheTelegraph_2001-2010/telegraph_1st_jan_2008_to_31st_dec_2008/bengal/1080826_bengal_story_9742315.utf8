          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 25: A seriously ill Jyoti Basu today made an unscheduled visit to the Bengal CPM headquarters immediately after news came in that Mamata Banerjee had rejected Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees talks offer.        
	I am seriously ill but came to the party office with a knee cap on to know about the Singur developments from Biman (Bose). I was told the chief minister had once again written to Mamata for a discussion, he said after a one-to-one with the CPM state secretary.         
	Basu recalled that when Mamata had called on him in June last year, she had said she would not meet the chief minister to discuss Singur.         
	Mamata had demanded Buddhas resignation. But I told her it was not possible since he had been elected by the people. It will be good if she meets him now to resolve the impasse, he said.        
	Bose took the cue from the chief minister and urged Mamata to sit for talks with the chief minister.        
	I want Mamata to come to the negotiating table without any preconditions, the CPM state secretary told a news conference at partys Alimuddin Street office.         
	I feel any standoff can be resolved through discussions. Let Mamata first sit with the chief minister to put across her proposal.        
	Bose, however, denied media reports that he had yesterday suggested providing alternative land to farmers.         
	It is up to the government to take a decision on this, he said.        
	Asked about the rehabilitation package, he said the government was working on it.

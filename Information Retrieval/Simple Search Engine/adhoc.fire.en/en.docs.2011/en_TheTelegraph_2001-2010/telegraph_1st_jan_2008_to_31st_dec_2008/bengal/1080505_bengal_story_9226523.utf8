	There was no suicide note and police are clueless about what drove Swagata to death.        
	Her landlord, Aniruddha Dey, said he hadnt seen Swagata since morning and decided to check on her around 6pm. When his knocks went unanswered, he called Bolpur police station.

	The police have informed Swagatas father Samir Bagchi, who lives in Behrampore.        
	Preliminary investigations have revealed that Swagata was last seen pacing outside her room around 10 last night by some students who live in the neighbourhood.         
	Sukanta Patra, a BA first-year student of Bolpur College, had asked her if anything was bothering her. She had said she was disturbed, but did not elaborate.

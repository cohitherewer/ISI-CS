                                                                                                               35 cows die
                            
	Durgapur, March 20: Panic gripped Budbud in Burdwan tonight after 35 cows were found dead in shallow ponds near the banks of the Damodar.         
	Their bellies were swollen and blood was oozing from their nose, the sub-divisional officer of Durgapur said. He added that the cows had probably drowned.

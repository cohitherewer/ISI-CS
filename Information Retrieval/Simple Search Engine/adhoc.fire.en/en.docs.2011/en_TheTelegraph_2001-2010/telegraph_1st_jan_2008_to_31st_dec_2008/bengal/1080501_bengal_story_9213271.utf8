	Calcutta, April 30: A woman who worked in a school for 23 years will get her appointment 12 years after retirement.        
	The high court today ordered the school education department to clear her retirement dues within three months.        
	Mohini Paloma, a group D employee of Bansberia Hindi Vidyapith, 70km from Calcutta, had got her salary regularly since joining work. But the Hooghly inspector of schools refused to pay her retirement benefits because her appointment had apparently not been approved by the authorities.        
	Bail for Americans        
	Two Californians caught at Bagdogra airport on April 14 with bullets in their bag have got bail. Heather K. Bond and her mother Monica must appear before the investigating officer every fortnight.

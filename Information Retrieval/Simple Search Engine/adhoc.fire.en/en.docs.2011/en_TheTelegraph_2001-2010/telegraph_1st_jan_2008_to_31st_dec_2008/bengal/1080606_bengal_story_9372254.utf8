                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Mamata snubs CPM call-off request
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 5: The successful and spontaneous shutdown over, CPM state secretary Biman Bose today asked the Trinamul Congress to call off its bandh tomorrow.        
	So what if it was on the same issue that inspired his party and allies to hold Bengal to ransom for 12 hours today?        
	There is no need for another bandh on the same issue. I am requesting Mamata Banerjee to call off her bandh tomorrow, Bose said. We would have supported her had she called the bandh before us.        
	He added considerately: We waited for 40 minutes after the oil price hike was announced for other parties to declare their protest moves.        
	Mamata, who would have none of it, asked people to pardon the party for causing inconvenience.        
	Yesterday, justifying her bandh call, Mamata had said: If the CPM calls a bandh despite being in the government (the Left supports the UPA government from outside), should we, the Opposition, suck on lozenges?        
	Bose, who is also the Left Front chairman, said the front would not oppose the Trinamul bandh.         
	CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan, too, said his party was not opposed to Mamatas bandh.         
	Bus fare hike hint        
	Bus fares could be hiked but not taxi fares, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said today.        
	There may be an increase in bus fares; I shall meet the chief minister over this, he said. But taxi fares will remain untouched.        
	Chakraborty will meet the bus unions tomorrow.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The bald patch on Tamali Biswass scalp. (Rana Ghosh)                                  
	Durgapur, Nov. 17: A teacher in Burdwans Andal allegedly yanked out a tuft of hair, leaving a bald patch on a Class III girls head, after she failed to recite the multiplication table she had been told to memorise at home.        
	A traumatised Tamali Biswas did not tell her parents anything initially as the teacher had asked her not to.         
	But her mother found the bald patch while giving her a bath yesterday.        
	The teacher slapped her several times and then held her by the hair and shook her head furiously, the eight-year-old told her mother. He apparently told the girl to tell her parents she had lost the hair in a fight with her classmates.        
	The mathematics teacher of Khandra Primary Institution in Andal, about 230km from Calcutta, could not be contacted.        
	Police have started an investigation. The teacher will be arrested if found guilty, said an officer.         
	How can a teacher be so cruel with a little girl? asked Tamalis mother Rina. We also scold our daughter for her faults, but not like this. He had even asked my daughter to tell a lie at home.         
	Tamalis father Tanmay, a stationery shop owner, accompanied her to school this morning and lodged a complaint with headmaster Dilip Ghosh.         
	I wanted to meet the teacher but the headmaster did not allow me. I demanded exemplary punishment for the teacher, Tanmay said.         
	Debi Banerjee, the doctor who examined the girl at Khas Kajora village, said the scalp had no apparent injury but the patch from which the hair was pulled out was tender and painful to the touch.         
	I have prescribed painkillers and asked the parents to wait and see if her hair grows back normally.         
	The headmaster said he did not allow Tanmay to meet the teacher fearing commotion at school.         
	That does not mean I am trying to shield the teacher. I will conduct an inquiry into the charge and submit a report to the police and the school management, Ghosh added.

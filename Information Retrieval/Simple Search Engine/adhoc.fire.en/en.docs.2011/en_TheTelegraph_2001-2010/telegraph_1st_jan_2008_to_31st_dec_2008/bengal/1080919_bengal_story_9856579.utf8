                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CBI seeks Nobel probe nod
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bolpur, Sept. 18: The CBI today petitioned the Birbhum additional chief judicial magistrate for permission to restart its investigation into the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal.        
	The central intelligence agency had closed the probe on August 30 last year, three years after the medal and other memorabilia of the Tagore family went missing from the Rabindra Bhavan museum.         
	The state police had handed over the investigation to the CBI on March 31, 2004.         
	In his petition, CBI officer P.S. Bose said the agency had recently received a new set of clues.         
	The judge has decided to hear the petition in detail on September 26.        
	Senior CBI officer S. Suderanjan said the Nobel heist had become a sentimental issue for the people of Bengal. After receiving the courts nod, we will start a fresh investigation, he said.

	Calcutta, June 28: Seven people, including five banana traders from East Midnapore, were killed when their truck collided with an oil tanker near Howrahs Uluberia in the wee hours today.        
	The accident occurred when the tanker came on the wrong side of NH41 at the Panchla-Bauria crossing, 40km from Calcutta.         
	It collided with the Eicher Canter which was ferrying the traders to a large market in Bagda, North 24-Parganas. The driver and the cleaner of the truck were also killed.        
	Police said the traders, from Nandakumar and Tamluk, had left their homes last night and would have reached Bagda this morning.        
	Those killed have been identified as driver Sanatan Barman, 31, cleaner Laltu Mondal, 25, and traders Sudhir Maity, 50, Shankar Manna, 45, Lakhikanta Samanta, 35, Sanjit Maity, 32, and Haripada Bala, 35.        
	Police sources said Barman had tried to steer his truck out of the tankers path but failed. The vehicle was smashed and flung to one side of the road. The tanker sped away.         
	The driver and the cleaner were rushed to Uluberia Subdivisional Hospital where doctors declared them brought dead.         
	The traders were found dead in the carriage-hold, almost two hours after the crash, when a crane arrived to tug the smashed truck away.        
	The police called up the trucks owner, whose number was mentioned on the vehicle.

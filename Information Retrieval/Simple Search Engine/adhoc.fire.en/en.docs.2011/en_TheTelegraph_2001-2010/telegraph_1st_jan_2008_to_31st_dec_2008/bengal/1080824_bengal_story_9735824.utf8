	Durgapur, Aug. 23: Two MBA students died and another was seriously injured when their motorcycle rammed into an oil tanker in Haldia this morning.        
	Dipendu Chakraborty, 20, died on the spot and Arpan Pramanik, 20, succumbed to his injuries in hospital. Anupam Mukherjee, 19, was admitted to the same hospital with head injuries.        
	The trio were on their way to the Durgapur Institute of Advanced Technology and Management, a kilometre away from accident spot.        
	According to witnesses, the driver of the tanker lost control of the wheel after overtaking a truck, a police officer said.         
	All three used to commute from Asansol where they stayed.        
	They had repeatedly been told not to travel on a two-wheeler as it is illegal and unsafe for three persons to ride one bike, said Bibhas Chandra, head of the MBA department.

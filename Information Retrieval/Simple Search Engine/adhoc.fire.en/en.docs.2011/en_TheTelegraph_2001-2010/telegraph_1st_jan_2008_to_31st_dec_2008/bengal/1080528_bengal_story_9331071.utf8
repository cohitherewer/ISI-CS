  - Heartless at home, but theres the rickshaw-puller      OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Hiranprabha in Jalpaiguri town. Picture by Biplab Basak                                         
	Siliguri, May 27: An 88-year-old woman roamed the streets of Jalpaiguri town for over an hour today before collapsing, having been turned away by four of her sons.        
	Except for Govinda, the youngest, five sons of Hiranprabha Bhowmik have government jobs.         
	My husband could not build a house because he had to bring up nine children (six sons and three daughters). But he had always said they will take care of me in his absence, Hiranprabha said as she gasped for breath, a packet of puffed rice and a bag of clothes beside her.         
	An NGO took her to hospital. We have put her on oxygen and saline. She is old and suffering from nutrition deficiency. On top of that, she had been roaming in this heat, said S.C. Bhowmick, the superintendent of Jalpaiguri District Hospital.        
	Two of the old womans sons live in Calcutta and Birpara (125km from Siliguri). She used to live with the four others  Prasanta, Arun, Ajit and Govinda  in turns in Jalapiguri town.         
	An employee of the land reforms department, Prasanta had called her to his house yesterday because there was a puja. Today, she was told to return to Govindas. But there she was refused entry. I then brought her back again but she was not allowed in, said rickshaw-puller Durga Charan Roy.         
	She also went to Ajit, who lives in Prasantas building, but the Jalpaiguri municipa-lity employee and Arun, the third son who stays in another part of the neighbourhood, also turned their mother away.         
	Mashima was unwell, I was scared. So I approached local people for help, said Roy.         
	Arun and Ajit claimed that they were not aware of their mothers visit. We didnt know she was in hospital. We will go at once, said Ajit.        
	Prasantas wife Bakul said it was not possible to keep Hiranprabha permanently in their house. She is not my husbands responsibility alone.        
	Pinu said her husband Govinda did not have a permanent job. He earns the least among the brothers.        
	One of Hiranprabhas daughters lives in Jalpaiguri, but the woman did not go to her.         
	Swarup Mondal, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Forum, alleged that the sons tried to dissuade her from filing a case at the hospital. We will send notices to them, Mondal said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Expansion cloud after cargo mess
                                                                                                               Expansion cloud after cargo mess
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 15: Singapore Airlines today said it might put on hold its plan to introduce an additional freighter to Calcutta after the trouble over cargo stuck during the airport employees strike and the subsequent demand for a fine.        
	The Airports Authority of India had shocked airlines yesterday by asking them to pay a late fee or demurrage for keeping goods in its warehouse during the March 12-13 ceasework. The airlines said the cargo could not be cleared because of the airports own staff and lodged a protest.         
	The fine was waived today following the intervention of airports authority chairman K. Ramalingam in Delhi but the airlines and agents suffered losses running into crores.        
	We are reviewing the decision to add another freighter to Calcutta from April. Strikes will happen again and business will suffer, said Amin Khan, the eastern India manager of Singapore Airlines Cargo.         
	The airline has three freighters and four passenger flights to the city.         
	Calcuttas market is growing but such disruptions cause huge losses, Khan said.        
	An official said Singapore Airlines lost Rs 1.1 crore a day because of the strike. Emirates and several other airlines lost Rs 50 lakh in a day.

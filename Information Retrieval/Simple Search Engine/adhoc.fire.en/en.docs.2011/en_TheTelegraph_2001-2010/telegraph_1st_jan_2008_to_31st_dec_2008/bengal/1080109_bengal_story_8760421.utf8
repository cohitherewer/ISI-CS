The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Month-long alert after unseasonal power cut 
                                                                                                            Month-long alert after unseasonal power cut 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 8: The city and the districts were plunged into darkness for hours this evening as the power shortfall shot up to 740MW.        
	The deficit in Calcutta and its neighbourhood was 170MW. The districts suffered more with the shortfall climbing to over 570MW.        
	The power department said the shortage was expected to continue through the month.        
	Calcutta and its suburbs had to go without power for up to three hours. Lake Town, Bangur Avenue, Kankurgachhi, C.R. Avenue, Kasba, Ballygunge and Behala were the worst hit.        
	In the districts, lights went off for four to five hours.        
	The shortfall  both for the CESC and the West Bengal State Power Distribution Company Limited  is unusual in winter when the load is lighter because fans and air-conditioners are used less often.         
	Power officials said the deficit was unavoidable as the CESC had shut down one of its mainstay units  the 250MW unit at Budge Budge  for an annual overhaul.         
	The situation got worse when the fifth unit at the Bandel plant collapsed after a tube leak. Also, a technical snag at the Kolaghat plant brought down generation by about 75MW, said S. Mahapatra, the managing director of the West Bengal Power Development Corporation, which controls the state-owned power plants.         
	Power supply from the central-sector plants had dropped, too. Another 210MW unit in Kolaghat is undergoing an overhaul.        
	We dont expect any respite in January, a power department official said.        
	The department is scouting for power.        
	The situation is really bad. We have approached the Damodar Valley Corporation and it has assured us 200MW from January 15 onwards, power minister Mrinal Banerjee said tonight.        
	He accused the central-sector plants of not supplying the agreed volume of power.        
	According to our agreement, the central sector is supposed to supply 921MW to the Bengal grid every day. But they are not supplying more than 350-400MW. We will take the matter up with the Union power ministry, Banerjee said.

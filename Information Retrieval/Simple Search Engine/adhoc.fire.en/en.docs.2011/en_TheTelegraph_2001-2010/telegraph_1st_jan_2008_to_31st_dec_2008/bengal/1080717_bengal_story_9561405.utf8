	Darjeeling, July 16: The indefinite strike in government offices across the hills will end on Monday, throwing open to the Czech scientist caught with a cache of insects the chance to apply for bail again.        
	Our agitation should not inconvenience people, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief Bimal Gurung said.        
	Offices that collect taxes will remain closed, though.

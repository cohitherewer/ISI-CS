          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Dec. 21: The state government has decided to take four virgin coal mines on lease from Coal India to ensure uninterrupted supply to its power plants.         
	Coal is expected to be raised from the mines in two years, power minister Mrinal Banerjee said here today.        
	Two of the four mines are in Birbhum district, one is in Burdwan and the fourth in Jharkhand.         
	Rain in the Asansol-Ranigunj coal belt had severely affected power generation in the state-owned plants leading to widespread power cuts this summer.         
	That is why we felt the need to take on lease four mines from which we will get exclusive supply, a power department official said.        
	The minister said the state was negotiating with the Bhutan government through the central power ministry on a project to produce hydro-electricity. We can generate 400-500MW if the agreement with Bhutan is finalised, he said.

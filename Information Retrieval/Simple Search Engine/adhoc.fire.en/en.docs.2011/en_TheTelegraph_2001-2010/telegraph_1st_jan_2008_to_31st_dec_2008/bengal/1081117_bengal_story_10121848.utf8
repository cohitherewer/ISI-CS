          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 16: Pushed to a corner after the Singur pullout, Mamata Banerjee has seized on the tribal protests for an election plank.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief will lead a demonstration in front of the West Midnapore police chiefs office on Tuesday to condemn police atrocities on tribals in Garbeta, Jhargram and Lalgarh.         
	I express solidarity with the adivasis movement in West Midnapore. This is a genuine outburst of their long-standing grievances. The government has done nothing to improve their lot during its 32-year regime, Mamata told a news conference here.        
	Her party admitted that this was an attempt to consolidate her base in West Midnapore. Adivasis are traditionally Left voters. We want to make inroads into the tribal belt, having cut a sorry figure in Singur, a Trinamul leader said.

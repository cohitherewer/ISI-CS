          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 7: Science graduates with honours can now enter a bachelor of engineering (BE) course directly in the second year if they clear a test.        
	The doors of engineering colleges will, however, be open only to those studying mathematics as one of their subjects at the undergraduate level.        
	The new move by the state board for joint entrance examinations (JEE) will make the competition tougher for engineering diploma holders, who were the only ones earlier eligible to take the test for second-year entry into engineering colleges.        
	BSc honours degree holders would be allowed to take the special entrance test held by the board this year itself.        
	Science graduates who want BE course admission through the lateral entry test will have to study math as one of the elective subjects at the graduation level, said Siddhartha Dutta, the chairman of the joint entrance board.         
	We will soon announce the other criteria that they need to fulfil to seek admission through the lateral entry tests, Dutta added.        
	Admissions to BE first year are held through the state joint entrance examinations. Students who clear the Class XII board examinations with science are eligible to appear in JEE.         
	All Class XII science students can also take the test.        
	The JEE board had introduced the system of allowing diploma engineers to seek admissions to second year BE courses many years ago.        
	Diploma courses in engineering are taught in polytechnic colleges. Admission to the polytechnic colleges are held through a separate entrance examination conducted by the JEE board.         
	Students clearing Madhyamik and equivalent Class X board examinations are eligible to appear in the JEE for polytechnic admission.         
	The All India Council for Technical Education, the regulatory body for engineering education, had written to the state board asking it to give science graduates the scope to seek admission to second year BE courses, an official said.        
	Dutta said 10 per cent of the total seats in engineering will be reserved for students coming through lateral entry.         
	The 70-odd engineering institutions in Bengal have nearly 17,000 seats.         
	Many students aspiring to pursue engineering education join BSc courses when they fail to find a rank on the JEE merit list after Class XII.        
	Many of these students ignore their BSc studies and appear in the joint entrance examinations over and over again. The new decision will enable this group to concentrate more on their honours papers, said a college teacher in Calcutta.

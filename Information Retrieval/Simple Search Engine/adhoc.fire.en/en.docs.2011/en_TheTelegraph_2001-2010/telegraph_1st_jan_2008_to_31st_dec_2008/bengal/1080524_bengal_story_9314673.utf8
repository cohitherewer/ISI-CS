	Burdwan, May 23: Alleged CPM supporters stormed the house of a Trinamul Congress village panchayat candidate today and beat him, his pregnant wife and mother.        
	Rakhi Majhi, 35, who is four months pregnant, was shoved to the ground and kicked in the stomach at Belsar village in Burdwans Raina. She runs the risk of losing her child.        
	Trinamul candidate Pareshnath Majhis fault was that he had demanded a recounting in writing from the district magistrate after he lost the Hijalna seat to the CPM.        
	A gynaecologist at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, where Rakhi has been admitted, said: We are desperately trying to save the baby.         
	Dr A. Ghosh, however, added: We are very worried, the patient has injuries in her lower abdomen.        
	Pareshnath and his mother Sandhya, 60, have also been hospitalised.        
	Rakhi said she was busy in chores around 8am when nine persons, on three motorcycles, stopped in front of her house, about 120km from Calcutta. I knew four of them. They called my husband.         
	As soon he came out, they hurled abuses at him, dragged him towards the gate and started beating him up. I rushed to stop them but they threw me to the ground and kicked me in the stomach. When my mother-in-law jumped to my rescue, they pushed her hard. She fell and became unconscious.        
	District Trinamul vice-president Susanta Ghosh has lodged a complaint with district superintendent of police Peeyush Pandey.         
	We have detained three persons, Pandey said.        
	Amirul Islam, who had worked as an election agent for a Congress candidate, was beaten up at Belgram village in Ketugram last night. Ketugram police refused to accept my complaint, said Amirul, who has also been admitted to the medical college hospital.        
	In Nadia, Trinamul supporter Satyajit Bala, 40, was beaten up and hacked in Chapra, allegedly because he had re- fused to work for the CPM during the elections.

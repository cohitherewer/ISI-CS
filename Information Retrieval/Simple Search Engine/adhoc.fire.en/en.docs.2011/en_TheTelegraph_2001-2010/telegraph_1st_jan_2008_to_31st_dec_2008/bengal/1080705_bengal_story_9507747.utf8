          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 4: Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today appealed to Somen Mitra not to join Mamata Banerjees camp at a time we are gaining in strength in Bengal.         
	One should not quit the Congress after we have performed well on our own in both the rural and municipal polls. I appeal to him to remain in the organisation at this juncture, the state Congress chief said.        
	The Congress general sec-retary in charge of Bengal, Mohsina Kidwai, said tonight that she had spoken to Mitra to enquire about his meeting with Mamata last night. We are keeping a watch on the developments, she said.        
	On a days visit to the city, Das Munshi spoke to party functionaries to assess the situation after Mamatas visit to Mitras Lower Rawdon Street flat to discuss ways to strengthen the anti-CPM secular platform minus the Congress.        
	During the two-hour meeting, Mamata had made it clear to Mitra that she would only tie up with those who quit the Congress, the party hand in glove with the CPM at the Centre.         
	Our intention is to reduce the number of CPM seats in the Lok Sabha and the Assembly. So, at the moment, there is no question of talking to the Congress. This new anti-CPM alliance that will emerge in the coming days will be without the Congress, she said.        
	A Das Munshi aide said: Priyadas appeal is a last-ditch effort to dissuade Mitra from switching to the Trinamul Congress.         
	Mitra, however, hinted again that his days in the Congress were numbered. Bengal cannot be saved until an alternative anti-CPM platform is floated, he said on the sidelines of a programme at Tipu Sultan mosque today.        
	The former state Congress chief also refused to call on Das Munshi, though the Union minister spent the entire day in the city. Mitras lieutenant Jayanta Bhattacharya met the state party chief.         
	Priyada asked me if we are quitting. I told him that no final decision had been taken, Bhattacharya said.        
	Last evening, Mitras wife had resented the manner in which a section of the Congress had labelled him a CPM stooge. Das Munshi tried to placate her today, saying: I share my concern with Somens wi- fe. Out party people should not have called her husband that.

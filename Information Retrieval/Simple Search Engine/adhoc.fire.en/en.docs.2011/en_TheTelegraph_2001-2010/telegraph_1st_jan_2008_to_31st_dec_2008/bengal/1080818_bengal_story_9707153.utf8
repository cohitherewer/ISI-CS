                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Citu defers Haldia strike
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Haldia Petrochemicals                                  
	Tamluk, Aug. 17: The CPMs labour arm today deferred a three-day strike it had called at Haldia Petrochemicals from tomorrow.        
	The Citu-led union pushed it back to September 2-4, citing ongoing negotiations with the management.        
	The Citu had called the strike demanding permanent employment for 183 contract workers, among other things.         
	Today, Lakshman Seth, the chairman of the HPL Employees Union, said: We have deferred the strike as negotiations are on with the management. We have revised our demands. Now if the management does not agree to them, we will hold a three-day strike from September 2.         
	But union sources said the strike was deferred following pressure from the state Citu leadership.         
	We do not want to give the Opposition any opportunity to say that we are working against the interests of industry, said a Citu leader, who is also member of the Citus state committee.        
	Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee has lined up an indefinite agitation in front of the Tata Motors project in Singur from August 24. If we have to launch a campaign against the Trinamul leader, branding her anti-industry, then we cannot afford to send wrong signals ourselves.         
	Earlier, the Citu had called a days strike at HPL on April 8 but it was put off after senior CPM leaders intervened because it did not want the HPL, its showpiece industrial unit, to be dragged into the bandh culture. Since production started in HPL in 2001, there have been no strikes.        
	In a letter to the HPL management, the Citu has said that if the 183 contract workers cant be absorbed right now, they must get salaries and benefits, including hikes, on a par with permanent employees.         
	Also, one member of each family from whom land was acquired for the HPL project should get a job, the Citu said. There are about 400 such families. We dont want to go on strike but we will be compelled to do so in the interest of the workers, Seth said.        
	HPL officials said three meetings were held with the union this month. After the meetings, HPL sent a letter to the Citu leaders of the union saying the 183 employees could not be absorbed right now. But we can absorb a few of them. For the rest, we can consider giving priority when there are vacancies, an HPL official said.

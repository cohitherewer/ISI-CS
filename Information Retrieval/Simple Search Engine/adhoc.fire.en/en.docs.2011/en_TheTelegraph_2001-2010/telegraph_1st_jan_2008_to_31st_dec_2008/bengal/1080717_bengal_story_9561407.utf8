          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 16: The government is planning to set up a special inspectorate to monitor self-financed institutions offering undergraduate courses in every stream, from science, arts, and commerce to technology, medicine and law.        
	The council of higher education discussed the proposal today in the wake of a flurry of complaints about lack of quality control in such colleges, though they charge high fees.         
	This inspectors will monitor the self-financed institutions through financial and academic audits, said council secretary Dipak Bhattacharya.        
	Higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri attended todays meeting.         
	There are about 150 self-financed institutions across Bengal, 55 of which offer engineering and technology courses. Many of the colleges offer undergraduate and postgraduate courses in management and computer applications.         
	The affiliating universities now conduct the inspections. But they cannot take any action as the colleges do not depend on the governments financial assistance. The universities can only check things like whether the colleges are foll- owing university-prescribed syllabi and admitting students according to norms.        
	The council has also deci-ded to set up a committee to examine the fee structure of the institutions.

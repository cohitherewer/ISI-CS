          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, July 13: A 65-year-old widow was allegedly throttled to death in a Murshidabad village last night after she gifted a fraction of her over 13-acre property to her daughters daughters.        
	All four sons of Menaka Das are missing.         
	Police have registered a murder case on the basis of a complaint lodged by Kalyani Das, whose daughters Madhumita, 21, and Sangita, 19, had got two bighas out of the 40 that Menaka owned.        
	The wives and two sons of Menakas missing sons have been detained. They are being interrogated. We are looking for the four sons, who are absconding, said Sisram, the Jangipur subdivisional police officer.        
	According to the police, Menaka had inherited the land from her father.         
	Of the four sons, Brojen, 48, is a bank clerk and Bhudeb, 45, a schoolteacher. They stay in their own houses in Raghunathgunj town. Arun, 35, and Rinku, 28, live at Teghori village, about 10km from the town and cultivate their mothers land.         
	Kalyani, who stays in Jangipur town, said her mother loved her daughters and had gifted them a bigha each last month.         
	As soon as my two brothers who stayed in the village came to know about it, they became furious. They began to mentally torture my mother and had even barred her from leaving the house. Yesterday, my two other brothers who stay in Raghunathgunj town, had also come to our village home, Kalyani said.        
	A police officer said neighbours had heard the brothers shouting last evening.        
	The brothers told villagers this morning that their mother had committed suicide by hanging herself. But the villagers did not find any marks on her throat that indicates hanging. But the marks on her throat looked like fingerprints. There were burns on her body, too, the officer added.        
	The brothers fled after the villagers called Kalyani.         
	Kalyani, 40, lodged an FIR against her brothers, accusing them of murdering their mother.        
	We had not seen Menaka for nearly a month. Later, we learnt from Kalyani that her sons did not allow her to step out of the house as punishment for the gift to her granddaughters, said Animesh Das, a resident of Teghori, about 260km from Calcutta        
	We suspect it is not a case of suicide, he added.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 3: Airport close-circuit television today caught a well-to-do passenger in snazzy dress stealing anothers cellphone, barely two months after an airline employee was filmed in a similar act.        
	In his black jeans and black T-shirt, a gold chain dangling from the neck and sunglasses raised over his forehead, the import-export businessman from Rajasthan looked an unlikely mobile thief.        
	But Ashok Agarwal, who is in his 40s, broke down when confronted with the footage, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officers said.         
	The garment merchant was arrested on the charge of pocketing the handset of Calcutta businessman Mohammed Hussain, who had forgotten it on the security check-in tray.        
	Hussain, flying to Mumbai on Jet Airways, had placed his white cellphone on the tray for an X-ray scan but forgotten to pick it up after he was frisked. He remembered it after 15 minutes and rushed back from the departure lounge. But the gadget was missing.        
	The CISF immediately ran the CCTV footage and launched a search for Agarwal.        
	The phone was lying there for sometime when Agarwal arrived and left his mobile, too, for the scan. After completing the security procedures, he returned to the counter and picked up not only his own cellphone but Hussains, too, a CISF official said.        
	Agarwal was waiting to board a SpiceJet flight to Bangalore when the CISF accosted him.        
	Had there been a delay of a few more minutes, he would have boarded the flight, said K.N. Tripathi, CISF commandant at the airport.        
	Agarwal denied taking Hussains phone but when officers showed him the recordings, he confessed and returned the mobile, the CISF said.        
	But handed over to airport police, who arrested him, Agarwal later said he had picked up Husseins mobile by mistake.        
	The businessman from Rajasthans Churu district said he exported and imported garments worth several lakhs and sometimes spent up to Rs 50,000 on a single business trip. There was no reason why a man like him would steal a cellphone, he argued.        
	But officers said the footage suggested his act was deliberate and cited how he had denied taking the phone till he was shown proof.        
	The CISF said Agarwal mainly exported garments from across India, including Calcutta, to Nepal.        
	On March 18, an MDLR Airlines employee, Dhiraj Gurung, 24, had been caught on the airport CCTV stealing a passengers cellphone from the X-ray tray.

	Tamluk, July 28: Trinamul Congress and CPM supporters allegedly hurled bombs and fired at each other in Nandigram tonight.         
	The exchange of fire began around 7.30pm at Sherkhanchowk in Khejuri, about 165 km from Calcutta.        
	Police said trouble started when CPM supporters hurled bombs targeting a Trinamul procession near Sherkhanchowk. The firing continued till late tonight, though the police claimed the situation was under control.        
	Trinamul district president and Egra MLA Sisir Adhikari said: The CPM has again started its recapturing spree and thats why they attacked our procession.        
	The CPM has denied the charge, saying Trinamul supporters attacked first.

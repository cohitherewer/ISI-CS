	Calcutta, Jan. 10: Students taking Madhyamik 2008 will get 15 extra minutes to read their question papers before putting pen on paper.
    
	Examinees have to be seated by 11.45am. They would be provided with question papers at 11.45 and would be allowed to start writing at noon, said Swapan Sarkar, the secretary of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.
    
	The decision was taken in tune with a policy adopted by various boards following a Union human resource ministry directive to make exams as stress-free as possible.
    
	The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education had announced a similar system for HS candidates a few months ago. 
    
	The boards conducting the ICSE-ISC and CBSE tests had implemented the central directive four years ago.
    
	We should not have taken this long to introduce the system, said a College Street schoolteacher.
    
	This years Madhyamik is slated to begin on February 15.

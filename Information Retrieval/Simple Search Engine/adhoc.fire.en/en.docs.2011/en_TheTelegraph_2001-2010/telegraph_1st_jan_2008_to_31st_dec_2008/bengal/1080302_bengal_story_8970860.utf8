The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Baby birth holiday to avoid Feb 29
                                                                                                               Baby birth holiday to avoid Feb 29
          SANJAY MANDAL                           Whens your BDay?                                  
	Calcutta, March 1: Not many parents would like to celebrate their childs birthday once in four years.         
	On leap-year day, Calcuttas hospitals saw one of the lowest number of childbirths as doctors were flooded with requests to defer caesarean sections.         
	There were many post- ponements yesterday. Parents had requested for deliveries to be done on Thursday or after Friday midnight, said P.L. Mehta, the chief executive officer of Bhagirathi Neotia Women and Child Care Centre.        
	The hospital had only one delivery yesterday, February 29. On a normal day, it has around 10.         
	The only delivery at the hospital yesterday was that of Purnima Jyotsna, wife of Shyam Sunder, a multi-national company executive.        
	We had planned the delivery on Monday but my wife felt a discomfort yesterday and the doctor asked me to admit her. We were blessed with a boy, said Sunder.         
	Ranjit Chakraborty, who did the caesarean on Purnima, said: Most parents avoid childbirth on February 29. Gynaecology operation theatres were empty yesterday with only emergency deliveries taking place.        
	Calcutta Medical Research Institute, too, had a lone child delivery against at least five on any given day.         
	On religious occasions and other special days like Independence Day, the number of planned deliveries shoot up. Yesterday, it was just the opposite, said Rupak Barua, its chief operations officer.         
	At other hospitals like EEDF and Woodlands, there were almost 50 per cent less planned deliveries yesterday, hospital officials said.        
	My wife and relatives told me they did not want to celebrate our childs birthday every four years. In case of a leap-year birth, wed have had to follow the Hindu calendar to celebrate the day every year, said S. Barik (name changed).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bicycle blast
                                                                                                               Bicycle blast
                            
	Volka (Alipurduar), Feb. 20: A bomb kept in a plastic carry bag hanging from a cycle went off here a little after noon today, killing one and injuring four.        
	Juran Das, a cook at a roadside eatery, was killed. The blast shook the National Crime Records Bureau office.        
	Police suspect an Ulfa hand in the blast because of its similarities with the ones on the Bengal-Assam border last month and in November.

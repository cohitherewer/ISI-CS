The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ghisinghs lifeline cut
                                                                                                               Ghisinghs lifeline cut
  - Govt rules out extension of term        OUR BUREAU                          Madhyamik examinees on their way to a Kalimpong centre. Chinlop Fudong Lepcha                                        
	Feb. 20: The state government does not have any plan to extend Subash Ghisinghs term as Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council administrator, minister Asok Bhattacharya said after a cabinet meeting today.        
	The government is not considering the renewal of Ghisinghs term. We dont have any such plan. After March 24 (when his term ends), a government representative will be appointed as administrator of the hill council. Im announcing this under instructions from the chief minister, the urban development minister said.         
	The announcement comes days after Bhattacharya said there was no way the government could announce Ghisinghs removal immediately. It is only after March 24 that the government can arrive at a decision, the minister had said.         
	The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has called an indefinite bandh in the Darjeeling hills from today to pressure the government into removing Ghisingh from the council immediately.         
	The GNLF chief was holed up in Pintail Village, 3km from Siliguri, for the third day after Morcha supporters blocked all routes leading to Darjeeling.        
	The Morcha claimed that only a handful of GNLF workers were left in Sukna as most had joined the new party. Unhappy over Ghisinghs insistence on the Sixth Schedule status for Darjeeling (and not a separate Gorkhaland), many have joined our party, said Lalit Thapa, the Sukna branch president of the Morcha. The nearby GNLF office was closed through the day.        
	Bhattacharya held the delay in the passage of the Sixth Schedule bill responsible for the trouble. An early passage would have meant elections to the hill council. That would have solved the problem.        
	For Ghisingh, it was another day of rest. He took a walk around the cottage at Pintail and rested in his room, said I.N. Pradhan, the Kurseong president of the GNLF, who spent the day with his party boss.        
	Since morning, Morcha supporters blocked National Highway 55 at Salbari and Sukna, not allowing even bicycles to pass.         
	Army vehicles, ambulances and vehicles carrying students were allowed to move.

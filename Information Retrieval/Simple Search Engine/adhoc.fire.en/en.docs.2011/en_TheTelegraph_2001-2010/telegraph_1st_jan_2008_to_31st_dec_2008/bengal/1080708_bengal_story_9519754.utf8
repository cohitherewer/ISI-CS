	July 7: Entomologist Petr Svacha, who was arrested for allegedly collecting insects from a Darjeeling forest, has to languish in jail. His bail plea could not even be moved because of a lawyers strike to press for a Gorkhaland state.        
	Czech national Svacha, 51, of the Academy of Sciences, Prague, and Emil Kucera, 52, were held held near Rimbik after forest officers caught them on June 22 with more than 200 beetles, butterflies and moths.        
	An environment lawyer of Calcutta High Court said the case against Svacha was weak. The law says a person engaged in research for the benefit of mankind cannot be kept in custody, Supradip Roy said.        
	With no one to move the bail plea, Svacha decided to speak for the duo. He told chief judicial magistrate N. Dey that they had been made to sign on blank sheets on the night of June 22 by the forest officials. We fear that they may be wrongly used against us.        
	Svacha, a world-renowned authority on beetle larvae with impeccable credentials, said they were not traders in wildlife. As an entomologist, I can say that the collection will not change the bio-diversity of the area. It is purely for my research, he told the court.        
	The insects, he added, were not collected from within the wildlife area of Singalila National Park but from a congested fringe area where cattle grazed. Grazing inside a national park is forbidden.         
	He also told the magistrate he wanted his money, seized by forest officials, back.        
	Sources said the duo had Rs 12,000 and $630 and 5,300 Czech korunas on them during arrest.        
	The magistrate said nothing could be done as no records were available because of the strike. I suggest that you give us all that you said in writing, Dey said. The next hearing is on July 21.         
	The strike will continue till August 7.

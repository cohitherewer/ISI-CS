The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Suicide for job and love lost
                                                                                                               Suicide for job and love lost
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, Feb. 17: A young man killed himself in a Burdwan village on Thursday out of despair for not getting a job, which made the girl he loved marry elsewhere.        
	Abhijit Nandi, 27, had pinned his hope on a primary teachers training certificate, for which he had enrolled himself in a Burdwan institute in 2005.        
	But months before his final exam in June 2006, Calcutta High Court restrained his institute from holding it as it lacked the mandatory affiliation to the Nation Council for Teachers Education.         
	The certificate, essential for a primary teachers post, would have almost guaranteed Abhijit a job. We are giving jobs to anyone who has passed Madhyamik and has a primary teachers training institute certificate. There are around 2,000 vacancies in Burdwan district alone at the moment, said Saidul Haque, the chairman of the Burdwan Primary School Council.        
	Abhijits elder brother Rajen said he was a good student. He got over 80 per cent in four subjects in Madhyamik and a first division in higher secondary.         
	The small farmers son at Bijur village in Memari, about 105km from Calcutta, had quit his mathematics honours course midway because of poor health and hurry to get a job.        
	Following the court order, the state had approached the Centre, which by an ordinance gave six months to the 143 institutes that were hauled up to get the affiliation. Most availed of the opportunity but some 30 institutes, including Abhijits, did not.         
	Rajen said Abhijit went into a state of depression after the court order.        
	His childhood friends said he had been in love with a girl from the same village. He could not reveal his relationship to the elders because he was jobless. He would have spoken to them after getting the teachers job, said Mrinal Banerjee, who lives in Memari town.         
	The girl, he added, was pressured by her family to get married and she agreed to a proposal in December.         
	Abhijit consumed a bottle of pesticide. He died at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.

	Khatra, March 12: A tribal couple in a Bankura village have been forced to perform their daughters last rites to atone for her sin of marrying outside her tribe.         
	Hundreds flocked to witness the shradh of 27-year-old Shraboni Mandi last Monday in Khejurberia, 6km from Khatra town where she lives with her husband.        
	Her father Sanatan was also made to pay a fine of Rs 9,000 and for a funeral feast to avoid being ostracised.         
	A goat was offered to Maranguru, the tribal god, and about 200 villagers gorged on its meat, khichuri and toddy.        
	Her (Shrabonis) offence is serious. It is against tribal tradition and culture. She deserves to be punished. Her family must snap all relations with her. We have declared her dead, said Prasanna Kumar Tudu, who led the priests performing the rituals.        
	Villagers said Shraboni had eloped with Jhoru Saini, a 32-year-old mason, five months ago. His family had organised their wedding.         
	Sanatan, 55, who grows vegetables on a small patch of land, said he had tried to convince his daughter to end her marriage and return home, but in vain.         
	Finally, a village meeting pronounced my daughter dead and told me to perform her last rites, he added.        
	Sanatan has another daughter, who is married to a tribal. My wife had refused to declare our daughter dead but she gave in when the priest warned that we would be ostracised. After the shradh, we have accepted that Shraboni is dead for us, he said.         
	Shraboni tried to put up a brave face. Have I committed a crime by marrying the person I love? she asked.        
	Im not ready to accept anyone dictating terms to us. My parents will one day und- erstand I did no wrong. Im very happy with my marriage.         
	The incident has left the Khatra civil administration red-faced. Subdivisional officer G. Kirankumar described it as quite unfortunate.         
	The CPM-led Bigyan Manchas Khatra chapter said a drive to educate tribals would be launched in the district. Jamini Mahato, the Manchas zonal secretary, called the incident a shame.

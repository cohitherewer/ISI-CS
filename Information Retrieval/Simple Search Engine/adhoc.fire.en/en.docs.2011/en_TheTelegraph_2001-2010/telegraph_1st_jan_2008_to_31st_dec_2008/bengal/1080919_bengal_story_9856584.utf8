	Calcutta, Sept. 18: A PIL was today filed in Calcutta High Court demanding its intervention to ensure the Tatas stayed in Singur.         
	The court should ask the Bengal government to take measures so that the Tatas do not abandon the Nano project or shift it to any other state, Srirupa Mitra Chowdhury said in her petition filed on behalf of a Delhi-based NGO.        
	The petition said if Bengal lost out on the project, it would be detrimental to development of industry and job generation in the state.        
	Supriya also asked the court to direct the state government to take steps to ensure a conducive atmosphere for Tata Motors.        
	The case will come up for hearing on September 19.

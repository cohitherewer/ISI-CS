	Memari (Burdwan), Sept. 10: A woman and her teenage daughter were tied up, soaked in kerosene and burnt alive by her husband in Burdwans Memari this morning.        
	Asraf Ali, 48, had married Rashida Bibi, 42, eight months ago, after the death of her first husband Johur Ali Mondal, but the mother of two had been asking for a divorce.         
	Around 2am, Asraf locked the houses of Rashidas four immediate neighbours in Gobindapur village, about 90km from Calcutta, and entered her house, bolted from inside, by breaking the asbestos roof.        
	He tied up Rashida and her 15-year-old daughter Mahima, doused them in kerosene and set them afire, a police officer said. Rashidas son Jahangir, 17, works in Calcutta.        
	Police said she had been staying in her first husbands house even after marriage with the jobless and ill-tempered Asraf. He visited Rashida occasionally. She was having problems adjusting and had sought divorce.         
	As Johurs friend, Asraf had helped the family during his illness. After Johurs death two years ago, Asraf helped Rashida with money and she developed a relationship with him, the officer said.        
	Asgar Ali, a neighbour, said he heard screams and saw flames leap out of the window. I called other neighbours but they couldnt come out as their houses were locked from outside. We saw Asraf run away. Villagers chased him but he whipped out a revolver.        
	Asraf is absconding.

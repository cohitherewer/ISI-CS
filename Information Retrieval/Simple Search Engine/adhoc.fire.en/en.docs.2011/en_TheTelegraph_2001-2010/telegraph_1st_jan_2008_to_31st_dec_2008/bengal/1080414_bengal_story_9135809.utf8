	Calcutta, April 13: Congress president Sonia Gandhi will address rallies in Malda and Murshidabad in the run-up to the May panchayat polls.    
	Announcing Sonias visit, state Congress chief Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said: The Congress president will address two conventions of party workers on April 28 in Malda and Murshidabad. The panchayat polls will be held on May 11, 14 and 18.    
	Das Munshi also said that the Congress would not actively oppose the 12-hour bandh called by Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress on April 21 to protest price rise, though the party was morally opposed to the shutdown.     
	On the possibility of seat adjustments with the Trinamul, he said the party was not averse to it. Party functionaries have got the go-ahead to tie up with the Trinamul, he said, but added that the response has to come from the other end. Mamata has turned down the offer.

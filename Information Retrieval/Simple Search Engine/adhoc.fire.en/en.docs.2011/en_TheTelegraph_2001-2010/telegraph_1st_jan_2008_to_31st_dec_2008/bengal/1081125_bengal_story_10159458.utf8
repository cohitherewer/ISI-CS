          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 24: Dunlop chairman Pawan Ruia today said the proposed pay-cut agreement between the management and the unions had to be executed to end the stalemate at the Sahagunj factory.        
	After a meeting with labour minister Mrinal Banerjee at Writers Buildings, he said: Poor market conditions had forced us to shut down production. But we did not declare suspension of work as we plan to re-start production when things become normal. Its not a permanent closure but a temporary shutdown. We told the minister that the agreement between us and the unions would have to be executed.        
	The minister will meet the unions tomorrow. The picture, he said, would become clear after the meeting.        
	The company has approached the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation for working capital and a term loan of Rs 115 crore.         
	According to Ruia, Dunlops problem was not lack of demand for tyres but difficulty in getting bank loans. We have about Rs 20 crore worth of orders but the crisis is with the availability of working capital, he said, adding: The global meltdown has made it difficult for companies to get bank loans. If the government puts in a word for us, things can be a bit easier.        
	After agreeing initially, the Dunlop unions had opposed the company proposal for a Rs 2,000-a-month grant to workers until production, suspended last Monday, resumed.        
	Ruia said: We have got moral support from the state government but not any incentive (like sales tax relief).         
	However, he did not raise the issue with the minister today as the labour problem will have to settled first.

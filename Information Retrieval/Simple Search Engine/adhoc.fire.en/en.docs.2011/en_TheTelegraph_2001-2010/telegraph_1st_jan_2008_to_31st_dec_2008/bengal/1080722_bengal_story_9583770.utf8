                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Unions in IIT food mess
          OUR BUREAU                              
	July 21: Over 250 IIT Kharagpur students had to go without lunch at their hostel to- day as a contractor downed mess shutters after Citu and Aituc union supporters bashed up some of its employees.         
	Although students of only one of the 19 halls were denied lunch at their mess, they were not the only ones suffering. Agitation by two unions controlled by a joint forum of the CPM and CPI labour arms, demanding absorption of contract workers and those engaged for construction of new hostels, has crippled mess operations in three halls.        
	The Jagadish Chandra Bose hall residents were the worst hit, having to eat at canteens on the campus on the first day after summer vacation. The Meghnad Saha and Homi Jahangir Bhaba messes shut down after 2pm.        
	Two others worked normally as they had absorbed all workers.        
	We had engaged private caterers to run the mess at five halls. They were ready to absorb the existing workers. But another group, temporarily engaged for construction work, is also demanding absorption, said an IIT official.         
	There are about 150 mess workers in the five halls.         
	Sudip De, a PhD student staying in the JC Bose hall, said the mess had been closed for two months because of the vacation. Some of us, who did not go home, travelled 4km every day for meals. We had thought our travails would end today, said De.        
	The contractor for the JC Bose hall, Sudarshan Behera, said: We had agreed to absorb some members of the Hall Workers Union. However, the construction workers body demanded the inclusion of their members, too. We cant accommodate so many.        
	He closed the mess after some of his employees were allegedly attacked.        
	We demand the inclusion of the construction labourers since they are rightful claimants to the jobs, said Purnendu Panigrahi of the construction labourers union.        
	While negotiations are on between the authorities and the unions, the students of the three affected hostels will be accommodated in other halls. We are trying to restore normality at the earliest. But for the time being, we have asked all students to have their meals at the two hostels that are operating, said D.K. Tripathi, the dean of students affairs.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta/Tamluk, Aug. 14: East Midnapore superintendent of police S.S. Panda, whose tenure saw the Nandigram battle reach its peak, was transferred today.         
	Home secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said nothing should be read into the move. Just like I was transferred from the higher education department, Panda has been transferred.        
	Chakrabarti, however, did not say what position Panda would hold now. Purulia SP Ashok Prasad will take Pandas place.        
	Panda was appointed the East Midnapore SP in October last year and the recapture of Nandigram took place a month later.        
	The Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee had repeatedly sought his removal, accusing him of withdrawing about 10 police camps and an outpost in the interior villages days before before the recapture. It had also charged him with inaction during the bloody clashes over land acquisition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha ready for long road
                                                                                                               Morcha ready for long road

	Darjeeling, March 2: Bimal Gurung took thrice the normal time to reach Darjeeling from Bagdogra airport yesterday, but the hill leader is not daunted by long roads.        
	Gurung today appealed to his supporters to be ready to tread miles to get Gorkhaland.         
	Thousands had thronged the roadside as the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief left Bagdogra at 2pm yesterday. He reached Darjeeling around 11 at night, and by the time he started for home, it was 3am.        
	Gurung was up from bed hours later as supporters flooded the Morcha office this morning.        
	The path will be long but our goal is Gorkhaland. We must take this movement forward in a democratic and peaceful manner. We have to take into account the livelihood of our people. I appeal to our unit leaders to maintain peace and tranquillity in the hills. The tourist season has just started and people must not be deprived of their livelihood, Gurung said.        
	The Morcha, formed five months ago, has been riding high on popularity and, more recently, its success in stalling the Sixth Schedule bill. A parliamentary panels recommendation of a fresh assessment of the bill has virtually put the special-status legislation in cold storage.        
	But Gurung cautioned his supporters against getting carried away. We must be ready for a long struggle as elections (to the hill council) are secondary for us.        
	Gurung reiterated that Subash Ghisingh would not be allowed to return to Darjeeling.         
	There are unconfirmed reports that some documents were removed from the council by some people yesterday. We will seek an explanation from the state government if such an incident has taken place, he said.         
	The Morcha chief warned that the partys agitation would now get stronger.

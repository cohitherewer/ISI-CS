The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata in Nandigram
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Mamata in Nandigram
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 31: Mamata Banerjee today announced that the Trinamul Congress-controlled East Midnapore zilla parishad and the Nandigram panchayat samiti would provide jobs to the families of those injured or killed since the land war began in January 2007.        
	We have the peoples mandate in East Midnapore. So, our newly elected members would construct market complexes to provide jobs to the families of those injured or killed in the anti-land acquisition movement, Mamata told a rally on her first trip to Nandigram after the panchayat poll results.        
	Ashok Guria, the CPMs district secretariat member, welcomed the move. If family members of those injured or killed get jobs, it would be a boon to everybody irrespective of party affiliation, he said.        
	Mamata said she wanted peace to return in Nandigram, but the OC of Nandigram (Debashish Chakraborty) cannot oversee the peace initiative since he himself indulged in violence.

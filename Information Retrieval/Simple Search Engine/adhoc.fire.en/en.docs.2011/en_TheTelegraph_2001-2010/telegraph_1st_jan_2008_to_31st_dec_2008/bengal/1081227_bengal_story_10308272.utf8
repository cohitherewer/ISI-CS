The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul admits vote-split scare
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Trinamul admits vote-split scare
          OUR BUREAU                              (Above) Badshah Alam, and Trinamul leader Mukul Roy				                                 
	Dec. 26: The Trinamul Congress today admitted that the Independent candidate for the Nandigram bypoll had been attacked yesterday because he would be dividing anti-Left votes.        
	Badshah Alam was injured in the head when about 250 alleged Trinamul activists pounced on him while he was campaigning for the January 5 poll.        
	Trinamul general and party MP Mukul Roy said in Calcutta today that it was an outburst of peoples anger against him.         
	Alam has been fielded by the CPM to split anti-Left votes in Nandigram. Local people, a majority of whom are with us, are angry with him as he is trying to jeopardise the prospects of our party nominee, Roy said.        
	Going a step further, Abu Taher, the Nandigram panchayat samiti vice-president, said the attack was expected from people who have been agitating against forcible land acquisition by the government.        
	Ironically, Alam belongs to the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind, whose leader Siddiqullah Chowdhury had been at the helm of the anti-acquisition protests until Mamata Banerjee took control of it. Siddiqullah was with Alam when he was attacked yesterday.        
	Taher said: Siddiqullah was very much in the anti-land acquisition movement but he is now indirectly helping the CPM win in Nandigram by fielding Alam. Our grievances against Alam are genuine.        
	Alam said in Calcutta that the Trinamul assault was a pre-planned one to avenge the attack on Mamata in 1990.        
	Alams brother Laloo had hit Mamata, then in the Congress, on the head.        
	I heard Trinamul activists in the mob accuse me and my brother of attacking Mamata on August 16, 1990 at the Hazra crossing. They hurled abuses at me and then started throwing stones, Alam said. He was brought to Calcutta this morning for a CT scan.        
	I want to clarify to the Trinamul leadership that I was not involved in the 1990 attack, my brother was. Some CPM leaders had framed me in the case to malign me, he said.        
	Alam, then a member of the CPMs powerful Calcutta district committee, had been showcaused for defending his brother and later expelled.         
	Alam had later joined the BJP. He jointly campaigned with Mamata for the 2006 Assembly polls since the Trinamul Congress chief was very much with the BJP-led NDA.         
	Alam quit the BJP and joined Jamait in 2007.        
	Siddiqullah, still camping in Nandigram, said today that he was scared to campaign in Trinamul strongholds Kaliachak and Sonachura. Police have failed to contain the violence unleashed by Trinamul, he alleged.        
	The Jamait leader campaigned elsewhere in Nandigram today with police escorts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Basu backs Buddha on capital
                                                                                                            Basu backs Buddha on capital
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 5: Jyoti Basu today endorsed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees assertion that there was no alternative to private capital for the states industrialisation.        
	Weve been seeking private investment since my tenure as chief minister. Capitalists have a role to play in the states industrialisation, Basu said after a CPM state secretariat meeting at Alimuddin Street this morning.        
	He added: Our party believes in socialism but it is still far away. Being a state in the Indian Union, is it possible for us to bring in socialism?        
	There was a message for the working class, too. We have always supported workers interests. But they should also not shun their responsibility to increase production.        
	The chief minister had on Thursday said that Bengal had no option but to follow the capitalist course. Do we (the state) have capital to set up a steel plant? he had asked.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose had backed the chief minister yesterday.        
	Basu took a dig at the Left Front partners. I dont understand why they are raising questions about private investments now. Even when we were in the Opposition during B.C. Roys time, we never opposed private investment for industrialisation.        
	The Forward Bloc did not comment on Basus remarks today but said it did not subscribe to the chief ministers views. We shall give a fitting reply to his desperation to woo capitalists at a rally at Singur tomorrow, party state secretary Ashok Ghosh thundered.        
	The Bloc has sought bilateral talks with the CPM. It will take place on January 10 or 11.         
	Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee today iterated the need to acquire land for industry while laying the foundation stone of a road overbridge in Murshidabad. The compensation has to be fair, he said.

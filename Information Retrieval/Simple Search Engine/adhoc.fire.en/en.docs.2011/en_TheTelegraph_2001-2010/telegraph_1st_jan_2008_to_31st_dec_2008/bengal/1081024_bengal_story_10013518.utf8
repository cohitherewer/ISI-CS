          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 23: A Delhi police team today beat up a woman in North 24-Parganas when they did not find her husband, wanted in an abduction case. When residents of Baduria gheraoed the police, they fired in the air to escape.        
	Trouble began this evening when the team of four from Tilaknagar police station in Delhi came to Baduria, about 60 km from Calcutta, in search of Razzak Hossein. The 35-year-old is accused of abducting Sweety Chauhan, 19, and abetting her suicide.        
	Residents of Ramchandrapur, where Razzak lived, alleged that the Delhi policemen assaulted Mathera Bibi when they did not find Razzak. Mathera was yelling for help, so we rushed to Razzaks house. We saw the policemen thrashing her, said Jahangir Alam.        
	As more people gathered, the Delhi team got nervous. One took out his revolver and fired in the air, said Rabiul Haque, pradhan of the Ramchandrapur panchayat.        
	When the villagers scattered, local policemen who had gone with the Delhi team whisked the cops from the capital away to their vehicle. The villagers regrouped and chased the car. At this, a Delhi policeman fired in the air, Haque said.         
	We can confirm the firing after we get the spent cartridges. We have started an inquiry, said Sugata Sen, additional superintendent of police.         
	Late tonight, nearly 1,000 villagers surrounded the police station.         
	According to Delhi police, Razzak met Sweety while working as a zari craftsman in there. He fell in love with Sweety and brought her to Baduria in mid-February. After a fortnight, Sweetys father came and took her away, but she committed suicide in Delhi, said a Baduria police official.        
	Razzak went back to Delhi and was not heard of since. But Sweetys father filed a complaint in Delhi accusing Razzak of kidnapping her and abetting her suicide, the police said.

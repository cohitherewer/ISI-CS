The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mayors mayor defence
                                                                                                            Mayors mayor defence
                            
	Calcutta, Feb. 6: Calcutta mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya today wore the lawyers gown for a fellow mayor accused of charging residents in excess for water and got an order in his favour.        
	Bhattacharyya had moved the Calcutta High Court division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice S.P. Talukdar against a verdict holding Chandernagore mayor Amiya Das guilty of collecting excess water tax from residents.         
	He told the court how the tax was fixed and how some residents tried to evade it by damaging their water meters. The division bench passed an interim stay on the December order.         
	The Calcutta mayor said the amount of water required for a person was determined on the basis of WHO guidelines. To stop misuse, a higher rate is required on the use of excess water.        
	Some residents of Chandernagore, Hooghly, had accused the civic body of forcing them to pay in excess and Das and some of his officers were held guilty. They were fined Rs 2,000 each.        
	Bhattacharyya said: It is a vital issue for the civic authorities. The judiciary should be aware of the problems they face.

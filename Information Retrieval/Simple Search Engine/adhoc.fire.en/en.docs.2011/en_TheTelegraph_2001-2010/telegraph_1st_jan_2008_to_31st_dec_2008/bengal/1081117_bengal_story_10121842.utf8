                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Feet limp, but blast driver wants same post
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 16: Mukul Phul Mali might never be able to walk again, but the driver of the car that bore the brunt of the Salboni blast is raring to get back to work in the Maoist-hit belt.        
	Doctors at AMRI Hospitals, where Mali is admitted, today said his feet might have been permanently disabled.         
	Mali, a police constable, was at the wheels of the pilot car of Union minister Ram Vilas Paswans convoy, which was hit by the landmine explosion in Salboni on November 2.        
	He suffered severe injuries in the thoracic vertebra and abdomen and can barely move his feet now.        
	Initially after the blast, there was no sense in either of my legs. Now, I can move them a little bit but cant fold them, he said from his bed in the critical care unit of AMRI.         
	I hope to be on my feet soon as I have a family that depends on me, he added.        
	Doctors said more tests were needed to see if Mali could indeed be on his feet again. MRI and other investigations will be done to find out the extent of the injury. After that, it will be known if he can walk again, a doctor said.         
	The MRI could not be done earlier because of splinters stuck inside Malis body. On the night of November 2, one of them was removed from his chest and a marble-sized pellet was pulled out of his abdomen.         
	The pellet had caused severe injuries to his abdomen and liver and there was uncontrolled bleeding, said a doctor.         
	Later, a CT scan revealed that the thoracic vertebra had been fractured and there was another splinter in the left shoulder. The splinter was removed by another surgery, said the doctor.         
	Mali recalled how he nearly drove into the jaws of death as the convoy made its way back from the inauguration of a steel plant.         
	The pilot car was brand new and had been bought only the day before. I was driving at a speed of 110 kilometres an hour. When we came near the bridge, there was a jerk and the vehicle spun, he said.         
	From my experience of driving in Maoist-affected areas for more than a year, I knew the car had been hit by a landmine.        
	His experience did count when Mali made sure the car, whose tyres had burst, did not skid off the road. I was covered in blood and could hear others moaning but my concern was not to let the vehicle fall into the ditch, which could have led to a fatal accident, he said.         
	By the time Mali brought the car to a halt, he was bleeding profusely.         
	I didnt lose consciousness till I reached here. Now there is pain but I am feeling better, said the constable.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had paid him a visit and applauded his bravery. CM saheb thanked me for saving the lives of others, Mali said.        
	The blast, however, has not deterred the driver from going back to work in the Maoist-hit West Midnapore. I am not afraid of these attacks. When I become fit, I will ask for posting in that area only, he said.

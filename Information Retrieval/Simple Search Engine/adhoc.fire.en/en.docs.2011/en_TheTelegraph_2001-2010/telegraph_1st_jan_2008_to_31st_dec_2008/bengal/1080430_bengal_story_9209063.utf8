          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 29: Subhas Chakraborty has failed to make it to the CPM central committee. His mentor Jyoti Basu did not raise the subject with the politburo, realising he did not have the support of either Prakash Karat or Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	We didnt discuss Subhass inclusion today. It was not on the agenda, Basu said after the meeting at the CPM state headquarters.         
	General secretary Karats stand was not difficult to decipher. You may have your opinion but better ask the leadership here. We have not discussed it, he said when asked if the party brass think Chakraborty should be inducted into the committee.         
	Basu had rekindled Chakrabortys hopes after he missed the bus at the Coimbatore party congress by publicly asking for his inclusion in the committee and the state secretariat. But he admitted his mistake after party leaders frowned at the breach of discipline.         
	The party did not censure the veteran publicly but made it clear that the issue could only be discussed in the politburo if Basu raised it. Basu chose not to do so today.         
	Sources said Karat endorsed the opposition of Bhattacharjee and industries minister Nirupam Sen to Chakraborty because of his penchant to create controversies.        
	Chakrabortys second aspiration  a secretariat slot  survives, though the odds are stacked against it. This will be discussed at the state level after the rural polls, said new politburo member Mohammad Amin. With Amins elevation and the death of Anil Biswas and Chittabrata Mazumder, three slots are vacant there.

	Calcutta, July 26: A group of youths today allegedly assaulted two security guards of Ramkrishna Mission Institute of Culture in Golpark with rods and baseball bats after the duo reprimanded one of them for rash driving.        
	Around 3am, Avinash Sawalka, a 28-year-old businessman, and his wife came to drop Daniel Majchrowicz, a PhD student from Harvard University, in their car. Daniel had been staying at the institutes guesthouse for the past six days.         
	Police claimed Avinashs Honda came speeding down the road, knocked down the No Parking signboard and drove up the pavement before coming to a halt near the gate.         
	Avinash, a resident of Robinson Street near Shakespeare Sarani, was about to drive away when he found the car had somehow got stuck. He rang friend Gajinder Singh Vij in Sunny Park for help.         
	But before Gajinder came, two of the institutes security guards  Jay Kumar Thakur and Takechand Mishra  arrived on the spot and began quizzing Avinash on why he had knocked down the signboard. Our guards asked him why he drove in such a manner. This led to an altercation, said Swami Tadvidhananda, who is in charge of the guesthouse.         
	While the altercation was on, Gajinder arrived in his car and joined in.         
	Around this time, a patrol van from Lake police station also came. The cops asked the guards to go inside and told the youths to leave the spot.         
	Gajinder left with Avinashs wife while Avinash stayed back to move his car.         
	Institute insiders claimed that 10-15 minutes later, Gajinder came back with a group of youths and along with Avinash attacked the two guards with baseball bats and rods. Jay Kumar and Avinash both suffered head injuries.        
	By the time the cops arrived, some of the youths had fled with Gajinder.         
	We have launched a probe to find out what led to the trouble. The youths had attacked the guards with baseball bats and rods. Based on Jay Kumars complaint, both Avinash and Gajinder have been arrested on the charge of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous means or weapons, said a officer of Lake police station.        
	Avinashs friend Arun Kumar claimed the guards had passed lewd remarks on Avinashs wife. When Avinash told Gajinder the guards had passed comments on his wife he lost his cool and attacked, Arun said.        
	Daniel has been asked to move out of the guesthouse.

	Midnapore/Tamluk, Aug. 12: A murder case will be filed against two producers and a contestant of a reality show arrested in Midnapore town last week, police said today.        
	Yesterday Prasun Adhikary, a hotel employee who fell off the roof during a scuffle with the TV team on August 8, died in SSKM Hospital.        
	We will start a murder case now and inform the court tomorrow, Rajesh Singh, the West Midnapore district superintendent of police, said.        
	Gautam Jain and Rajiv Mehra, the producers of Lux Fatafati Filmy Fight (F3), and contestant Somnath Roy Chowdhury will be produced in court tomorrow.        
	The reality show team, shooting in Midnapore, had put up at the Ritz Bengal hotel where Prasun worked. A scuffle broke out between hotel staff and the TV team at night, and Prasun is suspected to have been pushed off the roof.        
	The body was released after post-mortem this evening and younger brother Palash, a computer engineer, took it home to East Midnapore. Serious injury to his brain had caused death, the report said.         
	Prasuns father Paresh, a sub-assistant engineer at block office at Chandipur near Nandigram, said: He was to come home on Saturday for a friends wedding. But he fell to his death before we could see him alive again.         
	Relatives, neighbours and hotel staff today submitted a request to the police. We have requested the police to ensure justice, said Trilochan Adhikary, Prasuns cousin.        
	Superintendent Singh said some of the women who had told the police Prasun had harassed them later said they were asked to speak against him by the TV crew. We had released them but will interrogate them if necessary.         
	While hotel staff had claimed that the TV crew had been drinking and causing a ruckus on the roof and flared up when they objected, some women had alleged that the row broke out when they protested against harassment.         
	Mehra, who was brought to NRS Medical College and Hospital last night when he complained of chest pain, was discharged today.         
	He was taken back to Midnapore Kotwali police station this morning.

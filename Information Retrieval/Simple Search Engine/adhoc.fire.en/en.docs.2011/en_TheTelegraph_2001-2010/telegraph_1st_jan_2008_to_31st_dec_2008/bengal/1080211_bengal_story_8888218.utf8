	Calcutta, Feb. 10: Bengal is set to get the first tidal power plant in the country.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee made the announcement at the opening session of a workshop on Energy: Crisis and Remedies conducted by IIT Kharagpur and the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency here today.        
	Ive just been informed that a tidal power pilot project has been sanctioned on the Durgaduani river in the Sunderbans, the chief minister said.        
	The Centre will bear 90 per cent of the cost for the Rs 50-crore project. The 4MW plant, to be ready for generation by 2010, is expected to provide power to about a lakh people.        
	The renewable energy development agency and the National Hydroelectricity Power Corporation will together implement the project.        
	It has been in the pipeline for a long time and will be followed by one in Kutch, Gujarat, said V. Subramanian, secretary of the Union new and renewable energy ministry.        
	He praised Bengal and Gujarat for the political initiatives on renewable energy.        
	The chief minister urged the participants from the energy industry, scientists and researchers to find alternatives to thermal power, which makes up 96 per cent of Indias energy sources. We should concentrate on wind power and try to increase the number of hydel power stations, he added.        
	The power project to give light to the Sunderbans will be introduced in Jhargram, West Midnapore, and Darjeeling.        
	Bhattacharjee admitted that steps needed to be taken to reduce pollution from surface transport. We are planning elevated trains to reduce pollution. We have identified the technology and are in the process of mobilising funds.        
	IIT Kharagpur, which offers a BTech course in energy engineering, is planning to start a centre for energy research.         
	The renewable energy agency and the institute have set up a pilot plant on bio-diesel produced from jatropha seeds. The oil was used to light the lamp to start todays workshop.

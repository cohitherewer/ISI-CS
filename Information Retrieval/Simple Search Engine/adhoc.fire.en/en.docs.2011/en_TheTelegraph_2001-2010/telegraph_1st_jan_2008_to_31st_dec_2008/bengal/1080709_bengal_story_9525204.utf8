The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rights slur on scientist detention
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Rights slur on scientist detention
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Svacha and Kucera                                  
	Calcutta, July 8: The manner in which entomologist Petr Svacha and his associate Emil Kucera are being detained in a Darjeeling prison is a violation of fundamental rights, the state bar council chief said.        
	Forest officials caught the two allegedly while they were collecting beetles, butterflies and larvae in the Singalila National Park in Darjeeling district on June 22.         
	Svacha and Kucera were sent to jail custody and have stayed there since as lawyers are on a strike in the hills. Their bail petition could not be filed.        
	They are being denied the right to justice. The state government will have to be accountable for the collapse of the judicial system in the hills, council chief A.K. Sarkar said.         
	The high court, he added, had not responded to the councils request a fortnight ago to transfer Darjeeling cases to Siliguri. This is a constitutional crisis and yet the government and the high court are silent, Sarkar said.        
	The Czech duo have been charged with entering the park and removing wildlife without permission from the states chief wildlife warden.         
	Forest officials said the 200-odd beetles, larvae and butterflies found on them had been sent to the Zoological Survey of India to verify if they were on the endangered list.         
	A signboard at the entrance to the Singalila National Park declares it a protected place.         
	Foresters said Svacha, 51, and Kucera, 52, had been staying at Srikhola on the fringes of the park and were picked up after residents reported their activities over two days.         
	The Darjeeling chief judicial magistrate came to the prison today to meet the duo. Svachas lawyer Seshmani Gurung said they petitioned the magistrate to arrange for a proper hearing. He might hear them tomorrow, Gurung added.        
	Indian entomologists conceded that Svacha, a world-renowned authority on invertebrates, had broken the law, but said the treatment being meted out to him was harsh.         
	The Indian law on biodiversity is not at all friendly to research, especially for us. We need to collect specimens from all over the world. It would have been ideal if Svacha was fined and released, said Priyadarsanan Dharma Raj, a taxonomist with the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, Bangalore.        
	K.D. Prathapan, who is attached to the Kerala Agricultural University in Thrissur, said foresters in India were unable to distinguish between poachers and scientists.

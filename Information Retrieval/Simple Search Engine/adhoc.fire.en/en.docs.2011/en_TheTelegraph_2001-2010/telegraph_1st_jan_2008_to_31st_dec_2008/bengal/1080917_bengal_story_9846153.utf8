	Singur, Sept. 16: A trickle of consent letters from unwilling farmers has started in Singur.        
	Five of them wrote to district magistrate Neelam Meena today, saying they were ready to give up their land for the Tata Motors project and collect their cheques.         
	We made up our mind after considering the governments revised package, Sambhu Ghosh of Madhapara in Beraberi told The Telegraph.        
	The Ghoshes had been part of the Singur agitation since their half an acre was acquired for the Nano plant two years ago. The family used to grow three crops on the plot.         
	We didnt have any land except the 1.5 bighas and felt outraged when it was acqui- red. So, we joined the anti-acquisition movement. Our intention was only to get a better deal. Now we feel it is unwise to drag on with the agitation, Sambhu said.        
	Sambhu, his mother and three brothers jointly owned the plot. One of his sisters-in-law and his mother sent their consent today. My other brother is not here but he will also do so, said Sambhu.        
	His 70-year-old mother Monibala said: We were weighing the pros and cons after reading about the new package in the papers. We had wanted a rise in compensation and are very happy now.        
	Sambhu works in a sweet shop in Liluah. His son Gopal studies in Class VIII at Beraberi High School.        
	I want to join the Tata factory after doing an ITI course. The factory will create jobs for those like me and we want the Tatas to resume work as soon as possible, the boy said.        
	Sambhu plans to build a house with his share. My dream will be realised soon. Hopefully, my son will get employment in the factory. Then we will marry him off, he said.         
	The new package promises 50 per cent more cash and preference in jobs.        
	Haradhan Chowdhury and Bidyut Das of Khasherbheri have also decided to collect their cheques.        
	I like the new package, said Haradhan. I had joined the agitation as I wasnt happy with the earlier amount.        
	District magistrate Meena confirmed having received the letters.         
	An official at the block office said the administration was hopeful that more landlosers would collect their cheques in the next few days. They will get an additional 10 per cent for doing so by September 22.        
	Mamata show        
	Mamata Banerjee today presented three willing landlosers  Radheshyam Maity, 65, Shibram Panja, 60, and Aditya Panja, 55  who had apparently accepted their compensation cheques.         
	Now they want their land back by returning the cheques. I present them before you to counter the CPMs move of bringing in an unwilling farmer to its rally yesterday, she told her Singur rally.

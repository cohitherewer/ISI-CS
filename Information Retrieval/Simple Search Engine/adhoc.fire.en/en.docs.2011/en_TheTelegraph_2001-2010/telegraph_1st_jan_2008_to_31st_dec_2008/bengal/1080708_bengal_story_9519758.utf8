          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 7: Priya Ranjan Das Munshi underwent an angioplasty this morning after tests revealed blocks in two arteries.         
	Doctors at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital said his condition was stable and that he had been shifted out of the coronary care unit in the evening.         
	The information and broadcasting minister had chest pain yesterday while attending a party meeting in Malda after lunch.         
	He was flown to Calcutta last night from the air force base in Purnea, Bihar.         
	Two stents were implanted during the angioplasty, a family member said. Doctors said the heart attack was in its initial stages when he was brought to the hospital. So there was minimum damage to the heart muscles and the recovery was fast.        
	In the morning, Das Munshi had a liquid diet, but he had rice and fish for lunch.        
	Although he was shifted out of the cardiac care unit, a mini intensive care unit was set up in his room to monitor his condition, an Apollo official said.         
	Doctors said it was too early to say when he could be discharged.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee went to see Das Munshi, also the state Congress chief, and spoke to his wife Deepa. In the morning, governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi was among the visitors.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee: Thanks, Mamata                                  
	Calcutta, July 21: Bitter foes for 15 years, Mamata Banerjee and breakaway Congress leader Somen Mitra today shared a platform and announced the formation of a grand alliance to throw the CPM out of Writers Buildings.         
	It wouldnt be difficult to capture Writers if we, all anti-CPM forces, stand united. A mahajot (grand alliance) is the need of the hour, Mamata told the rally at Esplanade with Mitra and his aide Jayanta Bhattacharya by her side.        
	Thirteen Youth Congress supporters were killed in police firing on this day in 1993.         
	Minutes later, then Bengal Congress president Mitra had shared dais with Mamata, the Youth Congress chief then, to condemn the killings.         
	Since then, the relations between the two went downhill and Mamata was finally expelled from the party in 1997.         
	Today, Mamata said those who were serious about fighting the CPM were welcome to be her partners. Going by the results of the panchayat and municipal elections, in which the CPM was routed, it is clear that a wind of change is blowing across Bengal. We should all get united to end the CPMs 31-year misrule and pay respect to the peoples anti-communist sentiments.         
	The message to state Congress leaders was clear: follow in Mitras footsteps before the Lok Sabha elections.         
	Mitra, who was instrumental in Mamatas expulsion from the Congress, floated the Pragatishil Indira Congress on Saturday.         
	I have walked out of the Congress realising that only a secular front under Mamatas leadership could throw the CPM out of power. And I have vowed to rally behind her till the 2011 Assembly elections, when she would be sent to the red (Writers) building, he said today to an applause from a huge gathering.        
	The former state Congress chief decided to share the dais with Mamata to answer the call of my conscience. I have followed my conscience and joined Mamata because the people are with her, he said.         
	Mamata unveiled a string of programmes beginning with a July 27 rally in Birbhums Nanoor, where 11 people Trinamul supporters were allegedly killed on that day eight years ago. She also iterated her resolve to organise a sit-in out- side the Tata Motors plant in Singur from August 20.        
	Mishap: Four Trinamul sup-porters were injured when a van carrying 20 of them hit another while returning from the rally. The Matador was on its way to Baruipur. The condition of three is serious.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, July 9: A college girl in Malda plucked up the courage to complain to police after three youths raped her, recorded the incident on their mobile phones and told her they wo- uld circulate the video if she told anyone about it.         
	Following the complaint, two of the youths were arrested yesterday. Both are residents of Old Malda. The third is still missing.        
	The girl, a second-year student, is from Gajole.        
	Malda superintendent of police Satyajit Bandyopadhyay said such crimes often went unreported because of the fear of being blackmailed. The women feel ashamed and scared to come to us.        
	In this case, the girl had initially kept silent about the gangrape, which occurred last month.         
	She went to the police when one of the youths tried to blackmail her with the video.        
	The girl had been in a relationship with one of the three, Partha Sil, who works with a tractor company.         
	Last month, he took her to a tractor showroom. Two of his colleagues, Joydeb Mondal and Ranjit Mondal, were waiting there, an investigating officer said.        
	The girl was allegedly raped in the showroom.         
	Later, it was Partha who allegedly threatened to transfer the video to CDs and sell them as smut.         
	Partha and Joydeb have been arrested. Both have apparently confessed to committing similar crimes in the past.         
	They usually targeted college girls, lured them into having sex and then blackmailed them, the investigating officer said.         
	The officer did not specify what they blackmailed their victims into doing.        
	We have seized the phones of the arrested youths and sent them to experts, said Maksudul Haque, the officer in charge of Gajole police station, 35km from Malda town.        
	When friends, the girl had gone to the Dooars and Sikkim with Partha. She had put her trust in him, the officer said.        
	When contacted, the girl said Partha had been gentle and caring initially. He was so gentle and caring that I even introduced him to my parents and he used to frequently visit our home. I was almost certain that we would get married some day, she said.         
	After the rape, she said, Partha had turned into an animal. He kept me under threat and warned me of dire consequences if I told anyone about the incident.        
	Once Partha threatened to distribute the CDs, the girl made up her mind to go to the police. I couldnt bear to think what my parents would go through, said the daughter of a government employee.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Starving villagers plunder food trucks
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, June 22: Hungry and homeless for days, thousands of flood-hit people who have taken shelter on roads today looted food and tarpaulin from trucks carrying relief in East Midnapore.        
	Four trucks carrying rice, flattened rice (chira) and molasses to Bhagabanpur I block were stopped by nearly 4,000 villagers at Bajkul, 150km from Calcutta, around noon.        
	The mob blocked the road and took away 40,000kg of rice, 15,000kg of chira and 500kg of molasses. The drivers and the district officials were helpless as they were outnumbered, said Mahadeb Lohar, the deputy magistrate of the Egra subdivision.        
	Around 1pm, 2,000 residents of Patashpur II block gathered in front of the block office demanding relief. Suddenly they saw a truck unloading chira nearby and pounced on it.        
	They walked away with about 2,000kg, said Lohar.        
	Three hours later, a truck laden with tarpaulin sheets was emptied out at the Kajlagarh block office. All the 4,000 sheets were looted.        
	Asked about the looting in the Egra subdivision, district magistrate Anup Agarwal avoided a direct reply. The administration, he said, had faced problems in sending relief to Bibhishanpur, Simulia and Kankra gram panchayats. We have decided to drop relief materials on these places from air force helicopters, he added.        
	Allegations of inadequate relief poured in from East and West Midnapore.        
	Nantu Pradhan, a middle-aged farm labourer who had gone to search for food for his children and wife to the Kajlagarh block office, was chased away by policemen.        
	I waded through floodwaters for three hours to reach the office. I could not give any food to my children for two days, said Nantu. They will have to spend another night hungry.        
	The district magistrate, who held an all-party meeting today, sought the leaders help in reaching relief to the villages. We will also hold all-party meetings at the block and panchayat levels. We have rescued 2.5 lakh people, he said.        
	Dilip Roy, 35, of Beudia village in Bhagabanpur, who took shelter in the concrete house of his schoolteacher neighbour on Thursday, said he had not seen anyone with relief in three days.         
	Hundreds in the block echoed him. My family is starving. Im scared about my ailing parents, said Prabir Pal, who has taken shelter in the Bibhishanpur High School with about 1,000 others.         
	In Calcutta, the government said it was not shortage of relief but lack of co-ordination in distribution that deprived many. After an hours meeting, irrigation minister Subhas Naskar said: The system of distribution was not proper.

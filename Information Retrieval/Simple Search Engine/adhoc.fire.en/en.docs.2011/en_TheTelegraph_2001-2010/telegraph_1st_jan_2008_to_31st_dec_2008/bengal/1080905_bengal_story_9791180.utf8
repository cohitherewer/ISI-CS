The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM divided on land return
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CPM divided on land return
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 4: The CPM state secretariat has ruled out return of plots meant for the ancillary units to farmers but the party appeared divided on offering a land-for-land package.         
	The secretariat met this evening to approve the governments position before talks in Raj Bhavan tomorrow.         
	Emerging from the meeting, member Benoy Konar said: If the Trinamul leaders are insistent on alternative plots, let them negotiate with land owners (in the vicinity) and make sure they sell it at the price the government had offered during the acquisition. The unwilling landlosers can take their compensation lying with the government to buy the land.        
	Konars suggestion is little more than academic because no one in and around Singur is expected to sell at the rate set by the government following a spurt in land prices after the Tatas entry.         
	The CPM leaders stand echoed that of industries minister Nirupam Sen, also opposed to the land-for-land offer.        
	Sen had said the government could offer the unwilling landlosers in Singur 47 acres for commercial activity outside the project area. The land is held by the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC).        
	But some CPM leaders, including a few secretariat members, did not seem averse to the idea of alternative plots outside the project area or relocation of some ancillary units. There is no legal bar if the WBIDC wants to buy private land to settle the unwilling landlosers, a senior CPM minister said.         
	According to him, the West Bengal Land Acquisition Manual, 1991, has the provision for the return of acquired land if it was declared surplus. Section 147/2 of the manual also says: There is no objection to the land being restored at any stage... after possession has been taken, when desired by the authority on whose behalf the acquisition had been made. Section 166 adds that acquired land, when returned, should go to the original owner or the heirs.         
	Trinamul sources admitted that there was a mismatch between Mamata Banerjees demand of 400 acres and the actual area that was held by the unwilling landlosers. Their affidavits in court put the figure at 334 acres. But the government said the farmers collectively had only 254 acres.         
	The Trinamul sources said if the government returned the land that was yet to be used by the vendors  they put the area at over 200 acres  Mamata would be ready to scale down her demand with an assurance that she would not ask for land within the plant area.        
	Also, she would not demand the entire land allotted to the ancillary units, a position she has stuck to so far. We would press for the return of the unused land. Together with the 47 acres vested land, we will be ready for a settlement, a member of the Opposition negotiating team said.

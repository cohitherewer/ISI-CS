The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | At party door for culling
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   At party door for culling
          OUR BUREAU                          A nurse in a Malda hospital where two culling personnel were admitted with fever. Both have tested negative for bird flu. (Surajit Roy)                                  
	Dec. 21: The Malda administration has sought help from political parties in the bird flu-hit areas to deal with farmers refusing to hand over chickens to culling teams on a mop-up drive.        
	People whose birds are being killed in the mop-up operation are not entitled to any compensation.        
	However, some residents of Narhatta, 12km from Malda town, alleged that culling teams had turned them away on Friday saying they had run out of compensation. When the teams returned yesterday, the villagers were told that the mop-up drive had started and none of them would get any money.        
	Samima Bibi of Babupur said: Aro- und 8pm on Friday, one of the team members told us chickens could not be taken for culling anymore as they had run out of money. The same man announced yesterday no compensation would be paid.        
	CPM gram panchayat member Ashok Mondol said that once the villagers came to know they would not be compensated, they released their poultry from the coops. Now it will be difficult to locate the birds.        
	He held the animal resource devel- opment department responsible for the situation. They (the administration) rush to us (politicians) only when trouble is staring in the face.        
	District magistrate Sridhar Ghosh denied running short of money. The block development officers were always prompt in reaching the compensation, he said.         
	However, he has told the Englishbazar subdivisional officer to co-ordinate with the parties and ensure there is no further resistance.        
	We are having a problem catching the birds as most villagers have released the chickens from their coops, Ghosh added.        
	Animal resources minister Anisur Rahman said in Calcutta that no other area in the state besides Narhatta had been affected by bird flu. The samples collected from Gajole and Ratua in Malda and Onda in Bankura have tested negative.         
	The North Dinajpur administration has clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 in Itahar block to prevent smuggling and sale of chickens from neighbouring Malda.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Santiniketan, Jan. 8: Visva-Bharati authorities today indicated they were considering action against some employees in connection with Sundays shooting.        
	We have started discussions in this regard, vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray told reporters when asked whether the authorities would punish any employee on the charge of dereliction of duty.         
	Ray, who was in Bangalore for a seminar on the day Amaresh Kundu shot Saswati Pal and then himself, returned last night. He held a marathon meeting with department heads, principals and senior officials of the university this afternoon.        
	The vice-chancellor said a committee would be set up to probe the security lapse. He, however, added that it was impossible to provide foolproof security on the campus.        
	We could not protect Benazir Bhutto, Rajiv Gandhi or Indira Gandhi. The US could not protect the twin towers, Ray said.         
	He said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the chancellor of the university, had been informed about the incident.         
	Hours before todays meeting, students met the vice-chancellor and discussed a five-point charter of demands relating to lack of security on the campus and at the girls hostels that they had sent to governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi. A copy was given to Ray.         
	The governor, during his visit to Santiniketan yesterday, had asked the students to send their grievances to him in writing.         
	We have demanded security guards at each and every hostel, screening of outsiders entering the campus, boundary walls and adequate streetlights, said Bhramar Bhandari, a student leader.

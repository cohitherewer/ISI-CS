The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Plea for Nano substitute
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Plea for Nano substitute
  - Willing farmers to meet governor with factory request        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Singur, Oct. 8: Singur residents who had given up their land for the Nano plant or were earning their living from it will meet governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Friday with the request to ask the Tatas to set up a factory at the abandoned site.        
	The willing landlosers and representatives of the 22 syndicates that supplied construction materials to the project hurriedly called a meeting in a rented house near Singur station last evening after hearing that the Tatas had already decided on an alternative home for the Nano.        
	We felt helpless yesterday. So we convened the meeting in a hurry and decided to go to the governor and the chief minister. We will request them to ask the Tatas to reconsider their decision on Singur. If that is not possible, they should ask Ratan Tata to set up some other industry here, said Sheikh Babul, 32, of Joymollah, whose family had given up over half an acre for the project.         
	Debaprasad Das, 45, of Sahanapara, a syndicate member, said efforts were on to mobilise people to back their demand. We have arranged buses for over 2,000 people. We want to prove to the governor and the chief minister that we are sincere, said Debaprasad, who gave up over two acres for the project.        
	Many like Bikash Pakhira, 27, of Joymollah, who was a trainee at the Nano project in Singur, are waiting eagerly for a communication from the Tatas asking them to join Sanand, Gujarat, where the project is being relocated. Bikash had completed an ITI course and was trained at Tata Motors Pune plant.         
	We have heard we will be absorbed but we have not heard from them so far. However, I have decided to join Fridays programme, said Bikash. Laltu Dey, 25, echoed Bikash.         
	The governor had made a vain attempt to end the Singur impasse that killed off the Nano project in Bengal.        
	The CPM will go door-to-door in Singur to tell people how Mamata Banerjees agitation benefited the BJP (in power in Gujarat). Mamatas strong ties with the BJP are now clear, said Hooghly secretariat member Balai Sabui.        
	The Hooghly CPM leadership will also request the Tatas to build a factory in Singur. We will approach the people of Singur and ask them whether they would allow the Ta- tas to set up another factory at the Nano project site. If they agree, we will approach the Tatas, said Anil Basu, the MP from nearby Arambagh.        
	The government had given the land on a 99-year lease and the Tatas have not made it clear if they want to return or retain it.        
	The Save Farmland Committee said it would intensify its agitation in Singur after Puja, demanding that the land acquired from unwilling farmers be returned.         
	The law, however, prevents the government from returning acquired land.

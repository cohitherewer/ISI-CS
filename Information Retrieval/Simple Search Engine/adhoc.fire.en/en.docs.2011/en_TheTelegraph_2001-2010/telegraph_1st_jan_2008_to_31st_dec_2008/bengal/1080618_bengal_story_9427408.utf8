	Midnapore, June 17: Three men trapped in a Toyota Innova were swept away tonight.        
	The car, bound for Calcutta from Orissa with seven persons, had got stuck on a bridge across the Keleghai near Belda, 180km from Calcutta. Four were rescued before the bridges railing collapsed and the car slid into the swirling waters, West Midnapore police chief R. Rajsekharan said.        
	The missing trio have been identified as Gautam Bose, a former aide of Mamata Banerjee, Rajendra Lakhotia and Ramesh Kanojia. The Innova is yet to be traced.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Lalgarh cops locked out
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Security personnel outside the Ramgarh outpost. (Swarup Mondal)                                  
	Midnapore, Dec. 14: About 100 CRPF jawans, accompanied by 10 policemen and five trucks carrying their belongings, were stranded outside the Ramgarh police outpost for hours since noon because the tribal leader who had the keys was nowhere to be found.        
	After the outpost was withdrawn on November 27, officers had given the keys to Sidhu Soren, leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.        
	Inspector-in-charge Hirak Biswas was seen frantically calling another committee leader, Chhatradhar Mahato.         
	What is this? We told you we were coming and the keys are not there. My men have been waiting with their baggage for four hours. They are cooking outside the outpost. Why are you harassing us like this? Biswas was heard shouting into his cellphone.        
	Another half-an-hour later, there was still no sign of the keys, so Biswas ordered the lock be broken. A policeman got to work with a hammer.         
	Chhatradhar later said the police had not informed the committee about their arrival. Sidhu left the village on some work, he said.        
	Another committee member, however, contradicted Chhatradhar. He said Sidhu was sent away to an undisclosed location as soon as the tribal leaders learnt the police were coming.        
	He said the police and officials, flocking to Lalgarh over the past few days, should have told the committee in advance about their plan, rather than send a message this morning. The police movement was kept a secret because they dont trust us.        
	Asked why the outposts keys had been handed to Sidhu, an officer said: It was part of our strategy to protect it. Had we come away without involving the villagers, Maoists could have blown it up.        
	The outpost at Pirakata and a camp at Koima  both in Salboni  were also unlocked today. The people wanted the camps and outposts to start working again, district superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar Singh said.

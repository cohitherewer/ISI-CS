             Priya Ranjan Das Munshi: Happy?
                 
	New Delhi, Dec. 31: The decks have been cleared for the appointment of Priya Ranjan Das Munshi as Bengal Congress president. 
    
	The decision awaits Sonia Gandhis formal nod after the spadework by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee and Mohsina Kidwai, the party general secretary in charge of Bengal. 
    
	Congress sources said Das Munshi, the minister for parliamentary affairs as well as for information and broadcasting, must give up one of the portfolios to be able to devote more time to the state, where the Congress has a long way to go before it gets its act together. 
    
	Chances are that Das Munshi will have to relinquish the parliamentary affairs ministry before the budget session, which begins in the last week of February. 
    
	A Congress leader explained why. The Left bloc is crucial for the government in Parliament, especially in the budget session. The parliamentary affairs minister has to muster his diplomatic skills to keep the Left parties in good humour and ensure the House functions smoothly and the budget is passed without major hitches.
    
	Das Munshi would have to wear a different hat as the state party president and blast the Left regularly. Whether a dual role  one in Bengal and the other in Delhi  would be tenable is a concern. 
    
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, however, is not keen to replace Das Munshi before the budget session because a successor would need time to grow into the job. 
    
	If workload is the factor, sources said, vacating the I amp;B ministry would make more sense. Parliamentary affairs is a seasonal job with the ministry active thrice a year when the House is in session, barring exigencies. 
    
	The information and broadcasting ministry is more demanding by comparison.
    
	Das Munshi emerged as the choice for the Bengal job for various reasons: he worked his way up from the grassroots, had electoral appeal, was organisationally resourceful and was perceived as anti-Left.
    
	The last was a must if the Congress had to better its position in Bengal. 
    
	Sources said Das Munshi had a good equation with Mamata Banerjee. But like most in the Bengal Congress, he believed that unless she officially snapped her links with the BJP-led NDA, the Congress should have nothing to do with Mamata. 
    
	Sources close to him said the party should work on other prospective allies such as the front launched by Jamait Ulema-i-Hind leader Siddiqullah Chowdhury, and Saifuddin Chowdhurys Party for Democratic Socialism. Neither is part of the secular front Mamata launched yesterday. 
    
	Chowdhury had been in the forefront of the agitation against land acquisition for industry. 
    
	The Bengal Congress was headless after Mukherjee quit following the defeat in the last Assembly elections. Pradip Bhattacharya was appointed working president, a nomenclature that, sources said, did not allow him to work.

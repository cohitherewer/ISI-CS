          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 15: Santiniketan visitors familiar with Camellia hotel will now stay at Welcom Heritage Camellia.        
	Camellia Hotel and Resort has entered into a management and marketing tie-up with the ITC Welcomgroup, under which the latter will look after the marketing and branding of the property.         
	The tie-up was sealed a little before Pujas by Camellias promoter Nilratan Dutta and Rakesh Mathur, president of Welcom Heritage that plans to market the property globally.        
	The 52-room hotel recently built 10 cottages on its Prantik premises just outside Santiniketan        
	Samrat Chowdhury, the regional marketing head of Welcom Heritage, said: Santiniketan is an attractive destination for tourists from across the globe. But it lacks organised marketing. We have already started soft-selling the property before aggressively marketing it from the next financial year after some fine-tuning to suit the brand image, Chowdhury said.        
	The average room tariff a day is likely to over Rs 3,000 from Rs 1,800 now, Dutta said.        
	He said about Rs 5 crore would be invested to upgrade the facilities in the hotel to suit the ITCs specifications. The hotel enjoys about 75 per cent occupancy.

	Calcutta, Sept. 24: Industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen today said the compensation offered in Singur would be the model followed in future projects.     
	As we have offered 50 per cent additional compensation in Singur, the model will have to be replicated in future projects. However, the amount will depend on factors like location and fertility of the land.         
	Calcutta: A man was run over while crossing the tracks at Bondel Gate on Wednesday evening, triggering violent protests by local residents and passengers stranded in neighbouring Ballygunge station. Trains on the Sealdah South section were stalled until midnight from around 8pm as a group demanding better roads blocked tracks. Ballygunge station was vandalised at 11.40pm by passengers protesting the blockade. Umashankar Singh, 60, was run over apparently while going to a urinal.         
	Durgapur: Not one villager turned up at the hearing for land acquisition in Katwa a day after unwilling farmers were beaten up. So far, 80 of the 83 farmers heard have refused to part with their land. Over 400 were to be heard by Thursday. Around 1,000 acres are required for the 1320MW power plant in Katwa.

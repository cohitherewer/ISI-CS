	Bhubaneswar/Calcutta, Jan. 10: A final-year student of business administration from Salt Lake today drowned in a canal in Orissas Simlipal forest. 
    
	Sambuddha Sen, 21, a resident of EC 238, had gone to Simlipal on a holiday with four friends on Monday. 
    
	A student at the Institute of Engineering and Management in Salt Lakes Sector V, Sambuddha slipped and fell into a canal surrounding the Devikund spring inside the forest, around 300km from Calcutta in Orissas Mayurbhanj district. 
    
	Father Siddhartha Sen said he had spoken to Sambuddha this morning and was told that he would return tonight.
    
	Police officer Anand Majhi said from Simlipal that the boys, who were strolling in the forest since morning, had decided to take a bath in the spring. The spring has several canals flowing out. The boys were taking a walk along the banks of one of the canals around noon when Sambuddha slipped and fell into the water. 
    
	The water was ice cold and a part of the young mans body had got stuck under one of the rocks in the water. His friends tried to pull him out, but could not.
    
	Majhi said the fire brigade had to be called in for help, and the body was fished out around 3.30pm.
    
	Sambuddhas body has been sent to the district hospital for post-mortem. 
    
	We have informed the boys family, and his relatives will arrive soon, the inspector said.

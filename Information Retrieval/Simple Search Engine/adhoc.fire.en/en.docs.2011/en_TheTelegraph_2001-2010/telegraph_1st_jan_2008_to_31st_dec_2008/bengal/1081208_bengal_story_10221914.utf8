          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Asho in Siliguri. Telegraph picture                                  
	Siliguri, Dec. 7: A nine-year-old boy from Uttar Pradesh, who had stepped out of home telling his mother he was going to an aunt and landed in Sealdah and then in Siliguri, is finally going home.        
	Asho Yadav had Rs 50 in his pocket when he walked out of his house at Alapur in Uttar Pradesh to meet aunt Lajo, his mausi who lives in Calcutta.         
	Thinking Asho was joking, his mother had wished him a happy journey.         
	I was missing my mother, Asho said with half a grin today as he stood beside his father Jaglal Yadav.        
	For a boy who had never travelled beyond his hometown, the first journey was quite an adventure, involving four trains and covering over 2,000km.        
	When Asho arrived at Sealdah on November 7, the crowd unnerved him and he realised he should have at least brought his aunts phone number.         
	Railway police saw him wandering and put him on a train to Lucknow, about 15km from Alapur. When Asho felt hungry, he got down somewhere and ate. But the train had left by the time he finished.         
	With the help of local people, he took a train back to Sealdah, where the police saw him again. The next train Asho took was a Darjeeling Mail.        
	When his son did not return home on November 6, Yadav went to his school. They told me he had not turned up that day. I then went to the police. Someone told us he had seen my son boarding a train to Lucknow.         
	A representative of an NGO that looks after platform children picked up Asho from New Jalpaiguri station when he was about to board a train to Guwahati on November 13.         
	We had almost given up hope of getting him back when the police informed me three days ago that my son was in Siliguri. I could not believe my ears when Asho answered my call, said Yadav, who owns a small sweet shop.

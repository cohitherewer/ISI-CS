     A STAFF REPORTER
               
	Calcutta, Jan 31: The government today made it mandatory to register marriages that take place on or after from February 4. The order is binding on all communities.
    
	Violators would have to cough up a fine of Rs 25, as stipulated in the amended West Bengal Marriage Registration Act, law minister Robilal Moitra said at Writers Buildings.
    
	Although the rule does not apply to marriages before February 4, the minister urged all couples to get the registration done.
    
	The government had amended the act to make it more binding on couples. The notification for the amendment has been issued, the minister said.
    
	The marriage registration fee is Rs 420. But those belonging to the below-poverty-line category are offered a 50 per cent discount. 
    
	The All India Muslim Personal Law Board is divided on making registration compulsory. 
    
	A section led by secretary Maulana Syed Nizamuddin feels it is impractical. He said it amounted to interference in the Muslim personal law and a step towards Uniform Civil Code.
    
	Syed Shahabuddin, considered a board hardliner, did not see anything wrong with the directive. He reasoned that since the amended act recognises qazis (who solemnise marriages) as registrars, it would not come in the way of religious requirements. 
    
	The board will discuss the matter at a three-day session in Calcutta beginning February 29. 
    
	The act also aims to curb under-age marriages. 
    
	S.S.Z. Adnan, who heads the West Bengal Minority Commission, said the law should be an effective tool to keep a check on child marriages. But the government should have the machinery to enforce it, particularly in the rural belt, he added.
    
	The minister admitted the state did not have enough marriage registrars. We want to start the process with whatever we have.
    
	But there are plans to make more appointments. We will increase the number of non-official registrars, special marriage registrars and Muslim marriage registrars to meet the rush during the wedding seasons, Moitra said.

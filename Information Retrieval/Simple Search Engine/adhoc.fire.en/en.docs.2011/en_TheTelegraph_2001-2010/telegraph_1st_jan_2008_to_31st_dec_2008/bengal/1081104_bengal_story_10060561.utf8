          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 3: An 18-year-old student was found dead in a coaching centre in Garias Narkelbagan this evening, a day after her tutor was found hanging in his house.        
	Tanusree Pal, of Subhasgram on the southern fringes of the city, was a student of Basanti Devi College in Gariahat.        
	Police said the coaching centre had been locked since Saturday, after Kuntal Ghoshdastidar took his last class.         
	Manju Joardar, who had leased a room on the ground floor of her house to Kuntal, raised the alarm after a foul smell started emitting from the room. She informed neighbours and called police, who broke the door to find the girls body.        
	Kuntal was found hanging in his Sonarpur home yesterday. The police are awaiting his post-mortem report. The girls body has been sent for post-mortem.

	Tamluk, Dec. 4: Trinamul Congress and CPM activists clashed with bombs and improvised firearms in Nandigram today injuring 20 people.         
	This morning, Trinamul activists uprooted CPM flags and tore down festoons put up between Sonachura and Garchakraberia. In reply, about 100 CPM workers attacked the Trinamul activists with rods and sticks at Osmanchak. But later, about 100 Trinamul supporters beat up CPM local committee secretary Sheikh Based and his son.         
	Both sides hurled bombs and fired shots.         
	The exchange comes a day after Trinamul supporters blocked a CPM procession.         
	The East Midnapore administration has called an all-party meeting tomorrow.

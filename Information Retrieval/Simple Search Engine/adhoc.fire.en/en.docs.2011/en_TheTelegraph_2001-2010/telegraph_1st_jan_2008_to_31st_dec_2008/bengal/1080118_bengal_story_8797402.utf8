                                                                                                                                  Virus lurks in dust: WHO

              
	Washington, Jan. 17 (Reuters): The H5N1 bird flu virus may sometimes stick to surfaces or get kicked up in fertiliser dust to infect people, according to a World Health Organisation report published yesterday.
    
	The WHO team reviewed all known human cases of avian influenza, which has infected 350 people in 14 countries and killed 217 of them since 2003, and found that 25 per cent of the cases have no explanation.
    
	The virus is usually passed directly from bird to people, the report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, noted. And very rarely can one person infect another via intimate physical contact. 
    
	For some patients, the only identified risk factor was visiting a live-poultry market, the researchers, led by WHOs Frederick Hayden, wrote.
    
	It could be that small particles of virus-contaminated fluid stuck to surfaces, they said. Or, perhaps, fertiliser made from infected bird faeces somehow carried the virus into peoples noses or mouths.
    
	The report added that in several patients, diarrhoeal disease preceded respiratory symptoms, and the virus has been detected in the faeces.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 29: Mamata Banerjee today said Nirupam Sen was lying by saying that the Salim groups projects would not proceed without consensus on land acquisition.        
	I dont believe what the industries minister said in Delhi about the Salim groups projects. Its just a ploy to placate the electorate before the Lok Sabha polls, the Trinamul Congress chief said. He is lying to woo back the voters who have rejected the CPM in the rural polls.        
	PWD minister and RSP secretariat member Kshiti Goswami said Sens words reflected the CPMs belated realisation of its inappropriate land acquisition policy.        
	Water resources minister and CPI leader Nandagopal Bhattacharya said: We had warned the CPM against going ahead with the Salim groups projects by grabbing farmland. Now, rejected by the people, the party has realised that everybody has to be taken into confidence.

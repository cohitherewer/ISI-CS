	Sahagunj, Dec. 3: Mamata Banerjee today demanded immediate reopening of Dunlop and offered to negotiate with the management on behalf of the workers.        
	Addressing a rally near the factory, she said: They must withdraw the suspension of work through a tripartite agreement. Im not a union leader, but I can represent the workers in the talks. The management must clear all arrears.        
	The factory, reeling under a cash crunch, was shut down after the unions refused to sign a pay-cut agreement.

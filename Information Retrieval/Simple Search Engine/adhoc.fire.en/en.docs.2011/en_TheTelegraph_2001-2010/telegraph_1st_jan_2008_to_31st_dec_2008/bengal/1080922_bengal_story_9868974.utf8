  - Mamata gives 7 days to govt to give maximum land at Nano site, or else she will seek Presidents rule         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, Sept. 21: Mamata Banerjee tonight issued a seven-day ultimatum to the government to implement the pact it signed with the Trinamul Congress on September 7 in the presence of governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi to break the deadlock over Singur.         
	After a three-hour meeting with her allies at the party headquarters tonight, Mamata announced her intention to relaunch the siege to the Nano plant, but also gave a festival breather.        
	She did not clarify whether her self-imposed injunction would cover Diwali and Christmas when she said: I will restart my satyagraha but unlike the government, I dont want to disturb people at a time of festivity. The Ramazan month is on and the pujas are round the corner.         
	The Trinamul chief kept the door ajar for talks while rejecting the governments appeal for reconciliation. I am ready for talks if the government is serious about honouring the agreement.        
	Operationalise the agreement, she said, with stress on maximum land-based rehabilitation for unwilling farmers in and around the project site. If they (government) were serious about developing industry and agriculture, they would not have turned 180 degrees after signing an agreement with us for land-based rehabilitation in front of the constitutional head of the state. They are now going against that agreement. This amounts to disobeying the Constitution.        
	The agreement had promised land to the maximum in the project area.        
	However, instead of rebooting her suspended Singur blockade, Mamata announced various other activities over the next few weeks.        
	A party team will meet the governor on Tuesday and the Prime Minister and the President over the next seven to 10 days, demanding instructions to the state to honour the September 7 agreement. If the state still doesnt abide by the pact, she will press for the promulgation of Articles 355 as a precursor to the dismissal of the government and Presidents rule.        
	They have no right to continue in office after violating the constitutional head of the state, Mamata said.         
	It is believed that Mamatas decision to spread her activities was prompted by strong suggestions from participants at todays meeting that Trinamul and its allies would find themselves exposed to popular anger if they persisted with their movement during the festival season.        
	During the festival period, we can launch meetings and processions at Singur and in the city, Save Farmland Committee convener Pradip Banerjee was quoted as saying.        
	As part of this programme, while Mamata will lead a rally from Moulali to Esplanade on September 25, Trinamul workers at Singur will gherao the block office.         
	On September 26, Mamata and her allies will organise a rally in front of the Nano plant, where she had sat on a dharna for 15 days from August 24.

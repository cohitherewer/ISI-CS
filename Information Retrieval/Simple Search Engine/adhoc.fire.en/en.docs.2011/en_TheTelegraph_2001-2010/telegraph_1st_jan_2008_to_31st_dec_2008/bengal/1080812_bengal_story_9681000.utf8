          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 11: The Congress has announced it is willing to join Mamata Banerjee at the indefinite dharna at Singur from August 24, days after its state chief Priya Ranjan Das Munshi called for a united fight against the CPM.        
	Party spokesperson Subrata Mukherjee said: If necessary, I will write to the Save Farmland Committee for inducting us into the movement. He mentioned that on Saturday, Das Munshi had called for a joint movement against the CPM.         
	Rid of the Left at the Centre, we can easily tie up with the Trinamul in Bengal, Mukherjee said.        
	Contacted in Delhi, Das Munshi said: Subrata is right. We are not opposed to the Tatas but to the state government for forcibly acquiring agricultural land from unwilling farmers in Singur.         
	The Trinamul Congress, which is backing the demand for return of 400 acres to unwilling farmers, has said it was ready to accept the Congress in its agitation.         
	We are ready to take the state Congress along with us during our indefinite agitation in Singur provided the party gives us a letter pledging support to the anti-land acquisition movement, committee convener Pradip Banerjee said today.         
	Banerjee, also a CPI(ML) leader, said: Some key Congress functionaries had shared a platform with Trinamul leaders at Esplanade after the Nandigram firing on March 14 last year. So, if they are again keen to join us, they are welcome.         
	The Naxalite leader said that the committee would meet either on Thursday or Friday in consultation with Mamata to discuss the dharna. If we get the Congresss letter by then, we can place it for consideration.        
	Mamata was not available for comment but one of her aides said: We have no problem if the Congress joins us after it severed ties with the Left at the Centre.         
	Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind chief Siddiqullah Chowdhury also extended support to the Singur agitation. It is imperative for all anti-Left forces to come together, he said.

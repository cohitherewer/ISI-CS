                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Govt back to takeover table
  - Land acquisition for shipyard near Nandi kicks off        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Tamluk, May 19: The rural polls over, the government has issued a notification for the acquisition of around 500 acres about 30km from Nandigram for a shipyard, its downstream industries and infrastructure development.        
	The notice, advertised in newspapers today, will be put up at the Kukrahati and Betkundu village panchayat offices later this week.        
	Shipbuilder Bharti had sought around 400 acres on the banks of the Hooghly. The company has promised to invest Rs 2,000 crore over the next 10 years in the shipyard to be built in collaboration with the Apeejay Group.        
	The advertisement issued by East Midnapore district magistrate Anup Agarwal says: The land may be required for shipbuilding, downstream industries, infrastructure development and rehabilitation (of landlosers).        
	Around 6,000 people live in the four mouzas of Geonkhali earmarked for acquisition.        
	Agarwal said that after the notification was hung at the panchayat offices, landowners would be given 30 days to file claims and objections.         
	After 30 days from the display of the notification at the panchayat offices, we will start the hearing.        
	During the hearing, the administration will take the opinion of all people whose land falls under the notified area.         
	A Trinamul Congress-led group burnt copies of the notification and vowed to resist the land takeover.        
	A Bhoomi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee has been formed in the area on the lines of the Nandigram outfit that triggered a bloody land war last year over a notification.        
	We held a meeting at Deulpota yesterday and decided that we wont hand over any agricultural land to the government. We are holding meetings and taking out processions. We will meet the addi- tional district magistrate in Haldia on Friday and lodge our protest. If land is acquired in Geonkhali, we will launch a Nandigram-type movement, said Satyen Maity, the convener of the Pratirodh Committee in Geonkhali.         
	The resistance group was set up in August 2007 after the villagers learnt about the governments plan to build a shipyard in the area.        
	During a campaign meeting on April 27, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had asked the audience at Mahishadal town, 10km from Deulpota, whether they wanted the shipyard in Geonkhali. The audience had shouted back that they did.        
	The Pratirodh Committee said those who had shouted their approval of the project were all CPM supporters.        
	That is not what the villagers want. The people of Geonkhali will not hand over any agricultural land for industry, said Partha Batabyal, a committee leader.        
	Contai (South) Trinamul MLA Sisir Adhikary warned of stiff resistance if the administration tried to acquire land forcibly. He, too, threatened another Nandigram.        
	Most villagers are dependent on agriculture. There are about 1,000 people who depend on pisciculture. We will not allow an industry to come up on such fertile land, said Bimalendu Chakraborty, 65, a retired college teacher and anti-acquisition activist.        
	A top commerce and industries ministry official had said earlier this month that the state would go for land acquisition after the polls because several investment proposals were stuck.

	Sullied lies the green
         
	Sir  After many years, the citizens of Calcutta had got a present from the corporation  the Citizens Park, now renamed Mohar Kunja after the Rabindrasangeet singer Kanika Bandopadhyay. I frequently visit this park for my morning walks, but had not been there for about a week. When I went back on January 15, I found that the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) had nearly completed the construction of a stage in the park. Chairs were piled up, possibly in preparation for some programme in its ongoing conference. Shouldnt someone do something to put an end to such misuse of the park?
     
	Yours faithfully,
    Partha Chaudhuri, Calcutta

         
	Extra cover
     
	Sir  Did the Indian team management have to be so magnanimous towards the Aussies? If the case against Harbhajan Singh is still on, why let off Brad Hogg so easily? In todays competitive world of sport, kindness and generosity hold little or no meaning. In fact, for all the goodness of their heart, India will be perceived as a team lacking the killer instinct and aggression needed to beat the Aussies in their backyard. What is the point of being gentlemen in a game that has no place for the species any more?
          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Some newspapers and news channels had pictures of a beaming Brad Hogg even as he was awaiting punishment for abusing Indians. Did he know that he would get away scot-free?
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The attitude shown by the Indian cricket team in Australia is commendable. Even after Brad Hogg admitted to calling Indian cricketers b******s, the visiting team was kind enough to drop the charges against him. The Aussies could learn a thing or two from us.
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  No one was surprised at Indian moral perch at Perth (Jan 15). Sharad Pawar is an astute politician who has eyes on the chair of the ICC president. He needs to keep his record clean and shining. Therefore he must ensure that the Australian tour is not cancelled midway. Besides, there is his brainchild, the money-spinning IPL, for which  and for the ICC post as well  it is important to enlist the support of Cricket Australia. Any wonder then that the Indians meekly withdrew their charges against Brad Hogg? 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Temple tantrums
     
	Sir  After a gap of some years, I paid a visit to Dakshineshwar temple on the morning of January 6. To my dismay, I found that some youngsters were restricting traffic at the approach road to the temple. They forced us to divert our vehicle. We had to park around the railways residential complexes, quite a distance from the temple. However, on entering the temple precincts, we found that there was ample space in the parking lot for more vehicles. 
     
	When we were leaving, another group of youngsters handed over a chit of paper and demanded Rs 20 as donation. The slip mentioned that they were from Jolly Club in the railway colony. Apparently, the donation was the fee for parking at the railway colony complex. Needless to say, we would not have had to pay the fee if we had been allowed to park in the regular parking lot within the temple grounds. This local youth club is forcing temple visitors to park their cars on railway land  a land neither maintained nor owned by the club  and then collecting money in an unauthorized manner. The district administration, the railways and the municipal authorities will do well to intervene and stop this unlawful practice.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
S.S. Dasgupta, Calcutta

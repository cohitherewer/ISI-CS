	Signature style
    In a case involving a promissory note, the defendant requested the court that expert opinion be sought to compare her admitted signature with that on the promissory note. The court rejected the request and ruled against her. She challenged this order on the ground that the opinion of a handwriting expert had not been sought. The Andhra Pradesh High Court held that expert opinion was not necessary in all cases. Under the provisions of the Evidence Act, the court can itself compare the signatures of parties to judge their genuineness; only when the court is unable to come to a conclusion shall it seek expert opinion on the issue (Parna Padmavati vs Perati Yakub Reddy).                          
	No compromise        
	In a divorce proceeding, the man challenged the family courts order for continuation of the trial, contending that the couple had reached a compromise before the mediation centre. The Madras High Court held that according to the Code of Civil Procedure, a compromise is valid only when both parties legally agree to it. In this case, the woman had not agreed to the terms of the compromise so the lower court was right in ordering continuation of the trial, the high court ruled (V.S. Subramaniam vs S. Punitha).                            
	Derailed        
	A passenger injured his leg  which later had to be amputated  while he was getting off a train after realising that he had boarded the wrong train. Section 12A of the Railways Act provides for compensation in case a railway passenger is injured in an untoward accident, unless the injury is self-inflicted, the passenger tries to commit suicide or is intoxicated. In this case, the railways refused to pay compensation, pointing out that it was negligence on the part of the passenger, and not the railways, which had caused the injury. The Kerala High Court held that mere negligence on the part of a bona fide passenger is no ground to deny him compensation. When the passengers act does not fall within the category of exceptions, he is entitled to compensation from the railways (Thomas vs Union of India).

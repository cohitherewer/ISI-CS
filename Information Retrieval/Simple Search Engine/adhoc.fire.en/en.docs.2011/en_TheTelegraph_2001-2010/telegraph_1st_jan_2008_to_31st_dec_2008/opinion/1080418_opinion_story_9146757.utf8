The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Those who bring the world to the breakfast table
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Those who bring the world to the breakfast table                                                                            
	Foreign Correspondent: Fifty Years of Reporting South Asia Edited by John Elliott, Bernard Imhasly and Simon Denyer, Penguin, Rs 695        
	I recall the Talmudic instruction of my editor before setting out on my first assignment as a foreign correspondent in Southeast Asia. I wouldnt be in a hurry to file, if I were you, he had said. As I flitted from one capital and continent to another, I treasured the editors mantra. Before heading for his hotel to write his first despatch (there was no Internet in the early days), a foreign correspondent would have to take time to study a country and its people and try to gain access to policymakers.         
	For those lucky enough to be posted in New Delhi in the early Fifties and Sixties, the foreign correspondents job was enviable. There was much happening at the time. Along with the talkative political class of India, even the then prime minister and Independence hero, Jawaharlal Nehru, was accessible.         
	How useful an anthology of writings by the army of foreign correspondents who reported South Asia in the past half-century can be is arguable. It does, however, provide a handy, if idiosyncratic, scrapbook of glimpses from a turbulent past, captured more or less competently by individual reporters.        
	In the Introduction, the editors inform us that we do not always get it right, and are content with the saw that journalism is the first draft of history. So be it. A volume such as this inevitably involves a process of omission, but some of these are shocking. One of the most controversial pieces of writing to emerge out of foreign reporting in India was Neville Maxwells piece in the London Times, famously chronicling the death of Indian democracy. Maxwell, of Indias China War fame, is represented by another piece.        
	Two of the most distinguished correspondents ever to report on South Asia are entirely missing from this collection  Abe Rosenthal (picture left) of The New York Times and Knox of The Observer. Abe is still remembered (he died in 1984 after years of editing his paper) for his commitment to his task and empathy for Indians. As a foreign correspondent, Knox was in a class of his own with his elegant and insightful prose.        
	And Mark Tully (picture right), for decades the face of the BBC in South Asia, is not represented by one of his better pieces.        
	One cant really blame reporters in the West for writing about the more exotic and outlandish aspects of South Asia for a home audience. The yogis and godmen have their place alongside tiger shoots.         
	The volume contains some powerful writing. Take the clinical precision and ruthlessness of the report by Adrienne Farrell of Reuters in March 1951, about the virtual carnage of wildlife being promoted by the Indian government: For an all-in sum of $1,000, a visiting American can spend one month big-game shooting in India, with the prospect of bagging not only a tiger or two but also panther, bison, antelope and even bear.        
	The staccato Dacca Diary of Peter R. Kann in The Wall Street Journal, documenting Indian troops advancing towards the then East Pakistani capital is a model of reporting when a copy cannot be filed. Barbara Croisette of The New York Times was literally a stones throw from Rajiv Gandhi when he was murdered and wrote a taut piece for her newspaper. The detail with which Bernard Imhasly reported on the Babri Mosque demolition for Neue Zrcher Zeitung in December 1992 lent heightened poignancy to the event. Olaf Ihlau casts an acute eye for Der Spiegel on the Sai Baba phenomenon. Tiziano Terzani writes about Mother Teresa with empathy for Corriere della Sera.        
	Sometimes, journalism transcends into literature. James Cameron wrote on Nehrus death in the Daily Herald of May 28, 1964: Now that the words are needed it seems impossible to say more than that Nehru is gone, and we are immeasurably the poorer.... I shall never forget him in my life. If he was over-idolized, as he sometimes was, he was equally cruelly outraged at the end. All I know is that somewhere between the excesses and threats that hem us all around, there was, for many splendid years, something in politics that put a higher value on principle than on expediency, and that was, like Nehru, very rare.                    S. NIHAL SINGH

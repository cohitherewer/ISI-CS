	In these troubled times, one enters the world of childrens imagination with almost a sense of relief. That world is still a sylvan space where Durga sits smugly with infant Ganesh on her lap, village musicians play sarangi on house steps and deer peep shyly out of the foliage. In Xpressions08, an exhibition of artworks by the students of Nehru Childrens Museum (till tomorrow) at the Academy of Fine Arts, the nightmares of terror attacks, climate change or domestic violence could only be glimpsed fleetingly in a few paintings, such as the one by Anirban Paul (17) that showed a bouquet of flowers wrapped in a newspaper speaking of child-marriage, blockades, strikes or wife-killings. The cartoons brought out the childrens sense of awe and bafflement in a world increasingly dominated and controlled by computers. In the cartoon by Prakriti Basu (12), a little girl finds herself at a loss, trying to chose between traditional methods of drawing and painting on the computer with Photoshop. The terracotta figures had a deliberately unfinished quality that made them remarkable. The worst feature of the exhibition were the garish glass paintings. Coming in lurid colours, with glitters sprinkled liberally on them, the painted glass bowls, wine glasses or candle-stands were quite an eyesore.

	Prabahini celebrated its 25th anniversary at the Birla Academy on November 22, with songs by its students and solo performances by singers Rama Basu and Ashis Bhattacharjee, and elocutionist Ashis Ghosh. Basus singing was clean, though she was more at ease with the Atulprasadi songs, such as Balo go swajane and Aji e nishi. Among her Tagore songs, Himer raater oi gaganer deepguli re and Tomar amar ei biraher antoraale were the best. Ashis Bhattacharjees singing is marked by a rare sensitivity and sense of restraint. He presented nine songs from the puja parjay, but they came in a wide variety of taals. Jagate tumi raja, Dhane jane achhi jaraaye, Path cheye je kete gelo, Anando-dhara bohichhe bhubane, and the final Andha-jane deho aalo were some of the songs that illustrated the perfect harmony between music and lyrics, and rhythm and tempo.

While the function of the silver fitted Western needs, the surface work was of Indian origin, which differed in character from region to region. DELIGHT IN DESIGN: INDIAN SILVER FOR THE RAJ (Mapin, Rs 2,750) by Vidya Dehejia et al illustrates this through 219 colour photographs and scholarly essays. The candle stands and pepper pots on the left have the tightly scrolled floral work of Kutch; the sketch, centre, shows Swami silver from Madras; on the lower right is a plate from Burma with its predilection for scenes from the Buddhas life and the Jatakas. From Calcutta, the centre of British culture in India, comes the teapot on its stand, top right, more evocative of an English summer afternoon than a muggy Calcutta morning.

	Behind the scene                  
	Sir  Ryan Chakravarty and Amitabh Sharma deserve to be lauded for their valiant role in flushing out the Mumbai terrorists (Tale of two bravehearts from Calcutta, Dec 2). While it is interesting to read about the lives of these men, I am doubtful about the wisdom of this kind of reportage. Does it not compromise the personal safety of the commandos and their families? Many programmes on foreign channels, showing risky military operations, do not directly focus on the officers. There must be a good reason behind such a strategy.           
	Yours faithfully,        Siddhartha Sengupta, Calcutta
        
	Lesson not learnt          
	Sir  While a great hue and cry has been raised over the death of an eight-year-old school girl, after she was slapped by her yoga instructor, it is unlikely that the guilty teacher would be sent to jail (No mercy, Dec 2). The students would not testify against the teacher for fear of failing in tests  a threat that intimidates students and guardians most easily. The locals would not dare intrude into the matter, as these schools are sometimes backed by the political leaders and their mafiosi. And the inept officials of the state education board are least likely to take any action. But come September 5, and the nobleness of the teaching profession would be celebrated with fanfare. The problem with our teachers is their purely mercenary attitude to the job. Being highly unionized, they raise hell whenever their interests are hurt, but are least bothered about improving the quality of education or checking the rise of corporal punishment.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

                
	Sir  It seems that the police have, with good reason, registered a case of death due to negligence against Anita Das, a yoga teacher at Vidya Bharati School, Mominpur. After Das slapped Iftesham Chowdhury, a student of Class II, the little girl went into coma and later died. Given the gravity of the offence, the case against Das seems relatively lenient, one that is bailable and punishable with imprisonment up to two years only. Last heard, Das was absconding and the police are yet to arrest her.          
	Given this lackadaisical attitude of the police, it is perhaps futile to speculate if a stronger case should have been registered against Das. Some of the outraged guardians have demanded that a case of murder or culpable homicide not amounting to murder be registered against her by the police on the basis of the first information report. Be that as it may, the fact that the case was lodged under a lesser offence, due to either misplaced sympathy or some inscrutable ethical reason, cannot be the final word on the matter.           
	The insertion of any section(s) from the Indian Penal Code by the police, on the basis of the FIR during the registration of the case, is not binding forever. It is in the power of the magistrate or the judge to decide what offence(s) the suspect has committed, based on the evidence presented during the trial. So Das may end up with a more severe punishment than what is currently expected.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Salil Kumar Kar, Calcutta

                          
	Water everywhere          
	Sir  I am a resident of C.V. Raman Sarani in Siliguri. In a country where thousands of people perpetually suffer from water shortage, gallons of water are wasted everyday in my locality. The four taps at various points in the ward are broken and, as a result, water gushes out ceaselessly from them. The municipal water tanks also have cracks and water drips out of them continually. Nobody cares to repair the taps or the tanks. The municipal corporations indifference is really too painful to bear.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Yagnaseni Roy, Siliguri

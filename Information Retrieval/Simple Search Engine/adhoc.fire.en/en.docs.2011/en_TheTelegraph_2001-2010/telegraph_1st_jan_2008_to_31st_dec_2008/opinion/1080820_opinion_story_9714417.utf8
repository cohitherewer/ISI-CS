	Police breakthroughs with home-grown terrorism seem to be the most exciting flavour of the month in Gujarat. A pan-Indian network of training, indoctrination and planning, involving secret camps, cells, madarsas and private homes spread across at least eight different states, is being dramatically unravelled by the anti-terrorism squads. A number of alleged activists have been remanded, especially in connection with the July 26 Ahmedabad blasts, and the one organization that seems to have been nailed now, allegedly more substantially than ever before, is the Students Islamic Movement of India. This group seems to have morphed into the Indian Mujahideen, which had claimed responsibility for the Ahmedabad and Bangalore blasts. Most of the accused are from Gujarat  and are not riot victims, as the police are careful to add. So things appear to be coming together, and the net is closing confidently around those who are still eluding the grasp of the police. This is all supposed to be very reassuring, except that what is just the first stages of the rule of law is beginning to sound like the promised end. The tone of these public revelations being made by the police seems to imply that the case has been conclusively cracked, and the next logical step is to punish those who have been shown as plotting against their own country.        
	A fundamental crisis of evidence has dogged the accusations against Simi ever since the organization was banned in 2001  for the first time. Then, recently, the ban was lifted because of a lack of proper evidence against it, only to be imposed again immediately afterwards. The police, the courts, the government  none seems to be able to decide, purely on the basis of legal evidence, what to think about and do with Simi. Individual confessions made to the police under circumstances impossible to reconstruct or verify have always made up the main foundation on which the procedures have been conducted so far. For any degree of legal acceptability to be established, the judicial procedures following these accusations will have to go beyond such confessions  publicly and transparently. It is only then that the nation can be allowed to feel certain about what exactly is being claimed to have been established beyond doubt, and by whom.

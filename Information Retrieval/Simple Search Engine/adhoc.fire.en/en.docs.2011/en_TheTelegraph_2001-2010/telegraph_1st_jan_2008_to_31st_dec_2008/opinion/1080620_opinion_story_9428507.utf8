	Print on demand is the new technology that is changing the publishing world in the West. It allows books to be printed and bound to order, making millions of copies available even though they cater to a narrow readership. Academic publications, especially revised doctoral theses, college- and school-texts no longer in wide use, are its main beneficiaries. According to The Economist, the market has been growing by 45 per cent per year since 2001. This is bound to increase because Amazon, currently the biggest on-line book distributor, has announced that they would distribute POD books only if they are printed in their warehouses. If this is done Amazon would be ready to ship any book within two hours of an order placed on any book ever printed in any language.        
	Prima facie, this is big news. But two questions arise. First, as with any technological breakthrough there are secrets that are not revealed in the marketing hype. Whats the catch? Would books be cheaper because the educational market is highly price-sensitive? Second, since we tend to blindly follow anything that happens in the West, would this technology work here?        
	POD can work only if the publisher has the text in storage  if it has it in its computer memory or on a CD or microfilm positives along with copyright permission from the author or the authors successors to reprint future editions. If it does not and has to recompose the matter afresh then POD cannot work. Of course, it can still be done, but the costs would be prohibitive, simply because there are no economies of scale. Some publishers believe that they could bypass the composing costs by scanning the book, page by page, then take computer print-outs and use these as the master-copy for printing. This is a possibility, but the fixed costs would not come down appreciably. And the quality of the book would probably be mediocre.        
	Both these alternatives assume that there would be no copyright problems. But publishers are constantly renewing copyright for the standard texts, either by up-dating the texts, or, for literary works, by having new introductions written by leading authorities and resetting the text in freshly-designed formats. Also, copyright extends not merely to the text but to the manner in which the text has been formatted and designed. For instance, Shakespeares works are out of copyright but their design is copyrighted.         
	Can POD work here? No, it cant. Most publishers here dont have all of their own publications on electronic storage systems; they would have to recompose and redesign, which they would be loathe to do just for a few hundred copies. Some may do it, but the costs would not be worthwhile. POD will work here as it has always worked: photocopy the entire book and have it spirally bound  at a fraction of the price of a POD book. Otherwise order on-line from second-hand booksites like www.abebooks.com. All you need is a PC and a credit card. Works out much cheaper than anything POD can ever offer.

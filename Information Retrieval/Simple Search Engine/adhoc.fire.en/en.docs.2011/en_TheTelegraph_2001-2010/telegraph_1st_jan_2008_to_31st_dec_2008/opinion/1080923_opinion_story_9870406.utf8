                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DIFFERENT DEATH                                                    
	There are some taboos that seem insurmountable. A recommendation of the Kerala law reforms commission has pushed one of the biggest taboos to the forefront by proposing that euthanasia or mercy killing be made legal in the state. Mercy killing turns on the principle of death with dignity. Most of the world still baulks at the idea, and very few countries have made it legal, among them Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Thailand, and Oregon in the United States of America. Even there, euthanasia is bound up in many restrictions. The law commission of India had recommended two years ago that the withdrawing of life-support measures from a terminally ill patient, with the patients informed consent, be made legal. This form of mercy killing entails an act or commission, like a switching-off, even if it is by the doctor. The most passive is the withholding of common treatment, such as surgery, or the giving of pain-killing drugs, such as morphine, so that death is hastened.         
	The Kerala law reforms commission, however, recommends that if a patient is suffering from intolerable pain in an irreversible illness, either he, with the help of a doctor, can take a lethal drug, or someone else can give it to him. The dangers of aggressive euthanasia and assisted suicide are demonstrated by the fates of the different doctors named Dr Death through the years. The reforms commission suggests as safeguard a written sanction from three recognized doctors. Although the future of the recommendation is far from certain, the issues it raises should be discussed. The constitutional position on the right to life would be the inevitable argument, while a law derived from it, that against abetment to suicide, would also be cited. These must be strong enough to counter the appeal to compassion and humaneness: an individual in unbearable pain with no hope of life and movement should also have the right to die with dignity. But what seems lacking in the recommendation is the question of the individuals choice and informed consent; on this will depend the real safeguards. Beyond this, there would always loom larger questions: the meaning of consent of the old and sick in poorer families, for example, or what the legal power to end lives could mean in a country that runs a thriving black market in human kidneys.

	Sin redefined                  
	Sir  I commend the Vatican for adding seven more sins to the list of deadly sins to suit the age of globalization (Seven deadly sins updated, March 11). Today, what we need above all else are some objective standards for discerning the common good. Otherwise, democratic governments would grant anything that any social group asks for, as long as the request is phrased in the language of rights. This can only result in anarchy. We have already seen the fatal result of such democratic demands. I am thinking here of legislation that sanctions homosexuality, same-sex marriage, abortion, euthanasia, and genetic manipulation. In this situation, it is good that the Vatican has come forward with a new list of sins against which modern man can judge himself.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The updated list of sins published by the Vatican will be meaningful only if churches all over the world interpret, and help people understand them correctly. Since the Pope has condemned hedonism and consumerism in the strongest possible terms, churches must act in a way as to censure these tendencies. I feel that the Church of Mumbai needs to specify guidelines to be followed by its parishioners in their daily conduct. The church might make the use of public transport mandatory for those who come to attend the Sunday mass. The clergy should also be asked to shun private vehicles.           
	Sometime back, when I picked up some articles from the Shrine of Don Bosco in Matunga, Mumbai, I received them in a paper bag made by the boys of a home for street-children. I feel that all parish churches should start using and selling such bags, which are eco-friendly and meant to support a noble cause.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Papiya Sultana Alam should be congratulated for becoming the first Muslim woman from the state to clear the West Bengal Police Service Examination, and that too at one go. Since Muslim society continues to be conservative, it is indeed difficult for a woman to step out of the house and achieve success. Papiyas efforts are all the more praiseworthy, since she got herself a job, and that too in the police service, which remains a male bastion to this day. As Suited for the job (March 11), points out, Papiya should serve as the role model for thousands of girls, specially from the minority community. However, Papiyas husband, Badrul Alam, must also be praised for standing by his wife. We wait to see Papiya take up the cause of women in distress and hope that she will give the officers in her cadre reason to feel proud of her. The nicest part about Papiya Sultanas profile was that it revealed that the child still lives in the lady who is soon to be a police officer.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Working outside the household is especially difficult for married women who tend to think that they have no time left after performing their daily chores and taking care of children. It is remarkable that marriage has not come in the way of Papiya Sultana Alams ambition to join the police service. Papiya has proved that women can fulfil their dreams if they have the determination  with or without a helpful partner.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Money control          
	Sir  Online trading through sub-brokers of reputed firms has become a usual practice even in small towns like Bolpur, where I live. This might augur well for the investment scenario of the state, but prospective clients should be careful when entering into dealings with these brokers. I speak from experience. I had registered with the well-known Mumbai firm, Kotak Securities Ltd, through its Bolpur sub-broker in October last year, buying and selling small quantities of stocks and holding on to them for long-term gain. For some time things were fine, till all hell broke loose in January, 2008. Between January 8 and 10, thousands of shares of little known companies were bought and sold in a mad speculative frenzy from my account without my knowledge. This continued until the sub-broker could not offload them anymore as the market crashed a few days later. As soon as I got to know of the dealings, I wrote to the sub-broker not to trade on my account without my permission and faxed a copy of the letter to the Mumbai firm. But I have not received any reply from either of them. Meanwhile, KSL sold my entire portfolio, along with these forward shares, worth nearly a million rupees. The matter should be thoroughly investigated, lest small investors like me fall victim to the guiles of the sub-brokers.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
K. Chatterjee, Santiniketan

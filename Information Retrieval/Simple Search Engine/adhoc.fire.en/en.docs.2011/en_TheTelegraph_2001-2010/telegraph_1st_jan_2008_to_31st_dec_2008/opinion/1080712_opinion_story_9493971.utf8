	A centenary is always a thing to celebrate. Khayal singer Ustad Abdul Rashid Khan, who turned 100 recently, was fted for his achievement twice in June. First by Sangeet Piyasi at Uttam Manch on June 15 and again on June 30 by Devi Foundation and Electrosteel Casting Ltd. at G.D. Birla Sabhagar, where D.N. Sahay, governor of Tripura, performed the honours. The function also marked the formal release of his album, Rasan Piya (Ustadjis pen name).         
	The Ustad turned in a better performance here than he did at the previous programme. Starting his recital with a vilambit ektal khayal in Rageshree, he developed the phrases with relish in the opening section. Though at times barely audible in the mandra saptak, he was loud and clear not only throughout the madhya saptak but forcefully belted out the tar saptak madyam and gandhar. The bahlwas, medium tempo sargams and aakar taans were definitely well delivered for a man of his age. The drut teental khayal in this raga, boosted by enthusiastic and expert tabla playing by Samar Saha, saw the Ustad going in for rhythmic sargam patterns and sargam taans in which two of his pupils provided able support. Abdul Hafiz Khan on the harmonium egged the Ustad on not only with his accompaniment but also by expressing visible appreciation. The Ustad went on to sing two khayals in Desh, one in medium tempo teental and the other in drut teental. He ended with a kajri in Manjh Khamaj.                  
	At the beginning of the programme there were brief opening dance items by young Sonali Sharma, followed by a sarod recital by Tejendra Narayan Majumdar. Appropriately choosing Mian ki Malhar as the raga for his 30-minute alap-jod, he explored the raga with well-planned multi-octave phrase development. The oscillation of the twin nishads and more importantly of the characteristic Mian Malhar komal gandhar was as good as it could be. There was, however, a solitary appearance of the phrase Re ga Ma Re Sa in the manner of Megh Malhar around the 17th minute. Majumdar played a series of gamak and ekhara movements in the manner of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan in the drut jod. Very much like the Ustad, he combined both in quick taan patterns as well immediately afterwards. There were, however, a few slightly out-of-tune passages in the later movements.         
	The vilambit teental gatkari was in Desh. This started with mildly rhythmic phrase development in the manner of his guru, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, but without the Ustads appeal or melodic excellence. Then there were some ekhara and bol-ang taankari and finally extensive ekhara taankari in the manner of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan in his heyday. The ekhara taankari had the head of a composition made famous by the 78 rpm Ali Akbar-Ravi Shankar jugalbandi record but the body and tail were different. It was played in drut ektal as well. There was bolkari and jhala in this section.

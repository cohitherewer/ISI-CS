	 Politicians watch films, some of them used to be in films, some want their children to be in films, and some have filmy connections that can only be talked about in whispers. In other words, in India, politics and films look good together. A sequence like the following is commonplace: Nana Patekar, an actor, endorses the view of Raj Thackeray, a politician, that non-Marathis have no place in Maharashtra. Uma Bharti, another politician, promptly declares that she will not allow Nanas films to run in Madhya Pradesh theatres. But the sadhvi is not your average politician, so she didnt know that no film of Nanas is running in Madhya Pradesh right now. Not to be fazed, she turned her ire on Salman Khan, for the hunk has apparently signed a petition opposing the gag order on Raj Thackeray. Alas, one of her supporters pointed out that Salman too hasnt had a release in recent times, so they couldnt possibly descend in hordes on theatres and stop the film from showing. Could someone supply some film glossies to Uma Bharti please?                
	 Who says a finance ministers toughest test is the annual budget? P Chidambaram has an exam coming up which is tougher yet. He will address farmers at Delhis Ramlila grounds sometime soon. And he doesnt have a hope in hell to get his point across to the kisan bhais speaking in English, leave alone his native Tamil. So the honourable minister is diligently learning Hindi, and a peek into the FMs household these days might show him learning terms like karza-mafi (loan waiver) and udyogikaran (industrialization). His Hindi teacher has revealed that the FMs speech is going to be more Sanskritized than Urdu, because Sanskrit is closer to Tamil. But we are curious to know which poet Chidambaram is going to quote this time, since Thiruvalluvar wont help.                             
	 If the Congress comes to power in the fifteenth Lok Sabha, the country may get a Dalit prime minister. Thus spake the party mouthpiece, Sandesh  rather, its editor, Anil Shastri. Shastri goes on to claim that the Congress gave India its first woman and first Sikh PMs, and, as the initiator of Dalit empowerment, is also responsible for the first Dalit chief ministers of several states. What Shastri does not say while gushing in Dalit-love is that the Congress may be forced to let go the PMs chair if poor numbers make its leaders go begging to one Ms Mayavatis door.                            
	 Any Congress insider will tell you that Janardan Dwivedi is the partys favourite scapegoat, but the veteran leader is a resilient man. It could be something he picked up from his mentor, Ram Manohar Lohia. Dwivedi cannot stop talking about his proximity to the socialite leader. Little did he know that his tall talk would be cropped to size one day, and that too in the Rajya Sabha. Speaking on a motion of thanks, he had, as usual, strayed from his point and started speaking about the days when he was in jail with Lohia. The great man had apparently confided in him and few other devout followers that his split with the Congress was a result of the machinations of a particular Congress leader (Dwivedi did not take the name of the leader, but only referred to him as dot-dot). And then Dwivedi looked at Janeshwar Mishra, hoping to be seconded, as Mishra too was privy to Lohias secret. But Mishra simply got up and said that Dwivedi was a mere novice in those days and had not the courage to utter a word, let alone be counted in Lohias coterie. Poor Dwivedi, such a let-down! And coming from a partyman too!                            
	 If you are a journo on the political beat, you shouldnt raise your eyebrows if you were to receive mobile alerts from press officers filling in details about their bosss actions in service of the nation. These days, the presidents press officer informs scribes of Pratibha Patils movements via email and text messages. Ditto for the Lok Sabha speaker, Somnath Chatterjee. One message from Chatterjees press corps read like this: Somnath Chatterjee has congratulated the Indian cricket team on its victory in tri-series against Australia. Another stated that the Lok Sabha speaker had paid his tributes to Morarji Desai on the latters birthday.       
	Getting wired may now be cool with our politicians, but there are still a few who havent quite warmed up to the idea, most notably, Indias vice-president, Hamid Ansari. The vice-president is yet to get this new media act together and prefers to send communiqus by the old method. Some have quipped that this is because the vice-president, a political greenhorn, still hasnt quite mastered the art of self- aggrandizement.      
	FOOTNOTE    
	 Guess who had the biggest smile after Dhoni and his boys trounced the Aussies in the tri-series final? It was Sharad Pawar, the BCCI boss-cum-Union agriculture minister. After the triumph, Pawar, under fire for his no-show in the farm sector, finally found himself mobbed by mediamen and parliamentarians for the right reasons. The crowd gathered around Pawar, congratulating him for the teams performance and asked him sundry questions related to the game, players payments, the role of selectors and so on. Pawar fielded the queries like a pro, startling the crowd with his knowledge. He not only reeled off facts and figures related to domestic players, praised the selectors for their labours, but also promised that he was working to spread the game to the farthest corners of the country. With Pawar having to devote so much time to cricket, there is no point blaming the Union minister for not being able to fix the problems in Indias agriculture.

ROYAL RAJASTHAN (Roli, Rs 2,975) recounts a pictorial history of the kings and queens of Rajasthan, from the Mughal times to the present. Kishore Singh provides the commentary to the rare aerial and archival photographs put together by Pramod Kapoor. Alongside glimpses of the lives of the royal families of the princely states, there are fascinating vignettes of local traditions of art and architecture.

Top right shows a family retainer tying the safa on Thakur Kesri Singh of Mandwa. Lastly, sunlight on coloured glass has an enchanting effect in the Lake Palace Hotel, Udaipur (bottom).

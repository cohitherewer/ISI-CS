The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Stench of death
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       STENCH OF DEATH                                  Theatre - Ananda Lal                                                  
	From Tagores Dakghar to Selim Al-Deens Hargaj and Nabarun Bhattacharyas Andha Beral, Swapna-sandhani shows a growing obsession with death  which Koushik Sen underlines in his directorial note to Hargaj, a play that could have begun this trilogy on mortality had he successfully completed its abortive attempt to stage it in 2005. By a cruel twist of fate, Al-Deen himself died earlier this year. So a pall of deathly gloom may seem to hang over Swapna-sandhani as it gets ready to mark its fourth year of regular weekly performances at Sujata Sadan, the purposely-chosen alternative venue, which frees groups from the booking restrictions elsewhere. (Significantly, in this context, Sen has stood in the forefront of theatre dissenting against the state government.)        
	Few plays can be as morbid as Hargaj, named after the Bangladeshi village decimated by a tornado in 1989. The author obviously targeted the utter ineptitude of an administration, which cannot even respond before volunteers from Dhaka do, but also used the unremitting horror of death to present a gruesome memento mori of our physical fragility. The single-minded concentration on misery, which characterizes much of Bangladeshs drama, recurs here, and could have turned off audiences completely but Sen knows how to theatricalize these texts, having done it so brilliantly on Al-Deens Prachya in 2002.        
	So he brackets the grisly storyline with video grabs from ads on pulchritude and scenes of a city dancer (symbolizing female beauty) and fashion show (ending with dismembered mannequins strewn around). These blatant images of the physique and materialism stress the culture of globalization, similar to the contemporary visual interpolations in other Swapna-sandhani productions, but are more appropriate here. We can also connect the bodies torn apart by the tornado, metaphorically, to innocent urban victims of terrorism: as one man asks, can body parts constitute human identity?         
	The largely male cast expresses realistically the shock and fear of young relief workers in a disaster zone, where they search in pitch dark with torches, creating an eerie sight. Andha-beraler Galpa dramatizes four stories from Nabarun Bhattacharyas collection, Andha Beral, linked by a blind cat that frequents a roadside eatery. In Amaratya, doctors dissect for study the corpse of a destitute who died outside; in Cold Fire, a salesman promotes a new invention to replace the messy procedure of cremation; in Accident, a bus runs over a man who, we learn, deliberately committed suicide after losing his job as a minibus driver; in Dant, after a Mrquez story, a dentists set of teeth comes alive (hence a trifle unrelated to the other vignettes). Despite their brevity, they receive in-depth enactment and merit viewing for encapsulating Bhattacharyas sophisticated, yet subversive, macabre wit.

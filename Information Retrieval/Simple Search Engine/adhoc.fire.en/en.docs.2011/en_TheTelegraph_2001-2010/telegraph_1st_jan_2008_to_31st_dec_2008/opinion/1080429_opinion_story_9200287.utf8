	History has a habit of changing things. Nepal has just undergone a dramatic transformation in its history, and it is not surprising that responses to it and to its new leaders should also be different from earlier times. India has been prompt and positive in its response to the expressed desire of the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), Pushpa Kamal Dahal, or Prachanda, to scrap the India-Nepal peace and friendship treaty of 1950 and review all other agreements Nepal has with India. Given the ups and downs of the relationship between the neighbours  a really low point of which was reached, for example, in 1988-90  a proposal to scrap an old treaty was unlikely to have been taken kindly by India at any previous time. But this time round, while the Indian rhetoric has gently shifted the emphasis from scrap to renegotiate, it is clear that New Delhi is open to a discussion of the terms of peace, friendship, trade and transit, water-sharing and so on with the new leaders of Nepal.        
	In many ways, the ball is in Nepals court. The country enjoys many advantages from some of the agreements with India, although the 1950 treaty has often been perceived as unequal by politicians in Nepal. They must be aware that all the conditions, both unequal and advantageous, will be up for renegotiation. But, as the CPN(M) leader has put it, the purpose of renegotiation is a new unity on a new basis with India. Theoretically, at least, there is certainly a new equality  New Delhi will now be talking to the leaders of a secular, multi-party democracy. It is Nepal which will have to work out the exact terms of the equidistance from both India and China that the CPN(M) leader desires; he will also have to see how his partners in government whoever they may turn out to be  feel about this. Indias tetchiness about equidistance of this sort is predictable; all countries are tetchy on security issues. And in spite of Chinas disavowal of interest in the CPN(M)s victory, a discomfort about possible Maoist loyalties could persist behind New Delhis suavity. But the new leadership has shown itself aware of the fact that it was Indias support that made Nepals constituent assembly vote possible. A lot of nice things are being said on both sides; it is perfectly possible that a renegotiation of the treaty will be to the advantage of both sides. It is useful for neighbours to remain fast friends.

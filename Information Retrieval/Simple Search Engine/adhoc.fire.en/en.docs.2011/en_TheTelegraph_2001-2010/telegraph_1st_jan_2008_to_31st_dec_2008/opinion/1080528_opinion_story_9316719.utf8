	It was an admirable article, well thought out and in crisper English than youd often find in a comparable British daily paper. But alas, the Indian reporter had fallen into one error in which we British, ever ready to misuse our own language, have too often shown the way. He had written that some event begs the question, when what he meant was raises the question.        
	The two are easy to confuse, because they often go together, just as lightning and thunder do. But, like that pair, they are distinct. If I write that Hitler was a nice man who was kind to dogs, I am begging the question  quietly leaving it unasked  whether he was equally kind to people. In so doing, I may also be raising the same question, causing it to arise, in your mind. Same moment, same question, but two quite different events: I sidestep it, you ask it.         
	Theres another pair of words equally often confused: prevaricate and procrastinate. If my wife asks, Have you paid the tailor yet?, and I reply, The suit fits me well, dont you think?, I am prevaricating, deliberately evading some issue. If my answer is Surely next month would be soon enough?, Im procrastinating, putting off some decision until a more convenient moment.        
	These two also often go together. The politician who prevaricates over some tricky issue is often also procrastinating, in the hope that it will go away before he has to make a decision about it. But the two words meanings are entirely distinct. Prevaricate is from a Latin word meaning go crookedly, as varicose veins are apt to. Procrastinate began with the Latin cras (tomorrow), as in the refrain of the Pervigilium Veneris, a famous late-Roman lyric: Cras amet qui numquam amavit, quique amavit cras amet tomorrow let him love who never has loved, and who has loved, tomorrow let him love.        
	Neither of these errors is confined to the uneducated, the sort of speaker who says mitigate against when he means militate against. The very journalist who would make fun of malapropisms like that may himself cheerfully opine that they beg the question of what sort of English is being taught in British schools. They dont, they raise it.        
	Both of these common misuses raise (sic) a wider question: how often does a misuse have to occur before it ceases to be one? Modern dictionaries, unlike those of a century ago, tend to record how people, or maybe only quite a lot of people, do use words, not how they ought to. The compilers reckon that their business is to record, not to lay down the law. Believing that language belongs to its users, not to grammarians or pedants, I sympathize with that view  but within limits.        
	My sympathy collapses, for instance, when I meet might being used for may, and may have for might have. Ill rush to the barricades  quite in vain, no doubt, but Ill still do it  to challenge that, although millions of English-speakers do thus misuse those words every morning. And the trouble with dictionaries is that many people do in fact, and not unreasonably, regard them as authoritative, even though the dictionary-makers themselves decline that honour.         
	In my eyes, to use prevaricate when you mean procrastinate  the reverse error is much less common  is quite simply wrong, like using black when you mean brown: they may be alike, indeed shade into each other, but theyre distinct. And any dictionary that records that usage without comment is begging (though also raising) the question of whether it is justified in doing so.

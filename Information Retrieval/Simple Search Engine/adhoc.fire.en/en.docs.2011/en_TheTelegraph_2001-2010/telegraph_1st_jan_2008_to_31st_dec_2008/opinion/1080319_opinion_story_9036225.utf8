				       From the man who sued God to the man who sued TV for making his wife fat, people turn to lawyers for the strangest things, reports   Gary Slapper                                                       Spaced out: A Russian astrologer sued NASA for disrupting the balance of the universe		    
	In 2004, Timothy Dumouchel, from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin sued a television company for making his wife fat and transforming his children into lazy channel surfers. He said: I believe the reason I smoke and drink every day and my wife is overweight is because we watched the TV everyday for the last four years. The case kept at least two of Americas then 1,058,662 lawyers occupied for a while, but did not go to the Supreme Court.         
	In 2005, a 31-year-old Brazilian woman sued her partner for failing to give her orgasms. After a promising start the action ended in something of an anticlimax when the case was rejected.         
	In 2004, a German lawyer, Juergen Graefe, acted for an elderly pensioner from St Augustin, near Bonn, who was sent a tax demand for 287 million euros, even though the womans income was only 17,000 euros. Graefe fixed the problem with one standard letter to the authorities, but as German law entitles him to calculate his fee based on the amount of the reduction he obtained, his fee came to 440,234 euros (308,000). It will be met by the state.         
	In 1972, at Wakefield Crown Court in Yorkshire, Reginald Sedgwick was prosecuted for stealing Cleckheaton railway station. The defendant, a demolition contractor, was alleged to have destroyed the disused stone building and cleared the site of 24 tons of track with dishonest intentions. He admitted the deed, explained that it was done for an untraced third party, and his lawyer demolished the prosecutions case, securing an acquittal.         
	In 2005, Marina Bai, a Russian astrologer, sued NASA for 165 million for disrupting the balance of the universe. She claimed that the space agencys Deep Impact space probe, which was due to hit a comet later that year to harvest material from the explosion, was a terrorist act. A Moscow court accepted Russian jurisdiction to hear the claim but it was eventually rejected.         
	In 2007, a court in India was asked to decide whether a vibrating condom is a contraceptive or a sex toy. The condoms contain a battery-operated device, and, for the avoidance of doubt, are marketed as Crezendo. Opponents argue its a sex toy and thus unlawful in India, whereas the manufacturer says its a contraceptive and promotional of public health.         
	In 2006, a young man from Jiaxing, near Shanghai, found himself in legal trouble after failing to take advice before putting his soul up for sale on an online auction site. The posting was eventually removed by the auctioneer and the seller was told that the advert would be reinstated only if he could produce written permission to sell his soul from a higher authority.         
	In 2004, Frank DAlessandro, a court official in New York, sued the city for serious injuries that he sustained when a toilet he was sitting on exploded leaving him in a pile of porcelain. He claimed $5 million compensation. Reflecting on the demanding physical therapy in which he must now engage every morning before work, DAlessandro declared: Its a pain in the ass to do all this stuff.         
	In 1964, the Exchequer Court of Canada was asked to decide whether the expenses of running a call girl business in Vancouver were deductible from gross income for the purposes of income tax. The madam and seven call girls were all convicted and imprisoned. And then taxed. Claims for tax deductions in respect of the ordinary parts of the business, such as phone bills, were allowed. Other types of expenses were disallowed because the business couldnt prove them with receipts, including $2000 for liquor for local officials and $1000 paid to certain men possessed of physical strength and some guile, which they exercised when set to extricate a girl from difficulties.         
	In a notorious case heard by Baron Huddleston in November 1884, Captain Thomas Dudley and Edwin Stephens were prosecuted for the murder of a cabin boy, Richard Parker. When the yacht they were sailing from Southampton to Sydney capsized, they found themselves on a dinghy 1,600 miles from shore. After 20 days adrift, they killed Parker, eating his liver and drinking his blood to survive. They were rescued four days later by a German vessel and were convicted of murder at Exeter Assizes, although their death sentences were later commuted to six months imprisonment without hard labour. Their defence of necessity was rejected.         
	Cathy McGowan, 26, was overjoyed when a DJ on Radio Buxton told her that she had correctly answered a quiz question and had won the competition prize: A Renault Clio. Ecstasy collapsed into despair, however, when she arrived at the radio station and was presented with a four-inch model of the car. In 2001, she sued and a judge at Derby County Court ruled that the now defunct station in Derbyshire had entered into a legally binding contract with McGowan and ordered its owners to pay 8,000 for the real vehicle.         
	In 2005, Pavel M., a Romanian prisoner serving 20 years for murder, sued God, founding his claim in contract. He argued that his baptism was an agreement between him and God under which, in exchange for value such as prayer, God would keep him out of trouble.         
	Sentencing a young woman at the Magistrates Court in Port Adelaide, Australia, in 2003, a magistrate said: Youre a druggie and youll die in the gutter. Thats your choice... I dont believe in that social worker crap. You abuse your mother and cause her pain. You can choose to be who you are. You can go to work. Seven million of us do it whilst fourteen million like you sit at home watching Days of Our Lives smoking your crack pipes and using needles and Im sick of you sucking us dry.         
	He then concluded: Its your choice to be a junkie and die in the gutter. No one gives a shit, but youre going to kill that woman who is your mother, damn you to death.         
	He gave the woman a prison sentence, unaware that that was unlawful in the type of case in question. Her appeal was successful.         
	In 1874, Francis Evans Cornish, while acting as a magistrate in Winnipeg, Canada, had to try himself on a charge of being drunk in public. He convicted himself and fined himself five dollars with costs. But then he stated for the record: Francis Evans Cornish, taking into consideration past good behaviour, your fine is remitted.         
	In 1980, Lord Justice Ormrod, Lord Justice Dunn and Justice Arnold ruled in the UKs Court of Appeal that a wife from Basingstoke who rationed sex with her husband to once a week was behaving reasonably. Lord Hailsham later revealed that the ruling had provoked some newspapers to try to interview the wives of all the judges in the case.         
	A father from Zhengzhou, in China, was refused legal permission to name his son  after the keyboard character. Permission was declined on the legal basis that all names must be capable of being translated into Mandarin.         
	In September, 2004, Judge A.K.M. Patabendige, in Walasmulla, Sri Lanka, jailed a man for a year for yawning in court. N.V.P. Ajith, a defendant in a criminal case, stretched out and yawned in a way that so infuriated the judge, the punishment for contempt was immediate.

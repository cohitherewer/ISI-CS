	Goodbye To Gandhi? Travels in The New India By Bernard Imhasly, Viking, Rs 425        
	Bernard Imhasly, who has spent a lifetime as South Asia correspondent for various European newspapers and has now made India his home, has written an unusual book in approach and in content. His work inevitably made him travel to different parts of India and it would have been very easy for him to write an account of these travels and then to comment on the diversity of India. Imhasly chose very deliberately not to take this route taken by many of his peers. Instead he decided to give to his travels a still centre: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. In Imhaslys words, It is an account of travels in modern India, with Gandhi as my guide.        
	This focus might appear surprising since Gandhi died a few months after India attained independence. Moreover, India has clearly turned its back on most of Gandhis ideals. But, as Imhasly asserts, it [India] has struggled, more or less successfully, to meet its social challenges. The modes of meeting these challenges may not be all Gandhian, but many of the challenges emerge from Gandhis identification of Indias fundamental social and economic problems.        
	Imhasly makes one very pertinent observation which needs to be noted. He describes India as a moving target. Moving because India is undergoing rapid change. It is moving in another sense as well: The observer is moved  and transformed  by the things that touch him. This alters perspective and perceptions. It is evident that Imhaslys idea of India was radically touched by what he saw, by the people he met and heard and by the situations he encountered. In a very understated and non-egoistical way, this is also a journey of self-discovery.        
	This book brings together a mix of reportage and reflection. The journey begins in Gujarat, pogrom-affected Gujarat and thus very different from the place from which Gandhi began his experiments with truth. Imhasly travels to Champaran, the site of Gandhis first use of satyagraha in India. There are visits to Imphal and to Bangalore, places that are not associated with Gandhi. In Rajasthan, he meets Aruna Roy who tells him that from Gandhi she learnt that to bring about change one must live among the people one wants to help. She also learnt from him that ones actions must be truthful.        
	In Bangalore, Narayana Murthy, the name one easily associates with the new and emerging India, admitted that he had taken up Gandhis clarion call to be the change you want to see. From Gandhi had come the definition of leadership; a definition presented through praxis.        
	Imhasly arrives at the conclusion that Gandhi is alive in civil society, but his virulence is absent precisely where he had positioned himself throughout his life: in the politics of the country, at the intersection between private life and public action. While there can be questions regarding the use of the word virulence regarding Gandhi, the general thrust of the statement is undeniable. Civil society is also bound to change under the impact of the economic reforms, will Gandhi then be present in civil society?        
	The name of Imhaslys book has greater resonance than the query in the title suggests. Despite the presence of a few heroic and lonely figures, India has said goodbye to Gandhi.

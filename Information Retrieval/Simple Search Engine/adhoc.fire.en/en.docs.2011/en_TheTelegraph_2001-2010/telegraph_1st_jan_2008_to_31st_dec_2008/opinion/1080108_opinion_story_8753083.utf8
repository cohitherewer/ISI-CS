	The imposition of presidents rule in a state usually has its share of political and legal controversies. The unhappiness of Nagalands sacked chief minister, Neiphiu Rio, is therefore understandable. But he has to blame himself, rather than New Delhi, for the abrupt and inglorious end to his rule. Before he lost his government, he seemed to have lost control of his party. The way he sought to manipulate last months no-confidence vote against his government was a shame. By the time the Centre decided to invoke Article 356 of the Constitution, it was absolutely clear that Mr Rio had lost the support of the majority of the members of the state assembly. What happens in such situations  in the Northeast as well as in other states  is familiar stuff in Indian politics. Money would have been blatantly used for what has come to be known as horse-trading. The continuation of a government in such a situation would have been politically and morally wrong. The only way Mr Rio could have salvaged his governments  and his own  credibility was by offering his resignation. Given Indian politicians reputation for holding on to power by any means, Mr Rios unwillingness to step down should surprise no one. In the process, however, he left the Centre little option but to dismiss him. 
    
	Mr Rio can still try to redeem himself. The next elections in the state are only a couple of months away. He will have his opportunity to judge the peoples opinion of his rule and of the Centres decision to impose presidents rule in the state. However, neither he nor other politicians in the state should drag the Naga peace process into the political controversies of the day. The peace talks between the Naga rebels and New Delhi have much larger stakes than electoral victory or the defeat of one political group or another. Peace in Nagaland is not a political bargain; the failure or the success of the peace talks is a matter of life and death for the entire Naga society. It is important for New Delhi and for the Congresss unit in Nagaland not to sacrifice the peace process to narrow political interests. It is not unknown that various rebel groups in the state have their own equations with the major political parties. The peace process has its own share of problems. It would be a pity if its politicians become enemies of Nagalands peace.

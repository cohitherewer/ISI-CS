	The general elections are scheduled for next year but the prime minister is already scouting for a safe Lok Sabha seat to help him return to the top job, this time with the people rsquo;s mandate. Offers have poured in from party units in Punjab and also from Assam where Manmohan Singh won a Rajya Sabha seat. An invitation has come from Bengal too, with Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury offering Singh to contest from Malda in West Bengal. Malda is considered to be the safest territory in India. Veteran Congress leader, the late Ghani Khan Chowdhury, had won the seat seven times on a trot. His brother, Abu Hashem, is the present MP and he has requested the PM to contest one of the two seats that has come up after delimitation exercise. Singh is also expected to visit Malda soon. Let rsquo;s just say that the PM is keen to test the ground first for he knows that it is better to be safe rather than sorry in these uncertain times.      
	 Words speak louder than action in Chhattisgarhs politics, more so if they are spoken in the mother tongue. On the last day of campaigning for the just-concluded polls, Ajit Jogi urged tribal voters to accept murga-daaru from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party but vote for the Congress. This, coupled with his habit of describing chief minister Raman Singh as labara raja (liar king), left his opponents fuming. Fearing that Jogis dexterous choice of Chhattisgarhi labara would further strengthen his son-of-soil credentials, the BJP decided to call Raman Singh chaul wale baba. But the slogan lacked the punch as only the word, chaul (rice), and not wale and baba, belonged to the local dialect. In Chhattisgarh, baba is also used to denote an elderly person, but the genial Raman Singh is not that old yet.       
	As for the murga-daaru affair, Raman Singh and his party have vehemently denied hosting such occasions. But the grapevine has it that such feasts are common affairs in the state on the eve of election day, and all political parties lay out such spreads to woo tribal voters. If two feasts hosted by different political parties happen to fall on the same day, people happily attend both. This time around, although the feasts were well attended, there was no word about who the people would vote to power on D-Day. Time to speak a different language Mr Jogi?                            
	 The BJP has decided to publish its list of candidates for the Lok Sabha polls well before the Congress, even though the dates havent been announced yet. Instead of admitting that they had been caught napping, Congressmen are whispering that the BJP has stolen the precious AK Antony Panel Recommendations. The story goes like this. The Union defence minister had headed a committee, which had been formed to identify ways to improve the grand old party. Significantly, one of its suggestions had been that names of candidates for the Lok Sabha elections should be announced six months in advance. But all the hard work put in by Antony seems to have gone to waste. It seems that while the Congress spent its time debating and discussing the wisdom behind Antonys theory, its rival went ahead and put it in practice.    
	New   friends          
	 After their bitter fallout with the Congress, the Left, we hear, is on the prowl for a new friend at Poes Garden. Prakash Karat and D Raja are said to be in touch with J Jayalalithaa, who, they feel, will be more useful than M Karunanidhi. With little else to do, Sitaram Yechury and Raja are heading a delegation to Brazil to attend a communist workers meet. Another party delegation is scheduled to visit Syria to discuss the Middle East. With friends hard to come by in the country, it looks like Karat and Co. are searching for some international company.                            
	 Politics is a funny game but the Janata Dal United MPs who had resigned in protest against the ill treatment of North Indians in Raj Thackerays Mumbai may not agree. These conscientious men were prompt in putting down their papers after the violence. But so was the telecom department and it snapped their official telephone connections a day after they resigned!                             
	 Heard in the Bhopal Congress office: if the people of the state have their way, the Congress will win in Madhya Pradesh. However, if the faction leaders of the party have their way, the BJP will win the state.          
	 Sheila Dikshit was raring to take on BJPs chief ministerial candidate VK Malhotra in a televised debate, but Malhotra spoiled the show by playing hard to get. Apparently, gag orders have been issued by the party high command that has prevented Malhotra from appearing in television programmes such as this. Malhotras party, according to one school of thought, is unwilling to project the battle for Delhi as a war between Dikshit and their man. However, to prevent the the Congress chief minister from saying that Malhotra had developed cold feet, the party turned to ace trouble shooter, Arun Jaitley, to fill in for Malhotra. Soon enough, it was Dikshits turn to sound a retreat and the much-awaited encounter stood cancelled. All this has reportedly left BJP workers in Delhi wondering whether it would have been better to field Jaitley, and not Malhotra, against Dikshit. Given the crescendo, Malhotra must be hoping that the high command does not ask Jaitley to fill in the CM-in-waiting role as well.

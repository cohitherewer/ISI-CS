	Debt-based mutual funds had begun to win investors hearts in recent years. Inflows exceeded outflows for at least eight years down to 2006-07, when net inflows reached Rs 525 billion. The costs of running mutual funds are lower than those of banks. Whereas banks operational costs typically absorb the bulk of their earnings, mutual funds can manage with much lower margins. The result is that mutual funds have been gaining at the expense of banks. Their advance does not yet pose a threat to banks, whose assets are many times larger than those of mutual funds. But sophisticated investors have been turning towards debt funds; corporate investors have particularly taken to them. Simpler investors prefer fixed maturity plans, which are a good way of securing a determinate income in old age.         
	Recent months have, however, seen an exodus from both. This is largely due to tightening liquidity; as businesses have run out of money, they have cashed their investments. One would have expected liquid funds to see outflows first, and so they did. But debt funds have also bled. Some of them have been delaying payments. The norm was that redemptions would be made within three days of application. Now some funds have gone down to nine days, and a few are taking even longer. One would have expected the Securities and Exchange Board of India to pull them up and bring them up to scratch; after all, it is supposed to be there to protect the investor. But mutual funds are closer to it than the investor. They went to it and explained their difficulty in realizing their investments in government and corporate debt. The market for debt is narrow and illiquid; often the funds have to wait to find a buyer. One way or another, a number of them have been short of cash, and their clients who wanted their money back have been the sufferers.         
	One remedy that Sebi has thought of is to introduce trading in all mutual funds on stock exchanges. The rationale is that investors who now wait for the fund managers to cash their investments would have the additional choice of selling off their mutual fund holdings in the market. This is a good idea, but not for the reason that appeals to Sebi. If the funds were traded in the market, they would trade at a discount, and the discount would reflect their tardiness in paying investors as well as the quality of their investments. Making all funds tradeable would make them more liquid, but would also reveal their flaws. The information that the markets would reveal would be most useful to investors; and in the longer run, it would lead to the exit of bad investment managers and improve the governance of the industry. A market is not just a trading place; it is also an instrument of information dissemination.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       VANTAGE POINT                                                                  
	The last tiger census in India this year showed dismal results. The number of tigers all over the country has dwindled to almost its half over the last few years, and a place like the Sariska Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan has no tiger left to justify its name. Given the facts, it is easy to sympathize with the despair voiced repeatedly by a tiger conservationist like Valmik Thapar over the fate of the big cats in India. It is just as easy to understand why Thapar becomes rapturous when he gets to see the tigers up close  not once  but for ten days at a stretch in Rajasthans Ranthambhore National Park in March this year. His book, RANTHAMBHORE: 10 DAYS IN THE TIGER FORTRESS (Oxford, Rs 1,595), is an expression of his unbridled happiness over the fact that in this particular reserve at least, tigers still live and hunt in peace.         
	What gives Thapars joy its peculiar intensity is the severe gloom and desperation surrounding the tigers future in India, as he says in the introduction. Despite lengthy legislations and hefty investments, both the Central and the state governments have largely failed to protect the tigers. Thapars euphoria at being able to observe and photograph the tigers of Ranthambhore is not exaggerated since the Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve presents a unique instance of successful conservation. But then, Ranthambhore is an exception. If the photographs bring out the beauty of the tigers, they also emphasize the fact that it is perpetually under threat. These tigers might just prove to be the last of the species in India.        
	If the tigers are to survive, a few more ardent activists like Thapar are needed. Perhaps for this reason, Thapar stresses the presence of his six year-old son, Hamir, as one of the photographers in this book.         
	These images attest to the photographers dedication to the tigers cause. There is no attempt either to sentimentalize the animals or to underline their ruthlessness. The tigers are photographed in their natural state  as they stroll around the reserve, mark their territories, fight for food or make their kill.        
	The photographs in which they come breathtakingly close to areas of human habitation serve to mark their strangeness in these settings. As Thapar says, Tigers and human beings cannot coexist and all our policies to save wild tigers must be based on this fact.         
	Interestingly, there are a number of images in which the photographers are seen clicking the tigers. This is as if to remind the viewer that even as the tigers are being subjected to the photographers gaze, there is yet another presence behind that of the camera.         
	On the left is a tiger preparing for its nap on the Chhota Chhatri of the Ranthambhore Fort. The tigers have apparently taken over the ruins of the 400-year old fort. They use the Chhota Chhatri as a vantage point to gaze down at deer, says Thapar. Top right is a contented tiger beside one of the watering holes in the park. A blossom-headed parakeet makes most of the first blooms of summer (bottom left). In the picture on bottom right, taken from Hamirs Scrapbook, the photographers jeep takes leave of the tigers home.

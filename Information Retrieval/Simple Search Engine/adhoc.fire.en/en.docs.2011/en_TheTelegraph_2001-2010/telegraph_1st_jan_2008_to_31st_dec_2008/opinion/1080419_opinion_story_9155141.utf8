	It can be said without any exaggeration that a new era dawned for cricket yesterday evening with the first match of the Indian Premier League. There are two novel features in this tournament. One is that this is the first major tournament in India of the twenty-over variety of the game. The other is even more novel. None of the competing teams is country- or region-based. They are focused on cities, and they have players drawn from all over the world. In this aspect, cricket has thus emulated its traditional rival, football. Eminent cricketers were bought by the various teams at an auction; it logically follows that players are liable to be sold to other teams for a suitable price. This has never happened to cricketers before, but is standard practice among football clubs. If Kerry Packer brought about a major revolution in the world of cricket in the Seventies, the IPL can claim the authorship of another, even more radical, revolution.        
	Purists will moan that this is the end of cricket as they have known it, and those among the purists who see cricket as a way of life rather than a mere game will whine that this is the end of civilization as they have known it. It will be worth reminding them that change is ingrained in the DNA of cricket. When John Lillywhite first raised his arm shoulder-high to bowl a cricket ball, there was a howl of outrage. Many considered it to be not cricket. When the legendary W.G. Grace began to hit merrily on the leg side with a cross bat, many were very cross. Yet, as the history of cricket shows, very soon round-arm bowling and shots on the leg side became standard practice. Cricket has accommodated change to make the game more attractive and popular. In other words, cricket has changed to survive. Some of the changes have been minor, like changes in the shape of the bat, the height of the stumps and so on, but some, like round-arm bowling and one-day cricket, have been truly revolutionary in their impact. The impact of the IPL and the twenty-over variety will be in the future. It will be an expression of sheer prejudice to immediately write off these changes.        
	The cricket fan now has a range of choices regarding what kind of game he prefers to watch. There will be some who will enjoy nothing save the Test match, spread over five days and played at a somewhat leisurely pace. Others will opt for the one-day variety, lasting around six hours, with its emphasis on fast scoring. Now there is another variety on offer  a game that lasts twenty overs for each side. There will always be the diehard few who will watch all three types of the game simply because they are addicted to the sound of the cricket ball hitting the willow. From five days to twenty overs, the rhythm of the excitement will vary. For the nonce, cricket lovers should brace themselves for a spectacle, complete with film stars and cheerleaders. It is no longer possible to know cricket by knowing the world of cricket.

	How well did Elias Canetti know the Indian subcontinent and its crowds? I remember reading his classic, Crowds and Power, as a student, and applying his theory of collective behaviour to my own experience of growing up in India  and everything that he wrote seemed too tidily bookish.         
	One of the things I enjoy most in Mumbai is the spectacle of people getting on and off the local trains during peak hours. During those moments of madness, I alternate between looking at it collectively and concentrating on the individual faces with their changes in expression. And when I came across photographs made by Henri Cartier-Bresson in 1948  of crowds trying to pay homage to Gandhis ashes (right), or of a maharaja distributing sugar balls to the poor on his birthday (left)  I was able to ponder the psychological complexity of this kind of mass behaviour. Complex, not only because there are so many people, compelling one to aggregate ones observations, but also because each person holds together a mix of feelings and reflexes while being part of the dynamics of a crowd. What the individual feels and does in a crowd cannot be understood, of course, simply in terms of psychology. One has to take into account the structures and histories of an entire culture or society. These would be made up of its relationships with food, money and sex, with power and authority, with looking, touching and wanting, with pleasure, desire, danger, and death.        
	With Indian crowds, glee can turn into alarm in an instant, and both glee and alarm imply a suspension of reason that could inspire extreme, animal recklessness. Sometimes, when people and cows and dogs and crows are part of the same crowd, it is impossible to tell human behaviour apart from animal. And Im not saying this with Swiftian disgust, but with the knowledge of such recklessness encountered in myself. Given the inequalities one is born into in India, there are two ways of knowing crowds. First, by watching them from a distance or height, through the window of a car, bus, train or house, or on TV. Second, by being part of one, by accident or by choice. The second has been for me one of lifes richly confounding experiences. I can understand why photographers, writers and travellers from the wide open spaces of the West seek out the more crowded parts of the world simply to be closer to a larger number of bodies, to feel an extreme version of what Tennessee Williams had called the kindness of strangers. Kindness, here, is as much a kinship with other human beings as the quality of being kind. And the latter does not necessarily follow from the former.         
	Affluent and underpopulated civility can breed a desperate boredom  not unlike the sexual boredom of a comfortable marriage  that could lead to something like a death-wish: the perverse desire to lose oneself in the dangerous insanity of a crowd, together with every notion of privacy, safety and restraint one has been taught to guard with ones life in the name of civilization. The Romantic Sublime is embodied in the image of a man standing gloomily among Alpine peaks or on a vast seashore without a soul around him; if you think of Hrishikesh or Digha you will immediately realize why such an aesthetic of solitude could never have come out India.        
	The problem with wanting to lose oneself in a crowd is that it is perfectly possible for it to come quite literally true in India. Indian stampedes  to get ones share of the goodies being given away by a politician on his birthday, or to run from a bomb  often prove to be fatal for hundreds of people at a time. Beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror, Rilke had written in the early years of the 20th century, using the next centurys most dreaded word with what now sounds like touching innocence. That electric moment, when unthinking trust turns into unthinking panic, when a crowd turns into a stampede, marks the beginning of a terror that only the darkest of poets would find beautiful.                    AVEEK SEN

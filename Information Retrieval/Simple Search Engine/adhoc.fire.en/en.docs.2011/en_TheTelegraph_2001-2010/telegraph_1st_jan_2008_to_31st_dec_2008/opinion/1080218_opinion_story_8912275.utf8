                                                                                                                 TURN OVER A NEW LEAF                                  Gwynne Dyer                              
	The opinion polls could be wrong by as much as 10 or 15 per cent, and theyd still tell you a lot about the state of Pakistani public opinion. As the country heads into the election that was postponed for six weeks after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December, what the polls are saying, basically, is that the president, Pervez Musharraf, is about as popular as piles.        
	The elections to be held today are for the National Assembly (parliament), so they do not directly threaten the former generals grasp on power. Musharraf had himself re-elected to the presidency last October. But the real game is about whether he stays in power or not, and that is very much in doubt.        
	The depth of his unpopularity is truly impressive. A poll conducted recently by the International Republican Institute, a right-wing American organization for the promotion of democracy abroad, gave Musharrafs approval rating as a scant 15 per cent. That is a 50 percentage-point drop since November. Seventy-five per cent of respondents said that Musharraf should resign and 62 per cent believed that his government had some role in Benazir Bhuttos assassination.        
	A rival poll conducted at the same time by another US-based organization, Terror-Free Tomorrow, produced almost identical results. These are not numbers that the Bush administration would be eager to hear, since Musharraf is its protg. He has been Washingtons loyal ally in the war on terror and his government has been rewarded with about $10 billion in American aid.        
	Given all this, the IRIs report that 89 per cent of Pakistanis oppose any cooperation with Americas war on terror would be especially unwelcome to Washington. Whatever their flaws, the figures have not been manipulated to serve the purposes of the US government. So what do these polls tell us about the outcome of the election?                
	In the right direction        
	They say that Musharrafs tame party in the parliament, the Pakistan Muslim League -Qaid-e-azam, will be humbled in the elections, winning as little as 14 per cent of the popular vote. Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party, now led by her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, will benefit greatly from her death, winning half the votes cast and emerging as the biggest party in the new parliament.        
	The party of Nawaz Sharif is predicted to get 22 per cent of the vote. So, between them, the PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz are likely to get almost three-quarters of the votes. This is not at all what Washington intended when it put its money on Benazir Bhutto. Her return from exile began as part of a US scheme to shore up Musharrafs tottering rule by engineering an alliance between the two. The idea was that Bhutto, in return for an amnesty on the various corruption charges facing her, would come home, win the parliamentary election, and become prime minister. In return, Washingtons favourite Pakistani general would finally take off his uniform and emerge as a civilian president enjoying Bhuttos support.        
	Whatever the Pakistani public chooses to believe, it is unlikely that Musharraf organized Bhuttos assassination. The political compact between the two was far from settled, but it was still Musharrafs best hope of clinging to power. That hope is now fading fast.         
	Sharif and Zardari met in Lahore recently and pledged to form a coalition government after the election. That would be deeply distressing for the Bush administration, which would lose its most important and obedient ally. But it would be a very good thing for Pakistan, whose people deserve something better than an unending parade of generals ruling over them. And it would probably also be a good thing for the real struggle against terrorism since the war on terror has been the main recruiting agent for Islamist extremism since 2001.

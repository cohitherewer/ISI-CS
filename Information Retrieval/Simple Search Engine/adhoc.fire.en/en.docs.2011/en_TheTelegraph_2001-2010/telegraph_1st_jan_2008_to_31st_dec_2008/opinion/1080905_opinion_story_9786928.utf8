	The Several Lives of Joseph Conrad By John Stape, William Heinemann, 13        
	Fiction  if it at all aspires to be art  appeals to temperament, wrote Joseph Conrad in his extraordinary preface to The Nigger of the Narcissus in 1897, when distinguishing the artists task from that of the thinker and the scientist. These are all seekers after truth. But while the thinker plunges into ideas, and the scientist chases facts, art may be defined as a single-minded attempt to render the highest kind of justice to the visible universe, by bringing to light the truth.... It is an attempt to find... in the facts of life what of each is fundamental, what is enduring and essential  their one illuminating and convincing quality  the very truth of their existence.         
	In this intensely written preface, Conrad articulates his vision and ethics as artist. The work of the writer is an unremitting struggle, not only to gain a glimpse of the truth but also to make written words appeal through the senses, its high desire being to reach the secret spring of responsive emotions. For this, the shape and ring of sentences must be unerring, evoking the plasticity of sculpture, the colours of painting and the suggestiveness of music. The stylist is as present here as is the moral artist, struggling to make his reader hear, feel and before all see, because there is not a place of splendour or a dark corner of the earth that does not deserve... a passing glance of wonder and pity.        
	It is a matter of both wonder and pity that John Stape in his biography, The Several Lives of Joseph Conrad, chooses just this last phrase out of what he calls Conrads artistic manifesto to repeat throughout the volume, ignoring that the richness of the rest could give greater insight into the artists long and interrupted battles to complete each work. Stape alludes to the phrase the first time in his own preface, while discussing the difficulty of picking out the facts of Conrads life, given the writers tendency to fantasize in his reminiscences, The Mirror of the Sea and A Personal Record, the howlers about himself he told his friends, the inaccuracies in the memoirs of his wife and sons, the fictions about him that his friend, Ford Madox Ford, circulated, and the idolatry of his admirers, Richard Curle and Jean Aubry. And Conrad did have an extraordinary life, Stape adds, with considerable elements of romance and the exotic, variously recreated when he sat down to his desk, arguably a highly adventurous act in its own way.        
	Such a comment might strike a reader as somewhat dismissive of one of the greatest and most disturbing writers straddling two centuries  he died in 1924  and striving to create a whole new universe of imagination, experience and expression. Conrad, or Jzef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski, was born in Berdichev in 1857, in the part of Poland that fell at that time to Russia, to a father whose commitment to a lost Poland caused his imprisonment and drove his wife and little son through cold, oppressive cities. Conrads mother died when he was seven, and the melancholy wandering continued for the ill father and delicate son till Conrad was finally orphaned in Cracow. He left East Europe with his grandmother to regain his health, studied and travelled more until she died. His maternal uncle took over as guardian, mentor and long-suffering banker as Conrad discovered Europe  in Marseilles, he wrote, the puppy opened his eyes  till his determination to go to sea overcame his uncles resistance and he started on the first of his two hard and exacting careers.        
	Conrad was always reserved but melodramatic when it suited him, feels his biographer, hence it is very difficult to get to the man. In compensation, Stape offers a meticulous pile of facts, which give the impression of still-raw data that would yield more to sympathetic percipience. The reader comes to know of Conrads habits of overspending and borrowing, of his repeated spells of gout, his incurable restlessness and changes of house as a landsman, his almost constitutional inability to meet his publishers deadlines, of his friends, their marriages and their childrens futures, of his wifes fatness and painful knee surgeries, of his older sons fecklessness and post-war stress  although not why the biographer thinks the parents underestimated it. But the reader should not expect to be able to visualize the Conrads as warm and desirable hosts, as the facts suggest they were, or sense the atmosphere of Conrads friendships, or to imagine the magnetism of a man of genius who had fashioned his intellect out of travel and voracious reading, or even to speculate on the quality of Conrads conjugal life apart from parallel illnesses of husband and wife. It is startling to find that the reconstruction of such a romantic life with such exotic experiences can be so deadly dull.        
	Stape feels the need for a reassertion of facts in the biography of a man surrounded by myths and inaccuracies. But his arrangement gives no insight into the transformation of Conrads sense of rootlessness into an appetite for constant movement, a hunger to experience all the world. The magnitude of the change implied by the shift from seaman to writer barely registers in Stapes account of the beginning of Almayers Folly: Conrads mental escape to the tropics is hardly surprising, although why reverie became transformed into writing remains an intractable mystery. The choice of English when he had Polish and French at his disposal, Stape argues more than once, was a practical decision, although layered. What Conrad might have called essential behind the fundamental choice to live in England and be an English writer remains elusive.        
	Neither a sense of the sea nor of politics and the play of power, the two central themes in Conrad, helps to open windows on this somewhat claustrophobic account of his life. A thorough account of history sets the scene of his birth. But this dimension quickly dwindles into topical references for the context of his later novels, with sketchy nods towards the rich context of Victorian and turn-of-the-century Britain, the only exception being changes in the publishing industry and the emergence of the literary agent. But Stape is not without surprises. He completely ignores the issue of racism  or its reverse  in Conrads writings. That takes some doing when one of the most famous of a writers works is called The Nigger of the Narcissus. A nagging suspicion  unworthy no doubt  is unavoidable: maybe the biographer does not really like his subject?

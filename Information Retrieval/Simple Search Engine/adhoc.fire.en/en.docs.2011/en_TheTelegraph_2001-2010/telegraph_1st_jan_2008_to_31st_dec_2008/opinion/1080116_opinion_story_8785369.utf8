	Elected governments do not necessarily provide good governance. In Bangladesh, such governments betrayed the peoples hopes for over 15 years. That perhaps explains why, a year after an emergency was imposed in the country, the people there are not exactly desperate for a return to democratic rule. Such was the peoples frustration with their elected leaders that they have been rather patient with the army-backed administration. The interim administrations record of governance has clearly been much better than those of the governments of Begum Khaleda Zia and of Sheikh Hasina Wajed before her. Even the worst critics of the administration would express acclaim for the administrations major successes on two fronts. Over the past few years, Bangladesh came to be known as a lawless land, where rival political parties took turns in shutting down the country through strikes and violence. The country also became a hub of Islamist terror. The two evils virtually turned Bangladesh into a failed state. The collapse of the rule of law enabled its politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats to make personal fortunes through corrupt means. It became almost routine for Bangladesh to figure as the most corrupt country in Transparency Internationals annual reports. It was a formidable task to even attempt a meaningful clean-up, but the interim administration at least began it in right earnest. Most important, however, has been its success against Islamist terrorists. 
    
	All this is not to suggest that the army should banish democracy in Bangladesh yet again. The country had experienced long spells of army rule before democracy was restored there in 1991. Dhakas corrupt and inept politicians have paid a price for their failures and mistakes. In fact, both Ms Zia and Ms Wajed are still in prison on corruption charges along with several hundred other politicians and businessmen. But the goodwill that the interim administration has earned among the common people may not last if it unnecessarily delays the restoration of democratic rule. Like the politicians on trial, the present rulers could also face a test of their integrity in the coming months. They can come out clean only if they keep their commitment to hold the elections by the end of the year. Once they have put the electoral reforms in place, they should return to the people their lost freedoms.

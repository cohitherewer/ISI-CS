                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Angry young men                  
	Sir  The Calcutta High Court should look into the cause of frequent hooliganism and violence in educational institutions across the state (Class struggle, then and now, March 27). The fact that the children of ministers are disrupting the normal functioning of colleges with their brand of student politics, depriving thousands of bona fide students of their right to attend classes, cannot be condoned. The police seem to be working only to protect the interests of these privileged children. The fact is that these girls and boys are getting publicity because of the names they carry. But they must remember that educational institutions are not party offices; hence, they would have to abide by the law of the land. The heads of these institutions should be able to sort out problems involving students without having to seek the intervention of the police. The law courts should step in to prevent politicians from extending their influence into educational institutes.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

                
	Sir  Though the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has been in power in West Bengal for over 30 years, its student wing, the Students Federation of India has been unable to gain ground in Presidency College of late. It has also been losing its hold in some other colleges. Even in Jawaharlal Nehru University last year, the SFI suffered an embarrassing defeat. The prime reason for this was their foolish attempt to try and justify the events at Nandigram.           
	Much of student politics and elections in politically conscious colleges such as Presidency is determined by peer pressure, rather than by awareness or ideology. It is unfortunate that an institution of the stature of Presidency College, which has produced eminent leaders in the past, is now struggling to maintain its political standard and identity.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Oishik Bagchi, Gandhinagar 

                
	Sir  The Bengal Engineering amp; Science University, Shibpur, appears to be suffering from a mysterious ailment that remains undiagnosed. Student violence in the campus has escalated in the past few months, thereby showing the declining standards in the universitys standards.           
	The rise in violence in Besu is a disgrace, both for the members of the academia as well as for students. It is shameful that a group of unruly students have been allowed to cripple the premier institutions functioning. The authorities need to take some bold steps to arrest the slide in Besus standards. They should start by restoring order and discipline among the students. The future of students and the reputation of the institute must not be compromised. Shutting down the campus or deferring examinations cannot be considered as correct measures to improve the current situation.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Careless          
	Sir  Hospitals are meant to provide specialized care to patients. Therefore, the news that Satyendra Mohan Roychowdhury was denied treatment by the Calcutta Medical College Hospital for nine days after he suffered a hip fracture in an accident comes as a shock (Alone and too ill to leave, hospital blind, March 30). Are the authorities at CMCH unaware that it is the prerogative of every health centre to provide its services to those in need of them? It is also astonishing that no voluntary organization came forward to help Roychowdhury in his plight. Do these organizations exist merely for the sake of heavy donations and elaborate publicity stunts? The deliberate negligence of patients in government-run hospitals has gone on for far too long. The government must look into the matter and ensure that such inhuman treatment of the sick and the aged is not repeated.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S.A. Rahman Barkati, Calcutta

                
	Sir  What form of cruelty prompts professional caregivers to abandon an aged patient? The doctors of a government hospital refused to offer food or relief to Satyendra Mohan Roychowdhury, who has been rendered immobile after an accident. Such a vile act is unthinkable, even more so because it occurred inside a hospital. One wonders whether Roychowdhury would have been treated differently if he had money as well as a family. Isnt it time Calcuttans protested against the indifferent attitude of health employees?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Chitra Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that the media now have to play good Samaritan to those who have been deprived of care. The Telegraph did a commendable job by highlighting Satyendra Mohan Roychowdhurys sufferings at a hospital. The government should ensure that the errant doctors do not get away with the crime of neglecting an elderly patient.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Vineeta Trivedi, Howrah

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Protest March
                                                                                                                 PROTEST MARCH                                                    
	China would do anything to forget the curtain-raiser to the Beijing Olympics. Only months before the games are to start, Tibetan monks and lay demonstrators in Lhasa and its surrounding provinces have retrained the spotlight on Tibet and forced the government into a corner. The agitation  which coincides with the 49th anniversary of a similar protest on the eve of the Dalai Lamas exile and the re-election of Hu Jintao as the Chinese president  has been violent. The demonstrators have turned their anger on sections of the local population, especially on Han-Chinese migrants, who are seen as tools in the hands of a government trying to dilute Tibetan unity and culture through the settlement of non-indigenous populations, and the chief beneficiaries of its much-advertized economic drive. The reaction of the government, given its famed intolerance of dissidence, has been along expected lines. From the news coming out of this strictly-monitored area, it is evident that several have already died and the number of the dead could increase if Tibetans keep at it. It is not without reason that the Dalai Lama has preached restraint, both on the part of the demonstrators and the Chinese authorities. It is quite another matter if his voice will be heard in the turmoil.        
	The agitation, if sustained despite its severe costs, will not only continue to inconvenience the Chinese government, but also the international community which now accepts Tibet as a part of China. Most countries have urged the Chinese government to reconsider its policies with respect to Tibet. In the coming days, they may find themselves being forced to step up their rhetoric on the need to reach a more tangible solution to the problem. This was a perfect occasion for India to use the Tibetan card against its most powerful regional adversary that does not miss any opportunity to needle it on territorial rights or so-called diplomatic transgressions. Unfortunately, India seems a victim to the same lack of vigour that has seen it repeatedly concede to Chinas attempt to control economic and political initiatives in the region, be it through the role of the observer or of a direct player. Indias efforts to prevent Tibetans from demonstrating in the national capital should also be seen in this light. Yet, as the largest democracy in the region and an emergent economic power, India cannot afford to lose sight of its responsibility of keeping the dragon on a tight leash.

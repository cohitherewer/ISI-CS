	Climate change is a reality that has begun to overwhelm us all, but, unfortunately, political leaders and corporate giants, keen on exploiting potential markets regardless of the hazardous consequences, are deliberately stalling urgent corrective measures that could be put in place immediately to stem the rot. To think that enlightened businessmen in India want to continue aping the thoughtless growth patterns in the West (which is beginning to reassess its earlier models of growth and development using contentious energy sources) makes one want to scream in order to force them to address these real problems that are bound to threaten future generations.
    
	Carbon emissions are low in India compared to the West. However, it is imperative that our governments and scientists work towards switching from traditional energy sources to alternative modes of clean power. Instead, we seem to want to look the other way and pretend all is well since we have not reached the danger levels that are prevalent in the western world. This is our opportunity to lead the way. We should be playing an active and innovative role in ensuring that the world learns to follow systems that are linked to the needs and demands of our environment and that nurture and conserve mankind.
    
	India has a veritable fund of knowledge-based legacy industries that are dormant because we have structured our development on alien models, destroying tried-and-tested methods that had put us on the map as a society that had absorbed the best from diverse cultures, philosophies and scientific experiments. We were masters at sharing knowledge and techniques in all spheres of growth. We were great builders, skilled artisans, acute thinkers and versatile inventors. This expertise was suppressed by the colonial power that was disconnected with the intrinsic traditions of the land it ruled.
        
	For a better life
    
	After Independence, our leaders followed the colonial system and based the principles of governance on fundamentals that exploited the strengths of the people. India thus slid back deeper into depravation. Now that the world has begun to questions its own perceptions of development, admitting failure in many fundamental spheres, we have an opportunity to take up, once again, the challenge to conserve our planet. We could be the manufacturing base for alternative solutions to generate energy and power using natural resources. The unemployed youth in this country could also be made a part of the process of sustainable development. This can transform our economy into a viable entity that can deal with the tribulations of an uncertain future.
    
	Here is thus another chance to bring about a substantially better socio-economic reality. However, unless India empowers its elected representatives and demands that they deliver, instead of indulging in predictable rhetoric and slogan- mongering, this country will continue to descend into penury, a poverty that affects the economic as well as the intellectual sphere.
    
	And, let us not forget that without thinking carefully about the many time-bound correctives that need to be put into place, we shall continue to slip into a quagmire that could well suffocate us within the next decade. It is the responsibility of both the political class and the people of India to come together in a determined effort to build a responsive and inclusive mechanism to rectify a flagging democratic process, which has glossed over the indignities that a majority of our people have had to endure for long.
    
	Will the generation that dominates our polity today  the young men and women who aspire for a better life  be able to turn the course of history by providing solutions that will respect and nurture the earth and its environment for their children?

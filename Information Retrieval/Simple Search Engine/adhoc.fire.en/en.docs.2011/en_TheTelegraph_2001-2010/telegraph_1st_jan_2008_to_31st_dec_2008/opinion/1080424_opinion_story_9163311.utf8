	Still waiting                  
	Sir  The Supreme Court of India has for long introduced a system of scrutiny of all petitions filed. The flaws, if any, are supposed to be displayed on its website so that these could be rectified swiftly. Once a petition is okayed by court officials, it is numbered, listed and moved further along in the process of finally being presented to the judge for a hearing.          
	I filed a review petition on February 5, 2008, under diary number 3547. It has been two-and-a-half months now, but www.judis.nic.in, the official website of the Supreme Court, is still displaying my petition as being under scrutiny. This is ironic because the time permitted to file a review petition is one month, and any delay must be explained to the court in writing. So an individual living thousands of miles away gets one month to engage a suitable lawyer, consult him at his convenience, draft the petition and arrange to have it filed. On the other hand, court officials, who have only to turn the pages of the copy to find faults and put the same up on the website to notify petitioners, have been allowed unlimited time to do so. The procedure causes enormous delay in the correction of errors, the listing of the case and the setting of the date for hearing, for which one has to queue up. Something must be done to expedite the process of scrutiny so that those who seek justice are saved from harassment.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Rage against the machine          
	Sir  Bus drivers seldom drive carefully because they never get penalized for their recklessness. In the event of an accident resulting in a death, the driver can only be booked for a maximum of two years or be let off with a fine under section 304A of the Indian Penal Code (death due to negligence, not amounting to culpable homicide). The victims get a hefty compensation under the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal or under different sections of the Motor Vehicles Act of 1988. Since each of these public transport vehicles is insured, in most cases, it is the insurance company that shells out the compensation amount to the victims or their heirs. Most of these insurance companies are owned by the government, so it all boils down to the compensation being paid indirectly by taxpayers. If section 304A of the IPC is made a non-bailable offence and the punishment for it is rigorous imprisonment for seven years, then things would change dramatically. The Motor Vehicles Act must also be amended to make owners of vehicles liable to pay part of the compensation in case of an accident.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Since the government cannot be expected to take steps to improve the woeful state of Calcuttas roads, commuters must accept the injuries they sustain during their travel by road as acts of god. Not long ago, passengers had taken the law into their own hands and beaten up a bus driver and two conductors for speeding (Passengers rough up racing driver and crew, April 9). There should be more of such pro-active participation from the public, given that the polices hands are tied when it comes to punishing errant drivers. Highhandedness on the part of the authorities may force bus drivers to go on a strike and cripple public transport. But this should not deter the police from cancelling licences for rash driving. If adopted strictly, this step might force bus drivers to behave responsibly from the fear of losing their livelihood.           
	Yours faithfully,       
H.P. Mitra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court has pleaded helplessness in curbing the rising rate of road accidents (Plainspeak on road safety, April 12). The government is doing nothing to protect the lives of citizens. Commuters will thus remain victims of greedy bus operators and irresponsible drivers and conductors, as well as of contractors who guzzle funds provided for the improvement of roads.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Surajit Das, Calcutta

                
	Sir  On an average day, a bus driver spends 13 hours on the road, constantly haunted by the threat that another bus will pick up his share of passengers and that he will lose the chance to earn his commission amount. The employment terms of bus employees should be reviewed. Owners, as well as employees, should be held equally responsible for accidents, instead of putting the blame entirely on the latter.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The attempts of women from villages of Rajasthan to make their daughters more self-reliant is commendable (Turning tide: Speak up, girl child (April 8). Remarkably not only the attitude of mothers but also that of fathers towards their daughters has changed. This, hopefully, would lessen criminal practices such as female foeticide.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Vineeta Trivedi, Howrah

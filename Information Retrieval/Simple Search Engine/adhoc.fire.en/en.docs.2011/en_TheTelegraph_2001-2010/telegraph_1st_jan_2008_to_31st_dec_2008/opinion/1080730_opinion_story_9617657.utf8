	The commonest pastime of Indian politicians in any serious situation is to indulge in conspiracy theories. It gives them a bizarre sense of security by allowing them to shrug off responsibility. What they do not seem to realize is the irresponsibility that goes with peddling conspiracy theories. The latest of such theories has come from Sushma Swaraj, a firebrand leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party. According to Ms Swaraj, the bomb blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad were deliberately caused to divert attention from the cash-for-votes scandal and they were an attempt to win over the Muslim votes that got alienated because of the governments unequivocal support to the Indo-US nuclear deal. The logic, if any, behind Ms Swarajs allegations is so ridiculous that it does not merit any discussion or even condemnation. What cannot be passed over is the mindset that Ms Swaraj has exhibited. Bombs have been exploded in Indias two major cities, lives have been lost, property damaged and people injured, and all that a leader of Ms Swarajs stature can think of is how the events can be used to score a point or two against the government. What can be more shameful and irresponsible than this?        
	What Ms Swaraj does not realize is that she has trivialized an extremely grave matter. The bomb blasts represent a threat to the entire nation. They are not isolated occurrences, but part of a pattern that has a long history. There exists enough evidence to suggest that the bomb blasts are part of a plot hatched outside India and executed within India by extremist groups. It is also clear what the blasts are aiming to do: they are trying to create a sense of panic and terror in India, that, they hope, will vitiate the investment climate and thus hinder Indias economic growth and development. This is not quite the situation which a politician of Ms Swarajs seniority should use to score points against her political rivals. There are situations when the country should be placed before petty vested interests. It is significant that Ms Swaraj is the only political leader to have adopted this line of thinking. The situation demands not division and bickering but unity and action. As a responsible opposition party, the BJP should ask questions about the accountability of the intelligence agencies that fail, again and again, to pre-empt blasts. The BJP should not encourage Ms Swaraj and her line of thinking.

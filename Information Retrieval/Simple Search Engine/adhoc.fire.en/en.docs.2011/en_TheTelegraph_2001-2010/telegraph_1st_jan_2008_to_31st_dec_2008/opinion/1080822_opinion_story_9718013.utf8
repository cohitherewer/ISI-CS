	Local into global                  
	Sir  Chandrashekhar Dasgupta is convinced that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has put itself in jeopardy by taking the untimely decision of withdrawing support from the United Progressive Alliance government (The deal revisited, Aug 12). But actually it is the Congress, which has made a heavy compromise with its lofty ideals by teaming up with a bunch of opportunistic political groups like the Samajwadi Party. True, the Congress eventually defied the Leftist demand and let go of the alliance, but it took more than a year to do so. In the end, it had to stoop to win favour of regional parties. It is commendable that the CPI(M) finally took the decision to part ways and regained its identity in Indian politics.          
	Yours faithfully,       
N.K. Jha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The deal revisited is full of pithy analysis. But the most striking point made by it, I think, is about the involvement of regional parties in foreign policy matters. Historically and traditionally, the shape of national politics has been determined by local politics, and to an extent, by parochialism  more so now, with the increasing power of the regional parties. However, the major drawback of these parties is that they fail to put forward a concrete, well-informed view about a global issue. Perhaps they think that foreign policy is to be determined by the Centre alone. But in this age of globalization, the foreign policy of countries must be more inclusive, and based on a broad consensus and collective involvement of the regional constituents. It is a good sign that the Congress has absorbed such local groups in its corpus to carry forward the nuclear deal rather than giving in to Leftist demands. It must, however, be ensured that the participation of regional parties at the Centre goes beyond the petty interests of securing one or two ministerial positions.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Chandrashekhar Dasguptas suggestion about the involvement of regional political parties in foreign policy matters is pragmatic, but not realistic in the context of Indias political culture. In a country where narrow personal interests have always overridden national issues, Dasgupta seems to be harbouring a somewhat exaggerated hope. How can he expect provincial leaders with little education to have a learned opinion on global issues that are probably beyond their comprehension?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Forgotten first          
	Sir  Ashoke V. Desais International steal (Aug 12) provides an insightful analysis of the role of the Tatas in the history of Indian industry. The year 2007 marked the centenary year of steel-making in India. The Tatas are indeed pioneers in commercial production of steel in India. But in our enthusiasm to hail the Tatas we seem to forget that steel was first produced in India in 1904, three years before the successful steel production by the house of the Tatas. In 1870, an enterprising British metallurgist, James Erskin, started the iron-making venture at Kulti, named Bengal Iron Works, with two small open-top furnaces. In 1880-81, the company was taken over by the public works department under the secretary of state for India to ensure a steady supply of civic amenities castings. These were in high demand in Europe, which was undergoing mass-scale urbanization, spurred by industrialization.           
	The government carried on the business as Burrakar Iron Works. This, in fact, is the first available record of industrialization in India. After about ten years, in 1890, the venture was handed over to a new company, the Bengal Iron amp; Steel Company Ltd, and a lease was granted to it for 999 years by the secretary of state for India. For a brief period, the company was under the managing agency of Hoare Miller amp; Company. In 1892, the managing agency was transferred to Martin amp; Co. It was under this agency that the company flourished and made history in 1904, when it successfully manufactured steel for the first time in India. The raw materials, though of a quality inferior to what is used today, were available within a carting distance of 10 kilometers from the plant  iron ore from Kulti, Raidih and Mahatodih, coal from Kendwah Colliery and limestone from Raghunathpur mouza adjoining Kulti. Unfortunately, Kulti could not bask for very long in the glory of its achievement. With the dumping of cheap steel from England, its steel-making lost viability, and Kulti became just an iron-manufacturing unit, and remained so till the mid-1950s. In the euphoria around the centenary year of Indias steel-making, Kulti deserves, at least, to be footnoted as a vanquished hero.

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The fact that the Chinese faked parts of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games only goes to reveal the care, precision and meticulous planning with which a totalitarian state with dubious human rights records works to impress the West.

	Terminal trouble                  
	Sir  It was unfortunate that a passenger fell and hurt himself gravely in the dirty toilet of the Calcutta airport where employees had gone on strike (Skidding on strike puddle, air passenger cracks skull in city, March 13). This further tarnishes Calcuttas image as a city with no work culture. Do these striking employees have no concern for the citys progress? This would have been a good time for Mamata Banerjee and other opposition leaders to win support by sending volunteers to help passengers stranded at the Calcutta airport. How can the Opposition ever hope to oust the Left from power in the state if it cannot cash in on these opportunities?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Benu Kumar Bose, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Since airports are national properties, decisions about them can only be taken by the government. The employees, who are mere wage earners, should not be allowed to pressurize the government with strikes. Airports are meant to serve the interests of passengers and not that of the employees. If, for the sake of proper functioning of these places, it becomes necessary to fire some incompetent people, then that should be done for the sake of millions who would be benefited by the improved quality of service. Those who went on strike at several Indian airports recently should have been made to understand that their jobs depend on their efficiency and not on their ability to stall operations at their place of work.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The business of air travel is flourishing everywhere. For this reason, airports across the world  many of them several times bigger than the airports at Hyderabad or Bangalore  have been expanding and upgrading their facilities. As Indias infotech hub, it is important that Bangalore does not lag behind. Bangalores new international airport will reportedly have the capacity to handle upwards of 10 million passengers everyday. However, the privatization and launch of the new airport have been mired in controversy for a long time. The airport officials must ensure that the objections put forward by the Airport Authority of India and the Air Traffic Control Tower are addressed before the airport begins commercial operations. Instead of politicizing every development issue, politicians and bureaucrats should take a more professional approach, keeping in mind the interests of the nation.           
	Yours faithfully,      
N. Narasimhan, Bangalore

                
	Sir  It is surprising that the Bangalore International Airport has not been named after a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family. How did Bangalore escape, considering that the Hyderabad airport had to name itself after Rajiv Gandhi. One loses count of the number of yojanas named after the Nehru-Gandhis. Football and cricket stadiums have not been spared either. Surely Hyderabad has produced enough worthy men and women to name its airport after? Shouldnt they be given a chance?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

                
	Sir  The authorities of the Bangalore International Airport Limited have stated that the Hyderabad airport is fraught with danger, because of the multiplicity of uses it is put to  including defence research and testing  apart from handling commercial flights. BIAL seems to have forgotten that the Hyderabad airport has been in operation for several years now. Its performance has been above par and the few accidents involving commercial aircraft have, in most cases, been attributed to pilot error. BIAL, which is yet to take off itself, has no business casting aspersions on an established airport like Hyderabad. The decision to close operations at the Hyderabad airport is not logical, at least not until services can be transferred to the new airport. One wonders what prompted the decision.          
	Another of BIALs contentions has been that having airports close to each other will be dangerous for air traffic. This claim does not hold ground. All over the world, particularly in the United States of America and Europe, there are airports in almost every small town, and big cities sometimes have three to five airports, all within a few kilometres of each other. If it works for them, why should it not work for us?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Not guilty          
	Sir  Women in India are often tortured or killed for giving birth to girls. But the truth is that it is not the mother, but the father whose chromosome determines the sex of a foetus. This needs to be communicated effectively through the media. Otherwise, tragedies such as the one in Howrah in which a woman threw her two baby girls into a tank inside Belur Math would continue to take place (Daughters drowned to escape taunts, March 7).          
	Some years ago, an NGO named Jeevika had tried to explain the fathers role in the reproductive process through plays scripted jointly by Jeevikas volunteers and village women. They were staged in villages of South 24-Parganas on International Womens Day and were a great success. The women, many of whom were barely literate, became aware and passed on the knowledge to their families and friends. I know this because I was present at one such play in Khariberia. Subsequent inquiries from the organizers also proved that this indeed was true.          
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FROM RICHES TO RAGS                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Pontification on the international economic crisis has been indulged in ad nauseam for the last many days and the prognosis of doom has invaded urban, privileged India as well, particularly that section of society which fled from these shores looking greedily for quick money and rapid upward mobility, working as engineers overseas! Those young Indian men and women who suddenly became millionaires  flaunting their newly acquired wealth, wrapped in luxury brands looking uncomfortable but wanting to show off their social arrival  have fallen flat on their noses. Finally, the stark reality of rootless, uncultured growth, without the fundamentals and a solid foundation in place, has taken centre stage as it stands naked and exposed for what it is, and now, a gradual, steady correction process will hopefully begin. Liberal education and a comprehension of culture and tradition are essential ingredients for healthy, stable growth and change. That is clear now.        
	It had to happen the way it did. The inflated bubble had to burst. It was an unreal, insane boom and its many manifestations were, more often than not, gross. India will be impacted by this terrible upheaval but has the cushion and economic resilience that will protect it from an uncontrollable, overwhelming dilution and decline. It is time to respect and bring into play a sense of care, restraint and austerity, become more conscious of wasteful expenditure and work to curtail the suffocating materialism that has become the mantra of a growing middle-class, one that has been cloning the Great American Dream.        
	However, what is even more disturbing in India is the political scene as it unveils itself with each passing day. Political leadership is abysmal. Mamata Banerjee and Mayavati, Chiranjeevi and Naveen Patnaik, the Bajrang Dal and other extremists, old, seasoned but failed, Congressmen and women, predictable BJP/RSS leaders, infirm horses of the Left are all involved in the destruction of the ethos of this fine civilization.                 
	Mixed record        
	Jockeying for short-term power and personal gain, these leaders of nearly a quarter of the worlds population are inept and intellectually unqualified to rule civil society. They have failed the people, exploited the patience and the goodwill of the poor, created divisive vote banks, turned a blind eye to brutal killings and inhuman assaults brought on by their policies of divide and remain in power. India and Bharat are paying a huge price, as the subcontinent enters its phase of societal disruption and civil breakdown.        
	The ruling United Progressive Alliance has had a good report card. It has brought many necessary acts and decisions into play, ranging from the employment guarantee scheme to the Right to Information Act. The signing of the Indo-US nuclear deal has given India a new prestige in global politics. Equally, there is much that did not happen. Senior Congressmen worked against their own prime minister because he did not indulge in their old and archaic brand of political manipulation. Congressmen and women, who were not part of the council of ministers, and the key players within the party, threatened and insecure about their future, deviously stalled all that would have added value to their party.        
	That same lot are mortified by the emergence of the Rahul Gandhi factor. The only saving grace is that the advisors are using their stale tactics to sabotage the young man behind his back as they bow and scrape in front of him. They can see that their days are numbered. Sadly, hypocrisy remains embedded in the bulk of Congress leaders. They need to be gradually purged. Ironically, if a third front rules from the capital after the general elections of 2009, the Congress will, most certainly, enter its phase of systemic change, renewal and grow into a new avatar.

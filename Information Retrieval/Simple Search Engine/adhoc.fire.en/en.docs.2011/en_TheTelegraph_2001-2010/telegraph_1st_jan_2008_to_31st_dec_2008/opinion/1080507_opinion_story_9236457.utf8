	Time is money
    A mans pension was withheld because disciplinary proceedings were pending. They were eventually dropped and the benefits paid to him four years after his retirement. He approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court claiming interest. The high court dismissed the case without even giving notice as there are no rules specifying that interest has to be paid for delayed pension. The Supreme Court, however, held that even in the absence of any rules, guidelines or administrative orders, interest should be paid to retired employees for delayed pension on the basis of Article 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution (S.K. Dua vs State of Haryana).                          
	Dead man talking        
	The police started a case against a man  who fatally wounded another  on the basis of the victims dying declaration. The accused was convicted of murder on the testimony of eyewitnesses. He appealed, contending that since no FIR had been lodged against him, the police could not start a case. Upholding the conviction, the Supreme Court ruled that a declaration dictated by the deceased  on which he had put his thumb impression after it had been read out to him can be treated as an FIR and acted upon. There was also enough evidence to prove that the victim was in his senses and capable of speech, so there was no reason to discard the declaration, the court ruled (Dharam Pal vs State of UP).                            
	Faithless wife        
	A man filed for divorce because his wife had converted to another religion. The family court advocated reconciliation but the man appealed against it. The Kerala High Court pointed out according to the amendment made to the Hindu Marriage Act in 1984, it is the duty of the court to attempt reconciliation in every divorce suit. The Act also provides for machinery such as counselling centres and counsellors for this purpose. Directing the family court to proceed afresh, the high court held that persons of different faith can have a happy marital life and marital ties should not be broken merely by reason of conversion (Bini vs Sundaram K.V.).       SOLON

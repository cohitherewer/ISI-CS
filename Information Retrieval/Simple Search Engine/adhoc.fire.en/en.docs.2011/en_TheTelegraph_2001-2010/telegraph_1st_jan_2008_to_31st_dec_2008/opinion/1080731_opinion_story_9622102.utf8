	Breach of trust                  
	Sir  In the aftermath of the trust vote, it has become evident that apart from the Left  which expelled the speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, unceremoniously for not falling in with the party line  the Bharatiya Janata Party too was wrecked by dissent from within. While the Congress ensured that its whip was followed across the board, the BJP had nine dissenting or abstaining members of parliament, whose turnaround decided the verdict in favour of the United Progressive Alliance government. It is likely that the BJP floor managers presumed unconditional allegiance from all its MPs and thus did not feel it worth mobilizing them against the UPA. Had these nine voted with the rest of the party, it would have been a really close call for the government.           
	Mamata Banerjees decision to abstain from voting is mysterious, since her innings with the National Democratic Alliance has been long and colourful. Here again, the BJP failed to convince her to support it. As the general elections approach, the BJP needs to get its act together and make sure that it convert opportunities into victories.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa 

                
	Sir  With reference to the editorial, Slipped the whip (July 25), it needs to be pointed out that people who subscribe to the ideology of a political party are expected to vote in accordance with the policies set by it. If an MP or a member of the legislative assembly differs from his party line, he should resign and join a new party. The editorial tries in vain to justify the victory of the UPA government using the argument of conscience voting. But in reality, an MP or an MLA by voting against the wishes of his or her party, lets down hundreds of people who, in the first place, have voted him to his seat.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Janardan Choubey, Jamshedpur

                
	Sir  First, the BJP expelled nine of its MPs for either cross-voting or abstaining from the trust vote. Then, L.K. Advani, the partys prime ministerial candidate, said that had this sorry episode not happened, the UPA would have lost its majority. He went on to blame it all on the money power of the present government. Yet, it is a mystery how he expected the public to buy these pitiful laments when the truth is that his party did not do its homework properly. It seems as if the BJP was too complacent in its strength and had fantasized too much about the imminent fall of the UPA. Besides, the dreadful hash the party made of the bribery case shows how nave and insincere its strategies have been.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Santosh Adhikary, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  Swapan Dasgupta pays a left-handed compliment to the Congress and the UPA allies for winning the trust vote when he cynically adds the rider, If ethics, morality, propriety and ordinary decencies have to be kept aside... (Cash for votes, July 25). The credibility of Indian political parties, especially of the Congress, after the trust vote, has been irreparably tarnished. A Washington Post correspondent wryly commented that even by Indian standards, it was bad. Indian politics has become a no-holds-barred affair, providing a fast track to amassing wealth. Nearly a fourth of the total number of MPs have faced criminal charges at one time or the other, including income tax evasion, embezzlement, rape and murder, not to mention immigration and visa rackets. The squeaky clean image of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, was also soiled when he allowed convicted MPs to come out of prison to participate in the trust vote. Even a fast-growing and hawk-eyed media cannot seem to stop these endless malpractices.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Waunakee, US           
	Trial and error          
	Sir  Recently, the Supreme Court has refused a girl from Madhya Pradesh relief for falsely accusing two men of raping her (No mercy for girl who feigned rape, July 13). Strangely, the court ruled, within days, again on another case from MP, that if a woman in the tradition-bound Indian society admits of being raped, then there is in-built assurance in her confession that the charge is genuine rather than fabricated (Rape claim enough: SC, July 17). Perhaps it would be more prudent to accept that an Indian woman is as likely to be corrupt as a man and can take recourse to unethical means to fulfil vested interests. The men, in the first case, were lucky to get acquittal after spending eight years in jail for absolutely no fault of theirs, but there are a number of men languishing in prisons after being framed in rape cases.           
	A victim of rape should be given unconditional support by the administration and the judiciary, and a convicted rapist should be awarded the highest possible punishment. But would it be wise to accept the testimonial of an alleged rape victim as genuine ab initio, until substantiated with evidence? If the accusation turns out to be false, the authorities can wash their hands of the blunder by setting free the accused (after several years), but who will compensate the losses, both tangible and intangible, to the falsely implicated man, who, by the time he earns his release, has lost precious years of his life, his means of livelihood, dignity and place in society?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

                
	A clarification          
	Sir  The report, Relief boss shifted (July 25), warrants some clarification. Atanu Purakayastha, principal secretary, food processing industries and horticulture department, was earlier secretary, agriculture department, when the department of disaster management was entrusted to him as an additional charge. Since both the offices were located at the Writers Buildings, it was not difficult for him to look after both as secretary. On his posting as principal secretary, at the end of last year, it became difficult for him to attend both the offices one being located at the Writers Buildings and the other in Salt Lake. Moreover, he was nominated by the government of India for a course at Royal Institute of Public Administration, London, starting from June 30, 2008, which would have kept him away from the country for quite sometime.          
	Considering all these factors, and in view of the critical flood situation in two districts, the government decided to post a new secretary in the disaster management department. The government has full faith in the ability, sincerity and honesty of Purakayastha and there is no complaint against him of discrepancies in the distribution of sub-standard relief materials, nor was there any occasion for the chief minister to convey his displeasure to him.          
	Yours faithfully,

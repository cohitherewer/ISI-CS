	The people of Coimbatore are seeing red. This is not because they are angry, but because red has suddenly become the most prominent colour in their city. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) is holding its 19th party congress in Coimbatore, and, according to reports, the city is draped in red flags. It is a remarkable phenomenon that even though in most parts of what was once the communist world, communism has not only collapsed but is also a reviled ideology, the CPI(M) marches on in West Bengal, and walks on in Kerala. In the rest of India, it limps, but that is another story. Its strength in West Bengal and Kerala permits the CPI(M) to hold the United Progressive Alliance government at ransom, and also to continue spouting the message of a communist revolution. However bizarre all this might appear, it cannot be denied that while communism has collapsed in Russia and in eastern Europe, the CPI(M) has remained in power in West Bengal for over three decades.        
	This long stint in power has not been possible through a revolution, nor has it engendered a revolution. The CPI(M) has through choice participated in the democratic process, and used the process, at times somewhat unfairly, to its own advantage. Its use of the power it enjoys has not always been very democratic: it has used violence and cadre power unashamedly whenever it has suited its interests to do so. Notwithstanding all this, the CPI(M)s tenure in government has very few parallels.        
	A communist partys complete immersion in electoral politics has been the subject of interminable debates within the CPI(M). Indeed, when the latter broke from the parent party, the Communist Party of India, in the early Sixties, one of the issues was that the CPI was too close to the electoral process and therefore getting increasingly distant from an armed revolution. The CPI(M) opted for the path of half-partisan warfare, a combination of elections and revolution. The latter has now become a part of the rhetoric of the CPI(M), while the former is entrenched in practice. This tension prevails because the CPI(M) wavers constantly between ideology and realism.        
	The realism is engendered by the compulsions of holding office in West Bengal. The leadership in West Bengal has been forced to recognize that it cannot remain shackled to an obsolete ideology, and that the absence of economic development could easily erode its political dominance. The CPI(M)s policies in the state have thus witnessed a radical shift towards actively encouraging capitalism and investment. Yesterdays enemies have become todays friends. But the partys central leadership in New Delhi remains wedded to the ideology of anti-capitalism, anti-globalization and so on. It is inevitable that this apparent contradiction will come up for discussion in the party congress. It may not be possible to contain this contradiction in what the apparatchiki perversely call dialectics.

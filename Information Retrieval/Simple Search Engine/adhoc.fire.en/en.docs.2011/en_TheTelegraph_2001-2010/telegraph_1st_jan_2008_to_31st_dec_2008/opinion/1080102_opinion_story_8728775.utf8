                 Sumanta Sen
               
	AKG Bhavan in New Delhi or Muzaffar Ahmed Bhavan in Calcutta may shudder at the thought, but it has to be said that the Gujarati pride tagline on which Narendra Modi won the election in the state was an echo of a similar slogan, which Jyoti Basu had raised in the mid-Eighties. And, as in Gujarat, the slogan had paid off handsomely for his party in West Bengal.
    
	Basu had raised the slogan to campaign against the Centres stepfatherly treatment of West Bengal, and to urge Bengalis to rise in protest against the Congress. The Congresss claim that the polls in West Bengal were being rigged was contested by Basu as being insulting to the people of his state. Bengal responded favourably and the Left Front returned to office for a third consecutive term.
    
	The charge of rigging continues. Indeed, with time, it has become more strident even though the Election Commission has never found proof of it. The Oppositions insistence on making the accusation has merely strengthened the leftists stance that it has no faith in the people and chooses to insult their judgement. 
    
	The same thing happened in Gujarat. Since 2002, the Bharatiya Janata Partys opponents have been harping on Godhra, the riots and communalism. Even after the results of the Gujarat elections, Sitaram Yechury of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) called Modis win a victory of communal forces, thereby playing into Modis hands, who has always used this charge to tell Gujaratis, I am your elected representative, by insulting me they are actually insulting you, hurting your pride. Surely, he would say that again if the charge is repeated.
        
	Same fate
    
	Kapil Sibal, the Congress leader who also toed Yechurys line, should have realized that the timing of such a move was inappropriate for his party. With the reopening of the case against Jagdish Tytler, the killings of Sikhs in the capital in 1984 have come to the forefront once again. Sibal should remember that the victims had not died in a riot. It was a pogrom that some Congress leaders had unleashed on the Sikhs. Not a single Hindu had died then, unlike in Gujarat where Hindus died along with Muslims, albeit in far lesser numbers. It must also be remembered that the police in Gujarat had not been entirely inactive, unlike the cops in New Delhi.
    
	It is strange that Yechury and his party have forgotten West Bengal and Basus tactics in that state. The leftists seem to have also forgotten the fact that in the last 60 years states ruled by the Congress have seen many more riots than when ruled by other parties. But that is a different story.
    
	Meanwhile, strange though it may sound, Bengals chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, may take heart from Modis victory. In his campaign, Modi also talked about development, and that is exactly the issue which his counterpart in Bengal sees as a sure way to electoral success. There are many in the party who are not comfortable with the idea of large-scale private sector investment, and Bhattacharjee can now tell them to take a lesson from Gujarat.The urban middle-class may not be convinced of the feasibility of Bhattacharjees plans for industrialization. In Gujarat too, results in central districts reflected a similar scepticism. But the rural areas thought otherwise and the script should not be different in rural Bengal. 
    
	Another similarity between Modi and Bhattacharjee is their capacity to look beyond traditional industries for new investment. Bhattacharjee should also hope that his detractors will learn a lesson from Keshubhai Patels fall on his home turf. Modi was branded as a merchant of death. Bhattacharjee was condemned in much the same way for Nandigram. But Modi had the last laugh in Gujarat and, three years from now, Bhattacharjee may also have the same satisfaction.

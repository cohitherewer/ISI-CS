	Rashbehari Avenue is one of the few streets in Calcutta that have not changed beyond recognition from what they were like during my childhood. Sometimes on my way back from work, I get off the Metro at Kalighat and walk slowly down Rashbehari towards home. These walks, because few and far between, are always a luxury of looking and thinking and remembering  especially the homely Bengaliness of the little shops selling outmoded underwear, and the pavement bookstalls. During such a walk a few days back, my eyes fell on a brightly coloured book in one of the stalls, and like Prousts madeleine dipped in tea, this bookcover instantly spun out in my brain a deliciously complicated web of times lost and found. This was a childrens book in Bengali, called Tutu-Bhutu. It had a kitten and a puppy in boys clothes on the cover, dancing a jig with their arms on each others shoulders and a look of tongues-out, kindergarten sauciness on their faces.         
	I looked at the back cover  something I had never thought of doing as a child, when the book was one of the staples of my reading  and discovered that the writer and illustrator was called Dhiren Baul, and the book, now in its 19th reprint, was first published in 1959. Between the image on the front cover and the facts on the back, lay one of those ghostly-real corridors of time, like the avenue on which I had found the book, that linked adult to child in a peculiarly discontinuous continuity.        
	After buying the book, I quickened the pace of my walk back home, excited at the prospect of taking it to bed with me after dinner. Reading it again at night after all those years was a strangely disconcerting experience. The large picture on each page came back to me instantly, complete with all the fantasies I would spin around each visual detail as a child, and with every inexpressible feeling linked to each fantasy. But I had completely forgotten the story itself, the covert brutality of which struck me, as if for the first time  only an adult would feel that kind of shock. Bhutu, the kitten-boy in red dungarees, goes out to play with his furred and feathered friends, and suddenly, unaccountably, he pounces on the two little golden chickens, Chhana-Pana, and starts bloodying them with his teeth and claws. The little boy turns into a little animal, and a very real violence erupts at the heart of this beast fable. If little animals that are like little boys can actually start behaving like little animals, then do little boys also have little animals within them that might suddenly come out if they are not brought up properly? To the adult me, that was what Tutu-Bhutu seemed to be about. Definitely not nice.                    
	Yet a large part of that adult me was still reading such a potentially nasty story purely through the pictures, as I must have as a child. I kept looking at the pictures, and realized the extent to which they had formed the way I experience rural Bengal now  what I actually see as well as the irrational happiness I feel when I visit a village. The lotus-filled ponds, the blue horizon beyond the green fields, the palm-groves, the coming of the rain, the large umbrellas full of little holes that people hold while walking along the river in the rain. Each picture is a window, a magic casement, that still looks out of the text into a world in which it is always afternoon.

	Tainted victory                  
	Sir  William Randolph Hearst once said that a politician will do anything to keep his job  even become a patriot. The truth of this comment was brought home during the trust vote in the Lok Sabha on July 22 (N Mohan Rules, July 23). The parliament was turned into a fish market or auction house, with money and unparliamentary language ruling the show.           
	The United Progressive Alliance had no qualms about allying with its long-standing adversary, the Samajwadi Party, for deplorably opportunistic reasons. Sordid forms of horse-trading, defection and bribery were promoted to stitch together a fragile majority. This is an ominous sign for the Indian democracy. On the other hand, the image of the Left parties, with their tall talk about secularism and principled politics, has been sullied beyond repair. Wasnt it the Left which claimed only a few days ago that the nuclear issue was being raised by the UPA to divert attention from price rise, inflation and other woes of the people?           
	This is not a constitutional and moral victory for the UPA, as claimed by the external affairs minister, Pranab Mukherjee, since the principal architects of it were the cross-voters. The lacunae in the anti-defection laws need to be plugged immediately. Power should be given to the speaker and the chief election commissioner so that a defector is not allowed to hold a ministerial berth. It is ridiculous that political parties should talk about codes of conduct for news channels when they follow no such code themselves.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sankar Lal Singh, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The editorial, Fringe play (July 24), did not reflect the true spirit of things on the day of the confidence vote. That Manmohan Singh won the vote of confidence is a fact nobody can deny. But since the UPAs figure of 275 (266 votes were cast against the motion) include 10 by way of cross-voting, it would be wise not to get into the legitimacy of the result. It is clear that with no cross-voting, the government would have been down by 11 votes and the result would have been 265 for and 276 against the motion. So what the result essentially reveals is that members of parliament were on sale, and that the Bharatiya Janata Party MPs proved most purchasable. Manmohan Singhs stentorian voice had little to do with anything.           
	The prime ministers rebuke to L.K. Advani is being regarded as a high point of the proceedings. But it seemed to me that we have lost a gentleman in the bargain. Also, it is not correct to say that the BJP will remain perpetually on the fringes. Figures suggest that the BJP is the second largest party in parliament with 10 seats less than the ruling party.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Deba Pratim Ghatak, Durgapur 

                
	Sir  The trust vote was the greatest exhibition of the murder of democracy by MPs inside and outside the House. It is a shame that the UPA is actually celebrating the victory. What was the trust vote for? Was it for the spiralling food prices, unbearable power cuts, or for the secrecy in which the IAEA draft was shrouded? There were two days of acrimonious debate but the MPs were too eager to accuse one another on party lines to raise these subjects. Finally, the MPs voted, for or against the government on a document which none of them has read. Ignorance was the clear winner in this vote. The only consolation is that the nation watched the spectacle of debasement live on television.          
	Yours faithfully,      
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh 

                
	Sir  Manmohan Singh, considered by many to be the weakest prime minister of India (and called nikamma by L.K. Advani), has taken the boldest bet ever taken by any Indian prime minister and won convincingly, while exposing the bankruptcy of the BJP and the CPI(M) too. The Opposition, particularly the CPI(M), has not only lost the trust vote, but also the confidence of the nation. Singh, on the other hand, has emerged a stronger and more confident leader with pragmatism and vision. The nation would have expected the Opposition to be more graceful in defeat, and to analyse their faults. Having got rid of the Left baggage, Singh should now go all out to implement his unfinished agenda of economic reforms.          
	Yours faithfully,      
B.C. Bhowmick, Asansol

                
	Sir  Who will win the trust motion? I had been hearing this question since the morning on June 22. My father was up very early and watching TV when I entered the living room. He asked, Who will win the trust vote? I was not an MP, so how would I know? And yet I knew the answer. And the answer was that the vote would be won by someone who is better than others at deceiving Indians!           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tabrez Choudhury, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Had the BJP known that the Samajwadi Party would end up joining the ruling alliance after the communists withdrew their support, it would have decided to support the nuclear deal, thereby preventing any further expansion of the UPA. Moreover, the BJPs loss has also been Mayavatis gain. She cleverly joined the United National Progressive Alliance to take some more Dalit votes away from the BJP. The BJP seems to have shot itself in its foot by choosing to blindly oppose the nuclear deal.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Kattari Anand Naidu, Chennai

                
	Sir  It is true that the trust vote has ended one phase of political uncertainty in India, but this does not in any way mean that the prime minister will have a smooth ride with the policies he wants to implement during the rest of his term. But then is it not surprising that the Americans were first off the block to congratulate Manmohan Singh, even before the votes had been counted and the result was officially declared ? After all, not many prime ministers report to the US president.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

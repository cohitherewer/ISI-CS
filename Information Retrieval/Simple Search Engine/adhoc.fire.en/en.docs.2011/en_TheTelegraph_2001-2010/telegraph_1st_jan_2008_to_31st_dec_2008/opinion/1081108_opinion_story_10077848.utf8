The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Brief patches of shock and humour
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Brief patches of shock and humour                              Soumitra Das      VISUAL ARTS                                                
	At a first glance, Gen Next III at Aakriti Art Gallery (October 1-15) may seem to be an inspiring exhibition, what with the presence of some high-quality exhibits from countries as diverse as Italy, Poland and Austria and, of course, from India. But they contribute only a handful of artists in this vast exhibition where works of much inferior quality too have found a place. This is sad, for the artists who are good are outstandingly so, and hence the contrasting qualities are truly glaring. This is of course not done by design. The truth is that as in most exhibitions held in this city today, here too, the absence of the curator is acutely felt. Things were most likely left to chance. The works were not here by invitation. They were entries sent by the artists, and of the 800 received from all over the world, only 80 were selected.        
	Perhaps the selection process should have been more rigorous, for the two big rooms in which the works were displayed seemed overcrowded, and that too mostly with works that could have been safely removed. Who would have missed the paintings of Santosh D. Andrade from Bangalore and of Saptarshi Naskar from Noida? These exhibits were chosen arbitrarily and they have such a mass-produced look that they could have been produced anywhere and exhibited in any part of the world as well.        
	Nonetheless, the same exhibition will be remembered for the superior quality of a limited number of exhibits, mostly by foreigners. Maciej Gador from Poland is one of them, and he had two works to his credit. Gador appropriated myths and popular fairytales and created works of great beauty that are contemporaneous as well. Sower of Trees is a large inkjet print and while the myth is popular enough, Gadors complex and detailed work has given it new lease of life. Daphne-like, the sower himself is being metamorphosed into a tree. While a clock takes root, his long tresses turn into aerial roots flying in the wind. While seeds are being broadcast, birds wing around the fallow field, turning this print into a lyrical image of rejuvenation in the manner of British woodcuts with a touch of dream-time logic that lends credibility to the most illogical goings-on. His oil painting, too, has an element of fantasy that distinguishes the illustrations of Neil Gaimans graphic novels.        
	In the same league as this artist are IV Toshain from Austria and Serena Scapagnini from Italy. The first, Toshain, is a shocker who turns what could well have been an advert for a beauty product into a horrific X-ray image of the girls mouth, immediately transforming the beauty into a deaths head. She superimposes photographs of what look like malevolent witchdoctors with equally bizarre effect. The camera is as effective a tool as the pencil in the hands of this artist.        
	Fantasy spills over into a super-real world in Scapagninis works, dominated by pencils and sharpeners for Brobdingnags and a giant pair of hands ripping the cover off a secret world. This young, self-trained artist uses pencil and china ink on large sheets of paper to conjure up a fantasy world, but the precision, clarity and sharpness of her vision are amazing.         
	By contrast, the two artists who use the video as their medium  Suman Kabiraj of Calcutta and Sian Amoy of the US  are deplorably muddle-headed. Is Kabiraj documenting a pretentious dance drama? And why is Amoy so obsessed with the Howrah Bridge? Both artists seem to be unsure of their intentions and produce confused works. Anirban Das Mahapatra was the only one to exhibit photographs. His black-and-white prints are an honest documentation of a Ramlila performance.        
	But there were some other noteworthy artists from this country. Banatanwi Das Mahapatra creates non-figurative appliques. Pieces of textiles of various muted colours and shapes are stitched together in the manner of Orissa appliques to great effect. Printmaker Moutushi Chakraborty has the ability to shock with her images of a coy giantess (picture) and the kinky image of a certain unmentionable male body part depicted as a mouse, should we say. She is the only artist with something close to a sense of humour, a quality singularly absent in the other entries.

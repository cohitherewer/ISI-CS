    A man who beat another black and blue with a stick was accused by the police of causing ldquo;grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means rdquo; (under Section 326 of the Indian Penal Code). He contended that he could not be charged under that Section as he had used a stick and only a weapon used for shooting, stabbing or cutting could cause grievous hurt. Disagreeing, the Andhra Pradesh High Court held that the nature of weapon was immaterial as long as it is capable of causing death. Although, in this particular case, the stick only caused fractures, it could have led to death if it was used to strike a vital part of the body like the head (B. Chandrasekhar vs State of AP).

    A woman made a dying declaration in Hindi in front of a magistrate who, not being fluent in the language, transcribed it in English. When the case reached the court, the defendant contended that the declaration should be discarded because the very words uttered by the victim had not been recorded in it. Citing earlier decisions where dying declarations recorded with the help of a translator have also been relied upon, the Gauhati High Court held that the declaration couldn rsquo;t be rejected merely because it was recorded in another language (Bhabanand Kakaoti vs State of Meghalaya).     Cat out of the bag
    A man from whom narcotic substances had been seized contended that he had been searched in contravention of Section 50 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. This Section requires the presence of a gazetted officer or magistrate for searching a person suspected of carrying drugs. The petitioner contended that no gazetted officer or magistrate was present when he was searched by the police. The drugs were recovered from his jute bag and the Allahabad High Court held that searching a bag does not amount to a ldquo;personal rdquo; or body search. So it was not necessary for the police to comply with the requirements of Section 50 for searching a bag (Are Vijay Singh vs State of Uttar Pradesh).  SOLON

	Everything should be made simple, but not simpler. 
    
	 Albert Einstein 
       
	Good editors are language freaks and often talk about good words and bad words. That brings us to a grey but important area called usage. This is particularly important since no book in India succeeds unless it is written in simple English  or, for that matter, in any regional language. Simplicity is also important because books are written for the average reader, and never for the intelligent reader or the ignorant one. 
    
	But what is good usage? What newly minted words is it O.K. to use? And who is to judge  the author or the publishers editor? Is it O.K. to use O.K.? 
    
	Usage has no fixed boundaries. Language is a fabric that constantly changes and even experts fight over what is allowable, often reaching a decision on a wholly subjective basis such as taste. Although this leaves out the question of who our tastemakers are, some ground rules have already been established. 
    
	First of all, the written language is no longer taken as the source of authority. Proper usage means being close to the spo- ken word, which is commonly understood. Therefore sound and rhythm should inform everything that is written. The thumb rule is to write extensively by the ear and to read everything aloud before letting it out into the world. 
    
	Secondly, while there is no agreement about what words can and cannot be used, one should check the frequency of usage. Word frequency is provided in all modern dictionaries and the numerous books meant for teaching the English language. Sentences and paragraphs should be short because writing strikes the eye before it provokes thought and analysis. Short paragraphs look more inviting, whereas long chunks of words often discourage readers.
    
	Thirdly, in the Indian market at least, metaphors should be avoided as far as possible. This is a tough call because so many situations are best conveyed through metaphors. But most Ind- ian readers do not catch them; they want something simple and direct. 
    
	Fourthly, when in doubt, one should leave the bothersome bit out. Unfortunately, this solution is usually the last one that occurs to writers and editors in a jam. Their efforts to play around the problem or clarify it only make the situation worse and waste time. 
    
	But simplicity should not lead to oversimplification. Many textbook writers oversimplify complex issues to a fatal extent. When all is said and done, we need to study good writers to see how they do it. Every good book has its own integrity of content and structure that comes from clear concepts expressed in simple language.

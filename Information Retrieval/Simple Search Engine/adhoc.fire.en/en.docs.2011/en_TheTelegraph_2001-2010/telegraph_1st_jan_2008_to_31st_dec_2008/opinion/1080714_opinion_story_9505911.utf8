	Real challenge                  
	Sir  Although the editorial, Different show (July 3), highlights certain ethical issues related to talent hunts, it is silent on the greed and inhumanity that go behind the making of these programmes. Most reality shows in India began with adult participants, but, with time, even children started featuring in them. When children ape songs and dance-steps performed originally by grown-ups, the spectacle turns somewhat perverse. This kind of play-acting might increase TRP ratings and attract greater sponsorship, but it has robbed children of their child-like qualities. Parents also get vicarious pleasure from looking at their offspring taking the stage by storm. Whatever dreams of their own the adults have been unable to fulfil are dumped on the children. Understandably, the stakes on the childrens TV success are very high. Expectations do not stop with children appearing on TV. They must also win laurels. Professionals are engaged to coach them, and this results in these children mimicking routine items. They are unable to master the difficult performing arts or even appreciate them fully.           
	If these children fail, many of them face mental, if not physical, torture. If they are successful, they enjoy the limelight for a while, do stage-shows in and around their town or city, are praised by friends and then disappear from the public eye. Morever, children growing up in nuclear families are unable to cope with disappointment.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The controversy over the traumatized silence of a Class XI student following her elimination from a reality show has suddenly become national news. People have accused the judges of making immoderate comments on the young girls performance, and her father for pushing her into the state that she is now in. But is Shinjini Senguptas fate so unfamiliar or unprecedented as to raise such a hue and cry? Admittedly, a spirit of unrelenting competitiveness ruins the lives of many children these days. But young people, in general, have also become hypersensitive. They are provoked to commit suicide by the most insignificant reasons: stern rebuke by parents or at school leads to a nervous breakdown or running away from home. Cruel TV show producers or harsh judges are not the sole agents that provoke such wild steps.           
	In most cases, elders are responsible for these reactions. A regular child nowadays has to juggle many roles: from attending cricket coaching camps, dance classes, painting and music lessons to going to school and taking private tuitions. He or she is then expected to be the topper in all fields. It is difficult to guess how much satisfaction a child feels at being successful, but it is obvious that children have no option but to forego many childish pleasures in order to make their parents proud. If they fail, they are ridiculed, abused, even physically harmed  as in the case of the father who killed his son for not putting greater effort in his sports practice. It is alright to ask the judges of reality shows to be more sensitive towards the little participants, but it would be wrong to point fingers at them only. Parents need to realize that true geniuses are born with special talents. Great men and women cannot be mass-produced.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Reality shows and various competitions on television have now become cruelty shows. The judges generally come from the film industry and consider themselves to be unimpeachable. Not only do they pass sarcastic comments about the participants, they also humiliate and embarrass them. The producers of such shows ought to be more careful in selecting the judges. There should be a screening of the panel before the shows come on air.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Unfortunately, reality shows have stopped being a platform for new talent, and turned into a source of much bitterness. Influenced by foreign television shows, the Indian reality show is just a few years old but has become immensely popular. The thirst for popularity and profit has pushed young people, even toddlers, to sing and dance on television. Shinjini Sengupta appears to have been pushed by her parents to set foot on the stage; now her life is in tatters. Children today are losing their innocence very early in life and are wasting considerable time and energy preparing for an uncertain stardom. Moreover, reality shows, in order to draw audience and votes, exploit the sentiments of various ethnic communities, thereby undermining national integrity. Laws should be enforced to restrict the age-limit of the participants and emphasis should be placed on judgment based on merit rather than on public votes.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Oindrila Mondal, Siliguri

                
	Sir  There is a sophisticated way to point out the weaknesses of a performer, but reality TV judges often think otherwise. The worst victims of their rudeness are the vulnerable and young contestants. Although it makes sense to tap into the potential talent of a child but this does not mean that the child has to be put into a rat-race to win kudos from the public. Childhood is not the time to perform feats; it is reserved for studying, learning and enjoying. Young people should be encouraged to have fun participating in cultural and sporting activities without indulging in unhealthly competitions.           
	Yours faithfully,

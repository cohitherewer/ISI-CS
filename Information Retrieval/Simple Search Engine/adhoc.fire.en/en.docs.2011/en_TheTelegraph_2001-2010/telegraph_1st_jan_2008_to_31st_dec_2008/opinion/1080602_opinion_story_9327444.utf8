	What connects oil at $135 a barrel with last months discovery of huge cracks in the Ward Hunt ice shelf off Ellesmere Island at the top of Canadas Arctic archipelago? And what might connect those two things with a new, even Colder War?        
	The cracks in the ice, further evidence that the ice cover on the Arctic Ocean is melting fast, were discovered by scientists tagging along with a Canadian army snowmobile expedition that was officially called a sovereignty patrol. The army was showing the flag because Canada, like the other Arctic countries, suspects that valuable resources will become accessible there once the ice melts. And the most valuable of those resources are oil and gas.        
	If we are heading for an Arctic Ocean that is mostly ice-free in summer, then drilling for gas and oil beneath that ocean can soon begin. Hardly a week goes by without somebody pointing to the American geological surveys report that the Arctic basin contains a quarter of the worlds undiscovered oil and gas. But the event that did most to trigger this new concern about sovereignty was Artur Chilingarovs publicity stunt last summer.        
	Chilingarov is a polar explorer of the old school, but he is now deputy speaker of the Russian Duma and Vladimir Putins personal envoy to the Arctic. Last summer, he took a three-man submarine down to the bottom of the Arctic Ocean precisely at the North Pole, and planted a Russian flag in the seabed.        
	The Arctic is Russian. We must prove the North Pole is an extension of the Russian landmass, he said afterwards, and affected surprise at the fact that other countries with an Arctic coastline saw this as a challenge to their sovereignty. Canadas prime minister, Stephen Harper, for example, flew to the Arctic the following week, and subsequently announced that Canada would build six to eight new ice-strengthened warships for Arctic patrols.                 
	Fact or fiction?        
	Moscow claims that the Lomonosov Ridge, the sub-sea mountain range that goes straight across the middle of the Arctic Ocean, is an extension of the Russian territorial shelf, and therefore belongs to Russia all the way to the North Pole. Alternatively, if the Law of the Sea tribunal does not ultimately accept that claim, Moscow may have an even broader claim in reserve.        
	In the early 20th century, seven countries laid claim to parts of Antarctica on the basis of sectors: pie-shaped slices running along lines of longitude. Those claims are dormant because of a subsequent treaty banning economic development in Antarctica, but the precedent has not been forgotten. By that precedent, Russia could lay claim to about half the Arctic Ocean on the basis of lines of longitude running from the far eastern and western ends of the country up to the North Pole. In 1924, the Soviet Union did precisely that. Nobody else accepted that claim then, and they wouldnt now if Russia raised it again. But Russia has the big Arctic ports and the nuclear-powered ice-breakers to make its claim stick.        
	That is where the current panic comes from. It probably wont end up in a new Cold War, but it has certainly got the hens in the chicken coop all stirred up. As is often the case with hens, they are over-reacting. Russia is in a more assertive mood than it was a decade ago, but there are no signs that it intends to pursue its claims by force. Moreover, there is no serious basis for the claim that a quarter of the worlds undiscovered oil and gas reserves lies under the Arctic Ocean.        
	It always seemed implausible, given that the Arctic Ocean only accounts for slightly less than 3 percent of the Earths surface. Yet this factoid has gained such currency that it even influences government policy. Isnt it interesting how readily people will believe something when they really want to?

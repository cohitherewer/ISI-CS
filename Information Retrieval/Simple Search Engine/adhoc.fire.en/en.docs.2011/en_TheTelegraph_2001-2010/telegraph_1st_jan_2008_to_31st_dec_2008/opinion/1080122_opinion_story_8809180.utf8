	Immediately after Manmohan Singhs return from China, The Telegraph noted in these columns that there were some fundamental contradictions hindering any meaningful alliance and co-operation between India and China. India and China are competitors for the same space and status. Thus Indian leaders need to be extremely careful in their dealings with China. Indian policy towards China demands that the fundamental contradictions are never lost sight of, yet a relatively tension-free working relationship is put in place. This balance is, by no reckoning, an easy thing to achieve. But, as players of the realpolitik will readily admit, so far China is concerned, what is more important for India than preserving this balance is to keep national interests absolutely on the top of the agenda. Unfortunately, this condition may not have been completely fulfilled in the joint declaration by Mr Singh and Wen Jiabao. The fact that in the joint declaration India and China are described as like-minded countries maybe overlooked as a concession to diplomatic rhetoric. Having said that, it needs to be pointed out that foreign office mandarins of both countries will be hard-pressed to locate where exactly the minds and interests of the two countries are similar.
    
	What is worse is that by the joint declaration, India recognizes China as a participant in the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Co-operation. The nature of Chinas participation is not clear. Presumably, the dragon will be an observer, similar to its status in South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation. This concession to China to enter the Bay of Bengal is surprising since neither in terms of geography nor in terms of history does China have any claims and interests in the Bay of Bengal. The original idea was to include in Bimstec those countries that have an immediate interest in the Bay of Bengal  India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Mynamar and Thailand. Chinas keenness to participate in Bimstec is related to its desire to keep a finger in every Asian pie. The finger often turns out to be a hand, and the pie only for the dragons consumption. India made a mistake by admitting China as an observer to the Saarc. It has compounded the error by conceding that China should be a participant in Bimstec. The gestures of friendship may well turn out to be utterly misplaced.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | for the nation first
                                                                                                                 FOR THE NATION FIRST                                                          
	There are rare moments in a countrys history that throw up issues which demand that political actors abandon their narrow political and ideological interests and consider the nations interests. Manmohan Singh was referring to such a moment when he told parliament that the need of the hour was to build up a national consensus in support of the Indo-US nuclear deal. The appeal was unmistakably directed at the Bharatiya Janata Party, and more specifically, at its minence grise, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. There was an immediate and an obvious reason for doing this. The immediacy is related to the developments in the negotiations concerning the nuclear deal. Reports and various movements on the part of the government strongly indicate that the deal is all set to go through. The obvious context for the prime ministers remarks is the opposition to the deal expressed by L.K. Advani and other leaders of the BJP.        
	It needs to be recalled that the BJP, when it was in power at the Centre, took very important steps, under the leadership of Mr Vajpayee, to bring India closer to the United States of America. Such steps were in part a continuation of the radical shift in Indias foreign policy pioneered by P.V. Narasimha Rao, and in part the result of new initiatives put in place by Mr Vajpayee and his team of policy-makers. The growing closeness between Washington and New Delhi from the end of the Cold War prepared the ground for the path-breaking understanding between the two countries manifest in the nuclear deal. It is significant that Mr Vajpayees principal advisor, Brajesh Mishra, as the prime minister noted in his speech, has endorsed the Indo-US nuclear deal. Under the circumstances, it is difficult to comprehend Mr Advanis newfound opposition to the deal. From Mr Advanis ideological vantage point, he cannot logically be opposed to the growing pro-US tilt in Indias foreign policy. Thus, it will not be unfair to assume that Mr Advanis dislike of the deal is based on cynical concerns. He would prefer to see Mr Singhs government in some discomfort, and not see it run away with a foreign policy triumph. In other words, there is no principled opposition, only problems of authorship. The prime minister was appealing to the BJP to rise above such petty concerns, and to look at the gains that will accrue to the nation, irrespective of the party in power.        
	The idea is a new one in recent Indian politics, but its implications are profound. Too much of Indian politics is driven by narrow party motivations and by the desire to score points against a rival. Mr Singh, characteristically, was attempting to push Indian politics to a different and higher level. The point the prime minister was making is more significant than the acceptance or otherwise of the Indo-US nuclear deal. The country, not politics or ideology, should always come first.

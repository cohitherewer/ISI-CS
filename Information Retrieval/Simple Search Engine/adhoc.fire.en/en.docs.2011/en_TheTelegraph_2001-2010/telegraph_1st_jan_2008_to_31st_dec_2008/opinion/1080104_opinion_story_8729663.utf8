	Violent creed
         
	Sir  The church burnings and violence in four towns of the Kondhmal district in Orissa seem to have followed the trajectory of the communal violence in Godhra in 2002 (Christmas carnage on Orissa churches, Dec 26). As in Godhra, here too members of a minority community were the first to attack  injuring a Hindu priest  following which the two communities clashed. It is strange then, that the moderates and secularists are only condemning the attacks on Christians and the burning of churches, but not the assault of the priest, which spurred the violence in the first place. All forms of violence, irrespective of who their perpetrators are, must be condemned equally. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Nearly 15 churches were razed to the ground in Orissa on Christmas Day. The silence of our political leaders would be shocking but for the unfortunate truth that it is the god-fearing who are made to suffer these days. One billion people put their trust and their lives in the hands of a bunch of politicians who play warped sectarian games in order to secure votes. One can only hope that the Centre and the Orissa government will protect the lives and properties of the Christians in that state. Making public announcements of condolence and anguish at the happenings can hardly be counted as constructive action. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The riots in Orissa will only tarnish the image of our country further, especially when it has hardly recovered from the aftermath of riots in Gujarat and Assam. All that our elected heads seem to be able to do is either to send out pleas for peace or to stoke further violence with their controversial and divisive politicking. It is time people started to think for themselves instead of relying on their political leaders. 
          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Orissa has been a target of the Hindutva brigade for a long time. The similarity between the riots in Gujarat in 2002 and Orissa in December 2007 lies in the inaction of the police in both instances. Also, in both cases, the opposition parties were barred from entering the affected areas. It is astonishing that members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad were allowed to organize a rally against alleged conversions to Christianity on Christmas eve knowing full well that the missionary, Graham Staines, and his two minor sons were burnt alive in the same state in 1999. Although Naveen Patnaik does not need the Bharatiya Janata Partys crutch for his survival, for some mysterious reason, the BJP has had a say in all administrative decisions in Orissa. The party even put pressure on Patnaik to make the state steel and mines minister, Padmanav Behera, resign following the recent violence. The sooner Patnaik stops relying on the BJP as an ally, the better it will be for Orissa.

	Clear the smoke
     
	Sir  India should learn from France, which has extended its ban on smoking in public places to include bars, discotheques, casinos, cafs and restaurants, with effect from January 1, 2008 (End of road for Frances smoking cafs, Dec 29). The French are notoriously immoderate, and if France can achieve success with this ban, there is no reason why India cannot. Although smoking is banned in public places here as well, the law is disregarded by citizens and law- enforcers alike. The French have been gracious enough to accept the ban, preferring to remember the heady times spent at smoking cafs in the past. Indians, however, live only for the present, with no concern for their own future or that of others. It is amazing how repeated warnings about the lethal effects of smoking leave them unfazed.
          
	Yours faithfully,
   
Surajit Das, Calcutta

        
	Sir  The French have little cause to celebrate this new year. Or, at any rate, little choice in terms of places to go and celebrate. With the ban on smoking in France being extended to restaurants and cafs, a quarter of its population must now face yet another threat to their personal freedom. Images of Jean-Paul Sartre with his trademark Gauloise or of Catherine Deneuve holding her slim cigarette have been immortalized and are almost synonymous with peoples image of France, just as the charming Parisian cafs brimming with artists and intellectuals. This new year, a favourite French pastime will fade away in smoke rings. What is difficult to fathom is why governments across the world are insistent on making personal choices for their adult citizens. Smokers are well aware of the harmful effects of their habit. Should they still wish to indulge in it, they ought to be allowed to do so. Until the day governments gather the courage to ban the sale of cigarettes altogether, it is unfair on their part to make scapegoats of a section of the population. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Rangakarmees festival of solo performances by women, Ekal Yatra, featured six mainstage plays and four open-air recitals of traditional songs and dance. Among the six plays, all but two were fairly old: Saoli Mitras Katha Amrita Saman from 1989, Kalairanis Song of Lowino from 1994, Usha Gangulis Antar Yatra and Sushma Deshpandes Tichya Aichi Goshta from 1995. One wonders why Rangakarmee neglected recent creations in this genre.
    
	The other question pertains to a fundamental problem in solo theatre by Indian women. Of the six shows, three were directed by the actresses themselves, and three by men (counting Lowino, originally conceived by Hartman De Souza, now reworked by Kalairani). The performer-cum-director has become a rarity internationally upon the irrefutable logic that he/she cannot direct himself/herself objectively. Instead, self-directed Indian soloists display a high degree of subjective indulgence in their works. But to fall back on male directors is no solution either. For all other things being equal, they cannot mould an actress in the way that a woman director could. To improve, theatre by Indian women must cultivate the separate female director who is not also the performer.
    
	One actress who never indulges herself is H. Sabitri(picture), because she has learnt over five decades that less is more. In her half-hour-long A Process, she uses all her skills  sincerity of expression, facial malleability, potent energy, huge vocal range, graceful Manipuri dance  to convey her life in miniature, from child to senior role model. She internalizes everything, never exhibiting her prowess for its own sake. Deshpandes acclaimed Tichya Aichi Goshta, arthat Majhya Athavanincha Phad (Her Mothers Story, or My Own Memories) was the result of exhaustive research on Tamasha actresses, fictionalized into one character whose educated daughter grows up to scorn her mothers profession but returns as a journalist to interview her because times have changed. The protagonist recognizes the irony of this situation and tells us her own tale of hardship as well as the empowerment that Tamasha actresses feel when they are able to wield influence over men. Deshpande, too, can speak literally in different voices, but had a bad day singing, often going off-key.
    
	Neeta Mohindras Buhe Barian (by Rangtoli) dramatized four Punjabi short stories in a collage directed by M.K. Raina, interpreting patriarchal oppression in various forms. She offered the most natural acting at the festival.

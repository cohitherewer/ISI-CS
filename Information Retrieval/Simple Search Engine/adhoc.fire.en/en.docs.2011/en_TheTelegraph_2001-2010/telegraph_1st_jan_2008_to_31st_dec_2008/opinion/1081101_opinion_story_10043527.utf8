                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       THE DARK SIDE OF THE NATION                              This Above All      Khushwant Singh                        Small thanks				                                       
	I have long been disillusioned by the literary quality of works that win prestigious literary awards like the Nobel, Booker, Pulitzer, Commonwealth and so on. I have been even less impressed by books that make it to the top of booksellers lists and earn millions of dollars in royalties for their authors. But I make it a point to read them for the simple reason that people better-read than I think highly of them. When I heard that two Indians had made it to the last eight entrants for the Booker Prize  one of them being Amitav Ghosh  I assumed that if the award went to an Indian, it would be to Ghoshs Sea of Poppies because it is the best thing I have read in a long time. However, the prize went to Aravind Adigas novel, The White Tiger. I had heard of the novel but not read it, nor heard the name of the author; it is his first novel. I brought up the subject in my evening mehfil. Of the half-a-dozen in the assemblage, only my next-door neighbour, Reeta Devi of Cooch Bihar, had bought and read it. Later that evening, she sent me her copy. It took me two days to read it from cover to cover. I found it highly readable. Also infinitely depressing; it is the darkest, one-sided picture of India I have ever read. I dont mind reading harsh criticism of my countrymen, but I find half-truths unpalatable. If I had any say in the matter, I would have cast my vote in favour of Amitav Ghosh.        
	The narrator of the story is one Balram Halwai, son of an impoverished father who is a rickshaw-puller in the of village Laxmangarh in Bihar. He has to withdraw Balram from school so that Balram can earn some money as a dish-washer in a tea-stall by the station. Balrams ambition in life is to be a chauffeur. His only chance of doing so is to get employment with the family, which owns most of the land round his village. The family is in big business as coal merchants in Dhanbad, where they live in a large mansion with hordes of servants. Balram manages to raise money to learn driving, get a licence and a job as a second driver in the landlords family. The senior driver, Ram Persad, drives a Honda City; Balram a Maruti Zen. One member of the landlords family, Mr Ashok, goes to business school in America and returns home with an Indian Christian wife, Pinky Madam. They decide to settle in Delhi. Both Ram Persad and Balram are in the running to accompany them. Just in the nick of time, it is found out that Ram Persad is a Muslim pretending to be a Hindu. He disappears from Dhanbad (inference: Hindus dont trust Muslims). So Balram, now in chauffeurs uniform, drives his master and mistress to Delhi in their Honda City. They take up residence in a huge apartment block in Gurgaon.        
	Mr Ashok gets into big business, bribing everyone who matters. Ministers, politicians, middlemen, police, magistrates, everyone has a negotiable price-tag  wads of currency note, booze in five-star hotels, prostitutes of all nationalities. Once, a very drunk Pinky Madam, driving the Honda, runs over a child. Balram is made to take the blame. Ultimately the police and the magistrate are squared and nothing happens. Pinky Madam gets fed up of India and returns to New York. Mr Ashok takes to whoring. Balram dips his beak in brothels on G.B. Road. The master-servant relationship comes to an abrupt end on a rainy night, when the Honda City gets stuck in the mud. While a very drunk Mr Ashok is trying to lift a car tyre out of the mud, Balram smashes his skull with a bottle of Scotch, dumps his body in a bush and runs away with a bagful of currency notes, taking his own nephew with him to Bangalore.         
	His picture is all over the public places, among those being sought by the police. Nevertheless, Balram manages to set up a highly lucrative business, running a fleet of taxis to take late-night workers to their homes. When one of his drivers runs over a cyclist, he has the case quashed by bribing the police. Meanwhile, Mr Ashoks family, way back in Dhanbad, settles scores by having 17 members of Balrams family eliminated. Thats how, according to Aravind Adiga, things happen in the India of today. He narrates his tale of crime and corruption in his country in a series of seven, long, imaginary letters to the president of China.        
	Aravind Adiga now says he wants to dedicate his prize-winning novel to the people of Delhi. However, it is not the Delhi of which Dilliwalahs are proud of: the oldest and the most modern city of the world, a city of marble palaces, mosques and temples, of ancient forts and mausolea, the greenest capital on earth with the largest variety of birds, of parks and roundabouts ablaze with flowers in spring  all this escapes the authors eyes. What draws him are slums, the stench of drains filled with human excreta, pigs rummaging the garbage dumps, pimps and prostitutes. We, who belong to and love our city, have nothing to thank him for. But bless him. Though full of half-truths, he writes well. His black humour and biting satire persuades the reader to forgive him.                
	Budding friendship                
	With a sense of victory and great exultation        
	Says Mamata, Because of my endless agitation        
	I have saved Bengal from industrialization.        
	And now in the company of Amar        
	Singh, my new-found friend,        
	I have set out to save the nation.        
	A nuisance, Nano was anti-people, anti-peasantry,        
	So I have despatched it to Narendra Modi         
	This my secular credential, this is my card against BJP         
	And next time, if the Marxists bring in industry,        
	I and Amar Singh will take over the country.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | art in eclipse
                                                                                                                 ART IN ECLIPSE                                                          
	What does it mean when an eminent artist chooses to create a work of art as a gift to a city? And what does it mean when that city fails to honour such a gesture? What is at stake here is larger than misgovernance and more complicated than shame. Anjolie Ela Menon had created a huge mural for the Esplanade Metro station in Calcutta in the early Nineties. It was found out, quite by accident, that not only was it silently covered over by another work nailed on top of it, but the mural had also been damaged by this treatment. When the artist had enquired about the mural, she was initially misled about what had been done to it. After the matter has come to light, the Metro Railway authorities are making restorative noises, but the quality of this damage control would depend entirely on how much they are willing to spend for a professional restorer to work on the mural.        
	The value of art is distinct from its price in the market. And a work of art that is also a gift is doubly valuable in this intangible and honourable sense of value, for it embodies not only artistic excellence but also an act of generosity and graciousness. So it is important to realize that what is really at stake here is not a huge sum of money, but an act of the profoundest disrespect that has rightly left the artist with a feeling of equally profound outrage. Menon believes that works of art should be put in the public domain, instead of confining them to the drawing rooms of the rich. This takes for granted a civilized consensus regarding the value of art that the Indian State is quite obviously unable to honour. Going into the nitty-gritty of whether the state or the Central government should be held responsible for this is to get the point wrong. Everywhere in Calcutta, or Santiniketan, or Delhi, priceless treasures lie in unthinking neglect, or are vandalized or looted with a kind of smoothness that should put to shame any government made up of educated and elected representatives of the people. In Bengal, Calcuttas Academy of Fine Arts remains the most dismal symbol of cultural dereliction. Its priceless holdings inadequately protected from thieves, the Indian Museum has been reduced to a gallery of grotesques. Invaluable paintings by Rabindranath Tagore, his kin and contemporaries lie in damp strong rooms and inaccessible archives, the keepers of which are outraged when confronted with any notion of accountability.        
	Public spaces, open to the citizen but protected by the State, are one of many places where art might find civic refuge. But the book-fair saga, or the state governments attitude to air pollution, should make the citizen wary of assuming that such spaces might be available for the contemplation of beauty. Democracy, in its actual, modern forms, may not be the right sort of world for art, or the generosity that often comes with it.

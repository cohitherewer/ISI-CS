	Of the many pretexts for violence, illegal conversion is one of the strangest. Even before the attacks of Hindu fundamentalist outfits on Christian churches and homes in Orissa have been fully contained  there was more violence in Kandhamal over the weekend  churches have been attacked, allegedly by Bajrang Dal activists, in three districts of southern Karnataka, another state ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party. The violence has spilled across the northern border of Kerala too. The Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad have only illegal conversion as excuse for violence. Not even when the BJP was at the Centre  attacks against Christians then included the Staines murder  did the party state that there can be no illegal conversion in a democracy where everyone has the right to practise his religion of choice. By illegal, the Bajrang Dal and the VHP seem to mean forced or bribed conversions, and claim to find proof of money and of anti-Hindu literature distributed among poor tribals and Dalits, as they have in Karnataka. An irrelevant charge is made to appear legitimate. Not just the BJP, but all parties need to come down heavily on communal violence, on the strange phenomenon called reconversion, and on tactics used to coerce the poor to become Hindus.        
	The politics of these attacks differs according to region, but is uncomplicated on the whole. In Orissa, the rivalry between Dalit Christians and Hinduized tribal groups for shares in the quota pie has worked to the Hindu outfits advantage. In Karnataka, it is being thought that there is a plan to drive a wedge between the New Life churches and the Catholic church, which, allegedly, is not being attacked. Whatever the local guise, the fact is that in both Orissa and Karnataka the BJP, a party that is looking up to Narendra Modi as leader, is in government. Karnatakas home minister managed to call the attacks on churches unwanted only after stating that anti-Hindu pamphlets were found there. The prime minister, who called the violence in Orissa a national disgrace, has asked the Karnataka chief minister and the governor to ensure communal harmony at any cost. If they fail, especially when the country is fighting terror of a different sort, it would be a sign of the most shocking and malicious irresponsibility.

	Nandikars new play, Ajnatabas, based on a story by Sukanta Gangopadhyay, has, as far as I know, already been transformed into a telefilm starring Supriya Chowdhury. This production, therefore, gives it a fresh lease of life for theatregoing audiences. It also marks a change of pace for this leading Bengali troupe, from the relatively large-scale, sometimes even spectacular, works that it has preferred of late, to a more conventional small-cast domestic drama on a subject that several local troupes have touched upon: care for senior citizens.        
	A young couple  he a busy employee of a multinational company, she a lonely housewife  move into a pretty little house on Calcuttas outskirts, to get more space for themselves than they could have in a joint family. After two years of marriage though, he has run out of conversation with her, while she looks caged behind the grill gate that she keeps locked from inside once he leaves for work. One fine day, an older woman who seems to have lost her way turns up at their door, asking for water. After initial hesitation, the wife considerately lets her in, but learns that the lady has lost her memory too. Panicking, she phones her husband in office, who returns, and the routine calls by police and a doctor follow. Meanwhile, the old lady has not only bonded with the young wife, she has also won the sceptical husbands heart via his stomach by cooking a fantastic meal.        
	Through these scenes, Ajnatabas explores the sad decline of traditional family values, the isolation and solitude of the elderly or housebound wives, and the prevalence of suspicion over trust when dealing with strangers. Like one of Priestleys supernatural characters, the old woman brings something back into the lives of the young pair, making them aware of human feelings again. Then, just as suddenly as she came, she remembers her address and asks the man to take her there. He does, and out of curiosity, follows her inside unseen, to chance upon a sight he had never expected.        
	In his first major project, Sumanta Gangopadhyay directs well, but the concluding video makes things too explicit, like film always does; moreover, it has become a common habit in theatre nowadays to insert some footage. He should also remove significant props to establish the flashbacks, and record an accurate orioles call. In the lead, Swatilekha Sengupta easily walks away with the honours in an understated yet emotional performance. Sohini Sengupta presents an eerie sense of history repeating itself as she retells this story from her past. Gangopadhyay fits her husbands role. Among the smaller parts, Sumana Mukherjee stands out as the maid with pretensions to upward mobility: her transformation when answering the phone is a treat to watch.

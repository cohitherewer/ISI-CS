	Those of us who denounce the IPL sometimes confuse fear for loathing. I dont dislike Twenty20 in itself: I watch passages of play in the IPL, gripped and fascinated. The sight of the eccentrically-muscled Shoaib Akhtar bounding in to bowl from the boundary line against the Delhi Daredevils was exhilarating. Watching him destroy Delhis top order was like watching an inter-species massacre: Attack Penguin Crushes Puny Humans. Theres a tabloid excitement to the IPL which is infectious. To watch Shoaib and Sourav embrace and high-five is to warm to a contest that sidelines nationalism to make room for club loyalty.         
	No, doomsayers like me dont dislike Twenty20 or the IPL: were just scared that theyll make our cricketing passions obsolete. As we fret about the future of the four-innings game (will the Ranji Trophy survive? How will we nurture future Test cricketers if it doesnt?), it might help if we begin by recognizing that we arent alone. Historically, what is happening to cricket today has happened to other forms of entertainment  music, for example  in the past.               
	People who prefer Test cricket to the limited-overs forms of the game are often called purists. This is the wrong term: fans of Test cricket dont see the long game as the pure form of the game: they think of it as the classical form. It is classical because it is a codified, cultivated form of the game, distinct from both local/popular/primitive forms of bat and ball as well as modern abridged variants such as ODIs and Twenty20. Test cricket is classical also in the sense of being (or once having been) authoritative and definitive. Rahul Dravid, for example, chose the players for Vijay Mallyas franchise on the principle that good Test players ought to be able to play Twenty20 cricket because the four-innings form teaches the Test player a classical technique that can be turned to any purpose, a style for all seasons. He was horribly wrong (as we now know), but this was more than an individual error: it represented the collapse of the classical ideal in cricket.        
	People frequently say of Indian playback singers that this singer or that was classically trained. It is generally meant as a compliment. Lata Mangeshkars virtuosity and longevity was attributed to her classical training. But over time it has become clear that classical training is an optional extra for the successful playback singer because there have been so many who never had any, starting with Kishore Kumar. In the same way, Twenty20 tournaments like the World Cup and the IPL have thrown up players like Yousuf Pathan who have achieved great success and recognition via this upstart form of the game without any sort of track record at the Test level.         
	You could argue that this had already begun to happen with one-day internationals as players like Michael Bevan, Ajit Agarkar, Ajay Jadeja, Yuvraj Singh built reputations for themselves as specialist limited-overs players. But the difference in the skills required for Tests, as opposed to ODIs, was nothing compared to the radically different demands made on bowlers and batsmen in a game that takes forty overs to complete as opposed to one that takes more than four hundred. It seems likely that many first-rate Test players like Dravid and Jacques Kallis will never successfully adapt their techniques to the needs of Twenty20 cricket.         
	Just as playback singers and bhangra pop idols earn vast sums of money and become hugely famous without having served a long apprenticeship to an ustad or a guru from a classical gharana, so too will young men like Yousuf Pathan become household names without making a Test debut. The IPL has made this possible and that is why aficionados of Test cricket fear it.        
	The classical training that was once necessary for worldly success is necessary no longer. Crickets establishment and its following will continue to pay homage to the classical form, i.e. Test cricket, for years yet, but it will increasingly become a kind of lip service, a matter of polite habit, because the classical form isnt hegemonic any more. The headlines Twenty20 wins you, the column inches in the newspapers, the minutes on television, the endorsements it brings, the auction price it helps you net, makes the short game your first priority if youre an ambitious young cricketer. How could it be otherwise? Having survived a hundred and fifty years of modernity and change, Test cricket has been brought to its knees at a single stroke by Indias traditional merchant elites: Ambani, Reddy, Wadia, Mallya and Modi have Test cricketers the world over ready to jump ship to join a league still in its first season. Its a bit like Jos Carreras, Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo abandoning opera to compete in the first season of American Idol.              
	Perhaps the follower of Test cricket can learn something from the survival of classical music in a world dominated by film music in India and pop music abroad. The three-minute song might be king, but symphonies survive, ragas are revived, sangeet sammelans thrive, Chennai hosts its annual sabhas and classical musicians remain regulars on the Republic Day honours lists. If classical music, its virtuosos and its audience have survived the constantly foretold Death of the Gharana, perhaps Test cricket will survive the rumoured demise of the first-class game.        
	Maybe the first-class four-innings game could be reformed, franchised and made into a two-day, day-night, weekend affair with over limits. This mightnt please the dogmatic classicist, but whats the choice? A four-innings match played over two hundred overs is considerably better preparation for Test cricket than a two-innings game played over forty. Besides, wouldnt it be nice to have a first-class league that people actually watched and cared about?              
	Classical music, Western and Indian, has survived the commercial triumph of popular music because of its own resilience, the dedication of its fans, and the help of patrons, both public and private. In India, All India Radio, Doordarshan, Spicmacay, private companies like the ITC, media houses and numberless private citizens have helped create a musical calendar and networks of patronage that have kept a classical form alive in demotic times. Perhaps the BCCI and the ICC can do as much for Test cricket.        
	I know. It isnt likely to happen. But theres no harm hoping.       mukulkesavanhotmail.com

	The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, does not have a reputation of calling a spade a spade. He is known to be a very polite man who does not believe in being blunt to the point of rudeness. This quality of Mr Singh should not convey the impression that the prime minister bypasses uttering things that are unpleasant, and that he is prone to being economical with the truth. When he addressed senior bureaucrats in New Delhi on Monday, he made the perfectly acceptable point that the civil and defence services should be properly rewarded and that taxpayers would not resent the payment of such adequate compensation. He was referring, of course, to the murmurs of disaffection among defence services regarding the recent recommendations of the pay commission. Members of the defence services feel that they have been rather badly treated compared to what the pay commission has recommended for the civil services. Mr Singh gave the assurance that a mechanism had already been put in place to look into such grievances. What is significant is that the prime minister did not stop at such placatory words. He emphasized that better pay and better conditions of work demanded improved standards of work. Following the famous words of the prince of Denmark, it could be said, Ay, theres the rub.        
	The persistent, and not unjustified, complaint against the Indian bureaucracy has been its low level of performance and its lack of accountability. As the prime minister said, There is a great deal of public dissatisfaction with the functioning of the government. One of the fundamental factors behind non-performance or poor performance is that government jobs are sinecures. Failure and goof-ups do not result in the loss of jobs; promotions and increments are not dependent on performance. Such a situation can only lead to a complete erosion of standards. This is the real reason behind the public disaffection against the bureaucracy. There has occurred a loss of trust. What is worse is that there are no signs that the bureaucracy wants to reform itself. The prime minister posed this challenge before the civil services. In an era of reform, Indian bureaucrats cannot cling to the delusion that they are heaven-born, remaining untouched by the winds of change. More pay is one aspect of the change that entails an altered sense of responsibility and duty.

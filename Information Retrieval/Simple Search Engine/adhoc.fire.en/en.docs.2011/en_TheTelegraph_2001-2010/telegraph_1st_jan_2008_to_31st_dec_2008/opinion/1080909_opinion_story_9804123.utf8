                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CHANGE IS IN THE AIR                                  Malvika Singh                              
	India needs to be congratulated for having joined the nations of the world which are members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and having broken finally through the nuclear apartheid that had plagued us for decades. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was relentless in his endeavour to ensure that India engages with the larger world, and participates in the sharing of technologies, expertise and in international decision-making. He has changed the course of Indias foreign policy, enforced the opening up of a hitherto closed and unchanged mindset that came with the realities of a command economy. He has consciously put the country on a fresh trajectory that could transform our economy, society and politics internally as well as in terms of world affairs and partnerships at the start of this new millennium.         
	The deal is not going to win additional votes for the Congress in the forthcoming elections. It is not a populist measure forced upon a government which needs to indulge in superficial politics that will bring some short-term gains. It is for India, to help and assist this country, with all its socio-economic diversity, to grow, develop, question the status quo, initiate alternatives, and bring in change. The shift  out of the comfortable, insulated shell of the last sixty years  happened and that also without much angst. This is yet another feather in the cap of the United Progressive Alliance coalition led by the Congress.        
	The strident, rather loud, but alas, hollow words of abuse that leaders of the various opposition parties had screamed out at us from every rooftop and panel discussions on television seemed to have been silenced on September 6. The spokespersons of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Bahujan Samaj Party need to be grilled hard about why they were so against Indias engagement with the world by joining the high table of first world nations. After all, the nuclear deal has extricated India from that most demeaning status of a failed third world country, wallowing in the past, unable to restore dignity to its people. The deal has brought about a historic change  India is no longer a third world nation.                
	Future plans        
	It was Manmohan Singh who led India into breaking loose from the shackles of meaningless controls that had heralded the worst kind of corruption at all levels. The same Manmohan Singh opened up the economy gradually and painstakingly, allowing entrepreneurship to flourish and generate growth. Simultaneously, his government and party introduced daring initiatives like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme on the one hand, and the right to information on the other. Neither are populist measures in a country where disparities have been divisive and where, because of that, a small elite ruling class has exploited citizens by being non-transparent in their administrative dealings. These are long-term policy initiatives, truly nationalist, the results of which will change the fundamentals of governance, and restore a sense of appropriateness in the not-so-distant future.        
	The UPA, led by the Congress, could take centre stage yet again if it plays the game right. It needs to open up its thinking, its actions, its plans, to the people of India across all castes, creeds and faiths. It needs to reach out to and engage with the constituents. It needs to become an inclusive vehicle for carrying forward the change that India and Bharat desperately need.         
	Finally, if the US Congress now creates some obstacle related to the nuclear deal, it will no longer matter because that will be seen as a result of its insecurity! China is miffed because India is now an equal partner. It is thus proved that the BJP were in the wrong place at the right time. Will the Congress hold its ground?

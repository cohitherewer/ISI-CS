	Lucre for leisure                  
	Sir  It is unfortunate that in a country that accomodates almost a third of the worlds poor, where millions are illiterate, death by starvation is reported frequently  the salaries of the president, vice president and the governors have taken a leap in less than a year of being raised in January 2007 (Presidents pay hike, Sept 12). This comes in addition to the millions of rupees spent to fund their lavish lifestyle and travels. If the salary increments of the government employees recommended by the sixth pay commission have been huge, then those of the president, vice-president and governors can be called astronomical. It must be admitted that some government officials work very hard, that too in remote rural corners of the country, and as such, deserve handsome pay packets. But the president, vice-president and governors do little other than attending public ceremonies and offering unsolicited suggestions to ministers. For merely fulfilling absurd protocols, our poor country cannot afford a bunch of ornamental individuals. This also comes as a stark reminder that a small percentage of Indians are in government-jobs, with social, medical and financial security, while the large majority have no such benefits though they contribute equally, if not more, to the countrys economic growth.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The 300-per-cent salary hike of Indias president, vice-president and governors has come as a shock. Their performances are never evaluated, and their luxury and conspicuous consumption outweigh their official duties. Even their official tasks comprise occasional interaction with international delegations and visiting dignitaries, going on foreign trips, attending felicitation programmes or inaugurations, giving away prizes, and consultations with senior bureaucrats and ministers on rare occasions. Only a handful of governors are urged by their conscience to be as proactive as Gopalkrishna Gandhi; and only a few presidents as enthusiastic as A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. In fact, Kalam set a laudable example by leaving all the gifts he received during his presidency to the museum of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. But there have been others who have made extravagant overseas trips, received expensive gifts from foreign visitors, and offered all sorts of privileges to their relatives and friends. The inordinate raise in salary will no doubt make the picture rosier for such opportunists and their parasitic relatives.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The discrepancy between the paltry workload of the president, vice-president and governors and their enormous pay package can be resolved only by assigning more work and authority to them. The present set-up may not allow them to actively participate in the administration, but the Constitution may be amended so that no extra money is spent on clerks and bureaucrats to execute the official tasks that can easily be accomplished by the president, vice-president and governors.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Raw deal          
	Sir  A premier institute for mining engineering and earth sciences, the Indian School of Mines University, Dhanbad, has been a victim of administrative malpractices. The entrance to this institute is through the IIT-Joint Entrance Examination. The teachers too are paid on a par with the faculty members of the Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Management and Indian Institute of Science. The eligibility criteria for faculty positions are similar to those required for teaching at the IITs. Also, like the IITs, ISMU is an autonomous institute controlled directly by the Central ministry of human resource development. Despite such high standards, teachers of ISMU are facing hindrances to their promotion from the members of the HRD ministry who clearly seem to have a soft corner for the IITs and IIMs.           
	In all technical institutes under the University Grants Commission, including the ones under various state governments, there is a career advancement scheme for teachers whereby every lecturer can become a professor within sixteen years of his service. In all the IITs, IIMs and IISc Bangalore, there is also a flexible scheme which allows a teacher to become a professor within eight to nine years of his service at the institute. But at ISMU, neither of these schemes function. As a result, many faculty members, with almost 30 years of professional expertise as lecturers, assistant professors or associate professors, have not been promoted to professorship. Many of them will have to retire in the same grade in which they had joined. This will no doubt erode the standard of the institute; few will think highly of a faculty comprising so few professors, while other institutes of the same category are brimming with them. Many good academicians are therefore steering clear of ISMU; and those who are already teaching there are planning to leave. ISMU is a living example of the irresponsibility of the HRD ministry. The issues raised have been discussed several times in the executive board of the institute which has members from the ministry. They agreed to look into the matter, but there is no sign so far that they have.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The higher education ministry of West Bengal is putting the joint entrance examinees of 2008 through an ordeal. The second round of counselling for West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination (engineering), targeted to fill up the seats lying vacant after the first phase of admissions, was held on August 9 and 10. This counselling was opened to even rankers below 40,000 who eventually got good colleges, even government ones. But those with higher ranks who had already taken admission to low-grade colleges were not allowed to upgrade their choice, or attend this second round of counselling. The Central Selection Committee acknowledged its mistake and promised to hold a third phase of counselling soon, as almost 400 seats are still lying vacant. But it has been more than a month since then and the wait is becoming more agonizing by the day. Classes have already begun in all the colleges and the first semester examinations will start after the puja break. Some private engineering colleges meanwhile have started converting their empty seats into management category  a more lucrative ploy for them. The council and the JEE board are strangely silent on this breach of rule. Any further delay will be tantamount to late entrants losing an academic year. Many of those who have dropped out of the institutes they had earlier joined in the hope of getting better colleges, are, in fact, staring at that horrible prospect.          
	Yours faithfully,

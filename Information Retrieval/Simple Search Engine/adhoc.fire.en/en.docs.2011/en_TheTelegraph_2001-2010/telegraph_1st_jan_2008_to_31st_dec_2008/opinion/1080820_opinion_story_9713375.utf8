	It took eight days of threatening, and much persuasion, for Pakistan to finally see the back of its thoroughly discredited president. In a televised address that showed Pervez Musharraf far more in control of his emotions than he was at the time of the imposition of emergency last November, the president bid adieu to his countrymen, reminding them of his worth, the conspiracy behind his removal and the sacrifice he was making for the sake of national stability. It is unlikely that Mr Musharraf will have managed to convince his people, much less his political detractors. For, it is plain as daylight that the president would have hung on had there been the slightest sign of encouragement from the army or from his friends beyond the borders. But one cannot wish away the fact that by resigning, Mr Musharraf has drawn to a sudden end a protracted drama, which, if allowed to continue, would have sapped the nations energy further. Already, the hunt for the scapegoat has deflected attention from the other issues of common concern such as inflation, power shortage and terrorism. His resignation brings the members of the governing coalition face to face with the reality of dealing with more pressing matters, one of which is confronting their own political choices. Do they want to continue to seek revenge through democracy or get on with the affairs of the state?         
	It is time they knew their minds because their choice would determine how much precious time is spent on fractious subjects like the selection of the next president, the reinstatement of judges or the fate of the former president, each of which, unfortunately, has the ability to tear asunder Pakistans democracy and its fragile government. The removal of Mr Musharraf does not mean Pakistan has buried the ghosts of its past. A weak prime minister (functioning at the behest of two political leaders who have no public mandate and are often at cross-purposes), and an enfeebled president (stripped of extreme powers and subservient to the executive) leave enough room for the army to win back the stature Mr Musharraf had embodied in himself. The only way such a misfortune can be averted is by strengthening democracy itself without using it as an instrument for settling personal scores. However, it is doubtful if the leaders of the Pakistan Peoples Party or Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), amazed at their own abilities and superpower, will remember that.

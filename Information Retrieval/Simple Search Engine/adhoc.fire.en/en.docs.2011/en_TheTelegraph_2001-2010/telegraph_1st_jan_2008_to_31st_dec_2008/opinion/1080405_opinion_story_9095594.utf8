The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | goodbye to all that
                                                                                                                 GOODBYE TO ALL THAT                                                          
	Old men have reminiscences of events that never took place. Jyoti Basu and Harkishen Singh Surjeet, nonagenarians and founder members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), have memories of the revolution that never happened in India, and the withering away of the State that never occurred in either the former Soviet Union or communist China. They dedicated their lives to the ideals of communism and to the communist party, only to discover around 15 years ago that communism had disappeared from the globe. The Soviet Union collapsed under the weight of its own lies and the abuse of power and China turned towards market capitalism. If anyone aspired to communism anywhere, it was in a small part of India called West Bengal where communists held power and still dreamed of bringing about a revolution. The exit of Messrs Basu and Singh from the politburo of the CPI(M)  even though Mr Basu retains the status of a permanent invitee  perhaps marks the departure of communists from Indias most powerful communist party. Those who remain in the politburo belong to a different generation and are best described as realists rather than as communists.        
	A new generation, even when its members see themselves as communists, always brings with it new ideas and a fresh perspective on issues. This is clearly happening within the CPI(M). The new leadership is far less rigid than the founding fathers. The new leaders are struggling not so much to create conditions of working class dominance but to grapple with changed economic and political conditions globally, and with the almost universal disillusionment with communism. These new conditions have forced leaders like Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and even, though to a lesser extent, Prakash Karat, to reckon with the new realities of power and the strength of capitalism. It is undeniable that Mr Bhattacharjee has charted a path for West Bengals economic development which communists of an older vintage find unacceptable and inconceivable. The passing of the old order will inevitably facilitate the percolation of newer ideas and a newer praxis.        
	Communists travel with an enormous amount of baggage made heavy by bundles of misconception. This is a predictable plight of groups of people who continue to cling to an obsolete ideology. Many of the misconceptions arise from the confusion that communists have created by making social democratic ideas their own. One example of a prevailing confusion is the distinction Indian comrades make between foreign and Indian capitalists. It is bizarre to think that communists can temper their opposition to capitalists using the criteria of national boundaries. If one form of capital is acceptable, then others should be so too. This is perhaps too far-reaching a change to expect from a party that has just begun to change after many years in a never-never land.

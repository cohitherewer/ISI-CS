	Icons are ageless. When, through an inevitable biological process, icons get old and are forced to step down, their fans or their worshippers howl in disappointment. Witness the case of Sourav Ganguly and his considerable fan following in his native state, West Bengal. Mr Ganguly has been dropped from the Indian squad to play the one-day internationals in Australia. According to reports, he was omitted because the captain of the Indian ODI team, Mahendra Singh Dhoni preferred youth to experience. Following from this, three very senior players, among them Mr Ganguly, were dropped. The other two players are Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman, both of whom have been, like Mr Ganguly, in good form in the current series. There is no denying Mr Gangulys recent performance at both levels of the game  the one-day and the five-day varieties. He has been scoring runs, and equally importantly batting really well. His fans, and maybe Mr Ganguly himself, had assumed that his inclusion in the ODI team would be automatic. Unfortunately, Mr Gangulys fans, who have been very loud in voicing their disapproval and disappointment, have mixed up the present with the future.
    
	Given Mr Gangulys age  he is 35 years old  it stands to reason to say that he cannot represent the future of Indian cricket. Despite his present form, he has to step aside so that future talents can be seeded. Since Mr Ganguly decided not to step down, the selectors, with the future in mind, made the decision for him. It needs to be emphasized that he has been dropped only from the one-day squad. The one-day variety of cricket calls for levels of fitness and skills of running between the wickets that Mr Ganguly, unfortunately, did not have even when he was a young man. Now that age has caught up with him, he has become slower and less fit. These are factors that determined the decision of the selectors. There is an old saying that a cricketer should retire when people ask why he is retiring. Mr Ganguly should remember this and not wait for a time for people to ask when he will retire.

	The point is not new, but it is good to have a scientific and empirical demonstration of it. It has been asserted often enough that what we know as Indian culture or Indian civilization is nothing more than a cauldron to which various people and cultures contributed. The findings of the Indian Genome Variation project only confirms this with data drawn from a fairly representative sample. This makes absurd the whole idea that one particular race, religion or community constitutes India or even the majority of India. The findings show that four linguistic groups  the Indo-European, Tibeto-Burman, the Dravidian and the Austroasiatic  are predominant in India. Moving to clusters of population and their genetic affiliations, the project identified five such clusters. There are groups of people that belong to predominantly Indo-European caste and religious groups; there are others that are predominantly Dravidian, but sharing genetic similarities with other groups. There are groups of people that are a mixture of Indo-European and Dravidian populations. Apart from these clusters there exist isolated populations and religious groups in the Himalayan belt and tribal belts in central and eastern India. The Indian population in its linguistic, genetic and religious origins is thus very heterogeneous.        
	The findings of the IGV project also drive a spanner in the works of many pet theories. For example, the study shows that some Hindu caste groups are genetically closer to Muslims in the same geographical region than to the members of the same caste in other regions. This means that the whole idea of Muslims being outsiders is erroneous. Also this would suggest that conversion to Islam occurred, as historians have suggested, over a fairly long period of time, instead of in one fell coercive swoop by a Muslim tyrant. The extent of the intermingling also goes against the notion of an Aryan invasion. There are grounds to believe that the various genetic groups came to India through a process of migration, rather than through invasion. Once in India, they made it their home, thus spreading their genes.        
	On a less serious note, the data show that in West Bengal a substantial body of the population is derived from Indo-European caste and religious groups and also belong to the Indo-European linguistic group. It will not be unreasonable therefore to say that people in Bengal are derived from the same genetic pool as most Europeans, and also speak a language that has common origins with European languages. This may not be important to most people, but it will bring special satisfaction to the handful who believe that Bengal and Bengalis gained enormously by being the first to encounter Anglophone education, Western modes and manners and European sensibilities. Colonel Blimp in his London club and Babu Hurree Chunder Mookerjee may have been connected even without the dramatic intervention of British imperialism.

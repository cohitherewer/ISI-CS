                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             HOLDING UP THE SKY                                  Neha Sahay                              
	Chinese women are a vast reserve of labour power [which] should be tapped in the struggle to build a great socialist country, Mao had said soon after Chinas Liberation. Today this reserve is certainly being tapped  so that men can live off them, or so it often seems in the cities.        
	Take Qin Xiaoming. She left her village after she finished junior middle school. Though she was bright and studious, she couldnt afford to study further because her father had died of an illness for which the village had no cure. Since the age of 14, this 24 year old has been working in one of Guangdongs coastal cities, where women make up 60 per cent of migrant labour. Frugal and hardworking, Xiaoming managed to save a pretty packet, enhanced by some well-advised speculation in the stock market in the last two years.         
	Last year, her savings were 9,000 yuan; she could afford to rent a room downtown, and invest in a computer (to keep track of stocks). Today, she has less than 1,000 yuan in the bank. Her family back home has found they can always turn to Xiaoming whenever they need cash. Her mother wanted to build her dream house; for two years, Xiaoming resisted, telling her to take the money from the man she had started living with, whom Xiaoming refused to call father. Finally Xiaoming gave in, but insisted that the house be in her name. Her mother wanted it to be in the name of all her children.         
	Xiaoming had high hopes of her younger brother going to college. But he dropped out after junior middle school and loafed around till an uncle decided to train him to work in a garage. Now hes found a job, but keeps borrowing money from his elder sister, to indulge his expensive taste in mobiles and designer-wear. I dont like taking his calls any more, complains Xiaoming. I want my money back; he keeps making excuses.                
	On the verge        
	Xiaomings younger sister needs money too: she eloped and has a two-year-old baby, but can marry only now because shes just turned 20, the minimum age for marriage. Her husband, like most village men, doesnt do much; a wedding costs a lot.         
	Meanwhile, Xiaoming is tired of working in restaurants and bars, where the hours are long and conditions appalling. She dreams of completing her schooling, learning English and computers, owning her own flat. But all that costs money, and she has no godfathers in the city. Her family has twice tried to set her up with suitable boys, but Xiaoming found the country bumpkins loathsome. Every six months, she goes home with a song in her heart, only to find herself longing to escape to the city.         
	Xiaoming could be any female migrant worker. But what of Shi Ya? City-born Ya went to one of Guangdongs best universities, and landed a job in an international school as the directors secretary. Honest and hardworking, she soon became indispensable, both as secretary and teacher  till a pretty young thing joined as the new Chinese teacher. By the time Ya discovered the newcomer was being paid twice her salary, she was pregnant. She left her job hoping to devote herself to her baby. Alas, her husband turned out to be more demanding than Indian grooms; and instead of setting up house with her, moved in with her parents.         
	Ya now slogs in a private firm, seeing her baby only late evenings. Her father gambles; her younger brother lounges around waiting for a suitably well-paid job. Ya, who never uses make-up, not only pays her sisters college fees (which are high because she couldnt qualify for a state-run university), but also for her cosmetics. Her husband works when he feels like it. Only her mothers part-time earnings help Ya support all these dependants.        
	Women hold up half the sky, said Mao. Today, Chinese women hold up almost the entire sky.

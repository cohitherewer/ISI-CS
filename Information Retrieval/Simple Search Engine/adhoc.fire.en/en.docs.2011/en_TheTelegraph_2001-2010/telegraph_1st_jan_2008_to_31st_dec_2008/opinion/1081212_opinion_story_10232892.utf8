	To begin with, some cold facts about the Indian book trade. First, there are few good bookshops in even our large metros. Some have come up recently but there arent enough of them. Second, cramped for space and because of financial restraints, they are poorly stocked. Third, the odd title for the minority reader is simply not there, and, lastly, few booksellers know why some books sell while others dont; they go by instinct garnered through experience.         
	Hence the question, how do you get the books you cant find? As a practical guide through the maze of books, you need to divide the search into two sections: our books, that is original Indian publications or those reprinted here under licence, and their books, or imported American and British books. For both categories, the first step is to know the name of the publisher and preferably a few other details like its ISBN (the International Standard Book Number used for identifying titles) and the year of publication. Though these details are strictly not necessary, they are easily available through a Google search.         
	Acquisition of Indian publications isnt much of a problem once the name of the publisher is known. The real problem arises with American-British books because most booksellers do not import them directly; they acquire them from the publishers representatives in India. Every Western publisher has its representatives who promote and import copies for booksellers. Usually, there are three or four representatives, one for each region of the country.        
	But because imported titles are much more expensive and there is no guarantee that they would sell, agents play it safe by importing only sure shot bestsellers, that is down market titles on sex, crime and glitz or standard textbooks that are established in Indian universities. All other titles are imported against firm orders, and in very small numbers. So if you are looking for a book that falls outside the usual milieu, you would need to place a firm order, preferably through the agent or an established bookseller with details of the title and the ISBN. Normally, an imported title takes three to four weeks to arrive from Britain (all American publishers have their representatives in Britain) and so if there were delays, you would need to follow up.        
	Recent publications are usually processed pretty fast because they are in stock. It is the backlist that gets stuck because books have gone out of print or written off due to poor sales. (Because of acute warehousing space, many more books are now remaindered within a few months after publication and therefore not readily available.) To acquire these titles, you would need to visit out-of-stock sites like www.abebooks or www.dedalusbooks. Or simply do a Google search for out-of-stock book sites that will throw up a whole list from which you pick and choose. Punch in your credit card number and you will have the book within a matter of weeks.        
	The moral of the story is clear: if you want a book that you badly need, you need to go out and get it yourself. Bookshops alone arent enough to get it for you.

                                                                                                                 PLAYING POLITICS                                                    
	The agenda of a political party cannot be the same thing as the policy of its government. How the Congress fights the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Bengal should therefore have no bearing on the relations between the governments of Manmohan Singh and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Two recent events would suggest that the Congress high command has got the partys role mixed up with that of the United Progressive Alliance government. The first is the appointment of Priya Ranjan Das Munshi as the president of the Bengal unit of the Congress. He may well be the right choice for the job, but that is not the point. His appointment has clearly been prompted by the partys desperation to put its house in Bengal in order before the panchayat polls. Given the short time he has, it is doubtful if he can really make a difference to the state of the party. His biggest challenge comes from the enemies within the party. What is not in doubt, though, is the possibility that he will oppose the chief ministers policies, especially the ones relating to new industries. Such a campaign will be dictated by the Congresss partisan interests but can end up harming Bengals  rather than the CPI(M)s  interests. It would be Bengals misfortune if the Congress, too, follows Mamata Banerjees brand of obstructionist politics with the hope of expanding its support base.        
	The other development could be even more ominous for Bengal. Unhappy with the chief ministers failure to persuade his party to support the proposed nuclear deal between India and the United States of America, the Centre is reportedly working on a strategy to put his government under pressure. It has been indicated that the pressure may take the form of withholding the Union governments clearances for some new industrial proposals for Bengal. Even by the low ethical standards of Indian politics, this will be the worst form of tit-for-tat politics. What Mr Bhattacharjee can or cannot do to alter his partys stand on the nuclear deal is debatable. But the Centre will be entirely wrong to punish Bengal or any other state on political grounds. Such politics of blackmail was the order of the day in an earlier period. These are simply out of place in the new economic regime. The Congress should know how to make the crucial distinction between the party and the government.

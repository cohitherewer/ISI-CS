	Hamish McRae, one of the worlds best economic journalists, declared recently in The Independent that Hardly anyone a year ago successfully predicted the rise in the oil price to $120 a barrel  in fact I have not found a single forecast of that. Regular readers of this column may recall that I predicted oil at over $100 a barrel in April 2006, and well north of that price in another column in July 2007.        
	I am the most modest of men, but I reckon this gives me the right to offer some further forecasts. So I predict that the price of oil will soon fall  a bit. So far, the economies of the Bric  Brazil, Russia, India and China  are still growing strong, but the old industrialized economies are definitely heading into a recession. They still consume most of the oil.        
	This recession has not actually been caused by the high oil price; the sub-prime mortgage scam is to blame for this. But the recession is likely to drive the demand for oil down far enough to bring the price back down to $100 before long, or even to $85-90. Then in 2009-2010, as the old rich economies recover, it will go back up, probably to the $130-$150 range.        
	The price will rise because demand will recover much faster than supply can grow, if indeed it grows at all. An allegedly giant new oil-field has been found off the coast of Brazil, but even if it lives up to the advertising, it is 5-10 years away from large-scale production.        
	The worlds largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, admits that there is now not enough spare capacity among the Opec producers to make any difference. Russia, the biggest non-Opec producer, will probably see production fall this year.         
	So once the recession ends, the price of oil will probably stay well around $100 for most of the time in 2010-2015. But it wont hit $200, because there will be a steep rise in the supply of non-conventional oil from tar sands, oil shales, and other sources of heavy oil.        
	Even if the moment of peak oil is upon us, that would not mean the end of oil; it just means the end of sweet, light crude. The Alberta tar sands are profitable if the price of oil stays over $40 a barrel; at $60, the far larger Venezuelan tar sands are a viable economic proposition; at $80, even the oil shales of the western US are promising.                 
	High and low        
	In a world with a stable climate, ample unconventional oil supplies would bring the oil price down below $100 again, but thats not the way its likely to play out. By 2015, global tolerance for any process that involves high emission of greenhouse gases is likely to be very low. Indeed, there is likely to be a good deal of pressure to cut back on the consumption even of conventional oil.        
	Five years ago, global warming was a distant worry in most of the world, and in North America, where the denial industry had its headquarters, it was widely disbelieved. Now it is a high-priority concern in Europe, in America, in China, and a rapidly growing worry everywhere else.        
	Go seven years down the road, and throw in a few dozen more climate-related catastrophes like Hurricane Katrina or the killer heat-wave in Europe in the summer of 2003. What will popular support for burning fossil fuels be in 2015? Not very high, one suspects.        
	Billions of people live in countries that are now growing fast economically, so demand will probably keep the price for conventional oil near the $100 level well into the 2020s, but the political pressure to shut down extra-high-emission unconventional oil production may become irresistible.         
	In the still longer run  the 2030s and beyond  the demand for oil will probably fall even further, and with it the price. Because if it hasnt fallen due to a deliberate switch away from fossil fuels, then global warming will gain such momentum that entire countries will fall into chaos instead. There is more than one way to cut demand.

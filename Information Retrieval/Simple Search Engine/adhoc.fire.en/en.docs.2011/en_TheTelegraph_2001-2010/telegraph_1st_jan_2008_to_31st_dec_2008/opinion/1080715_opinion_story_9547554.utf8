	Had the pillars of Western democracy been more mindful of the lessons of history, they would have avoided their recent embarrassment over Zimbabwe at the United Nations security council. The decision by Russia and China to veto targeted sanctions on Robert Mugabes reign of terror not only raised the spectre of Cold War but also made evident the determining influence of these two nations on global politics. More tellingly, the United States of America and its favourite protg, the United Kingdom, were left frothing at the mouth by the twisted sleight of hand of another ghost, that of the imperialist past. It was incredibly arrogant, even insidious, of the Western leaders to press ahead with the sanctions despite the unequivocal opposition of all the African countries invited to the G8 summit. The sanction on Mr Mugabe by the European Union in 2002 was resisted with equal gusto by the African Union. The proposed Africa-Europe summit in 2003 had to be deferred till 2007, when the EU travel ban on Mr Mugabe was lifted.        
	The imposition of an arms embargo and travel ban on Mr Mugabe and 13 top officials in his government were unlikely to bring down the oppressive regime. Sanctions would neither have eased the surreal rate of inflation  over two million per cent now  nor stopped the oppression of the cadre of Movement for Democratic Change, the opposition party led by Morgan Tsvangirai. If anything, Mr Mugabe would have got a convenient alibi to explain the economic crisis and a better opportunity to rally support against his arch-enemy, the Imperialist West  the abiding challenge to African sovereignty. If Europe, with its memory of Holocaust, is intensely wary of the consequences of a non-interventionist foreign policy and of the dangers of unfettered national self-determination, then Africa, scarred by colonial rule, is eager to safeguard its autonomy by keeping old enemies at bay. Sanctions go way back to 432 BC when the Athenians put trading restrictions on Megara, leading to the great Peloponnesian War. But their effectiveness have been tried and tested in bizarre ways. Sanctions have mostly encouraged subversive behaviour rather than repentance: Castro remained indefatigable, an indigenous arms industry flourished in South Africa, North Korea sustained a Stalinist tyranny and an underground nuclear programme. The Zimbabwean dystopia, too, would not have got any better.

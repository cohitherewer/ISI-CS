	Speaking in a forked tongue                  
	Sir  While standing at a bus stop in Tinsukia some days back, I heard a few men from the tea-tribes (adivasis, to be politically correct) talking among themselves in chaste Assamese. That very day I read about Salkhan Murmu, the national president of the Jharkhand Disom Party, demanding the recognition of the adivasi language in Assam. The adivasis had migrated to Assam more than 100 years ago and have now adopted the Assamese way of life. If they do not think of themselves as separate from the Assamese, why should politicians make them feel that way?           
	Yours faithfully,        Aditya Singha, Dibrugarh 
        
	Death on the road          
	Sir  The way in which the giraffe, Sundar, had to die is a glaring instance of the irresponsibility of forest and zoo authorities (Giraffe dies in road accident, May 25). Sundar was being transported from the Calcutta zoo to Nandankanan in Orissa in a wooden crate with his neck sticking out from the top. He died of electrocution when his uncovered neck came in contact with overhead power lines. Apparently, neither the zoo authorities nor the veterinary doctor present found anything wrong with the mode of transportation. Even a lay man knows that if an animal has to travel a long distance, it should at least be kept comfortable and safe.           
	When we visited Konarak some years ago, we were amazed to see a giraffe sculpted on the temple wall. A medieval king had received the giraffe as a present from Africa, and the animal had evidently survived the journey. So we have not progressed at all, it seems.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Sundar was one of the star attractions of Alipore zoo. His towering form and long strides were a delight to watch. Children loved him. The Calcutta zoo has got a lot of rare animals from Nandankanan in exchange for Sundar. But he will be missed.           
	How could the zoo authorities have been so callous as to transport Sundar in the way they did? It is even more appalling that Sundars escorts decided to continue the journey after he was injured instead of bringing him back. It was entirely possible to avert this death.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Jyoti Prakash Basu, Calcutta

      
	Sir  By highlighting the death of Sundar, The Telegraph has brought two points to the fore: the absolute lack of professionalism in the handling of animals in India, and the increasing focus of the media on instances of official callousness. It is useless to blame the authorities at Nandankanan alone for Sundars death. When Alipore zoo was sending the animal, it should have had adequate knowledge about whether the giraffe could endure the long journey in the heat. The glaring lack of coordination between the two zoo authorities is also unbelievable. Had they been in constant touch, Sundar might have been saved. This mishap makes it clear that officials, even zoo officials, can never be genuine animal lovers.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Surajit Das, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The first post-mortem report of Sundars death has revealed that the giraffe died of a high voltage electric shock. Indian electricity rules drafted in 1956 say that a low-tension overhead line crossing a road should be at least 19 feet above ground level. If it is a high-tension line, the minimum vertical clearance should be no less than 20 feet. This stipulation is obviously not adhered to by the state electricity boards, leading to deaths on roads and highways. Electricity authorities are as much responsible for Sundars death as those of the zoo.           
	Yours faithfully,

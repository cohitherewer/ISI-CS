	The World is What it is: The Authorized Biography of V.S. Naipaul By Patrick French, Picador, Rs 595        
	Form is a secret, usually unacknowledged, problem in the composition of a biography. This is especially the case when the subject is living: if the narrative cannot be sealed by death, what recourse does the biographer have? Patrick Frenchs solution to this problem is to use the death of Naipauls first wife Patricia (of cancer, in 1996) as a moment of closure in a life that appears in other ways to have moved away from her. It suggests, as nothing else could, how important Patricia really was to Naipaul the writer. Since her death, he has written nothing of consequence; whether he ever will again is doubtful. The extent of this dependence tells us something about both man and writer. As a man Naipaul appears to have been unusually close, in a series of difficult, egotistic relationships, to members of his immediate family, and as a writer he appears to have drawn sustenance, not so much from literary predecessors and contemporaries as from the frustrated literary ambitions of his father and the readerly devotion and advice of his wife. This makes Naipaul, warts and all, the ideal subject of a literary biography, for there is little in the writing that cannot be referred, in one way or another, to the life.        
	Naipaul had already made gestures towards the composition of a life: in some of the essays, in the incomplete narratives of A Way in the World (1994) and most importantly, in Between Father and Son: Family Letters (1999). What French has drawn on, in addition to these and other writings, are his extensive conversations with Naipaul himself, and the more than 50,000 pieces of paper deposited in the University of Tulsas Naipaul archive. These include Patricias journals as well as his own. Naipaul had never bothered to read his wifes record of her life with him, and he made, apparently, no objection to the deeply unflattering portrait of himself that emerged from the exercise of historical reconstruction. Here, as always, he appears to have been no less than honest, however painful the consequence. As a man, as a writer, he is what he is.         
	It would be a mistake, however, to sensationalize the pieces of information that have so far provided grist to the gossip-mongers mill: the visits to prostitutes, the cruelty to his first wife, the abusive relationship with his mistress, Margaret. Some of these facts were already known, and any examined life will usually reveal the extent of the viciousness of which human beings are capable. Sometimes that realization extends to the writer of the account, as in the case of Paul Therouxs Sir Vidias Shadow. That Naipaul has made no attempt to conceal his faults, submitting himself to the judgment of history, is a measure of the degree to which he acknowledges his own indebtedness to the people who made him what he is. His prickly, self-conscious, unashamed egotism feeds off other people and converts them to his own use, to the service of his lifelong project of being a writer.        
	It is a part of the writers morality, Adorno said, not to be at home in his home. A writers home is in words, and it is there that he must fortify himself against the pains and perils of the creative process. Naipaul appears to have learnt this lesson early: never at home in Trinidad, and escaping from the island with a scholarship, he moves from lodging to lodging in Oxford and London, restless and uneasy, but rarely failing to write letters to his family. French traces, in admirable detail and with an unsparing, critical eye towards the self-revealing event or episode, Naipauls loneliness, his fierce conviction of his own worth, and his struggle with countless humiliations and privations (especially from the richer branch of his family represented by his uncle, Rudranath Capildeo). The Capildeo clan (unfairly depicted by the Tulsi family in A House for Mr Biswas) is the first object of Naipauls corrosive hatred, but it is a hatred that extends to the entire milieu of violence, privation and want in which his earliest years were spent. Frenchs account of this early period, usefully grounded in a historical account of the arrival of Indian indentured labourers, including Naipauls maternal grandfather, in Trinidad, is illuminating and precise. Little is known of his fathers family history: characteristically, Seepersad Naipaul seems a man without a past, a man stumbling awkwardly towards a future not his to grasp. In a way it is this absence of history that draws Naipaul towards a father whose own failures and frustrations as a writer are within the sons ability to compensate.        
	In Frenchs crowded, busy narrative, Naipauls own life is a ceaseless engagement with history, whether it is through the people he meets or the places he visits. His literary milieu in London, changing over the years to a point where he comes to be lionized by the rich and the famous, who put up with his rudeness and vanity, is less appealing than the circles to which he is admitted abroad. Like Tagore and Graham Greene before him, he meets Victoria Ocampo in Buenos Aires, and is predictably rude about Borges, who was also present, in a later estimate. But his most signal rudenesses are reserved not for people but for countries, states or races. Travelling in Africa and Asia, he finds little to commend and much to condemn. Most interesting from our point of view are the long and exhaustively researched accounts of his trips to India. Unexpectedly, we find that the journey that produced An Area of Darkness actually included a longish, fairly happy stay in Kashmir, where Vidia wrote Mr Stone and the Knights Companion. (An Area of Darkness, by contrast, was written in London.) French contextualizes the writing of Naipauls three books on India by interviewing the friends whose hospitality he enjoyed (and sometimes betrayed), including the late Ravi Dayal. This contextualization, drawing upon substantial and on the whole careful research, succeeds as little else could in making sense of Naipauls Indian journeys and their frequently disappointing products.         
	French is perhaps less good on the major literary products of Naipauls imagination, the novels. But his book does not set out to be a critical analysis of the writer, it is an account of the man. It admits us into the nature of writing as an extension of living, and examines the fictions and frauds into which the writer is drawn, but must resist. What impresses us most about Frenchs project is the honesty it shares with its subject. As a writer, Naipaul subscribes to few illusions; it is fitting that a narrative of his life should dispel them. Crowded, various, vividly anecdotal and endlessly surprising, Patrick Frenchs life of Naipaul will be difficult to supersede.

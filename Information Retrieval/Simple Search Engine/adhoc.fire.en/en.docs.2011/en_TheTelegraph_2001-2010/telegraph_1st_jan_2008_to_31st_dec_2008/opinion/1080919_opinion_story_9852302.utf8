The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A dandy in action
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A DANDY IN ACTION                          - The UPA had believed that Islamism was not Indias problem        Swapan Dasgupta                                              
	The worst thing that happened to the Manmohan Singh government in the past seven days was not the serial blasts in the national capital. Far more devastating than the momentary panic that gripped Lutyens Delhi last Saturday evening was the wave of derision that greeted the home minister, Shivraj Patil, the man in charge of internal security.        
	It is one thing for a minister to be attacked for incompetence and ineffectiveness but it stretches the bounds of political endurance to be mocked and ridiculed in a time of national crisis. Jawaharlal Nehrus favourite ideologue, the irascible V.K. Krishna Menon, had to confront this in the aftermath of the 1962 debacle. He could never recover from the taunt of facilitating the manufacture of coffee percolators in the ordnance factories. As a matter of fact, neither could Nehru. The disastrous Sino-Indian war broke him emotionally and damaged his governments credibility irreparably. The Congress had to encash every last paisa of the Independence dividend to remain afloat politically.        
	The depiction of the home minister as an incorrigible dandy, more interested in his personal appearance than the security of citizens, may well be a caricature. However, black humour has often captured the public mood more succinctly than fiery denunciations on television talk shows, not least because it corresponds to perceived reality. Patil may have made only a nominal contribution to the United Progressive Alliance governments decision in 2004 to scrap existing anti-terror legislation and focus on the roots of terror. It was a political decision that stemmed from the belief that Islamism was not an Indian problem and that the socio-economic betterment of minorities through covert affirmative action would firewall India against a global menace. At the time the UPA assumed power, Indias liberal establishment believed  and not entirely without justification  that the spectacular terrorist attacks during the National Democratic Alliances tenure were the handiwork of imported mujahedin from Pakistan, with only a sprinkling of local involvement. The priority, therefore, was to apply international pressure on Pakistan to call off its dogs and give local Muslims a symbolic sop by scrapping the Prevention of Terrorism Act.              
	The problem with this seemingly electorally-savvy approach was not that it was inherently flawed but that a policy option became an article of faith. As the Bharatiya Janata Party stepped up the pressure to resurrect Pota  as if this was the magic weapon against terrorism  the Congress and its allies dug in their heels deeper. The face-off may well have helped the government consolidate its support among the Muslim communities had ground realities not changed dramatically.        
	The belief that the roots of terror were grounded in material deprivation and not ideological subversion led to an overall laxity in policing. Whereas under the NDA, the thrust of counter-terrorism was the detection and elimination of the so-called Inter-Services Intelligence sleeper cells, the UPA shifted the focus to political intelligence gathering. This became the core competence of the intelligence agencies. During the trust vote in July, for example, the sleuths did a thoroughly professional job identifying the vulnerabilities of Opposition members of parliament.        
	The erosion of an intelligence network geared to counter-terrorism led to a commensurate fall in the quantum of actionable intelligence. The interrogation of some of the suspects in the Ahmedabad blasts case produced the information that a terrorist strike in Delhi was imminent and that a reconnaissance of potential targets had already been conducted. The information was promptly passed on by the chief minister, Narendra Modi, to the prime minister and the national security adviser. Of course, the interrogations didnt reveal the date, time and exact location of the blasts but the job of the police is to convert raw intelligence into actionable intelligence. The Central agencies neither bothered to rush to Ahmedabad to question the suspects, nor did they alert the policing network in Delhi and the neighbouring states. Arguably, the Delhi blasts may not have been averted but it was the indifference to raw intelligence that testifies to the rot in internal security  a shortcoming the prime minister has now admitted.        
	Some of the callousness may stem from indifference, but most of it has its origins in the partisan perception of internal security. Till it was apparent that the Delhi blasts had been carried out by the same group responsible for the bombings in Ahmedabad and Jaipur, it had become customary for the Centre to run down the threats in states run by the BJP and its allies. In 2004, political abuse was showered on the Modi government for the killing of Ishrat Jehan, a student of Mumbais Khalsa College. A shrill campaign was mounted suggesting that this was a cold-blooded murder of an innocent Muslim girl. The abuse ended abruptly after the Lashkar-e-Toiba website owned up to Ishrat Jehan being one its martyrs.        
	It was this same mindset that was in evidence at the Union cabinet meeting after the Ahmedabad blasts. One of the more flamboyant ministers with literary pretensions asserted that the blasts had been masterminded by Modi himself to whip up communal frenzy. At least two important leaders of smaller parties holding important portfolios agreed. Subsequently, after the Gujarat police arrested a large number of suspects and identified the command structure of the infamous Indian Mujahideen, a veritable whos who of Uttar Pradesh politics travelled to Azamgarh to commiserate with the father of one of the alleged masterminds of the conspiracy. Last Wednesday, Muslim leaders in Mumbai organized a provocative press conference where it was aggressively asserted that Abdul Subhan Qureishi alias Tauqeer, suspected to be the groups main bomb-maker, was innocent. An understandably distraught mother was brought before TV cameras to say that her son should not be condemned before he is found guilty. The hunt for Tauqeer was painted as a Modi-BJP conspiracy to harass innocent Muslims. The irony is that the more the secular establishment protests and gets into denial mode, the more brownie points Modi earns from Middle India.        
	The growing perception that the UPA government is both wary and afraid of confronting the terrorists has complicated matters for the Congress. As elections approach and the bombings persist, the fatalistic acceptance of civilian casualties may no longer be the natural response of India. Yet, if Middle India retaliates electorally, can the UPA be certain of consolidating the margins?              
	In a provocative contribution to the identity debate, a Muslim writer has suggested that the Congresss bid to retain the minority vote is an exercise in futility. He has argued that an emerging alliance of Muslims, Christians, Dalits and Naxalites will shape the electoral outcome in 200 parliamentary seats  to the detriment of the national parties. The implications of India being confronted by a pincer offensive of terrorism and sectarian blackmail are ominous.        
	The Congress has reason to be concerned at the prospect of being squeezed between a bellicose Moditva and a vengeful minorityism that may rally behind Mayavati. The Gujarat chief minister has already become a national icon for those Indians who want aggressive modernization to be complemented by a robust, no-nonsense administration. He could emerge as Indias Vladimir Putin. Against this, the meekness of Manmohan Singh may be at a very serious disadvantage. Fortunately for the Congress, Modi is not fighting this election; he is at best a mascot. The Congress is toying with the option of going into battle wearing the BJPs headgear, if not its clothes. Will this accretion be more reassuring to Middle India? Or, has the image of an ineffective dandy become too deeply ingrained?

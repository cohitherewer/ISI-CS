	Not many books eleven years old deserve to be renoticed. But Ive just bought the third edition of Fowlers Modern English Usage. Or so its publishers, Oxford University Press, called it when it came out in late 1996. I reviewed it for The Economist, and Im ever more impressed. Its a fat book 873 pages, in my paperback version  but if you can afford the shelf space and the money (the Indian paperback edition costs Rs 395), theres no better guide.        
	Its one real error is its title. As I wrote at the time, it should be called Burchfields Modern English Usage. Its reviser, R.W. Burchfield, had spent many years editing the Oxford English Dictionary. He had at his command its vast paper and electronic databases, beside a personal one of current usage built up in the Eighties and Nineties. And he knew far more about the history of English words and usage than H.W. Fowler did, or indeed than anyone could have, when Fowlers book first came out in 1926. A second edition, in 1965, was only lightly revised. This third one is not a brand-new work, but it is very different.        
	Fowlers aim was basically prescriptive. His early years, from 1872 to 1899, were spent teaching classical languages and English at a public school. In those days most educated Englishmen spoke and wrote much as he did and taught his pupils to; and others, all agreed, should try to do the same. His target, as he once put it, was the half-educated Englishman. Todays scholarship is much more descriptive, recording how English is used, not only how it ought to be.                 
	Good sense        
	Besides, though he accepted Americas right to its version of the language, Fowlers concern was strictly the British one. Burchfield, in contrast, drew equally on British and American sources, with input also from Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand (though not India: he discusses stay, for instance, as a rival to stop for reside temporarily, but not for doing so long-term. A later reviser of Burchfields work will surely cast his net more widely).        
	In both respects, Fowlers book, as Burchfield fairly says, is by now a fossil, a monument, albeit enduring, to the standard English of southern England in the early 20th century. But it is seldom wrong, and it is always fun, full of his idiosyncrasies and sense of humour. Much of this, happily, Burchfield has preserved, while adding many individual touches of his own. He offers, for instance, po-faced, a wholly superfluous note on epistemic modality, an invention (it seems: Im happy never to have heard of it) of modern grammarians, and Ill wager he was chuckling as he wrote it.         
	He retains some weak bits of Fowler, such as a note on ambiguous uses of too which not only is unconvincing but also omits that truly ambiguous phrase I cannot commend too highly. In contrast, he knocks down Fowler on literary words, arguing that, since literature today accepts almost any word, there are no literary ones. That is utter illogic. Its also untrue: next time you spot a stream flooding a field, tell your friends the freshet oerspreads the lea, and see how many understand you.         
	But those are niggles. Overall, what marks Burchfields book is his knowledge of the history of individual words and usages, and his robust good sense on contested issues such as sexist language, the split infinitive, like/as or hopefully. He has good advice on countless small points, and most large ones, all of it as good in India as Britain. To anyone at times unsure Is this English?  which certainly includes me  I commend this book. Highly.        
	And no, I have no link whatever with its publishers.                    thewordcageyahoo.co.uk

	Microsofts unsolicited bid for Yahoo is an effort by the dominant offline franchise to become a dominant online one. The future of information technology is perceived to be cloud computing. This is the move away from the personal computer to the use of the internet for what are essentially offline tasks like word-processing. The other rationale for the deal for Microsoft is simple: combining its core businesses with Yahoos internet businesses will help meet the challenge that Google poses. It is also about advertising and audience: Microsofts internet business revenues are about one-sixth of Googles. With Yahoos email and instant messaging users, the audience of the combined company  it has been named Microhoo  could grow enormously. Potentially, analysts say, it could become 40 per cent of the market. That would be a threat to Googles dominance there.
    
	The merger will come with many challenges: first, there is duplication. Both Microsoft and Yahoo have email and instant messaging services. It seems that Yahoo has a larger user base, and users find Yahoo mail better: which leaves Microsoft with the interesting problem of what to do with Windows Live. Both companies also have co-ownerships in several large countries, including Australia and India. Many of the partners are also commercial rivals in those markets. This can make integration between the two companies difficult. In most services, Yahoo is doing better, sometimes twice as better: what that will mean for the retention of the Microsoft brand in these services is an open question. Finally, there is the question of culture. For Yahoo, that is a critical part of its success; the return of the founders, Jerry Yang and David Filo, to the helm of affairs notwithstanding, employees could still leave in droves.
    
	But the merger is not a fait accompli. While the board of Yahoo is considering the offer, Google has raised unfair competition concerns, suggesting that Microsoft could exert the same kind of control over internet services that it sought to exert in the PC market. Both Yahoo and Microsoft are similar in that they are centralized: Yahoo is a portal that owns and controls content, brings in the audience and bombards them with advertisements. Microsoft has long been considered a closed company in an open era. Google, on the other hand, comes with its tools, and can be distributed by users. The merger can even be good news for Google. It has about $8.5 billion in cash, after recently completing a secondary offering. That gives the company carte blanche for other large acquisitions, if needed. More important, while two large companies are busy working out the integration plan, Google can march ahead merrily in the confusion to make further gains of market share in both search and advertising.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | How to ruin a splendid chance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       HOW TO RUIN A SPLENDID CHANCE                                  The Left Front may project itself as best suited to run the economy, but Kerala and West Bengal tell another story, writes Satrujit Banerjee                          Hope abandoned                                  
	As the Left Front was initially instrumental in the survival of the current Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, it is understandable that it had a major say in economic policy-making on the national scene. While the benefits of the Common Minimum Programme steered by the Left may be endlessly debated, arguably the biggest casualty was economic reforms, which could not be undertaken due to the Lefts persistent objections. Since the Left parties project themselves as the foremost protector of the weaker sections and as those ideologically best equipped to run the economy, let us examine how they have fared in the two prime bastions of communism in India  West Bengal and Kerala.        
	West Bengal presents a unique example in a democracy. It is a state where a single political entity has been in power uninterruptedly for over 30 years. While sceptics may cite lack of a credible opposition as the sole reason, there is no doubt that two landmark reforms immensely helped the Left cause in its first decade of power. Launched in 1978, the panchayat raj brought about major social changes in the villages by giving a platform, for the first time, to the have-nots. The second reform, which took a longer time to shape up, was land reforms or Operation Barga. It was, without doubt, long overdue, even if the process of its implementation was tilted towards boosting the vote bank insofar as it gave a much higher share of the crop to tillers of the land, who formed the majority. But as the Left Front dug deep, snuffing out any opposition, corruption, mainly in the form of cronyism, set in and the gloss on reforms began to fade after a decade. When one adds up the money that has been given to the panchayats over the years, the Left has little to show for it. It is no secret that panchayats dole out benefits selectively to their own cadre, who in turn show their gratitude by committing themselves to the Left cause. Betterment of villages can wait.               
	The other significant factor contributing towards a downturn in the economy of the state is the militancy of the labour unions. It was indeed strange to see the government in power driving away industries and discouraging new ones unless they towed the militant line of the Left. Not surprisingly, the industrial downturn in the state over the last 20 odd years has been fast and furious. In comparing the performance of the state with others in the country, it must be borne in mind that when the Left Front came to power, West Bengal was ranked either at the top or among the top three of all leading economic indicators. As of 2005, comparison with developed states like Punjab, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh provides dismal reading. West Bengal is sixth in per capita domestic product and last in per capita consumption of electricity. The percentage of electrified villages and households is the lowest. It has the lowest per capita budgeted expenditure on education and thus, not surprisingly, the least number of middle and secondary schools. It shares the dubious distinction of having the lowest literary rate with Punjab.         
	But by far the most shocking fact is that after 30 uninterrupted years of being ruled by a supposedly pro-poor party, West Bengal has the largest percentage of people living below the poverty line. The reality is that, for the last decade, the state has been in the throes of a cash crunch and is not in a position to invest in social causes. The revised estimates of the 2003-04 budget show that wages, pension and interest payments constitute 101 per cent of the revenue receipts and, of this, interest liability alone is 43.3 per cent  the highest among 15 states. Over the last decade, the government borrowed at an average rate of around 13 per cent while its revenues grew by 11 per cent. Of late, when the cost of borrowing has come down to around 11 per cent, the growth in revenues has slumped to less than 9 per cent. To overcome this, the state plans to borrow more!         
	Kerala provides a lesson in how to destroy an economy poised for the big leap. Back in 1975, a United Nations report hailed the states impressive advances in spheres of health and education. Certainly, its Human Development Indices  elimination of poverty, primary level education and health care  are impressive by any standards and when compared with other Indian states, is simply staggering. Life expectancy is nearly 74 years and literacy an astounding 95 per cent compared to the national 63 years and 65 per cent respectively. It has the most favourable sex ratio in the country, which, according to the 2001 Census, is 1,058 women to 1,000 men. With a birth rate at around the replacement level of 18 per thousand, and falling, it is lowest in India by a long shot. Per capita, Kerala spends 36 per cent more on education and an impressive 46 per cent more on health than the national average.         
	But not everything is hunky-dory in the state. Frequently overlooked is the fact that Kerala is poor even by Indias standards, with an annual per capita income 5 per cent lower than the national average. Unemployment is in excess of 20 per cent among its educated masses and is the worst in the country. Add to this its 1.8 million migrant workers and you wonder what the state of affairs would have been had they decided to stay back!               
	Ever since Kerala gained statehood in 1956, it has been governed by the undivided Communist Party of India, a coalition led by its Marxist wing after the division of the party, interspersed by Congress-led coalitions. But whichever party ruled the state, along with its reputation as the frontrunner in the Human Development Indices, it also acquired a reputation as a place hostile to business, with heavy regulation, militant trade unions and frequent strikes. As a result, most private businesses left the state. Public sector companies, too, have been wary and not invested heavily.        
	The irony is that even as Kerala was gaining fame as a preferred place to live in the developing world, large numbers were leaving as early as in the 1970s because not enough worthwhile jobs were available. With its long history of migration to the Gulf countries, employment there seemed a logical choice and today one Keralite among six works overseas and remits a staggering 5 billion dollars annually, augmenting the states economic output by a hefty 25 per cent. Employment abroad, with the family ensconced in India, breeds other problems. Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of liquor and at 28 per lakh, the highest suicide rate, more than twice the national average.         
	So the next time you find Left leaders pleading for the downtrodden and pontificating that only they can deliver this country from its miseries, remind yourself of the track record of their two showcase economies and how other investor-friendly states are handling their economies better.

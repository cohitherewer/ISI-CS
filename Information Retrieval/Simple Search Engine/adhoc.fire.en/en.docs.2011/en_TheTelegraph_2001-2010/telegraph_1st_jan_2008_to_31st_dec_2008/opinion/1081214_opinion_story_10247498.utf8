	Honours even                  
	Sir  In cricketing terms, the assembly poll series between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party featured three ODIs (Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram) and two Tests (Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan). The Congress won two of the three ODIs, while the Test series was drawn. In MP, the BJP scored a century, while in Rajasthan, the Congress missed the mark by two runs. Out of the total runs scored (as in the number of assembly seats won), the Congress made 279, and the BJP 294. The honours were thus shared at the days end.           
	Yours faithfully,        S.K. Sharma, Calcutta
        
	Iron hand          
	Sir  The borderland and its zero people (Dec 9), by Aveek Sen, leaves no room for doubt that the Border Security Force personnel are worse than the terrorists who attacked Mumbai. The militants were waging war against the people of an enemy nation. But BSF jawans are guilty of abusing and killing their own countrymen whom they are supposed to protect. A lot has been written about the Mumbai attack, and the entire nation has mourned the victims who lost their lives in the carnage. However, neither the governments  both in Bengal and in Delhi nor the media seem to be bothered about the atrocities perpetrated by the BSF in Bengals villages near the Bangladesh border. Some years ago, Dhananjoy Chatterjee was deservedly hanged for murdering Hetal Parekh. There is no reason why the jawan, who shot and killed 18-year-old Khukuli Khatun in cold blood, should not be meted out the same fate.           
	Sen writes that villagers in Khatuns village passing by the BSF camp are made to get off the van and pay respect to the national flag inside. Shouldnt the government civilize the BSF first so that the soldiers learn to respect the people who make up this country?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

      
	Sir  The police and the Border Security Force are blamed for every law and order problem, as well as lapses near the border. But these men are doing their jobs, and reaping rich rewards for them too. No truck can ply on the highways without the driver paying the cops. Similarly, taxi drivers, vendors in railway stations or hawkers on footpaths in Calcutta have to bribe the police to be able to ply their trade. Even in Mumbais Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, I have seen policemen waiting and watching goods being loaded on to the trains, and then collecting money from the labourers. So let us stop blaming securitymen, or else give them some other jobs to do. Let us also elect people who can direct the men in uniform to do what Indians expect to be done in these matters.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sukumar Roy, Kharagpur

                
	Sir  Aveek Sens article about the death of Khukuli Khatun in a Nadia village was wonderful and heartbreakingly sad. It also came as a surprise because news today seems to be dominated by trivia. Khukuli, when she spelled her name out to the nurses in clear English with her dying breath, was staking her presence in life, like she did when she stamped her feet and demanded an education, a thing that can sometimes become a double-edged sword in our villages. Khukulis name will remain etched in our consciousness, thanks to Sens lovely article, and I hope to find more such stories in The Telegraph.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Pratiti Basu Sarkar, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  That villagers living near the Bangladesh border suffer in the hands of defence personnel is well known. The media, government and NGOs should come together to put an end to their troubles soon.          
	Yours faithfully,

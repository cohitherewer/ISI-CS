	Turning to the government for organizing the unorganized is an ambiguous reflex for a modern democracy. It speaks of some sort of civic scruple, but it also betrays a lack of independent initiative. It is particularly ironic that a group of successful directors and producers from Mumbai have asked the State for help with stopping the exploitation of junior actors and performers  extras  in the film industry. Bollywood, so much a world in itself, is perhaps the industry that has, more than any other, the resources to be autonomous and self-regulating. From taxes to censorship, it has always tried to prove that it is a law unto itself. So, it does look rather odd when such a deputation approaches, of all Central ministries, that of women and child development, to draw up guidelines for the rights of junior performers, especially those who are female. Amusingly, the ministry itself is rather taken aback by this gesture, and is unsure of how to respond. The fact that the minister is away getting her daughter married adds a delightfully Bollywoodish touch to the situation.        
	But why should so many creative and enterprising individuals not be able to think up a plan for themselves, especially when they are prompted by what looks like the goodness of their hearts? There must be a way of working with the existing labour laws to ensure proper guidelines, supplemented with innovative consciousness-raising efforts. To turn to the government is to pave the way for continuing interventions and regulation that would be difficult for Bollywood to put up with eventually. The Indian State finds it difficult to draw up benchmarks and then withdraw, and usually demands a mile when given an inch. It is good that the issue of organizing and regulating the unorganized elements in the industry has come up from within. But the industry should also try to take upon itself the task of finding the solutions.

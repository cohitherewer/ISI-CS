	When Manchester United met Chelsea in the Uefa Champions League finals last month, several soccer debates came to a head. The most important question was whether the Premier League was doing English football any favour by taking in so many foreign players. Think of some of the stars that Manchester and Chelsea looked towards for bringing home the coveted trophy: Nemanja Vidic (Serbia), Patrice Evra (France), Nani (Portugal) for Manchester; Didier Drogba (Ivory Coast), Florent Malouda (France), Michael Essien (Ghana) for Chelsea. No wonder England was out of the action in this years Euro, said many hurt Englishmen, including Premier League chairman Sir David Richards. On the other hand, in India or Malaysia or Japan, the finals totted up a larger TV viewership than domestic soccer encounters in these countries have done in recent times.         
	Rick Glanvills CHELSEA FOOTBALL CLUB: THE OFFICIAL HISTORY IN PICTURES (Headline,  12.00) comes at a time when Chelsea, Arsenal and ManU have become household names far out of the British Isles. From being treated as a music hall joke (from its mention in stand-up comedian George Robeys act), the Blues, as Chelsea is fondly known, have indeed come a long way. The picture at the bottom is of the clubs FA Cup side of 1923, when football was still just a game. It is interesting, however, that the foreword to the book has been written by Italian Gianfranco Zola (who played for the club between 1996 and 2003, seen holding aloft the Cup-Winners Cup with Vialli in 1998, top left), and not by John Terry, the most successful captain in Chelseas history (not seen in the picture, top right). No less interesting is the fact that the club had its two most glorious runs under foreign coaches  Gianluca Vialli (1998-2000) and Jos Mourinho (2004-2007). Mourinho (picture, left), with two League Cups, two Premier Leagues, an FA Cup and a Community Shield, lived up to his boast, I am not one from the bottle; I am a special one.        
	It was in 2003 that Chelsea was bought by the Russian billionaire, Roman Abramovich. In this little detail of footballing history lies the bigger story of the marriage of free market and soccer. Be it the Americans, Malcolm Glazer (ManU), George Gillet and Tom Hicks (Liverpool), or the former Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra (Manchester City), English football clubs are virtually run now by money from other countries. In a similar way, the fan base of these clubs are spreading like never before into Asian countries, which have a nominal presence in world football. It is also worth pondering how many of the stars of the English clubs would be in the wilderness  since their national sides are too weak to qualify for major international tournaments  if European club football had not gathered such a huge following.

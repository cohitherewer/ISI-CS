	The urge to be different may become addictive. So potent is the addiction that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has put at the head of its list of members of parliament the name of Somnath Chatterjee, the speaker of the Lok Sabha. The party has ignored the fact that the Lok Sabha speaker can no longer be listed as a party MP. The speakers chair is above all political parties, else he cannot preside over debates in parliament. But the CPI(M) is in no mood to pay attention to such niceties. The list of MPs withdrawing support from the United Progressive Alliance is a bit longer with the addition of Mr Chatterjees name and, it is implied, that would transform into one more vote when the confidence motion takes place.        
	The act of listing Mr Chatterjees name among the MPs has implications on many levels. But first and foremost, it shows disrespect towards the Constitution and towards the speakers post. While it is an MP who has to be elected speaker by the other members of the house, once elevated to that chair, he becomes strictly non-partisan, and owes no loyalty to any party. As a matter of fact, should the speaker express any such attachment, he betrays the high office given him. A speaker does not vote in the house unless it is needed to break a tie. The principle of non-partisanship is so well-defined that in the usage of Britain  from which India has drawn much of its Constitution  the speaker of the House of Commons refrains from party politics even after his term in the house is over. Mr Chatterjee is acutely aware of the neutrality and dignity of the speakers position, as his latest remarks and the statement from his secretariat make clear. The argument of the Left Front that he came into parliament as a CPI(M) MP and hence must leave his post when the CPI(M) withdraws its support to the government is false logic, employed to disguise  not very well  a motive that can hardly be called noble. There is, at another level although allied to this attitude, an indirect instruction to Mr Chatterjee himself. There has been no report of any discussion between the Mr Chatterjee and the CPI(M) preceding the making of the MPs list. Hence his name on the list functions as a message to him  to up and leave. But then, the CPI(M) was never known for its propriety, good manners or a sense of place.         
	The other argument being offered is that the speakers position is given to an MP from one of the parties in government or in support. With the CPI(M) gone, someone from the UPA or its supporting parties should take over as speaker. This argument is based on custom, not principle, and simply drags the institution of speaker down into unnecessary controversy. In withdrawing support, the CPI(M) has not exactly covered itself in glory. By creating turbulence around the speakers chair, it is merely worsening the mess.

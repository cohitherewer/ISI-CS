	 It is difficult to guess who in the UPA is happier after winning the trust vote. Whether it is Manmohan Singh, on saving his kursi, or his Congress colleagues, on discovering the PMs politicking skills. P.V. Narasimha Rao, considered the modern-day Chanakya, may have been Singhs guru in politics, but Congressmen were sceptical about the shishyas political dexterity. All that has changed, thanks to Singhs performance in the number game. When DMKs Dayanidhi Maran announced that he will abstain from voting, clever Manmohan pressed Kamal Nath to change Marans mind. A call was put through to Chennai, as per Marans wishes, and he fell in line. Not only Maran, but several others reportedly received calls from the PM, whose short, but sweet, conversations helped garner crucial support. Congressmen, who only knew of Manmohanomics only, are now marvelling at the PMs bag of political tricks as well.                
	 A lot can change in a day in politics. LK Advani seems to have discovered this bit of wisdom too late in the day. On the eve of the vote, BJP leaders, including Advani, were sitting pretty, confident that none in their camp would jump the ship. Instead, they were worried that the Congress would try and win over allies such as the Akalis, BJD and Shiv Sena by promising them sacks of goodies. The task of garnering the support of party MPs was left to the respective chief ministers. On the other hand, a lot more care was given to the job of ensuring that the allies in the fold did not flee to the other side. So much so that the BJP central leadership spent hours trying to extract promises from top allied leaders in this regard. At the end of the day, however, it was Advani and Co. who were in for a nasty surprise. They discovered, to their chagrin, that it was the BJP that had suffered the most desertions during the vote of confidence. It was found that no less than six BJP MPs had cross-voted, one had abstained, and two were absent from the proceedings. These days, the grapevine tells us, BJPwallahs are spending their time preaching to themselves that people in glass houses shouldnt throw stones.                            
	 Some call India Youngistan, but politics in this country is still a haven for the aged. The parliament, for instance, is full of wise, old men and the government took good care of them, just to make sure that these ripe old souls survived the tense floor test. An emergency drill was ordered days before, extra beds and chairs were kept ready at hand, and leave for senior doctors were cancelled. All this was in addition to the regular fleet of doctors and nurses who kept vigil inside parliaments mobile hospital, as well as the ambulances that were parked outside. The government also took care to make the House safe. SPG men were allowed in the officials gallery, and, apparently, Congressmen were instructed to be near those who were under the protection of this force.       
	The aam aadmi were not forgotten in the melee. Special cameras had been installed inside the House to help them get a ringside view of the days events. The net result? The netas survived yet another day at office in one piece, but some viewers may have fallen ill after witnessing the goings-on on that fateful day.                             
	 Still on the trust vote. Uma Bharti seems to be well-versed in the art of statecraft. After all, like most other wily politicians, she too considers an enemys enemy to be a friend. This can well explain why she decided to lend a helping hand to the government during voting the other day. Bharti, one learns, sought out her protg, Chandrabhan Singh, to vote for the ruling coalition. Soon, it was the BJP-mans turn to seek out the saadhvi, after irate party supporters vandalized his home. Bharti bailed Singh out by asking the other Singh, Amar of the SP, to come to his aid. Amar Singh, in turn, got in touch with his new-found friends in the government. Chandrabhan, we are told, is safe now and plans to join Bhartis outfit, the Bharatiya Janshakti Party. And we thought that a good turn seldom counts in the muddy waters of politics.                             
	 Even as his party prepared to bring the government down, BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, we heard, took time off to write a story for a Marathi film. The movie, to be shot in Kolhapur, is directed by a well-known director and is supposedly a satire on the countrys current political situation.       
	Some might wonder why Naqvi is testing other waters at this point of time. Is it possible that Naqvi has taken to writing scripts hoping to get over the nasty shock he and his party received in the parliament recently?           
	 Here is an SMS joke that did the rounds before the T-vote: Prithviraj Chavan says Manmohan Singh will win the trust vote. But the same man had also predicted a victory in Karnataka. The man laughing after the UPAs victory was Chavan himself, and not the anonymous wisecrack. Indeed, Chavan has a lot to smile about these days. The man who had fared disastrously in the assembly elections in Tripura and Meghalaya, and is also said to have committed the Karnataka gaffe, was not considered sharp enough even in his own party. But he proved his mettle recently when he bagged the requisite numbers, virtually from nowhere, during the row over the nuclear deal. But getting the numbers proved to be a difficult task and Chavan, apparently, managed to snatch only a couple of hours sleep during that hectic week. Now, with the government safe on the shore, Chavan surely isnt losing any sleep over such minor irritants as SMS jokes.

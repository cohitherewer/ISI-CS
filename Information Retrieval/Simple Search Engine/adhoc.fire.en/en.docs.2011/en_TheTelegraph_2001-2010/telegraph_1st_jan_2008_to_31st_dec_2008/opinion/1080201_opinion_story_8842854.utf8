	Strange and sublime journeys
       
	JAHAJIN, (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Peggy Mohan unravels how the Bhojpuri language travelled to the distant Caribbeans. The novel is based on the authors work as a linguist in the Seventies, when she documented the life-stories of migrants, settled in Trinidad as indentured labourers. The material that Mohan gathered far exceeded her anthropological interest and took on a life of its own. Jahajin transforms that documentary project into a structured narrative. The novel opens with Deeda, aged 110, telling the narrator the myth of the two monkeys. Subsequently, in bits and pieces, she reveals how, many years ago, the people of her community came to the distant shores of Chini-dad, the land of sugarcane. That journey is recounted in vivid details, turned fantastic by Mohans gift for fiction, literary flair and empathy. Other characters, most memorably the narrators grandmother, intervene gently into the recollections of the Bhojpuri migrants. Stories unfold out of stories, memories grow out of memories, making this a richly nostalgic work.
            
	TOTAL CAPITALISM: MARKET POLITICS, MARKET STATE, (Three Essays Collective, Rs 200) by Colin Leys responds to the contention that the dream of contemporary capitalism is that everything should become a terrain of profitable enterprise, including most of what has hitherto been seen as the business of government. The articles included in this volume  The Rise and Fall of Development Theory, Neo-Liberal Democracy and The Cynical State  explore how governance becomes inflected by market economy in a neo-liberal world. Leys analyses with critical acumen how policy-making, public debate, and political life become affected by total capitalism.
            
	Why Mars amp; Venus Collide, (Harper Element, Rs 295) by John Gray is the companion to the bestseller Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus. To be honest, the sequel does not radically depart (or even differ) from its predecessor. There are the usual what-to-do and what-not-to-do manuals, the familiar advice given to argumentative couples. Apparently, men saying something like Okay, let me make sure I understand you. Are you saying you feel?, instead of a brash That doesnt make any sense, is bound to make the women feel infinitely better and forgiving.

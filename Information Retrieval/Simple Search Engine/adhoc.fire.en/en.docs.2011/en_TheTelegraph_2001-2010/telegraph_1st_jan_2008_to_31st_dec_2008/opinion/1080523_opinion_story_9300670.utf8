	Instead of going down the well-trodden path of depicting Goa as the city of wild pleasures, Tilak Ranjan Bera provides a fresh perspective to the southern state. His Goa is not a sleazy hub for criminals, junkies and disreputable tourists: it is a land of peace. Goa: A Journey and Reminiscence (Woodland, Rs 2,000) is profusely illustrated with scenes that convey the serenity at the heart of this ancient city. There are lush beaches, spectacular temples and churches, archaic bungalows and some stunning flora and fauna. Beras potted history draws our attention away from the seediness that is routinely associated with Goa, particularly since the recent murder of a British teenager there.         
	A doctor by profession, Bera is a keen photographer, traveller and writer. He has chronicled a cultural and anthropological history of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in an earlier book. This one follows more or less a similar approach. The research is extensive, in that Bera does not begin patly with an account of the colonial settlers. He starts with the pre-historic times by describing the invaluable archaeological findings that have been exhumed in and around Goa. There are the ruins of Silahara, Yadava and Kadamba period, going back to the 10th century. More mysterious are the stone carvings, associated with esoteric fertility cults, which lie over a large area on the bank of the Kushavati in the Usgalimol area. Alongside these marvellous edifices is an immense face of Shiva carved on stone by an unknown, modern-day sculptor (bottom right). Together, they convey a sense of timelessness, an assortment of rare moments lying beyond the pale of the popular iconography of Goa.        
	After this overview of hidden treasures, the grandeur of Old Goa could appear almost tame. Some of the most spectacular evidences of Portuguese-Gothic architecture are embodied in the many residential buildings and churches located in the middle of the old city. (Left shows the alter of the Basilica de Bom Jesus church.) The rich Christian heritage is interspersed with some striking Hindu structures  Mangueshi, Saptakoteshwar, Naguesh, Narasimha and Shanta Durga temples (centre bottom)  strewn all over the city. The lurking presence of the Safa Masjid, Buddhist ruins and relics of Jain temples lends a spirit of plurality to Goa that is also reflected in its ethnic multiplicity  in the coexistence of indigenous and foreign sensibilities, traditions, rituals and ways of life.         
	Bera reprints some valuable sketches of natives and sahibs by Antnio Lopes Mendes, who arrived in Goa on an official mission in the late 19th century. His drawing of the Old Goa city arch during its golden Portuguese period appears on centre top. These images provide an ironic parallel to the notoriously decadent beach parties which bring together the East and the West in contemporary Goa. Top right shows one such scene of cultural diversity during one of the dazzling carnivals the city has become famous for.

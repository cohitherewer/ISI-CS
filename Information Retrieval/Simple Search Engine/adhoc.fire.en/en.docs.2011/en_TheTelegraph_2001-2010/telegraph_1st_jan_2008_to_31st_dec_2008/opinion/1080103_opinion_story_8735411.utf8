	Regimes are most vulnerable when they try to bring about big changes. The by-election to the Balagarh assembly constituency did not pose a threat to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees rule in Bengal. But it was expected to show which way the political wind is blowing in the state. The results now confirm the belief that the chief minister and his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), have reasons to be worried. Compared to the partys performance in the last assembly polls, the CPI(M)s vote at Balagarh has dropped by nearly six per cent. Worse, it could have lost the seat if the Trinamul Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, partners in the 2006 elections, fought the by-election together. The principal reason for the erosion of the Marxists support base is obvious. Mr Bhattacharjees administration made many mistakes in pushing for the chemical hub at Nandigram. His party complicated matters for him by trying to usurp the role of the administration. The hopes that the chief minister raised with his agenda of Bengals industrialization were turned into fears at Nandigram, thanks to his partys Stalinist ways. The protests over the events at Nandigram clearly struck a chord with a section of the voters at Balagarh, who may have previously supported the Left.        
	However, elections are no measure of the wisdom behind major policies. Besides, the peoples perceptions of the policies and the impact of these policies on their lives change over time. Certain economic decisions have their political  and electoral  costs. But that cannot be any reason for not pursuing policies that make sound economic sense. Only woolly-headed idealists and incorrigible cynics would deny that Bengal needs more investments for industries and other ventures. Mr Bhattacharjees initiatives to get them have created a new faith in a state that had long been shunned by investors, primarily because of its outdated political culture. In the new economic regime that rewards competition and openness, Bengal cannot afford to fall behind in the race. Balagarh has demonstrated the political risk involved in attempting radical changes. But abandoning the initiatives because of this could be far more risky for Bengals future. Mr Bhattacharjee needs to learn how to make industrialization more acceptable to the people. Dissociating it from his partys politics could be a major step towards that.

	They are among the most-quoted words of recent centuries. But what cant, at the time, they were. We hold these truths to be self-evident, intoned Americas Declaration of Independence in 1776. Really? Truths, yes: most of us today accept them as such. But self-evident?        
	Even now, the world holds plenty of regimes that reject them. In 1776, those who signed the declaration cannot, for five seconds, have thought them self-evident. They were not so to George III, for one; nor to half the educated minds of Europe, let alone the uneducated, brought up, as the poem had it, to ask that: God bless the Squire and his relations,/ And keep us in our proper stations.        
	Indeed, not all the truths listed were self-evident even to those who listed them. All men are created equal? Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? There is a famous medallion from the pottery of Josiah Wedgwood, one of Britains 18th-century enemies of slavery, showing an African in chains, with the message Am I not a man and a brother?. From any slave-owner, as most of the declarations signatories were, the only honest answer was no. The United States of America was born with a falsehood in its mouth. Its people, and many of its foreign admirers, still have one. The phrase, American values, is taken almost for granted. Yet just what are these values?         
	Democracy? The ballot-box was not invented in America but in ancient Athens. True, its use there was open only to male citizens, not to women or slaves. But so too for slaves in the US until the 1860s, and far later for women. As for being the worlds greatest democracy, even in its presidential elections about half of Americas voters usually dont bother to vote.         
	Equality? Slavery went, but racial segregation was a fact of American life  even of law, in some states  until a century later. The very armed forces that were fighting for freedom, etc, etc  as indeed they were  in 1941-45, were segregated.        
	Liberty? Self-government? Any West European owes thanks to the mighty ally that protected him throughout the Cold War. Yet for much of that era, most of Latin America was an American fief, where the US backed vicious dictatorships and civil wars that made Russias East European empire and occasional military interventions therein look like a childrens picnic. Indeed, to many people from Nicaragua eastward, the values most obvious in American actions in the past 50 years have been the Hollywood ones of violence, aggression and dominance.                
	Childish beliefs        
	The gap between image and reality is not total. The work ethic, go-getting optimism and sense of opportunity that Americans ascribe to their society are indeed typical of it. Nor is the gap unique to the US. We British preached fair play and freedom long before we allowed them in our non-white colonies. Frances claimed mission civilisatrice in Africa was largely a fake. Secularism  Ill put this politely  is hardly the most obvious feature of India.        
	What is special about the American case is the extent to which the world shares that nations image of itself. My late home, the Economist, perfectly capable of seeing straight in Americas internal affairs, was equally capable of an almost childlike belief in the declared aims of America abroad. No surprise, maybe, in a magazine so self-proclaimedly philo-American. But even the left is apt to see the US as falling short of its true values when it is merely behaving as superpowers do.        
	And what has this to do with language, you ask? Frankly, not too much. Its just that I detest high-sounding but bogus clichs, and the gush about American values that has pervaded the presidential contest has reminded me that this is one of the phoniest. May a victory for Barack Obama add a little substance to it  though, alas, what fresh gush thatll provoke.

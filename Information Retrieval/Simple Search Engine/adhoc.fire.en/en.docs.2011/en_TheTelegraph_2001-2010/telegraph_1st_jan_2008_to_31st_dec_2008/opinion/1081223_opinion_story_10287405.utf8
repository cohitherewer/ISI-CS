	Indian diplomacy has very clearly mounted a pincer attack on Pakistan in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on Mumbai. On the one hand, it is mounting pressure through evidence and rhetoric on the democratically elected government of Pakistan to take action against terrorists and against those outfits that train and harbour them in Pakistan. On the other hand, it has got the United States of America to exert a similar pressure on Islamabad. India and the US are working on the same intelligence raw material to tell the Pakistan government that the involvement of some of its citizens, of some Islamist organizations based in that country, and even of the ISI, is irrefutable and action needs to be taken. The Pakistan government is not easily persuaded on the matter. One reason for this may be the fact that all the evidence and all the pressure come from either India or the US  two countries that are treated with suspicion, if not loathing, by the fundamentalist forces in Pakistan. No government in Islamabad can quite afford to ignore these forces. India cannot and should not reduce the diplomatic offensive that it has begun, but keeping in mind the Pakistan governments own internal compulsions, India could perhaps open up another diplomatic front.         
	This front could bring into its fold countries that are well disposed towards Pakistan but have reasonably good relations with India. The country that comes immediately to mind is Saudi Arabia. India should prevail upon Saudi Arabia to speak to Pakistan to act against terrorists. A wealthy country like Saudi Arabia, with global investment interests, will readily realize the damage that terrorist violence can bring about. India should play on this aspect and try to win the active support of the Saudi government in the battle against terrorism. Similarly, India cannot ignore the muted response of its long-term ally and friend, Russia. The time has come now for Moscow to come out more categorically against the role Pakistan plays in sponsoring and nurturing terrorists. Even China, not known to be Indias friend, can be brought in to play. Indian diplomats should explain to these countries that terrorism represents a threat that transcends all other tactical interests. Pressure needs to build up from quarters that have some chance of being heard within Pakistan without the raising of fundamentalist hackles. This is a new challenge before Indian diplomacy.

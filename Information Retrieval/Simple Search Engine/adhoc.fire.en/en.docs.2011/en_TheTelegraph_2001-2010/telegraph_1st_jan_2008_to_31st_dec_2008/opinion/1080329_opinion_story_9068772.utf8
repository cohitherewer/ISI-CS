The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | do not go gently 
                                                                                                                 DO NOT GO GENTLY                                                           
	To be accepted as a powerful nation, it is necessary to behave like a powerful nation. This simple and self-evident truth does not have adequate recognition in the corridors of the magnificent buildings that Edwin Lutyens built on Raisina Hill. In foreign affairs, India continues to act as if it is in a position of weakness. Yet it expects to be welcomed to the high table where the superpowers sit. In its self-perception, India places itself below the salt. This is partly a hangover from the time when Indias voice did not carry very much weight. In part, it is also a failure to accept that in economic terms, at least, India is a force to reckon with. This reluctance to don the mantle of power is no more evident than in Indias rather wimpish reaction to Chinas response to a series of demonstrations in India against the Chinese occupation of Tibet. The demonstrations in Lhasa and their spread in India have quite obviously caught China on the wrong foot. It is open to India to leverage this and to win a few points vis--vis Beijing. But New Delhi is allowing Beijing to seize the diplomatic advantage.        
	After some Tibetans had protested outside the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, Chinese foreign-policy officials in Beijing summoned the Indian ambassador, Nirupama Rao, to express their concern over the event. As if this was not enough, a few days later, Ms Rao was woken up well after midnight and summoned again to the foreign office in Beijing to express Chinas worries about the safety of the Olympic torch when it passes through India. This, not to put too fine a point on it, was a deliberately staged and exaggerated articulation of concern. The Chinese foreign-office mandarins, by summoning Ms Rao at an unearthly hour, behaved as if a national calamity had occurred. Nothing had occurred in New Delhi or anywhere in India for the Indian ambassador to have her nights sleep disrupted by an official summons. India should object in no uncertain terms to such uncouth behaviour towards its ambassador in Beijing. To assume that the Indian ambassador is at the beck and call of the Chinese foreign office at any odd hour is to humiliate India. It is surprising that South Block let this pass.        
	There are enough reasons to suspect that South Block accepts such deplorable behaviour because it seems to be oblivious of Indias power and position. The protests against China can easily be used as a bargaining chip against Chinas position on Arunachal Pradesh. India should make it clear that it cannot be taken for granted by China. India has no reason to fear the dragon, and signals to that effect should go from Raisina Hill to the Middle Kingdom. Unfortunately, India seems to be unprepared to do this and is erring on the side of caution. India is allowing itself to be bullied unnecessarily. A faint heart not only never won a fair lady, it also never won an unfair diplomatic battle.

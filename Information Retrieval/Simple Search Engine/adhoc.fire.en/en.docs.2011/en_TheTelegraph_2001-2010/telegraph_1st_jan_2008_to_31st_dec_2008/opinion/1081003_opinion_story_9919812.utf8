	It is rare that something that is good news for India is also good news for George W. Bush. In the last few days of his presidency, Mr Bush has won a foreign policy victory. The senate of the United States of America ratified the Indo-US nuclear deal by an overwhelming majority a week after the Congress passed it. By this agreement, India will end its 34 years of isolation and gain access to nuclear fuel for civilian use from the US. By the terms of the deal thus civilian nuclear trade between India and the US will resume: the US will be able to sell nuclear fuel, technology and reactors to India for peaceful energy use. In return, India has agreed to open up 14 nuclear facilities to international inspection; eight military reactors will remain outside any kind of external surveillance. The passage of the deal was long  it was first mooted in 2005  and with not a few hiccups. Mr Bushs critics in the US said that India was being unnecessarily rewarded despite having tested nuclear bombs in 1974 and 1998, and having refused to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The deal, its critics argue, will only encourage countries like Iran and North Korea to go ahead with their programme. For Mr Singh it is the culmination of an arduous climb, in the process of which he nearly lost his government.        
	It will be simplistic to view this deal through only a nuclear prism. In terms of realpolitik, it represents a complete turnaround in Indo-US relations. Despite the cloak of non-alignment that India put on its foreign policy, India, during the Cold War, was seen as belonging to the Soviet lobby. The US, within India, was seen as the principal promoter of Pakistan. Till very recently, relations between the two countries were not exactly cordial. The deal alters all this dramatically. India and the US now have a special relationship. Various circumstances have aided the emergence of this new cosiness. The rise of China demanded, from the USs point of view of maintaining a balance of power in Asia, a counterweight. India with its size and growing economic might was an obvious choice. The threat of terrorism and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism  gaining urgency after 9/11  helped the coming together of India and the US. Countering terrorism is one of the many common aims shared by the two countries. The deal is also Indias best invitation yet to dine at the international high table.

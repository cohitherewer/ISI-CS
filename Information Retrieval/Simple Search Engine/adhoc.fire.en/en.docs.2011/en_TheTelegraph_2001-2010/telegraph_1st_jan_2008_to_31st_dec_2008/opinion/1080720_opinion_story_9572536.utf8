The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | pm and the lower house
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       PM AND THE LOWER HOUSE                                                          
	It is unusual and ironic for a person not to be actively present at the most critical event of his career. Manmohan Singh has won many laurels in his life, but he and any future biographer of his will agree that the trust vote in the Lok Sabha, beginning on Monday, is to date the most critical test of his political career. Yet he will not be able to initiate the motion or put forward the best possible defence of his government. This bizarre situation is the result of the simple fact that the prime minister of India is not a member of the lower house where elected representatives of the people sit to decide on the fate and future of the country. Mr Singh is not a dramatic orator in the manner of, say, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but he is known to be a cogent and lucid speaker: not a rabble-rouser appealing to the emotions, but convincing and persuasive, appealing to reason. Also, in this instance, no one knows better than Mr Singh the intricacies of the Indo-US nuclear deal and how it benefits India. The United Progressive Alliance government and Mr Singh himself will sorely feel the prime ministers absence in the debate in the Lok Sabha.        
	The prime minister finds himself in this very odd position because of a certain ambiguity in the Constitution itself. This august document does not make it explicit that the prime minister should belong to the Lok Sabha. The Constitution, in fact, is silent on the matter. Thus, Mr Singh has not violated any norm by being prime minister and remaining a member of the Rajya Sabha. He has violated neither statute nor convention. Yet, he must be ruing the fact that in the present political conjuncture  if not crisis  he cannot speak in the Lok Sabha in favour of the government he has led for the last four years. He will be reduced to the position of a mere spectator while his fate and his governments fate are debated and decided by the members of the Lok Sabha. And, as if to put salt on the wound, when there is a division in the Lok Sabha, he will have to withdraw from the house. To be very precise, Mr Singh will not be present when the Lok Sabha votes on whether to trust his government or not.        
	Mr Singh could have avoided this plight by seeking election to the Lok Sabha. It would not have been impossible for the Congress to have given him a safe seat somewhere in India. Such a solution would have saved Mr Singh some embarrassment, but it would not have removed the ambiguity inherent in the Constitution on this matter. Legislators must devote their attention in the future to this subject. There is no reason why in the Constitution of a proud and thriving democracy such an ambiguity should be allowed to persist. The prime minister and all members of the Union cabinet should be elected to the Lok Sabha. Necessary amendments should be made to the Constitution to make this mandatory.

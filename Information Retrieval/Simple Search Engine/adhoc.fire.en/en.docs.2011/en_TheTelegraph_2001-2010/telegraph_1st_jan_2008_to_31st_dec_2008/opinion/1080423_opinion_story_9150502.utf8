	Family rules                  
	Sir  The appointment of Rahul Gandhi as the general secretary of the Congress was perhaps the first in a series of acts that are to culminate in his coronation as the future king of democratic India. Arjun Singhs proposal of Rahul Gandhi as the Congresss prime ministerial candidate, expectedly, followed soon after. It is well-known that without the adhesive provided by the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, the squabbling leaders of the party cannot be brought together. Arjun Singh was only giving voice to an open secret when he suggested Rahul Gandhis candidature (Nudge for PM Rahul, March 31). What was unexpected was the way in which he insulted the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, whose integrity is unquestionable.           
	Manmohan Singh did not hanker after the post. The Congress sought him out from amongst several party leaders because of his honesty and dedication. As prime minister, he has never allowed his personal interests to override those of the country, and this can be said of very few people in positions of authority. His stewardship has seen the United Progressive Alliance government tide over difficult periods. While voicing his allegiance to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, Arjun Singh forgot to honour the incumbent prime minister. No amount of damage control can conceal the sycophantic nature of senior Congress leaders.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is good to know that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have always kept away from an environment of sycophancy, as Jayanthi Natarajan, the party spokesperson insists (Sonia silences PM snipers, April 16). The Congress, like most other political parties of this country, is packed with sycophants, who have made their careers by grovelling in front of the men in power and kissing the ground they tread on. If Natarajan is to be believed, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi are an exception to that rule. However, it remains to be seen whether a young leader like Rahul Gandhi will manage to maintain his integrity now that he has entered mainstream politics. He faces serious challenges ahead as he has to work in a vicious environment of self-seeking partymen.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Sonia Gandhi has once again proved her political acumen by cutting Arjun Singh down to size through her praise of Manmohan Singh for his magnificent performance. Her gesture reminds one of the time she refused the post of prime minister. Although many objections have been raised against Sonia Gandhi on the ground that she is a foreigner, she has established herself as more honest than many Indian leaders.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                
	Sir  Arjun Singhs comment about Rahul Gandhi was expected, given that Singh has the reputation of being one of the longest-serving toadies of the Gandhi family. Men like Singh, who have almost reached the end of their career, can go to any extent to keep themselves in favour in order to stay in power. Hence it is not surprising that Singh would express his support of Rahul Gandhi in spite of the fact that most UPA allies, such as the Nationalist Congress Party, insist on projecting Manmohan Singh as the prime ministerial candidate for the 2009 polls.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

                
	Sir  The contention that Rahul Gandhi has been dragged into the news not because of his own actions, but by other people who have made irresponsible statements appears to be a bit immature (Sibling news, April 17). Do we really believe that a family loyalist like Arjun Singh could deliberately issue a statement that is unpalatable to the Gandhis? It should be kept in mind that another loyalist, Pranab Mukherjee, had also endorsed Singhs comment. I refuse to believe that in a party run on dynastic principles, two senior leaders would wilfully risk their jobs by saying things that may displease Sonia Gandhi. The whole episode appears to be a ploy to gauge the prevailing opinion about Rahul Gandhi before he is publicly proclaimed the prime ministerial candidate. It is also a signal for Manmohan Singh to get ready to vacant the seat he has dutifully kept warm for Rahul Gandhi.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Darkness falls          
	Sir  I live in the Dimna area of Jamshedpur, which now belongs to Jharkhand. The entire locality goes without power for the greater part of the year. The situation aggravates in summer, when there is power for a maximum of eight hours every day. Whenever I ring up the power station, I am told that there is a paucity of supply. When Jharkhand was not formed, power cuts lasted for not more than two hours. Since Jharkhand came into existence, we have had to reconcile ourselves to living without electricity. This is unexpected since coal cannot be in short supply, at least in Jharkhand. The truth is that the authorities have not built a single power plant or upgraded the established ones. What is the government there for if we have to rely on personal generators for electricity and drinking water?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ravi Bhusan, Jamshedpur

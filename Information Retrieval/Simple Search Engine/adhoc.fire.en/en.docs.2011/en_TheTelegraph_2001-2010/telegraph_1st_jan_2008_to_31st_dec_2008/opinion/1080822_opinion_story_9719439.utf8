Jhabvala is a portfolio of watercolours and pencil drawings of the two cities this senior Delhi architect is familiar with and fond of. They look like realistic depictions, but are a mix of observation, memory and fantasy. This makes their claim to historical documentation somewhat dubious; besides, none of the images is dated. The work is technically precise, but undistinguished, being of a standard expected of any good architect.

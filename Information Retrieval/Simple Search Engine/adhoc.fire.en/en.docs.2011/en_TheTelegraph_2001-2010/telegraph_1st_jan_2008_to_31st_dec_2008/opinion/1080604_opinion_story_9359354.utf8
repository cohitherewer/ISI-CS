	Procrastination is the thief of governance. No government worth its salt can be seen to be dragging its feet on a matter on which a decision is absolutely imperative. Yet the United Progressive Alliance government has, over the last few weeks, been unable to make up its mind about how to deal with the oil price hike. After an incredible period of silence, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, announced on Monday that subsidies could not be increased any further and that the consumer could not be entirely protected from a rise in prices that was global. All this makes sound economic sense, and it is somewhat elementary even when it comes from a professor of economics like Mr Singh. But it does not provide a decision with concrete proposals. What is demanded is that the prime minister should act, not that Mr Singh the economist should speak. Every day that Mr Singh wastes in meetings and thus postpones the critical decision, he and his government lose credibility. This is not a happy state of affairs for a government that many believe is living on borrowed time.        
	The usual excuse given for the inordinately long time the present government takes over decision-making is that it is a coalition set-up, and there are far too many pulls and pressures. This excuse side-steps the entire issue of leadership: Who is to be the master? The famous question (slightly altered) posed in Through the Looking-Glass is the crucial one for governance. It is a sad commentary but a true one that throughout the four years of the UPA governments existence it has never been clear who its master is. Both the UPA and its government have their respective leaders  Sonia Gandhi in the case of the former, and Mr Singh in the latter  but they have not distinguished themselves by their ability to take quick and hard decisions. Ms Gandhi acted with great conviction and swiftness when she refused the prime ministership which was hers for the asking. But in her role as the chairperson of the UPA, she has been strangely withdrawn, more so recently. Mr Singh, despite his best intentions, appears incapable of cutting through the shackles around him. He appears always to be looking over his shoulder, and this reduces his capacity to take fast decisions. The UPA government may or may not be living on borrowed time, but it certainly is inactive. An inactive, non-functioning government is a non-government.

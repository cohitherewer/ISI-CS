The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Class struggle, then and now
                                                                                                                 CLASS STRUGGLE, THEN AND NOW
  - A clash between two kinds of Left					 
										      COLLEGE ELECTIONS                                                
	Going by tradition, the 2008 student elections at Presidency College have been peaceful  barring one day of violence at the Hindu Hostel. The victory margin  35 to the Students Federation of India, and 37 to the combine of Independents Consolidation and Democratic Students Organization  conceals nearly as much as it reveals. On the face of it, the figures say that the SFI, with all its establishment support, has failed to control students affairs in the college for yet another year. But scratch the surface  or get some IC workers and sympathizers to open up and it comes out that this may actually have been a victory of sorts, rather than a defeat, for the SFI. In a year marked by Singur, Nandigram, Rizwanur Rahman and Taslima Nasreen, this is no less than a moral victory for the CPI(M)s student wing.        
	It is well known that the CPI(M) has had an unusually high stake in the goings-on in Presidency College. But since 2003, when the SFI had last held the students body, the college has presented a curious case of the administrative affairs (and the faculties) being dominated by supporters of the ruling party, and the larger section of the students turning their face away from the SFI.         
	Shubhadeep (name changed on request) had his first experience of the elections this year. When he entered Presidency College last year, he says, his seniors were full of stories about how the run-up to the elections is like the Durga Puja. When he experienced the real thing, however, the Physiology (Hons.) student could find nothing festive about it. The air was filled with suspicion, mudslinging, threat and fear. The fear factor was used most effectively by the SFI  but this, he insists, is a private perception in which he could well be wrong. A newly-elected IC office-bearer claims that SFI and violence are synonymous at Presidency. So much so that immediately after the names of the elected representatives are announced, the non-SFI winners have to be removed to hideouts. This is because the panel is elected through an electoral college a few days after the student elections are over. IC supporters rattle off past instances when elected students were prevented by CPI(M)s local committees from coming to college on the day of the panel elections, resulting in ill-deserved panel wins for the SFI. Maybe this is not wholly untrue. If they were, IC supporters would not have gone about happily boasting that in the Hindu Hostel clashes, for once, they had paid the SFI back in its own coin.        
	A victim of concentrated malice is how Niladri Mitra, convener of the SFIs post-graduate unit in Presidency College, looks at his organization. The word, prachaar, comes back like a refrain in his speech. Be it on Nandigram or on the water-crisis in Bankura, the SFI is made the butt of a vicious campaign round the year. And yet, it was the SFI that waged a long fight to get the students of Presidency College their own photocopying facility. Against the ICs charges of ideological bankruptcy, the SFI accuses IC of opportunism.        
	A number of independent student groups have been born in colleges in the last few years based on the one-point principle of opposing the SFI. Some of them, including the IC, have recently come together to form the United Students Democratic Front. In the early Nineties, an independent or apolitical student-body would inevitably have elements of Opposition parties like the Congress or Trinamul Congress. These days, the game is played strictly on the Left side. Thus, the IC calls SFI pseudo-Left, while the SFI brands IC ultra-Left.        
	A good number of students are unsure whether they have anything to gain from either kind of Left. Whatever the parties might say, student elections are won and lost on issues which have nothing to do with students, says an undergraduate student. The cynicism is unmistakable, but those in the SFI and IC camps are convinced that student-politics is as relevant as ever, if not more. An umbrella is a must, whatever be your cause. And no umbrella can hold out as well and long as a political one.       SREYASHI DASTIDAR

	To think that one political victory and an acceptance speech could reduce millions across the world to tears of joy and hope, speaks volumes. Barack Obama has turned yet another page of our contemporary history with his commitment and unrelenting endeavour to become the symbol of change, restoration, renewal and reinvention. At the age of 47, he has shattered many a myth, broken through the glass ceiling of race and colour, and has, more importantly, brought together the many strands of diversity that are alive in a new-generation America that has shed the torn baggage of the past. An insular nation, conservative and comfortable in its privilege and isolation, has broken loose.        
	With 9/11, America began to experience the trials and tribulations, the traumas and truths that had enveloped, often suffocated, almost all other cultures across the planet. Till that unfortunate day, they had stood apart from the world, unscathed by the violence that marked the last century. Through the turmoil of that bizarre tragedy, ordinary men and women, who had been disconnected from the world outside their homesteads and small towns, began to look beyond and question positions, policies and interventions. A general awareness began to grow and develop. Minds began to open up to fresh ideas and influences. The young stepped out of the established parameters and on November 4, 2008, the United States of America has renewed its tryst with destiny. Hopefully the new regime will reach out to the world, work towards peace and not explain away war as a means towards peace, build effective partnerships instead of backing one country against another in an effort to divide geopolitical regions, look to conserving the planet by celebrating austerity, and finally, embrace differences in an attempt to collectively to find sane solutions to problems raging across the world.                
	Body, mind and soul        
	Hope is palpable and in the air. Will India be infected with this energy? Will the large mass of young men and women in the subcontinent be charged up with the spirit of todays America? We have reached the worst ever point in our political trajectory. Corruption has invaded the central core of our politics, ranging from the allocation of tickets to polarized positions that ruthlessly cripple our plural polity, diverse traditions and cultures, faiths and philosophies. Therefore, will the majority, the young generation, turn the tide of rapid decline into a positive wave of hope and change? Will they compel a shift of attitudes and mindset to fulfil the silent aspirations of a dynamic young nation-state?        
	When will we discard the leadership that plagues our political space? When will those at the helm of our nation ensure the departure of the wheeling and dealing individuals who manipulate political parties for selfish ends? When will we learn and absorb innovative approaches and actions from the experiences of others? When will we eject muscle and money power, blackmail, deals and extortion out of our political system? Smaller regional parties are operating in the same manner as the two national parties, if we can call them national. Mayavati and her BSP have not infused a fresh and clean breath of air into the public space, nor any exciting ideas. The BJP seems to have got the infectious virus of constant in-fighting and back-biting from the Congress. Incompetence rules.         
	We need our very own, indigenous Barack Obama. We need a leader to reach out and attract the many different communities, castes and creeds of India, people who are looking for a messiah of sorts to extricate them from the horror of corruption  of the mind, soul and the body politic. All Indians will join a movement that leads them towards dignity of life and purpose. Change the rules. Change the parameters. Change the rhetoric.

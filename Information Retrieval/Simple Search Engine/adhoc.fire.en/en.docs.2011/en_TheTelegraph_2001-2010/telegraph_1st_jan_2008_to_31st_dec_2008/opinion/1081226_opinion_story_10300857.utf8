                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       STAND UP AND DELIVER                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	If Hyderabad can have an airport as it does  spotlessly clean, smart, non-smelly and functional, with sensible, comprehensible signage, smiling faces and utterly polite and pleasant security guards who are presentable, as well as bookshops and leisure spaces that are well appointed  why cannot the same happen in every single state and city of this country? After all, its the same people and a similar culture.         
	In this public-private endeavour, it seems clear that accountability laced with a sense of pride has worked well. Meticulous care has gone into the minutest of detail. Arriving at the Rajiv Gandhi airport was a great pleasure, and if we can generously praise the man who was the mastermind and executor of the Delhi Metro, we should consider doing the same for the man who built this state-of-the-art airport.        
	Then, as we step into the government operated infrastructure, there is no professionalism, no accountability, no honesty and integrity of purpose and action. A tidal wave of anarchy and chaos begins to invade the public space. Petty politicians with servile bureaucrats scurrying about, delivering favours, need to either correct their corrupt means of work and function, or be removed from all areas that need to respect the citizen and not exploit the patience of ordinary, law-abiding Indians. For example, no road rules apply anywhere across this land and no traffic police anywhere demand adherence to the rule of law. Instead, they demand to be personally ingratiated to let offenders off the hook. This is pure desi corruption and is the same wherever the bureaucrat and the politician rule together. Bad roads prove that the money allocated is, alas, stolen. Traffic snarls define mismanagement and abject indifference, a by-product of the hire-but-cannot-ever-fire reality of government employment. In every department, its the same syndrome. Lazy, lethargic, inept and corrupt, these men and women are holding India back and getting away with misgovernance.                
	Gifted people        
	However, the municipality in Hyderabad seems to work a trifle better than the MCD in Delhi. Sidewalks in the crowded, old city are comparatively clean and devoid of rotting rubbish. In contrast, Delhi colonies are lined with uncleared garbage. The difference is sharp, and the message is clear. Calcutta died, Bombay is dying, Madras is fading, Delhi is bound to join this group of privileged, but failed, cities sooner than later, and what are today referred to as the B-grade cities and towns of urban, progressive India, hopefully, will fast become the face of a new and dynamic country. For this transformation to happen, their municipalities must do the exact opposite of what the crumbling metros and their administrations have done over the last 60 years to be spared of the horrific degradation that we metropolitans have been forced to live within.        
	The chief minister of Delhi cannot do what she wants for this city because she does not control the land or the municipalities. Perversely, those rest in the hands of the lieutenant governors office and with the urban affairs ministry of the Central government. How can a chief minister deliver without holding these reins?        
	The truth is that we can do it. Ours is an immensely skilled and highly intelligent nation, which has been held back and exploited for centuries by invaders and, more recently, by our elected rulers. We are good learners, innovative and creative, and are able to survive in times of scarcity, strife, repression and even when suffocated with archaic rules and regulations. As a people who pass down ideas and skills from generation to generation, our fund of knowledge is vast and unlimited. We must force the hands of those who rule. That must be the new mantra, one of accountability and opportunity, this time in that order.

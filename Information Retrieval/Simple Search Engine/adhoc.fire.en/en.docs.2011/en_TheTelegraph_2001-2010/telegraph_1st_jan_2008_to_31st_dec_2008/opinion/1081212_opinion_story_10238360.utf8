	Real change in the practice of democracy may come quietly, and quietness was one of the keywords of the assembly elections held under the strict supervision of the Mizoram Peoples Forum. It is perhaps a rare instance of accurate naming, for the MPF seems to have been able to turn ordinary peoples desire for disciplined campaigning and peaceful elections into a reality. Backed by the church and including non-governmental organizations, this non-political body worked with firmness and good sense to induce cooperation and compliance, not only from political parties but also from militant groups, so that neither flamboyant shows of money and muscle nor disruptive violence could confuse or hinder the free exercise of the peoples franchise. The outgoing chief minister of the defeated Mizo National Front, too, showed appreciation of the forums extraordinary effort, even if his partymen were none too pleased with the way the MPF had hobbled them. Defeat sours the temper. The Congress, in contrast, was generous in praise, although the prime minister was allowed to hold election meetings in only two instead of the three places asked for.        
	There can be no doubt that other states in India could look upon the elections in Mizoram this year as a model. More than the effects  quiet, austere campaigns and peace during polling and after  it is perhaps the effort behind the achievement that needs to be studied. A remarkable unity of purpose welded together the church and social organizations; both the purpose as well as the unity mattered. It must have been hard work persuading political parties and militant outfits to see the point  to their disadvantage  even if the influence of the church in the region is taken for granted. This was not about religion, neither was it about politics. It was about the rights of the people in a democracy and the need to give those priority. The growth of pressure groups and watchdog bodies outside of political parties and institutions is a mark of a societys maturity. It demonstrates the peoples faith that they can participate in governance. A clean election, for example, may not immediately mean a corruption-free government, but the vigilance of a popular watchdog organization may help in bringing about clean governance too. The MPF has opened up possibilities, the rest of India should explore them.

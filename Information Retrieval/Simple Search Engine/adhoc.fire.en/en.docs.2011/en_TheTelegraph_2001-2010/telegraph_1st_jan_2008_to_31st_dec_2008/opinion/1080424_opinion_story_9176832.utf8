The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Bring on the real entertainers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BRING ON THE REAL ENTERTAINERS                                                                  
	Had it not been for the power failure, the IPL match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Deccan Chargers would have been shorter than Jodhaa Akbar and just a tad longer than an episode of Kahanii Ghar Ghar Ki. I have watched V.V.S. Laxman and Harbhajan Singh against the Australians, Mohammed Azharuddin against the South Africans, and Sachin Tendulkar in the Hero Cup semi-final at the Eden Gardens. Not for a moment did I hope that the Riders or Chargers would do anything to match those extraordinary cricketing feats. I went to Eden Gardens last Sunday to get close to those who had given up a weekend evening in a multiplex or shopping mall to give the truncated, sexed-up version of cricket a try. Sunday at the Eden Gardens has convinced me that the IPLs success is contingent upon the number of celebrities coming forward to own teams.        
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni is certainly the hottest property in Indian cricket at the moment, but that has not made his IPL team, the Chennai Super Kings, half as sought after as Shah Rukh Khans Kolkata Knight Riders or Preity Zintas Kings XI Punjab. Reports that came out a day after the Eden match confirmed that the most coveted seats were in the blocks that gave the best view of the celebrities in the Clubhouse and the stage (where SRK was supposed to perform), rather than in the H and G blocks, which give the best view of the cricket.        
	This is why the absence of exciting cricket (read fours and sixes) was a lesser disappointment. The bigger let-down for the crowd was that Shah Rukh Khan did not perform, nor did he get the famous Bong belles in Bollywood as had been rumoured. Rama Sarkar and Jyotsna Barik would never have have made a trip from the suburbs to watch cricket if it had not been for Shah Rukh Khan. On the other end of the spectrum would be someone like Ratan Agarwal, a businessman and a regular at Eden Gardens since the early Seventies. On Sunday, he had brought his wife and daughter along to give them a feel of cricket at the hallowed ground. He must have left the ground feeling he had chosen the wrong day.        
	As the dry-as-parchment Eden pitch revealed itself gradually, and the crowd was left looking for a chance to scream and dance (and watch the cheergirls jiggle their bodies), most of the women around me started looking bored and confused. This was not what they had come for. Watching cricket at home with her husband and son, Sangeeta Dhar of Manicktala had often wondered how much more fun it must be at the ground. Not any more.        
	For those who thought that in the show of cricket, the players are the only entertainers, IPL has toyed around with that definition a bit. And this could end up being IPLs biggest worry. The big names of Bollywood cannot possibly keep turning up in match after match after match. If they dont, neither will the thousands who have been thinking of the IPL matches as just another opportunity to catch the stars (sadly, press photographers too fall in this category). And the lovers of Test cricket will continue to scoff at this philistine concoction. So who will watch?         
	The cricketers, for one, would be loath to see the IPL golden egg perish. So it may not be long before they have to take up the job of entertaining again. Just like the good old times.                    SREYASHI DASTIDAR

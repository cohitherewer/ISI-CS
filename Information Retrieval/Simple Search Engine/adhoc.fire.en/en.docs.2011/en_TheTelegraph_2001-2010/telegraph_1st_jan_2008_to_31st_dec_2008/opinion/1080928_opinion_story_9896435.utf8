The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | all for love and nothing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ALL FOR LOVE AND NOTHING                                                          
	Someone once remarked that it is love that makes the world go round. He forgot to add that so do clichs. Love is an adolescents dream and a middle-aged mans nostalgia. Yet it arouses so much passion, heartburn and, one should add, given recent developments, controversy as well. When the prime minister of India proclaimed to the president of the United States of America that the people of India deeply love you, he did not quite apprehend (or maybe he did?) the furore it would create. Even if he did fear it, he certainly did not expect that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Janata Party would sing in unison to deny the Indian peoples love for George W. Bush and to question Manmohan Singhs right to articulate Indias love for the man who bombed Afghanistan and invaded Iraq. If nothing else, Mr Singhs declaration of love has served to unite two political rivals. Love may or may not make the world go round, but it certainly has the power to bring together opposites. Prakash Karat and L.K. Advani can now discuss the power of love over a cup of tea. Two less puritanical persons would have exchanged sweet nothings over a glass of champagne.        
	On a slightly more serious note: there is reason to discuss the issue of the prime ministers right to speak about the love that the people of India have for a particular individual. The prime minister heads an elected government, and thus for the years that he holds office through the logic of representative democracy, he actually represents the people of India. The people of India have entrusted to him the right to enter into negotiations with other nations, to sign treaties with them, if necessary to declare war, to determine the direction of Indias economy and innumerable other matters of pitch and moment. There are people  and in a democracy they have the right  who criticize or differ with the decisions that the prime minister takes. But no one actually questions his right to take such decisions. But why the storm over a declaration of love? Love, after all, is that most elusive and transient of emotions, which, as a Roman poet said, is best written in the wind and the running water. Love in the modern world is an expression of a fantasy. Why grudge a person or even a people this?        
	It is worth remembering that, in the Fifties, another Indian prime minister declared India to be a blood-brother of another nation. Witness the great slogan of the Nehru era: Hindi Chini bhai bhai. By any reckoning, a blood bonding is thicker than a tie of love. Yet Nehrus emotions did not stir Mr Karats forebears to attack Nehru. Perhaps, ideology is a stronger bond than either blood or love. St John says, Greater love hath no man than this, that a man may lay down his life for his friends. Mr Singh was willing to lay down his prime ministership for the friendship of the US. Americans should say that they deeply love Mr Singh.

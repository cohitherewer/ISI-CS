The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Summing up the good life
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SUMMING UP THE GOOD LIFE                              This above all      Khushwant Singh                        Life is a party				                                       
	According to legend, Babur, who led a stormy life full of battles till he established himself as the founder of the Mughal dynasty in India, was in the habit of forswearing wine on the eve of battles when the odds were against him. He would have his wine goblets smashed and would promise that if Allah granted him victory, he would never again touch wine. But no sooner Allah granted him victory than Babur got new goblets and went on a drinking binge for a few days. He is reported to have explained his conduct in these words, Babur enjoy your life to the fullest for youll never get this life again. What he thought during the hangovers that must have followed bouts of heavy drinking is not recorded.        
	Is hard drinking the best thing one can do to enjoy the one life granted to us? Is the popular concept of wine, women and song the summing up of a good life? Certainly not. For one, it looks upon women as objects of pleasure. Have you ever heard of a woman talk of liquor, men and music as her idea of a good time?        
	Peoples idea of a good life differs according to their circumstances. What an educated, sophisticated person would consider good life is bound to be poles apart from the life that appeals to an uncouth rake with pots of money to splash about. However, what is common to all classes of people is the idea that a good time requires indulging the five senses to their fullest extent, depending on ones age and state of health. In order to do that, one should be in buoyant spirits charhdi kala. There could be regrets, but resolve to enjoy life to the fullest extent. Omar Khayyams Rubaiyat is pertinent: Come, and in the fire of spring/ The winter garment of repentance fling;/ The bird of time has little time to go/ And lo, the bird is on the wing.                
	The dear departed                
	Why do people want to be remembered after they are dead? Most do, because they indicate whether they would like to be buried underground, in the sea, cremated on a wooden pyre, electric or gas cremator, and how their ashes are to be disposed of  immersed in the Ganga, strewn on some hillside or in their garden. Some even leave money behind to pay for annual shradhs, bhogs, or shabad keertans. Their loving relatives go further by having their pictures with messages of remembrance published in newspapers on their birth and death anniversaries, assuring them how much they are missed. Presumably, they do so in the conviction that these newspapers are available where their dear ones have gone. These messages are usually full of lies about the dead persons goodness, truthfulness, cheerfulness and so on. To me, a non-believer, all this is childish exercise in futility. I can understand the need to announce a persons demise and the meeting to pay him tributes, but I fail to appreciate the need to remember the dead, year after year. However, I confess, I too had expressed the desire to be buried under the earth rather than be cremated, provided no prayers were recited, no gravestone made and saplings of peepal were planted above my head. The only cemetery willing to accept my terms was Bahai at Ghaziabad. But they insisted they would have prayers said. I gave in, since I wouldnt be able to hear them. Then they said I would be laid alongside other Bahais without any kind of tree on my grave. I reneged from my agreement and have left it to my children to deal with my body as they wish and throw my ashes anywhere convenient to them.        
	All this came to my mind as I carried an urn full of ashes of my one-time English secretary, Yvonne Le Rougetel. She was allotted to me when I joined Unesco in Paris. She turned out to be a most unusual person. She had no religion but lived for others without bothering about herself. She found me a home in a suburb of Paris and then English girls to help my wife run our home. When I returned to Delhi and got a grant from Rockefeller Foundation to write a history of the Sikhs, I wrote to her asking if she would like to be my secretary again on a very measly salary. She flew over immediately and found lodgings for herself. She helped me write the two volumes. At times, she went on vacations to the hills. When she died two years ago, she left a will asking for her ashes to be scattered on Mahasu peak near Shimla. My son, Rahul, picked up Yvonnes ashes from London. Next week, he goes to Mahasu to carry out her last wish.        
	Without meaning to do so, some people leave their names behind for posterity in the shape of hospitals, schools, colleges, or museums they had set up, their inventions, works of art, music and so on. Such are the philanthropists, who wish to serve humanity and are remembered with the gratitude due to them. Those who leave their assets  in gold or silver, kept in vaults, or as money accumulated in banks  to their heirs or retainers, are only remembered by these objects. The desire to leave ones name for posterity is no more than an extension of ones ego into an imagined afterlife. It is sheer vanity. In reality, nothing outlasts his or her life for long, and soon that too is forgotten. I have often quoted Khayyam on the subject. I quote him again: There was a door to which I found no key/ There was a veil beyond which I could not see/ Talk awhile of thee and me there was/ Then no more of thee or me.                
	Mirror, mirror, on the wall                
	Banta came home one night very drunk. He went to the bathroom to wash his face. As he looked into the mirror above the wash basin, he could not recognize himself. He asked: And who are you? He got no reply. He looked more closely and said, Now I know who you are. You look like the rascal standing by my wife in our wedding photograph.

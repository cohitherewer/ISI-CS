	There is something particularly horrific about classroom killings. India had been fairly secure in the belief that this was a peculiar disease of the West. There is no longer any reason for such security. In the last few months, three boys, respectively of Class VIII, Class X and in the most recent incident, of Class XII, have died, shot by their classmates. The two schools in the first two cases, and the college in the last, differ greatly in the regional and socio-economic profiles of the students. Yet that did not stop the youngsters in Gurgaon or Satna or Ghaziabad from getting hold of guns and killing classmates they were angry with. Is the growing availability of guns then the crucial factor? That certainly makes killing more conceivable, or vengefulness  the motive in each case  easier to vent. But the real point perhaps is the intensity of hatred that can drive a young person to murder. Bullying, unresolved quarrels, harassment of a sister are not new phenomena among young people anywhere. What is new is the mindset: an absolute anger and an absolute solution. The openness of the crime, and the fact that the killer usually has a companion with him, are frightening indicators. Evidently, in some perverse way, the boys who pick up the guns to kill feel righteous. And they have at least one friend who agrees.        
	The real terror for Indian parents lies here. But there is still a significant difference between these killings and the bloodshed in American campuses, most recently at the Northern Illinois University, and other similar incidents, for example, in the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Classroom shootings in India have so far been personal; the anger and vengefulness of the young killers in Illinois and Virginia turned into a kind of impersonal hatred, which moved from murder to suicide. Neither kind of bloodshed is any the less terrible. But in India there may still be time to uncover the complicated sources of such violence and address them.

                                                                                                                                    SMALL, BUT IT MOVES
                             
	The Tatas Rs-l-lakh car has been long in the making. For no fault of theirs, it got bad press in those years. The land acquisition saga in Singur was not the publicity any manufacturer would have wished for. The Tatas could have walked away from Singur, and relocated the factory somewhere else. It is to their credit that having given a promise to the West Bengal government, they kept it, no doubt at a cost in the form of delay and unpopularity. 
    
	The unveiling of the car in Delhi on Thursday was a signal that the project is finally on the way. Although over 20 new models were exhibited, the Nano stole the limelight. As the worlds cheapest car, it was bound to draw attention. But for a cheap car, it turned out to be remarkably well-designed. It is roomier than an Ambassador, which till recently was the Bengali chariot of choice. Ratan Tata fitted quite comfortably in the drivers seat, and five people emerged from the car. Although the price is likely to make it a second car in many families, perhaps even the first car for a young daughter just come of age, the space inside makes it perfectly appropriate for the Indian family. It is well suited for driving in the city, particularly in Calcutta, where driving is an advanced form of jaywalking. 
    
	It will be some time before the car rolls out of Singur; the drawn-out drama of land acquisition has delayed it. Even when it rolls out, it is uncertain just how much work will be done in Singur. Car factories are primarily assemblies. They optionally include body shops and paint shops as well. But the crucial components  the engine, the chassis, the gear box and the steering  are seldom made in situ; normally they are bought from specialized suppliers and fitted in. And assembly also means many things; trucks, for example, are shipped as chassis mounted with engines, and bodies are built locally to meet customers specifications. 
    
	It will also remain unclear for some time how many cars the Singur plant will build, though the Tatas plan a total capacity of a quarter of a million; it will surely depend on how well the plant functions and is allowed to function. The Trinamul Congress has threatened to sabotage it. It was one thing to oppose the plant before the land was acquired. But now that the costs have been incurred and only the benefits remain to be reaped, it makes no sense to oppose it. 
    
	The Singur plant is just one arena for confrontation between the government and Trinamul. The state needs another, more consultative, less confrontational way of doing politics. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has realized this; so he, uncharacteristically, went and apologized to the people of Nandigram. Singur gives him a chance to try out his newfound maturity. If he can bring Trinamul round to letting Singur roll out cars, he will have earned his spurs as politician.

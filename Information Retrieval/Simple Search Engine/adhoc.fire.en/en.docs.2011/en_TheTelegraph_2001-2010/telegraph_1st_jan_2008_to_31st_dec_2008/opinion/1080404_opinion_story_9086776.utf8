	In its attitude to the Republic of China, the leadership of the Peoples Republic of China has swung between two extremes: extreme belligerence and conciliation. In early-1984, some nine years after the death of Generalissimo Chiang Kai- Shek, the widow of the communist leader, Zhou Enlai, wrote a friendly letter to the redoubtable Mayling Soong Chiang, better known as Madame Chiang Kai-Shek. The text of the letter hasnt been made public but Maylings reply, vetted by the authorities in Taipei, is interesting for its robust conclusion. The real China, Mayling informed Zhous widow, presumably to a suggestion for Taiwan to reintegrate with the mainland, is now in Taiwan.         
	Mayling was being somewhat disingenuous. Although the old Kuomintang leadership that ran Taiwan with an iron hand until 1996 was unwavering in its commitment to the spirit of China, there was always the feeling that their present predicament was another chapter in their peripatetic existence since 1911. The mainlanders who followed Chiang to Taiwan in 1949 survived on the conviction that the island was a place of temporary exile. Till 1990, they persisted with the bizarre all-China composition of the National Assembly. They never wavered in their conviction that it was their duty to speak for the Chinese people as a whole. In 1961, for example, Chiang exasperated Washington with his threat to veto the entry of Mongolia to the United Nations. As the real China, Taipei claimed sovereignty over Outer Mongolia.        
	Like many who joined Mao Zedongs revolution, the KMT embodied Han Chinese nationalism. Regardless of his virulent anti-communism, which, incidentally, deterred a communist invasion of Taiwan, Chiang never departed from the principle of one China. The KMT was as ruthless in its treatment of those who favoured independence for Taiwan as the communists are towards pro-independence Tibetans. In fact, Chinas claim of sovereignty over Tibet is a continuation of a position fine-tuned and articulated by Chiang in the Forties.              
	Chiang and his wife also believed that it was their sacred duty to safeguard the heritage of Mandarin China. The Grand Hotel, the Sun Yat Sen Memorial, the National Opera House and the Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial (renamed Hall of Democracy by the outgoing Progressive Democratic Party administration in 2007) in Taipei remain some of the more outstanding examples of imperial architecture outside the mainland. Likewise, the National Palace Museum, built in a similar style in 1965, contains the entire collection of art treasures from the Forbidden City. Along with Chinas bullion reserves, the collection was despatched to Taiwan by Chiang for safekeeping in 1948. In hindsight, this move saved the most exquisite collection of Chinese art under one roof from being desecrated by the Maoists during the Cultural Revolution.         
	So deep was this conviction that Taiwan was just a temporary springboard for the final reconquest that the body of Chiang was not given a permanent burial for 30 years after his death. It was Chiangs wish to be buried either at the Sun Yat Sen mausoleum in Nanjing or at his family grave in Zhejiang province. Unfortunately for Chiang, the fear of pro-independence activists in Taiwan desecrating his body prompted a hasty burial at the Military Cemetery in Wuzhishan in 2005. Likewise, Maylings body is stored temporarily at the Soong family mausoleum in Hartsdale, New York, pending final burial alongside her parents at the International Cemetery in Shanghai.         
	For 58 years, China and Taiwan have been locked in a vibrant battle over who and what constitutes the real China. In diplomatic terms, Taipei lost the battle in 1971, when the UN recognized Beijing as the rightful claimant to the permanent Security Council seat. In 1978, the United States of America, Taiwans foremost ally and protector, also bowed to reality. In Taiwan, no one speaks of the reconquest of the mainland any longer, although China persists in dangling the Anti-Secession Law in 2005 to deter any unilateral declaration of independence by Taiwanese nationalists. However, in a larger politico-civilizational sense, it is entirely possible that Chiang may end up having the last posthumous laugh.         
	At a time when the T-word is haunting China and threatening to deflate the Olympics balloon, Beijing is likely to find solace in the other T-word. If the recent upsurge in Tibet has highlighted the grave consequences of authoritarian modernization, last months presidential election in Taiwan pointed to Chinas astonishing ability to leverage its market economy for diplomatic gains.         
	The March election, which saw the KMT return to power after eight years, may prove a landmark in Taiwans history. Although the scale of Harvard-educated Ma Ying-jeous victory over his PDP rival, Frank Hsieh, can be attributed to the popular exasperation with the corruption and economic mismanagement of President Chen Shui-ban, the election was also dominated by the China factor. Confronted with sluggish economic growth, the KMT advocated a common market with China that would permit free flow of goods, services and labour between Taiwan and the mainland. His rival, on the other hand, cautioned against an over-dependence on China and hinted that the common market was just a euphemism for a one-China policy that would lead to Taiwan becoming another Tibet. The PDP harked on the authoritarian underpinnings of the KMT and its insensitivity to non-Mandarin cultures and warned that cosying up to China would subvert democracy and undermine Taiwans ethnic identity.         
	An interesting sidelight of the spirited campaign  a testimony to Taiwan s vibrant democracy  was the contested nature of the Chiang legacy. We consider Chiang Kai-Shek a dictator, Bi-khim Hsiao, the American-educated PDP spokesman, told international observers. At the Chiang Memorial, a government-sponsored exhibition asked: A Hall for the Strongman who was created by an authoritarian regime. Should he be commemorated forever?               
	It was a question that was prefaced on a partial reading of the Chiang legacy. Like the Great Helmsman, Chiang was temperamentally authoritarian and presided over a brutal White Terror in Taiwan. Yet, a formal commitment to the three principles of Sun Yat Sen  peoples nationalism, peoples power and peoples livelihood  plus a belated recognition of where it had erred on the mainland, saw the KMT blend economic freedom with political democracy in the Nineties. Till the death of Mao, Zhou and Zhu De in 1976, the communist leadership could hark back to the KMTs sordid record of incompetence, corruption and brutality in the Forties. However, it was the same KMT leadership that brought about Taiwans economic miracle and subsequently created one of the few genuine democracies in southeast Asia. In the past decade, Chinas staggering growth rate  powered, ironically, by very large Taiwanese investments  may have left Taiwan looking somewhat tired. However, Chinas surge hasnt been at the cost of Taiwans distinctiveness.         
	From 1950 to the beginning of Deng Xiaopings market reforms, Taiwan stood out as the China that doggedly resisted Maos adventurism and his reckless flights of whimsy. He may have been denounced as an incorrigible Cold Warrior whose China lobby contributed to Senator Joe McCarthys witch-hunts. But compared to what we now know of Mao, Chiang was a model of rectitude. Now that Beijing has more or less dismantled the economic edifice of Mao and embraced the market economy with all the zeal of a new convert, Taiwans role as the repository of Chinese entrepreneurship has been blunted. Yet what remains is equally relevant for all those who view the Peoples Republic with some wariness: the power of democracy.         
	Without Chiangs dogged refusal to capitulate, Beijing couldnt have been confronted with the force of an alternative Chinese style of politics.

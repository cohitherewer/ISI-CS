	Nectar in a sieve By Kamala Markandaya, Viking, Rs 295        
	Kamala Markandaya is one of the earliest exponents of Indian writers writing in English. Born into an elite Brahmin family, Markandaya studied history at Madras University and then pursued a career in journalism which took her to London. It was there that she started writing novels. Nectar in a Sieve, written in 1954, is her debut novel. On publishing this work, the author changed her original surname from Purnaiya to Markandaya. She used the latter for the rest of her writing career.        
	Markandaya wrote at a time when Indias nationhood was still in a nascent state. Independence had been won after many sacrifices, but this was also a time to grapple with serious challenges. The fragile agrarian economy was being eroded further by the frenetic pace of industrialization. Caste-hierarchy was ever present, like a festering wound, and gender insensitivity and the sexual exploitation of women continued unabated. All these issues feature prominently within Markandayas fictional frame. Her novels touch upon the famous Gandhi-Nehru debate on the question of industrialization of Indian society. In a sense, Markandayas works are also a scathing indictment of the colonial legacy, although some critics are of the view that Markandaya was also alert to some of the ways in which colonialism proved to be, in Gayatri Chakravorty Spivaks words, an enabling violence.        
	Nectar in a Sieve, however, has no room for such enabling violence, and regards modernity and industrialization, the twin products of colonialism, as unqualified evils. It depicts the life of a small village in southern India in the early Fifties, and represents an intra-diegetic and homo-diegetic narrative. This means that the protagonist, who is directly involved in the events that unfold in the story, is herself the narrator. In this case, her name happens to be Rukmani, whose long, unmitigated sufferings evoke Eliots image of some infinitely gentle, infinitely suffering thing.         
	The novel moves in the form of a long flashback as Rukmani reminisces her past, starting from her wedding night. Her reminiscences narrativize the nation caught in the throes of crises, manifest in the extreme poverty of tenant farmers like Nathan who is married to Rukmani, Rukmanis having to bear many children, her daughters abandonment by her husband and her subsequent entry into the flesh trade, and, finally, the setting up of a tannery in the villages that brings about Rukmanis doom. When famine strikes, Rukmani and her husband migrate to the city. But her suffering is not abated, and by the time of her return she has lost her husband.        
	Rukmanis resilience contains an element of heroism. Critics like Meena Shirdwadkar, the author of Image of Women in the Indo-Anglian Novels, have pointed out that Rukmanis courage reflects a meek or at times cheerful way (sic) of facing poverty or calamity. Her relative passivity in the novel is redeemed by the fact that she chooses to tell the story of her chequered life.        
	However, Markandayas novel has its own share of problems. The characterization is not always nuanced although Kunthi, the village prostitute, and Puli, the city urchin, linger in our memories.

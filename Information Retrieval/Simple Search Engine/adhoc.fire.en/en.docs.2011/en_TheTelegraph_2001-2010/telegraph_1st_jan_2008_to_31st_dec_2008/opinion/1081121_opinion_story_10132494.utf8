	Insult to injury                  
	Sir  In a manner reminiscent of the colonial times, the government of West Bengal continues to treat tribal communities with disdain. Over the years, the authorities have repeatedly taken advantage of the simple, peace-loving santhals by withholding from them the barest of human dignities. No wonder the uprising in Lalgarh assumed such violent dimensions (Tribals vow to step up protests, Nov 18). It was evident that the chief ministers convoy was attacked by extremists and the villagers had very little role in it. But the administration remained in denial, refusing to take the police and intelligence agencies to task for their inexcusable glitch. To cover up for their double failure  first, to avert the attack on the convoy, and then to arrest the real culprits  the police resorted to inhuman torture of innocent schoolboys and women.           
	In such circumstances, how does the state government expect the santhals to quietly put up with the mounting insult? In the absence of due processes, it is meaningless to talk about democratic ways of protest. In fact, the police should be thankful that the fury of the people did not erupt into deadlier forms of violence. Although the blockade has now been lifted, the tribals deserve an unconditional apology from the government. They have always got a bad deal from the elected representatives, and continue to be economically depressed, and lack basic education and healthcare facilities. Quelling an agitation is only a provisional solution to problems whose roots go much deeper.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  When Mamata Banerjee seized the Durgapur Highway to press her demand for 400 acres of land from the Tata small-car factory in Singur, the administration remained a mute spectator. Her example is now being imitated by splinter groups like the Yuva Chhatra Kurmi Sangram Committee and Jharkhand Disham Party to protest against police atrocities on the tribals in Lalgarh (Protest jams food highway, Nov 17). It has become a standard practice for most political parties to block roads and railway tracks to gain political mileage, without sparing a thought for the common people.           
	Last Sunday, my nephew had a trying time. He was to appear before an interview panel in Calcutta. Although he boarded a Howrah-bound train in the morning, he could go only up to Shaktigarh and was then caught in the rail blockade. With no alternative in sight, he had to trudge up to the National Highway to take a bus. Sadly, the vehicle could not budge an inch because of the highway blockade by the JDP. He was a victim of a callous administration. What good is the chief ministers dream of industrializing Bengal when he cannot ensure that a young man is able to attend an interview on time?          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

      
	Sir  Destroying trees mercilessly or blocking roads is not going to end the deprivation of the tribals. It would have made better sense if these people had lodged their protest through an organized platform without causing undue disruption to normal life or destroying the environment thoughtlessly.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Kumar Seal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  As tribal agitators held the public to ransom in West Midnapore, government officials chose to look away. The taxpayers end up spending thousands on the upkeep of these public servants, but whenever crisis knocks at the door, they are left helpless. The unrest in Jhargram reveals a deeper malaise in the state administration in particular and in the civil services in general. Increasingly, young people are averse to joining either the IAS or the IPS, as a result corruption is eating into these sectors. The recruitment and training of these officials need to be drastically overhauled. The authorities have to be competent in being able to deal with new-age agitation. Unless strict measures are taken to clean up the rot, the administration would soon become irrelevant in the state.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ritaja Basu Mullick, Calcutta

                
	Out of the way          
	Sir  I have been travelling between Calcutta and London over the last 15 years. My experience during these trips taught me that unlike other big Indian cities, Calcutta is no longer a viable destination for national and international tourists. When the Royal Jordanian Airlines had a flight to the city, I was often its lone business-class passenger; but on its stopover in Mumbai, the whole section would fill up.           
	Calcuttans will have to accept that fact that their once renowned city has lost its glamour. The reason is perhaps to be found in the fact that Calcutta has very few tourist spots. Unlike Mumbai or Delhi, Calcutta has few weekend getaways. This is unfortunate, since places like Digha or Santiniketan are a few hours drive from the city. But tourists tend to avoid these places because of a dearth of proper facilities there. The West Bengal tourism department should try to think up ways of sprucing up the tourist spots in and around Calcutta.                     
	Yours faithfully,

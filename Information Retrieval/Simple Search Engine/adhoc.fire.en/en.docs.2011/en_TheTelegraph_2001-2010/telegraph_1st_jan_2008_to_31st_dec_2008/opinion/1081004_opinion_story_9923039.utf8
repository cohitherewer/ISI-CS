	As an artist, Venkat Bothsas style isnt quite original. It seems to have been inspired by the clichd technique that projects painted images of the natural world on installations that is in vogue among experimental Indian artists such as Bothsa and Tamil Nadus M. Siva whose work is uncannily similar to Bothsas.        
	Hence, the real challenge for an artist like Bothsa is to engage his audience using this not-too-unfamiliar technique. However, he is moderately successful in achieving this in Second Skin, an exhibition of painted sculptures (Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, Sept 6-21). Bothsa uses luminous tints  brilliant reds, bright yellows, sparkling greens and blues  on his polystyrene heads and busts to create a twisted fantasy, which flatters and deceives. This iridescent world of fibrehumans is dangerously imbalanced. It worships all things material, is unabashedly consumerist and tragically removed from its ancient, natural roots. Hence the resigned look on the monstrous, androgynous head with an antenna, its hair knotted in tiny buns. Painted on its tired, mask-like face are the sky, clouds, mountains, as well as those signifiers of a fatally technological society: clocks and bikes.        
	Reality is spliced here, as is evident from the sculpted woman astride a giant bull, her luscious form barely contained in a skimpy dress. There are butterflies painted on her forehead, and a chain stretches across her breasts and belly. She bunches her left hand in a fist, and has eerie, empty eyes. The massive animal seems to struggle under her lithe body, its skin sprouting fruits, flowers and wheels  a symbol of speed delightfully juxtaposed with the slowness of the bulky beast. On another head, we see painted vines, trees, creepers and vignettes of branded goods. Another holds a snail to its heart, while a huge clock ticks on its skin. The conflict is thus between pace and leisure, nature and machine, the inside against the outside.        
	The full breasts, taut bellies and hips mock and tease. But one is afraid to touch, lest the beautiful second skin comes off, revealing a rotting form beneath. Yet, this world is not without hope. A room full of gleaming women nestling fish and birds under their breasts, their plastered faces breaking into ecstasy, signal redemption and the triumph of innocence over the evils of greed, technology and chaos.

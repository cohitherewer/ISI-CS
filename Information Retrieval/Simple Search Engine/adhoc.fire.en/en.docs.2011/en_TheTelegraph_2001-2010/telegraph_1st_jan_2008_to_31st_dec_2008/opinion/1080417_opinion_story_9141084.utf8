The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Blame it all on the West
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BLAME IT ALL ON THE WEST                                  China Diary -Neha Sahay                              
	The more they protest outside China, the more the Chinese defend their government. The photograph of a handicapped athlete trying to defend the Olympic torch from being grabbed by a Paris protester has confirmed the worst Chinese opinions about the West  it cannot bear to see China host a successful Olympics.        
	Topping the hate list is the Western media. The website, anti-cnn.com, has become hugely popular since its launch soon after the March 14 events in Lhasa. Incidentally, CNN wasnt invited to the government-sponsored foreign media tour of Lhasa. The Beijing office of the London Times has received hate mail for its editorial, The Genocide Olympics?.        
	A group of Chinese has actually begun documenting international media coverage of Tibet. Among the clips downloaded by them is a picture of Tibetan protesters being beaten in Kathmandu. One German newspaper had passed it off as a picture of Tibetan protesters being beaten by Chinese police in Lhasa.        
	Thanks to widespread access to the internet, and a media that rarely highlight turbulent events at home, even those educated till middle school are fairly knowledgeable about the human rights situation in countries where protests are the loudest  such as India and the United States of America. What really gets their goat is the contempt expressed openly by the white expats in China for their point of view.         
	Just because they are Americans, they think they know everything and have the right to pronounce judgment on the politics of our country, fumed Sun Mei, a middle-aged teacher working in an American school, talking about an argument with her directors over the Lhasa incidents in which Tibetans had attacked other Chinese. The Americans later asked this reporter: Did you talk to Sun Mei about Tibet? Their amused, patronizing smiles said it all. Like most Westerners, they believed she had been brainwashed and knew no better, not having access to any free media.                
	Pointing fingers        
	A few Chinese, however, are on the other side. Most prominent, of course, are the Falun Gong. Hoping that natures fury in the form of an earthquake or a flood wipes out the evil Beijng Olympics, they had begun saying what the Dalai Lama said much later  that the Tibetans shown on CCTV attacking other Chinese in Lhasa were actually policemen in disguise. According to them, the government had done the same thing to them some years ago  distributed footage of alleged Falun Gong practitioners setting fire to themselves at Tiananmen Square. Those burnt included a 12-year-old girl.        
	The act had caused revulsion across the country. The sect had denied having done it, and accused the Chinese government of having staged it. Another Chinese was sure the police must have first resorted to violence against peacefully-protesting Tibetan monks for them to have been so provoked into violence. However, the most significant criticism came from a columnist in a Guangzhou newspaper who wondered whether it was time the government allowed free access to information about what was really happening there. This, he argued, would help Chinese citizens form their own opinion.        
	Incidentally, the outburst by some monks in front of foreign journalists during the State- organized Lhasa visit was not blanked out. Xinhua, the official news agency, attributed it to the formers ignorance of life under the Dalai Lama  the poverty, serfdom and absolute power of the monks then. It was the Chinese government that had built schools, hospitals and even given subsidies to monasteries, it said. Interestingly, its not just the average Chinese who is put off by the Western protests. Some foreigners who have settled down in China feel that the US is behind the current unrest in Lhasa.

	Darkness rules                  
	Sir  Sunanda K. Datta-Ray rightly sums up the reaction of the average citizen of West Bengal to the states deteriorating power situation in Darkness visible (May 17). The scurrilous and acerbic reaction of the communist party bigwigs against Gopalkrishna Gandhis decision to turn off the lights at the Raj Bhavan does not come as a surprise. The ruling leftists have always bared their fangs at anybody threatening to expose their inefficiency and their exaggerated claims of achievement.           
	The critical power situation in the state is the result of gross mismanagement of existing power plants. A totally politicized workforce and the lack of pragmatism on the part of the government regarding the increasing demands of a burgeoning population have further compounded the problem. Moreover, when and if there is generation of surplus power, it is sold to other states ignoring the demands for rural electrification frequently raised by Bengals villagers. Unfortunately, communists have never been known to brook either dissent or truth. The uncouth diatribe directed against the governor, Gopalkrishna Gandhi, by the comrades reveals the dilemma and frustration of the people at the helm.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

                
	Sir  Darkness visible was an article worth reading. It is a curious paradox that while the people running the government have industrialization and development on their lips, citizens continue to grapple with power cuts every single day.           
	The members of the communist party may be bitter about the governor taking the high moral ground, but it would be silly of them to ignore the problem of power cuts. The onion crisis of 1998 had been the last nail in the coffin of the Bharatiya Janata Partys coalition government at the Centre. The power crisis may bring darkness into the lives of the comrades here as well. Polls may be won by violence but the heart of the common people is won only by sharing their troubles.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Hungry hearts          
	Sir  Genetically modified crops are hazardous and pose a threat to the biodiversity of the planet. Their role is now being debated seriously the world over (The brinjal battles, May 14). According to a recent report by the European Unions environment commissioner, any potential damage to the environment is irreversible. The richest reservoir of gene resource is the tropical forest and some say that there are reports of GM crops impacting the biodiversity of this zone adversely. The few multinational corporations that were actively exhorting the use of fertilizers and pesticides earlier are now the dominant players in the biotech industry.           
	The government of India has to be cautious as far as GM crops are concerned. It is suspected that GM crops may have unexpected consequences for the ecosystem. As per recent reports, a handful of the worlds largest agricultural biotechnology companies are seeking hundreds of patents on gene-altered crops. More importantly, gene patents generally preclude the age-old practice of saving seeds from a harvest for replanting. They require farmers to purchase high-tech seeds instead. Monopoly control of plant genes is not beneficial to India under any circumstance. With the current global food crisis, it is unacceptable that we will be dependant on a few companies for our sustenance.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Population explosion and the scarcity of foodgrains are inter-related crises. An immediate step to tackle the food crisis would be to keep cultivable land strictly for agricultural purposes. There should also be a check into whether the vast amounts of land lying unused in the rural areas can be put to agricultural use. The government needs to be proactive and engage scientists to deal with the frightening problem of food shortage to eliminate it.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Pranab Hazra, Asansol

                
	Sir  The article, All about food (May 12), by Ashok Ganguly raises some pertinent points concerning food security, food production and the scientific temper. There is no doubt that foodgrain production in India has been on an upward slope. However, considering that the size of holdings of a majority of farmers is small and marketable surplus coming from them is insignificant, food availability has not been in consonance with increased production. Secondly, there has been excessive concern about growth in production in the country. Unfortunately, not much has been said or done regarding preservation. The public distribution system too has remained indifferent to the pressing needs of higher procurement, better preservation and better distribution. Thirdly, the gap between production and availability of food in the market has widened because of the huge waste that takes place in the course of transit from godowns to procurement centres to the fair price shops. Various estimates made by different bodies have stressed that nearly 40 per cent of the total food produced goes to waste along with almost 30 per cent of fruits and vegetables that decompose as a result of grossly inadequate preservation methods.           
	Fourthly, our agricultural policy has been tilting towards higher production instead of caring for the numerous varieties of paddy and wheat strains that face extinction. This is coupled with poor irrigation. Little effort has been made to preserve the varieties, especially of paddy, noted for their food value and flavour, although they are of a relatively lower yield. Finally, the food value of the potato has been hitherto disregarded, but it should be taken into account. After all, the potato fair held in Bangladesh recently highlighted the various properties of the vegetable that make it an ideal grain substitute.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Like the proverbial bad penny, secularism has re-entered the public discourse with gusto. Concerns over the agitation in Jammu over a land transfer to the Sri Amarnath Shrine Board, the pro-azadi stir in the Kashmir valley, the Hindu-Christian strife in Orissa and the revelations of an Islamist hand in the terrorist strikes in Jaipur and Ahmedabad have coalesced to produce another outcry over Indias secular future. Political parties with a stake in minority votes, human rights activists, professional secularists and the remnants of the once-powerful Nehruvian consensus have once again raised the cry that secularism is in danger. On TV talk shows, grim-faced intellectuals have debated the possible collapse of the idea of India.        
	As an aspect of the pre-general-election warm-up, the agonizing seems a part and parcel of Indian democracy, though few would condone the murder of an activist Hindu swami and the retaliatory attacks on Christians and their places of worship in the old Phulbani district. Yet, the debate on this occasion has gone well beyond the usual Amar-Akbar-Antony homilies and appeals to keep religion and politics well and truly apart.        
	First, it is painfully clear that India is witnessing an Islamist ferment that was hitherto subterranean. The cry of azadi, for example, has been the default chant of protestors in the Kashmir valley from 1989. What was significant about the contrived outrage against the transfer of 40 hectares to the Amarnath Shrine Board for three months each year and the imaginary economic blockade (West Bengal experienced more disruption during the recent bout of insanity over the Tata car factory in Singur) was the easy transition to Islamist nationalism.               
	Arundhati Roys description of a Srinagar rally in The Guardian is telling: Syed Ali Shah Geelani began his address with a recitation from the Quran. He then said what he has said before, on hundreds of occasions. The only way for the struggle to succeed, he said, was to turn to the Quran for guidance. He said Islam would guide the struggle and that it was a complete social and moral code that would govern the people of a free Kashmir. He said Pakistan had been created as the home of Islam, and that that goal should never be subverted. He said just as Pakistan belonged to Kashmir, Kashmir belonged to Pakistan.        
	Nor was the invocation of Nizam-e-Mustafa confined to the Kashmir valley, which the secularists believe is governed by a unique logic, distinct from the rest of India. The details of the Islamist terrorist conspiracy involving the Students Islamic Movement of India and/or Indian Mujahideen suggest that the motivation behind the assault on India is purely theological. What is even more ominous is the evidence that these terror networks were funded by zakat contributions, facilitated by religious institutions and protected by gullible human rights activists and cynical politicians. There is nothing to indicate that Islamist terrorism has any mass community sanction but, equally, there is no real indication of community revulsion.        
	Secondly, there is a common thread that binds the successful mass agitation in Jammu and the reprehensible tribal backlash against Christians in Kandhamal district: Hindu fury. Hitherto, political wisdom deemed that organized Hindu response to grievances existed only in the minds of over-zealous members of the sangh parivar. The Ayodhya movement, the 1993 Mumbai riots and the fierce backlash in Gujarat against the arson in Godhra did puncture this complacency. Yet secularists always nurtured the belief that Hindu consciousness was invariably offset by caste, language and regional pulls. Raj Thackerays anti-outsider high-handedness in Mumbai, the Gujjar stir in Rajasthan and the self-serving perception that the Bharatiya Janata Party has lost its way created an environment whereby it was thought that Hindu passivity had returned. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagams insistence on demolishing the Ram Setu and the tokenism associated with the Rajinder Sachar Committee recommendations were a direct consequence of this misplaced calculation.        
	The two-month-long Jammu stir, which witnessed a phenomenal unity of all Hindus in the region, cutting across the political divide, was an eye-opener to both politicians in the Kashmir valley and the establishment in Delhi. Both had become accustomed to taking Jammu for granted. Likewise, the fierce reaction to the murder of the venerable Swami Laxmananda Saraswati on August 23 took everyone, not least the Orissa government, by complete surprise.        
	Whether the swami was killed by Maoists or others was not the issue. The murder became the occasion for a Hindu explosion over an issue that is hardly ever addressed in polite circles in Delhi and Bhubaneshwar: the conflict between the Church and indigenous faiths. The irony is that it is this conflict that has been simmering all over central India for some time and has thrown up a militant, non-Brahmanical Hindutva that blends local culture with militant nationalism. Just as the Christian churches in these remote battlegrounds are not the epitome of a benign faith based on compassion and charity, the little tradition Hinduism of the tribal communities has precious little in common with, say, the genteel Art of Living.        
	Finally, the existential anguish of secularism has brought to the fore the capitulationist streak of the secularist order. Arundhati Roys critique of the Amarnath yatra as an aggressive political statement by an increasingly Hindu-fundamentalist Indian state may not be widely shared, but there is little doubt that a section of the deracinated, Barak-Obama-loving, cosmopolitan elite now share her view that Indias military occupation of the Kashmir valley allows Hindu chauvinists to target and victimise Muslims in India by holding them hostage to the freedom struggle being waged by Muslims in Kashmir. Articles in the mainstream media endorsing azadi for the Kashmir valley would have been unimaginable some years ago. That these mingle harmoniously with assertions of the innocence of the Simi/IM activists, demands for Afzal Gurus pardon and the rights of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh point to the growing perversion of the inclusive approach to nation-building.              
	Indeed, recent events point to the steady drift of the Nehruvian consensus to the fringe. The principle of separate development for minorities (reflected in separate personal laws and a special status for Kashmir) was meant as an emotional facilitator. Instead, it has reinforced emotional separatism and has been portrayed as a non-negotiable right. In 1947, the whole body of nationalist opinion was firmly against communal reservations. Today, the Congress in Andhra Pradesh has opened the floodgates of Muslim reservation. In the Eighties, Indira Gandhis opposition to terrorism was unequivocal. Today, the Congress finds nothing odd in nurturing a lax security apparatus on the grounds that special laws to counter terror would alienate minorities. In private, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, praises the Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, for opening the eyes of the country to the Simi, but he wont allow the laws that will prevent its members from using technicalities to escape conviction. The Congress establishment has tacitly upheld the human rights of terror suspects, but it is disdainful of the ordinary citizens demand for security against bombers. It is this institutionalized priority given to sectional interests over the national good that has fuelled a perverse mindset whose most recent manifestation was Mamata Banerjees destructive nihilism in Singur.        
	The goal-posts have been constantly shifted by a nervous secularist establishment. From an enlightened, if somewhat romantic, ideal, the idea of India is being transformed into a permissive nightmare. This is bound to generate a disquiet which can easily turn into rage at the slightest provocation.

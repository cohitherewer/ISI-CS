	Repetition is addictive: this is something that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation would eagerly attest to. For example, there is something enjoyable about the familiarity of dengue, malignant malaria and chikungunya returning to haunt the city every year. This year, Japanese encephalitis has been added to the list of mosquito-borne diseases. There have been no Japanese encephalitis cases for the last 10 years, but the corporation was never interested in improvement: decline is so much more exciting. Never mind that people die every year of diseases that are preventable in the first place. This time, the corporation has found another stimulating twist to play with. When a 20-year-old student, who lives in Calcutta but whose home is in Tamluk, East Midnapore, has dengue and dies after being first admitted to a hospital in Tamluk and then to a nursing home in Calcutta, where did the dengue-carrying mosquito bite him, in Calcutta or in Tamluk? This is a fascinating question to debate over. Such activity can be so much more gripping than the issue of trying to contain the infection, locate the sources, and equip hospitals for the correct tests and treatment. A basic requirement for containing the infection is spray-killing mosquitoes and destroying larvae in the immediate vicinity of all hospitals and nursing homes where such patients are brought, apart from taking particular care within the building so that the infection cannot be carried by mosquitoes from the affected individual to other patients. But that is hard work; arguing is so much more fun.        
	Beating the mosquito needs a multi-level approach, and that approach has been rehearsed over and over again. People need to know which are the mosquito-borne diseases  everyone knows where the insect breeds. If the necessities of storing water, cleaning the surroundings, and exposure at night cannot be all stopped at one go, patient, wide-reaching reminders of the dangers of mosquitoes can help. The local governments can do the cleaning up and mosquito-killing in the public spaces while setting up monitoring units to locate possible danger zones. Everything can be done; all that is needed is a combination of elementary thinking powers, a will to work, a sense of shame at failure, and true grief that lives should have been lost that should not even have been threatened.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CITY WITHOUT THE BLINDING LIGHTS                                  MAGIC LANTERN      Children have ways of enjoying power cuts that adults can never fathom                                                  
	Strangely enough, my earliest memory of a power cut in Calcutta is associated not with darkness but with light: a tiny, lamp-like iridescence. I must have been around seven and I remember sitting inside a car as we drove past the Maidan. It was dusk, and the street lights, which had just begun to glow, blinked once, twice, and then gave way to a dense darkness. I shoved my sister aside and peered out of the window. The trees, silhouetted by headlights, stood still at a distance. Then I saw the flickering lights, in a neat, single file. They came from the oil lamps that had been lit by phuchkawalas inside the Maidan. The lights were eerie yet beautiful. That image has stayed with me, along with the knowledge that it was the power-less city that made the lights look pretty.        
	I grew up in the Eighties, and power cuts or loadshedding (as it is still called) were all too common. The dark affected us  children and adults  in vastly different ways. On hot summer nights (always summer, never winter or the rains, I wonder why), the yellow bulb in the study would start dimming, and then go out. It was time for us, the children, to push our books away and run to the terrace, which lay radiant in a silvery light. It was also the time for games, food and ghosts. The lukochuri would break up, though, on hearing the low rumble of the snackmans cart in the alley. Later, we would gather around a lantern, sharing food, secrets and phantom tales.         
	Sometimes, we would listen to our friends talk on other terraces. At other times, there would be conversations. We would lie down on the still-cooling terrace, watching the inky sky, talking to friends, unseen to each other.         
	The adults, of course, sat grumbling downstairs. My father would smoke in the balcony, muttering, the corners of his mouth lighting up every now and then. My mother would sit still  angry and helpless  her eyes darting towards the inverter that made whining, complaining noises. The terraces and balconies in other houses would fill up slowly. There would be snatches of laughter, conversation, a few songs even.         
	Power cuts touched everything. The living, as well as the lifeless. There were slogans and graffiti on the walls. I remember one drawing in particular that showed the then chief ministers beaming face in bold brush strokes, a sinewy hand hung above his head, holding a lantern. The streets erupted occasionally. Once I saw a masked man leading a protest, in a long, black dress. I was told that this was load-shedding himself.        
	Things began to change for the better from the mid-Nineties. The power situation in the state has continued to improve since then. In 2006-07, Bengal recorded a monthly surplus of 2,000 million units. A net export of 1,100 million units was registered the following year. Today, West Bengal sells power to other states. The comrades cannot stop smiling or looking in the direction of Bakreswar and Kolaghat. Nobody seems to mind that there is too much light these days. On the neon-lit streets, inside the malls, though not so much in the village homes.         
	This summer, though, things changed, even in Calcutta. The lights have faltered frequently (and not just at the Eden Gardens). The stretches of darkness  a time spent among still fans, silent computer screens and dead light bulbs  have lengthened. This time, I am older, and I get angry.        
	Yet, on some nights, after the lights go out, I watch, from my room, the terraces and balconies filling up in the dark. I can hear laughter, conversation and songs, all over again. Suddenly, I dont want the lights to return.

	Trust deficit                  
	Sir  The turn of events during Tuesdays trust vote in the parliament has undoubtedly sullied Indias democratic image (Cash display stuns House, July 23). Ashok Argal, a Bharatiya Janata Party MP, walked in carrying a wad of notes, claiming that a Samajwadi leader had tried to bribe him. He was soon joined by two other party colleagues, who alleged that money had been offered to them as well. The manner in which members of the parliament are allegedly being bought over has come as a shock to Indian citizens. If the allegations of bribery are proved to be true, one fears that MPs will soon start sacrificing the countrys interests in return of hefty bribes. Democracy in India, it seems, is dead; this country has turned into a banana republic. It is a pity that the custodians of our sacred Constitution have turned out to be men of such dubious character. Indians should demand a judicial enquiry by the apex court to establish the truth behind the charges. Otherwise, we have to live with the shame of being a tainted nation.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ardhendu Bose, Siliguri 

                
	Sir  The United Progressive Alliances victory in the trust vote on July 22 ended days of intense political speculation. Yet, it was a black day in the history of Indian democracy. First, the Opposition prevented the prime minister from completing his concluding speech. Then, three BJP members alleged that a Samajwadi Party member had asked them to abstain from voting in exchange of a princely sum of money. The allegation, however, appears a bit far-fetched. If the three men had indeed been approached with a bribe, what prevented them from taking the matter up with the Speaker earlier in the day? Perhaps the trio considered the evening to be an auspicious time to spill the beans. The truth will be revealed if an impartial inquiry is instituted with the Speaker as the head.           
	The result of the trust vote proved to be a case of sour grapes for the BJP and the Bahujan Samaj Party. Both Mayavati and Advani were left sulking at the end of the day. The decks are now clear for the government to proceed with the Indo-US nuclear deal. However, in its haste to get the deal passed, the government should remember to discuss the deals pros and cons with Indian scientists, who, undoubtedly, would understand its nittygritties better than our politicians.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur 

                
	Sir  The bribery allegations during the trust vote has made a mockery of Indias august political traditions. The trust vote, it is alleged, was reduced to an auction, with brazen parliamentarians selling their votes to the highest bidder. The cash-for-vote scam has thrown up important legal-political questions that are relevant to our democracy. It also took our minds back to the JMM bribery case in which MPs were reported to have voted for the P.V. Narasimha Rao government after being paid off. All this points to a disturbing trend, which must be arrested at the earliest. Else, it would completely destroy the peoples faith in our democratic institutions. Hopefully, those in power and in the opposition will rise above party lines to suggest measures to tackle the menace of horse-trading.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Abhijit Roy, Jamshedpur

                
	Sir  The people of India want to know the whole truth behind the vote-for-money scandal. A television channel, reportedly, has claimed that it possesses tapes showing bribes being accepted. The network must make the tapes public. If it desists from showing the tapes, it would fail in its duty to expose the rot that has set in. If there is even an iota of truth about the contention, then the claims of victory by Manmohan Singh and his colleagues would sound rather hollow.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Dark and dreary          
	Sir  The Calcutta Electric Supply Corporations only job is to supply uninterrupted power supply to its consumers. For several days now, parts of Calcutta, including Golf Green, have been facing frequent and prolonged power cuts. Advertisements issued by the CESC declare that 1912 is the number to call when the lights go out. However, recently, we tried calling this number innumerable times, only to be greeted by a sing-song recorded message stating that all the customer care officers were busy attending other calls. At other times, we failed to get through on account of the phone line remaining busy. On the rare occasions when someone answered our calls, we would be assured that the officials were looking into the problem.           
	Despite their assurances, cable faults are common and take an inordinate time to be rectified. The situation, I am sure, is similar all over Calcutta (Power cut feared during day, July 4). The CESC needs to deliver instead of giving lame excuses. During summer, the company points at excess demand to justify power cuts. In the rains, the fault, we hear, lies with the wet coal that is supplied. Come winter and power supply improves due to the fall in demand. All this seems to suggest that the problem of infrequent power lies with the consumers and the weather, and not the agency that has been given the responsibility to provide electricity to the city. Perhaps a bit of competition will help improve CESCs performance.           
	Yours faithfully,

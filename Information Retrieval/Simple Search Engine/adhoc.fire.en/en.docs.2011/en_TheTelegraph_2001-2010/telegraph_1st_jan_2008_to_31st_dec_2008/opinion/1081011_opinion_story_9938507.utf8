                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Letters to Editor
                
	Identity crisis                  
	Sir  A new ATM has come up at the Rash Behari Avenue crossing. The board above the entrance says Vodafone. Confused, I asked the security guard which banks ATM it was. He said that he did not know the name of the bank and added that only credit-card transactions and check deposits are done here. Even after having worked in a nationalized bank for four years, I do not know of any bank called Vodafone. Instead of misleading the people, will the concerned authorities please let us know the name of the bank that possesses this ATM?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Great distress          
	Sir  The results of the opinion poll on the greatest living Bengali (Oct 6) conducted by CNN-IBN and The Telegraph were stunning. It was surprising that the people of Bengal, who take pride in their supreme intellect, chose a cricketer (Sourav Ganguly) and an actor (Rani Mukherjee) as the greatest and the second greatest Bengali alive respectively, leaving behind eminent people like Amartya Sen or Ashoke Sen.           
	Personally, I have the greatest regard for the cricketer and the actor, but are they really comparable in stature to a Nobel Laureate or a renowned physicist? Amartya Sen is perhaps the beacon of modern-day Bengal. His pioneering work on development issues has made him one of the foremost economists. Ashoke Sen has earned fame all over the world for his String Theory. The fact that these two Bengalis have got less than 1 per cent of the total votes speaks volumes about our intellectual preferences.           
	There is something trite in the character of Bengalis as a whole that makes them gawk at glamour: they are awed by cricketers and movie stars easily. Perhaps it is this quality that makes us turn to Page 3 of a newspaper even when some catastrophe has happened in the country. I believe that this trait has brought us to the position that we are in today. However, Bengalis need not worry about this  today, the whole of India behaves in this manner. This is evident from the fact that Amitabh Bachchan probably has more temples dedicated to him than to the many gods of Hindu mythology.           
	The poll results left me both dismayed and disappointed. I would like to know whether the respondents had actually bothered to find out anything about the other great Bengalis in the list before voting for Ganguly and Mukherjee?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ashok Menon, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is disgraceful to see Sourav Ganguly getting a majority of the votes in a poll that also featured other greats including Amartya Sen. Ganguly may be a gifted cricketer, but can he ever be compared with a man like Sen? And what about Rani Mukherjee? How can she be greater than, say, Jhumpa Lahiri? The poll results were shameful and they have eroded my faith in the judgement of Bengalis.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Sudhir Mishra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The word, greatest, in the just concluded poll should have been defined and explained for the benefit of the SMS janata. Perhaps the voters confused greatest with popular. Hence, Sourav Ganguly, who is inarguably the most popular Bengali, was adjudged the greatest.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  A Bengali daily had once conducted an opinion poll to find out whether roadblocks all over North Bengal would solve the problems of sick tea gardens. Unbelievably, 74 per cent said yes. If this poll result can be taken as an index of the intelligence of the average voter, then it is not surprising that Dada was voted the greatest Bengali.           
	Yours faithfully,

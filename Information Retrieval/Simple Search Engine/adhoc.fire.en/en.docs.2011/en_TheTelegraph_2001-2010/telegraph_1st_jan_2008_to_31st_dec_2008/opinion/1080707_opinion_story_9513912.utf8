	The Ottoman Empire had already been in retreat for over a century when the Young Turk revolution broke out in July 1908. Some of the Young Turks hoped to save the whole empire; others wanted to abandon the empire and rescue an independent Turkey from the wreckage. The latter group won the argument in the end, and although the rest of the empire fell under European imperial rule ten years later, Turkey itself was saved. Now, exactly a hundred years after the Young Turks, the country is plunged into another constitutional crisis.        
	In March, the public prosecutor brought a case to Turkeys highest judicial body, the constitutional court, demanding that the ruling AK (Justice and Development) Party, re-elected only last year with an increased majority, be shut down for trying to subvert the secular state. He also wants Prime Minister Tayyib Recep Erdogan and seventy other senior party members banned from politics for five years.        
	Last week the government struck back, arresting two retired generals and 23 other people on the charge of provoking armed rebellion against the government. One, General Hursit Tolon, was the former second-in-command of the army. Police allege that they were members of a state-backed gang that is suspected of a number of murders of prominent public figures with the aim of destabilizing Turkish society and forcing military intervention. But state-backed? Isnt the government itself the embodiment of the State? In Turkey, not necessarily. The conspirators, it is claimed, belong to what Turks call the deep state, the alliance of senior judicial and military figures who still see themselves as the guardians of the secular Turkish republic that was the ultimate result of the Young Turk revolution.              
	Deep state        
	What the rebellious Young Turk officers demanded in July 1908, was the restoration of the constitution that had been suspended 30 years before. It brought a rough kind of democracy to the multinational empire, but the various ethnic nationalisms, Bulgarian, Kurdish, Greek, Arab, Armenian  and, above all, Turkish  were already too strong for a unified state to survive.        
	The Ottoman Empire went under at the end of World War I, leaving a decimated Turkish population to fight for its independence against British, French, Italian and Greek invaders who sought to carve Turkey up between them. The man who led that independence struggle, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founded the Turkish Republic in 1923, and he made it one of the most rigorously secular states in the world. 99 per cent of Turkeys citizens are Muslims, but political parties are banned from appealing to religion. Even religious symbols are seen as dangerous. Initially, this militant secularism was a tactic for wrenching a largely illiterate and conservative peasantry out of its medieval ways and catapulting the country into the 20th century. But as the decades passed, the reformers turned into self-selecting republican elites who justified their privileges by claiming that they had a mission to defend the secular state.        
	A hundred years after the Young Turk revolution, the Turks are again at a crossroads. It is quite possible that the court will decide to ban the AK Party later this year. The outlook this time is a lot brighter. It will turn out all right because the self-nominated defenders of secularism are transparently cynical in their attempts to manipulate popular opinion. And AK Party leaders have clearly decided that its not worth having a bloody political battle now, when its obvious that they have already won the war.        
	If the court bans the party, they will all resign from power peacefully. Then those who are not banned from politics entirely for five years will reform the party under another name, and fight and win another election. Bit by bit, the deep state will wither away.

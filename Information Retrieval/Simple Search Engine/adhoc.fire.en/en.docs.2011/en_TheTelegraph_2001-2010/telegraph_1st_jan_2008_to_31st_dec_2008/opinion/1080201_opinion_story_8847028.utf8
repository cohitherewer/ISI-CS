	Republic-day honours have deteriorated into perks for friends, and are now given by the government to those who it would like to co-opt. It is disappointing to see the government neglect and shun hundreds of anonymous men and women who have helped preserve India as a vibrant, multi-disciplinary and plural cultural entity. Since the State has successfully managed to deny the best and the brightest of Indians the honours, particularly since the Seventies, it is time we compel those in power to reward the men and women who are working silently to create a better India. Since these men and women live in the real India, and not in the sterile expanses of the countrys atrociously planned modern cities, an indifferent State finds it easier to ignore the contributions of a dynamic and competitive India, one that could emerge as a leader with the help of tried-and-tested alternatives to bring about dignified living in the future.
    
	Global warming and its dire consequences have been dominating international discourse of late. Carbon emissions and other such environmental issues are plaguing the planet, human expertise is giving way to a kind of robotization that has resulted in the compartmentalizing of thought and the dumbing down of content in the all-pervasive electronic media as well as in other channels of communication that connect the media with the masses. All this has resulted in diluting the traditional and diverse indigenous strengths of our ancient culture, which are now being replaced by methodologies and tools that would soon become redundant in a rapidly changing world. 
        
	Treasure trove
    
	India needs to bring into play all its inherited legacies that are relevant to the modern, contemporary world. This is because ours was a tradition that was once localized and diverse, one that drew from nature and existed within the rules. It was also characterized by an architectural tradition, which used materials that were compatible with the environment. We must actively consider the revival of everything that remains relevant in the new century.
    
	This is an opportunity to set standards for the world and revive a way of life that we had once known and lived. The potential of a large number of Indians remains untapped. Perhaps we need to draw on their expertise to build new mores for the future. If our national and state leadership would turn to our real strengths and stop imitating the failed Western world, we could rescue our people from their plight.
    
	Today a painter, whose skills would match those of the artists in Akbars atelier, is spending his days in penury. This is merely one instance from the many similar examples that we come across each day. Government servants, by and large, do not see these things. Their blinkers prevent them from noticing these deprived people. Nowhere in the world would this happen to a Master. But then, those who frame archaic policies and are the arbiters of quality are, more often than not, people with little or no understanding of history, tradition, philosophy and the arts. They are forever confined within the insular world of government departments which restricts their minds and disengages them from the process of change.
    
	As a small gesture, the Centre should begin to scour this land for talented individuals so that they could be honoured during the next Republic Day celebrations. Removing the selection process from the hands of the nodal ministry for Republic-day honours and transferring it to the ministry of culture should be followed by the deletion of the names of politicians from the list of contenders. We would then have a list of living treasures who would do India proud despite the political degradation.

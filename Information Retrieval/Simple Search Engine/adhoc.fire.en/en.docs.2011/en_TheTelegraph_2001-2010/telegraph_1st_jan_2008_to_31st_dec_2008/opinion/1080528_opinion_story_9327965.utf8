	It is the lot of Indian superstars, in films and in politics, to be as unreachable as they are popular. Think of Aishwarya Rai and Sonia Gandhi. Each, in her own way, is alluring as well as opaque. Their lives are incessantly public, but impenetrably private too, as far as their ordinary audiences are concerned. And the manipulation of this distance from the people, with varying degrees of risk and success, is part of the great games the superstars play: democracy and showbiz, democracy as showbiz. With the coming of the internet, and then the blogs, democracy gets a chance to be played differently. A new kind of traffic opens up between the stars and their public, new ways of revealing and disguising the self, new ways of not being able to avoid hearing what people are saying. So even as fans get to know from his blog how Aamir Khan is spending an idyllic time by the River Krishna with mother, children and dog named Shahrukh, another level of bitchery is struck between two public figures. Then there were Amitabh Bachchans comments on Shah Rukh Khans new show flopping, followed by a rather disappointing apology. Finally, and more seriously, Omar Abdullahs entirely justifiable and sharply irreverent comment on the Indian president saying cheese in Kashmir with an AK47. Mr Abdullahs blog entry has provoked 31 astonishingly frank comments from readers, all of which together represent the voices of Kashmir far more tellingly than any media report. His other entries, some of them explicitly political in tone and content, also forge a different kind of public discourse  and a different recognition of the politicians accountability to the people  in the realm of democratic practice.        
	Perhaps, as Shobhaa D pointed out to Bachchan, eminent bloggers should cut out the niceties and go unabashedly for one anothers throats. That might rescue the public sphere in India from the mediocre and the anodyne. A boring lack of candour and indiscretion characterizes the public privacies of very important men and women in India, be they prime ministers, party presidents, film stars or criminals. But blogging affords an opportunity to fashion new voices in which to communicate personally with the anonymous masses. Indian eminences should seize that opportunity, and thus give a much-needed human edge to an otherwise mind-numbing Babel of platitudes.

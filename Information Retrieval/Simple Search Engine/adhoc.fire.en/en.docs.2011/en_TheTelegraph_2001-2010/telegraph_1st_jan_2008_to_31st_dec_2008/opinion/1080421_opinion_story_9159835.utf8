	Its no surprise that the camera, in Ray, is a synecdoche for  not a prosthetic appendage of  the human, especially of the eye and its magnificent capacity to receive the world: the eye itself embedded in the humanist wonder of seeing  chokh melechhi. Metaphors for seeing populate the oeuvre, from the opening scene of Pather Panchali, where we look out on Durgas face from darkness  of the theatre, with its Cartesian beam of light illuminating the screen, as well as from the inside of the basket of kittens whose lid the little girl has just removed. The instant when Apu, pretending to be asleep, opens his eye is almost too famous to mention; that eye reappears as the rent in the curtain that lets daylight into Apus rented room in Aparajito ; the binoculars in Charulatas hand; the slats in the Venetian window she peers through urgently. Rents, tears, keyholes, the act of spying (think of Feluda in Joy Baba Felunath, hidden behind a string cot, looking out through a rent at the prime suspect): all these are pregnant, in Ray, with revelatory value. To give primacy to the eye, Ray must make the camera  the machine  not irrelevant but seamless: not an artificial but an organic element in filmmaking. Just as Rays relationship, as an artist, with the visible world is Flaubertian  involving fashioning an exact cinematic language to show it as it is  the camera, in his hands, approximates the model of the Flaubertian author: self-effacing, transparent, nowhere visible but everywhere present.        
	In Ajantrik  a silly story, Ghatak said with evident relish, only silly people can identify themselves with a man who believes that that God-forsaken machine has life  there seem to be at least a couple of references to the Tagorean brief of looking, or dekha, a brief passed on, for the purposes of Bengali cinema, from Tagore to Ray. (The small, rather pious poem Tagore wrote in Rays notebook when the latter was seven, about having travelled the world and oceans without noticing the dewdrop upon a stalk of rice, not only unconsciously transfers the mantle and reiterates the morality of the gaze, but is prescient in its advice: it reminds the young recipient to narrow the vision, as in a cinematic frame  for the frame is about excluding unnecessary material.)               
	The roof of Bimals taxi has a tear, which lets in the rain, embarrassing Bimal, making him defensive; it also offers fleeting glimpses of the sky and sun. The ramshackle (Ghataks word) vehicle makes the main feminine presence in the film, Kajal Gupta, collapse with laughter upon entering it, till she sees Bimal glowering. But the tear in the roof, and the promise of space it offers, entrances her momentarily. This tear is a rare figure, in Ghatak, for the Tagorean eye, opening out onto the luminous (more space, more light, in Tagores formulation); and, as in Ray, its context isnt grand, or grandiose, but comic, shabby, homely. The location of the human, in Ray, indeed, in much of modernism, is the finite and the commonplace; and its also the commonplace the eye consistently transposes value to. Its this homeliness that makes camerawork in Ray organic, natural.        
	Despite the rent, Ghataks visual mtier is (as I pointed out earlier) strikingly different from Rays. Its not so much the eye that interests Ghatak, as bringing the camera  the machine  face to face both with nature and with the audience. Ray beholds the world but leaves it as it is; this is a mark of his Flaubertian temperament, but its also, probably, his modulation (as a product of Santiniketan) on Tagores peculiar Oriental humanism  for Tagore argued that the Orient had a long lineage of the human co-existing with nature, in contrast to Western mans relentless compulsion to dominate it. Ghatak, however, wants technology  the camera  to interfere with, and transform, nature; but in a manner unlike, I think, the way in which the Romantic believes technology appropriates the natural. Ghataks intention is not only to give the machine subjectivity  to anthropomorphize it, to commit the pathetic fallacy  but to allow it to occupy a subjective space  the space of feeling, of suffering and celebration, which only we are conscious of occupying. In Ajantrik, hes always playing around with both the pathetic fallacy  conferring subjectivity  and with, in a bustling, powerful way, reshaping the subject. How does he do this?         
	There are, of course, the delightful examples of anthropomorphism, of which the car, as Bimal pours water into its radiator, going Glug glug glug aah! is justly well known. Theres also the moment when the boy who lives with Bimal tries his hand, without permission, at driving the car; it goes out of control, only to stop inches before the laughing Kajal Gupta, whos indifferent to her own danger. Is this a transference of subjectivity, or a creation of it (They dont realise that you too are human)? The other half of the observation (They say Ive become a machine) is invoked in Ghataks films, including Ajantrik, in relation to how the lens of the camera records panoramas, especially during crises, or some apocalyptic intuition of joy. When Bimal begins to reconcile himself to the fact that car has no future, the camera suddenly presents us with the range of the unexpectedly participatory landscape around Bimal, reminiscent of the way it behaved in Meghe Dhaka Tara when Nita cried out, Dada, ami bachte chai.         
	Ghatak isnt instructing us, as Auden did, that the quotidian is essentially indifferent to, and outlasts, suffering; here, the quotidian is unnaturally alive to grief; it seems to be listening  another pathetic fallacy. But the machine, in this instance  the camera  is whats committing the fallacy, giving to the landscape a human sensitivity, while being complicit with, and inextricable from, the moments brimming over with emotion; its a witness, a creator, an actor, and one thats implicated, embarrassingly, in the longing for life.        
	When it comes to panoramas, Ghataks lens is profligate in the possibilities it ascribes. The opening of Titas Ekti Nadir Naam comprises a remote aerial shot of a great delta; till we realize its a close-up of a sandbank. Not only does this surprising view allegorize the literal ebb and flow of the narrative, the extinction and birth of communities and a river, it abnegates the eye for a vantage-point that belongs to the machine. In Komal Gandhar, as Rishi sings Akash bhara surja tara, the camera keeps going in and out of focus as it reshapes the panorama of Kurseong, a device far more estranging than the tracking shots that mimic the movement of the body and the eye: first focusing on Rishi, then on the woods behind him, letting Rishi fade; later showing us another character, Shibu, against the backdrop of hills, then allowing him to evaporate while shifting focus to a waterfall behind, which shines like a molten thread. Unlike Rays eye, or I, forever situated in the makeshift and commonplace, Ghataks most dislocating transactions between technology and nature take place in vastness, and constitute his repeated, fitful attempts at the sublime.              
	Finally, the way in which Ray and Ghatak think of the child is intimately connected to the manner in which they perceive the natural on the one hand, and the mechanical on the other. Rays child is organically whole, and, from the moment Apu opens his eye, an astonishing, magical, and transparent receptor of the universe. For Ghatak, though, the child is incomplete, and is in the process of becoming human; and, in this, it resembles Bimals idea of the machine. Unsurprisingly, then, the child and the machine frequently converge in Ghataks work; as in the marvellous scene in Subarnarekha in which the boy in the abandoned military outpost has been metamorphosed, as it were, into an aircraft, and is accompanied, on the soundtrack, by the engines roar; or the tender sequence in Komal Gandhar in which a toddler pursues Supriya Chowdhury, dragging a toy automobile by a string.         
	But remember, the difference between the organic and the mechanical is that the latter can be dismantled, and then even fused again. Thus, the cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in Terminator, sitting and repairing his own damaged arm; and Jaggadal, taken apart and sold in bits and pieces. The child, like the filmmaker, is more cyborg than human being: at the culmination of Ajantrik, it smiles and blows the abandoned horn, displaying to us how the imminent but not-quite human and the mechanical might be conjoined with one another.                          THIS CONCLUDES A TWO-PART ESSAY

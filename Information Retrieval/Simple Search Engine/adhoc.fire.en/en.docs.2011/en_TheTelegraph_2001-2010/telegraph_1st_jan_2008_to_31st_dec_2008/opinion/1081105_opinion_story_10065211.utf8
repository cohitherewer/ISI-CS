	Age of reason
    While joining the service of the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Board in 1970, a man submitted a certificate that said that his date of birth was 10.03.1952. In 1986 he came to know that when he joined his age had been recorded as 20 years and not 18. He found out that the authorities had come to such a conclusion from his medical test. He filed a petition for the correction of his date of birth, but it was turned down. Holding that his date of birth should be taken as 1952, the Andhra Pradesh High Court said that the date had been recorded in all documents for 30 years. It added that the need for a medical test arose only when there was no proof of the date of birth. (Iqbal Hussain vs Central Power Distribution Company of A.P.

	No vile intent        
	 A bus conductor was dismissed for not issuing tickets to all his passengers before a journey. He pleaded that there had been a delay as the bus was full. When the Labour Court reinstated the petitioner, the authorities went to the Andhra Pradesh High Court. Upholding the order of reinstatement, the court said that since a check had revealed that the tickets were being issued to all passengers except three people whose tickets too had been punched, the conductor had no vile intention. It held that the violation occurred only because he was handling a big crowd. It further added that without looking at the circumstances, a disciplinary authority should not pass an order of dismissal. (Depot manager APSRTC vs D. Narayanan)                                
	Cops ticked off        
	 Following the kidnap of a minor girl child in Uttar Pradesh, instead of apprehending the accused or trying to recover the child, the police tried to get the complaint withdrawn. The Supreme Court condemned the practice among policemen of not registering FIRs immediately. It observed that there had been several instances where FIRs were registered only after the complainants had moved court. The court directed that all state governments, Union territories, directors general of police and police commissioners be informed that if steps were not taken for the immediate registration of FIRs, the complainants could go to magistrates who could then issue contempt proceedings against the errant officers.

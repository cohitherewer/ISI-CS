	A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India
   By Upinder Singh, Pearson, Rs 3,500        
	Of the three periods into which Indian history is conveniently divided, the ancient period is perhaps the toughest to teach, and to write about for the intelligent person interested in history. There are many reasons for this. One is the vastness of the period  it stretches from pre-historic times to the 12th century. The other is that there are still large areas of this period about which relatively little is known. Ancient Indian history remains the quarry of specialists, each one of them doing good and solid research in their specialized fields. Bringing the various strands and findings of these specialized researches into one volume that is lucidly written is a very challenging task. Upinder Singh takes on this challenge with aplomb in her book.        
	This book is expressly intended for students and teachers; and also for the non-specialist reader interested in knowing about ancient India, and the state of research on the period. Having said that, one hastens to add that the specialist will also find this book of interest.        
	Indian history is plagued by the curse of its practitioners writing only for their peer group. This has made much of what is written on Indian history utterly dull and incomprehensible to the ordinary and intelligent reader. The other curse is groupism. Indian historians think and write in cabals and cliques. Singhs book is an attempt to break out of these chains. She writes with a refreshing openness, and her constant aim is to communicate clearly, without simplifying the complex subject matter before her. In my opinion, this is the major contribution of the book. Within a strong chronological framework, Singh presents cogently her facts and analysis; she also tells her readers where the gaps in knowledge lie. Her text is thus inevitably open.        
	To make her book useful for students and teachers, Singh uses a number of devices within the text. Boxes are used extensively to discuss definitions to important concepts, to analyse the principal sources and to indicate the new directions of research on a given theme. There is a large number of maps, pictures and figures. Readers will find  to take random examples  separate boxes on the identification of Taxila and on the Ashtadhyayi of Panini. These devices always help the readers understanding and to arouse his curiosity. Singh wears her erudition very lightly and her prose is never weighed down by jargon.        
	Underlying the analysis in this book is the belief that archaeological evidence needs to be made more central to the writing of ancient Indian history. Singh argues that generally archaeological evidence is used as corroboration of findings derived from other kinds of sources, especially literary ones. Singhs opinion is that in view of the information and insights offered by rapidly growing archaeological data, historical narratives can no longer afford to remain text-centric. This cannot be argued with. She is also right when she says that texts and archaeology generate different sorts of historical narratives and suggest different rhythms of cultural continuity, transition and change. But one cannot help thinking that the distinction between literary and archaeological evidence, while important, may have been too sharply drawn here. Historians, over the years, have sought to be more nuanced in the way they have brought together these two types of evidence. Otherwise, a writing of this kind of book would perhaps not have been possible.        
	It is impossible to discern from a book of this nature one overarching argument that holds the work together. What is equally relevant is that the discipline of ancient Indian history is not amenable to very large generalizations and grand theories. There are too many variations over time and regions to buttress any great theory. One of Singhs strengths is that she resists the temptation to offer any such generalization. In an era when most historians are torn between different and contending theories, Singh remains rooted to facts and analysis without ever committing the error of claiming that she has said the last word on the subject.        
	I have two small grouses, but both are on things external to Singhs text. One is the proliferation of endorsements of the book. This is oddly very unfair to Singh. She has written a masterly book that does not need the prop of endorsements. Readers will be able to form their opinion after going through the book. There is no need at all to thrust the opinion of others (even if some of them are reputed scholars of ancient India; by the way, many, whose endorsements are included, are not). The publishers may have released a boomerang by this overkill of endorsements.        
	The other grouse concerns pricing. No book intended for students and teachers in India can be priced at Rs 3,500 and expect to reach its target readership in the country. Most high school and college libraries  let alone individual buyers  will be hard-pressed to buy a copy. There is no doubt that the book is lavishly produced, and that its production values make it more user-friendly, but publishers could have thought of ways to lower the price. Subsidies and sponsorships are not entirely unknown in todays world. This book must reach students and teachers, otherwise Singhs outstanding achievement will go to waste.

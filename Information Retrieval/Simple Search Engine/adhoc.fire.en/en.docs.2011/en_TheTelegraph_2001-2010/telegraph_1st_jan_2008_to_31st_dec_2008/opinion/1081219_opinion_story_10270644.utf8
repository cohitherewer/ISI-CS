	Anyone would agree that a post-office workers strike is unacceptable. A strike that cripples the normal course of the everyday life of the nation and causes damage worth crores of rupees is ethically questionable. This would be the chief argument against the nationwide strike called by the All India Postal Employees Union and the National Federation of Postal Employees in support of the demands of the workers categorized as Gramin Dak Sevaks, who were originally recruited as extra-departmental employees. Much water has flowed under the bridge since then. The GDS now has almost three lakh employees working in post-offices throughout the country, who have been asking for the regularization of their services for quite a while. But what has touched the GDS close is the report of the Nataraja Murthy committee, formed to study the problems of the GDS. It has recommended the lowering of retirement age by three years, a rate of time related pay that is unacceptable to the workers, and abolition of about one lakh posts of GDS employees working as stamp vendors, packers and urban sub-post masters. This is a far cry from the parity in wages and pension with departmental employees that the GDS had already been asking for.        
	A postal strike cannot be condoned, but it must also be noted that this one had been long in the making. Demonstrations by postal staff, especially by those in the GDS union, had been occurring in different places in the country since September 2007. Objections to the Nataraja Murthy committee and requests that a judicial commission look into the disparities had been repeatedly voiced. It may not be possible or wise to bow to every demand. But the government had had plenty of time to work out the problems with the postal workers. It is not as if the government does not know that recruiting an army of extra-departmental staff in any institution to save money is a recipe for future trouble. When the nation suffers now, the postal workers alone cannot be blamed.

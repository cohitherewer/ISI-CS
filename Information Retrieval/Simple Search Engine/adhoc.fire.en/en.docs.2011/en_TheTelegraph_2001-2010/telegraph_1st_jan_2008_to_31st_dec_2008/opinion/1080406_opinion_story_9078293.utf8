	State of despair                  
	Sir  Satyendra Mohan Roychowdhury, deprived of medical care and compassion, is not just a victim of circumstances (Alone amp; ill, but not enough for hospital, March 30). This childless widower could not depend on the State to take care of him. He was left unattended at the Calcutta Medical College Hospital, and voluntary organizations refused him help. The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, was introduced with much fanfare. Is this how the law expects to protect the elderly?          
	Yours faithfully,         Surajit Das, Calcutta
                  
	Turf war          
	Sir  Thanks to Anasuya Basu, the real reasons behind the student unrest at the Bengal Engineering and Science University have been made public (They didnt start the fire, March 27). In most residential institutions, a clash between students and outsiders is not unusual. The latter are often provoked by their own sense of insecurity and jealousy of students of reputed institutions. This sense of exclusion gives them reason to harass students.           
	The refusal on the part of some students to bow to political dictates is also a reason for friction. As a student of BE college, I am reminded of the so-called apolitical college union that was formed in the mid-Seventies at the height of the Congress regime. This body went on to win the union elections in 1977, beating the Students Federation of India after the Congresss defeat in the general elections. Similar unions continue to exist in other top-notch institutions even today.           
	Students of such reputed institutions may be active members of such bodies, but they do not need any political clout to secure a job when they finish college. While, in lesser-known colleges, the academically disinclined student politicians depend on the netas for their living. The intruders at Besu are such ruffians with political backing. The inept university administration is making their job only too easy.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Tamal Basu, Bandel, Hooghly   
	Sir  It is heartening to see The Telegraphs efforts to highlight the role of political violence in two prominent institutions of higher education in West Bengal  Presidency College and Besu. In Bengal, violence and student politics go back to the turbulent Sixties and Seventies. Back then, scores of educated, middle-class youths joined the movement. Then too, both the colleges saw militant student unionism. But those were the days of idealism, while the recent incidents were precipitated by a corrupt administrative system.           
	Yours faithfully,         D. Chattopadhyay, Calcutta            
	Sir  It is unfortunate that the students who raised their voices against the Besu administration have been labelled criminals. Mostly extraordinary students are admitted to Besu. The academic faculty and students are together responsible for its excellence. Besu has recently acquired the Institute of National Importance status. But how can it reap the fruits of these privileges when it is bent on playing havoc with its students lives? Many students come from needy families; for them education is a struggle. The weak administration and certain interest groups cannot be allowed to destroy their future.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Vineeta Trivedi, Howrah

	Kleptocracy
         
	Sir  India must be relieved of the heavy and ever-increasing burden of pensions, perks and privileges for people who retire from important government posts (Pay hike for Pratibha, double gain for Kalam, Jan 11). Since there is no government bungalow allotted to a former chief justice or Union cabinet secretary, it is unfair to provide such a facility to retired presidents, vice-presidents, prime ministers and ex-legislators or their spouses. The pension scheme for parliamentarians and legislators is also a waste of resources. If those who come into politics do not find it lucrative enough to serve without the promise of any pension and other post-retirement benefits, they should opt for some other profession. In any case, they should not become a burden on the taxpayer. After all, most of our elected representatives are rich enough to invest heavily in the gamble called elections. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  There are hundreds of Indians committing suicide because they do not have any food to eat. Is it justified for the government of such a country to raise the salaries of its president, vice-president and governors? These are public servants and should, therefore, commit themselves to honest public welfare. They should exhort elected governments to eradicate poverty through proper education and corruption-free governance. Sadly, we belong to a nation where the man living in the street is denied the necessities of survival  food, shelter, clothes and medicines  while politicians and the rich abound with things they do not need. Perhaps our governments policy is to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. India needs a peoples mutiny to retrieve the ill-gotten money of the rich. It is time the media brought out a list of the wealth of every Indian politician so that people would know who has how much. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Blood sports
     
	Sir  One could say after Shakespeare, Hypocrisy thy name is animal-lover (Bull sport taken by horn, Jan 12). The activists calling themselves animal-lovers have freed bears from the madaris, snakes from snake-charmers and circus animals from show-owners. Animal-lovers have also managed to secure universal condemnation of Hindu animal sacrifices and even a ban on them in some areas. Their argument has always been that these practices are cruel. Of late, they have been at it again and have tried to get Tamil Nadus centuries-old Jallikattu banned through a court order. Animal-lovers are apparently concerned not just with the killing of animals but also with the teasing and the pain they are subjected to. Might one ask why these animal-lovers never protest against the halal killing of animals where the poor creatures die a slow and agonizing death? It is interesting to note that the chief justice, K.G. Balakrishnan, had observed on Jallikattu that it was cruelty against human beings too. That is understandable, since many men get injured during the sport. But then, mountaineering and trekking should be banned too as people may get killed or maimed in the course of these activities. 
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

        
	Sir  The Supreme Courts decision to allow Jallikattu during the festival of Pongal was a misguided and misinformed move. That the decision was shortsighted has been proved by the high incidence of injury this year  above 80 participants have been injured. Sports such as Jallikattu cause injury not only to animals but also to human beings. Just because no animal was injured or killed does not mean that the beasts had a very pleasant time. On the other hand, apologists for Jallikattu owe concerned citizens, and not merely animal-lovers, an explanation as to why Tamil Nadu must persist with an 800-year-old tradition that does a lot of harm and no visible good.
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Tax review
     
	Sir  Bhaskar Dutta has been very insightful in his article Growing alright (Jan 16). There has indeed been a substantial increase in the Central governments tax revenues. However, of a population of 1.1 billion, only about 13 million are required to pay personal income tax, and, in reality, far less actually do so. However, Indian health and educational services are not comparable with those of developed countries. Yet Indian taxes are reaching respectable levels in comparison to some of the developed countries finally. Therefore, the entire tax regime is a highly skewed mechanism for the redistribution of income, from a miniscule group capable of earning that income to the rest of the population. It also underpins wasteful government expenditure. 
     
	I do not think that most of the population exempt from taxation have income-levels below the minimum taxable income floor. After 60 years of Independence, it is time the upper brackets of agricultural income-earners were taxed. If this is politically difficult, then at least the substantial subsidies to agriculture should be removed. It is imperative that the tax structure, rather than the tax rates, be revised. India has woken up rather late to the need for development of infrastructure. This task is being undertaken mostly with the help of the private sector and the inflow of foreign direct investment. This should provide scope to the government to reduce its own size and expenditure.
          
	Yours faithfully,

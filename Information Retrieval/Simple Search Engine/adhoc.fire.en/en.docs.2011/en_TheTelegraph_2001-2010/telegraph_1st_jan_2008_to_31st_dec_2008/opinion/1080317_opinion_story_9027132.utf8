The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | touch of reality
                                                                                                                 TOUCH OF REALITY                                                    
	It is a question with no easy answer. How are children to be taught what the evil touch is without turning them into bundles of suspicion and fear? The Maharashtra government has taken a direct but well-thought out step. It is distributing a film and a booklet to government and government-aided schools throughout the state and has had the inspector of schools talk to a large number of girls studying in Classes V and VI. These classes comprise the core target group of the programme, for the students are around 12 and 13 years. But a younger group, from nine to 11 years, is also being addressed, because girls of this age are often sexually abused without their being clear about what is happening. Since the molesters are very often adult males in the family or close to it, the children have to be taught to assess whether a touch, from an uncle and even, inescapably, from the father, is caring or sexual. It is a painful and hard lesson, and the government of Maharashtra has decided that the priority is the safety and protection of the child, not her loss of innocence through cautionary knowledge.         
	For many schools in West Bengal, however, this priority is still not perceived as overwhelming enough. Many girls schools are prepared to counsel students individually, or even have a system by which they can put in their questions in a box so that the issue can be discussed in class while the troubled child remains anonymous. The Delhi government makes online discussions available, because talking about life skills of this kind in class leads to controversy. These tactics are evasive, placing greater value on the innocence of children than on their ability to defend themselves. Teaching them about the evils out there too early would damage their inner world of imagination and joy, is the argument. The evasive strategy is not without its merits, because there is something hideously unpleasant in introducing little girls to the workings of an exploitative adult mind. But given the harsh reality of sexual abuse of children in India, is there really a choice?

	MILK TRUTH
   An employee of a co-operative involved in the distribution and marketing of milk claimed minimum wages specified under the Minimum Wages Act. The co-operative contended that the Act was not applicable to it because it was not engaged in ldquo;dairy farming rdquo;. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, it held that the co-operative did not come under the purview of the Act as marketing and distribution of milk does not amount to dairy farming (Swamy Prasad vs State of Madhya Pradesh).
 
	TECHNICAL FAULT

  A municipal corporation advertised for an assistant manager with 10 years rsquo; experience. When it shortlisted an X-ray technician for the post, some of the other applicants challenged the decision in court. They contended that the nature of his work was not administrative but technical and the high court ruled in their favour. The Supreme Court, however, held that when the medical officer endorsed the fact that the man was also in charge of administrative work like maintaining the X-ray register, collecting money and issuing receipts, his experience could not be termed as only technical, more so when it was known that there was no clerk in his department to carry out the routine administrative work. As an employer, the corporation is the best judge; if it is satisfied, the high court was not justified in ruling that the man had no administrative experience, the Supreme Court held (Trivedi Himangshu Ghyanshambhai vs Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation).

  A NEW LESSON

  An organisation built two rooms and a toilet for use as a primary school in an area earmarked as a green belt under the Town and Country Planning Act. It then filed a writ petition for allotting the plot to it, contending that the right to education was a fundamental one. The Supreme Court held that just because primary education was a fundamental right, it did not mean the respondents could seek regularisation of an illegal structure (and change in land use pattern) because it had arranged to teach some children (City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra vs Ekta Mahila Mandal and others).

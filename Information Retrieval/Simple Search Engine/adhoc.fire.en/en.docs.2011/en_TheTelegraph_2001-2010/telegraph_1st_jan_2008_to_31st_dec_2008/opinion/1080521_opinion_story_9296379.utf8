                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       LEAD AND DEAL                                                    
	When time is running out, it may become difficult to buy it. Yet the United Progressive Alliance government has been trying to buy time so far the Indo-US nuclear deal is concerned. The international timetable for negotiations is coming to an end, with the Bush administration in its final phase in Washington. On the domestic front, Mr Manmohan Singhs government has failed to break the stalemate with the Left parties. Dialogue between the government, led by Pranab Mukherjee, and the Left parties seems to have become a never-ending process. This is a pity, since the government is only displaying its weakness and rapidly losing face in international fora. If India is forced to renege on the Indo-US deal, because of pressure from the Left, especially from the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Indias credibility as a nation that honours treaties and agreements will take a severe beating. What is worse, the honour of the prime minister, Mr Singh  a man respected for his integrity  will be tarnished.        
	This chapter is one of the most unfortunate in the history of independent India, both in terms of domestic politics and so far as foreign policy is concerned. It is abundantly clear that the government of India is going slow on the nuclear deal because it fears that the Left might withdraw its support to the government if the deal is signed. The government is compromising itself on a major foreign policy initiative because of the pressures of domestic politics. The Left believes that by agreeing to the deal, the government of India has only succumbed to US pressure; and that the deal will so increase Indias dependence on the US that India will be reduced to being Uncle Sams satellite. The fears of the Left are more a reflection of its congenital anti-Americanism than of the ground realities. In fact, the Indo-US nuclear deal will put the seal on Indias emergence as a major player in international politics. The deal is the USs recognition of this status. The deal will also allow Indias almost-stagnant civil nuclear programme to grow, as the deal will enable the US to pressurize the Nuclear Suppliers Group to modify its guidelines so that India can have access to crucial raw material.        
	There is too much at stake to allow the deal to become a victim of a petty and antiquated anti-Americanism. Mr Singh knows this, but there is a strange reluctance on his part to push through what he believes in. If his government falls because of the deal that he is convinced is good for India, he will have the distinction of going down with his head held high and his honour intact. The alternative is to tamely submit to what are no more than blackmailing tactics by the Left. History and honour are both nudging Mr Singh towards the deal, he should not allow the Left to pull him back by his coat tails.

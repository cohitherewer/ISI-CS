	 LK Advanis rath has been derailed in Delhi and Rajasthan. The Bharatiya Janata Party leader had apparently planned a Vijay Yatra, confident that his party would bag four of the five states that went to polls. But the debacle in the capital and in Rajasthan put paid to his plans. He not only had to cancel his yatra, but also fend off his detractors who sought to blame him for the electoral reverses. A major war of words broke out between Advani and a senior party leader during a meeting that was called at the formers residence. Murli Manohar Joshi is supposed to have accused Advani of not being able to ensure a crowd of even 500 people at his rallies. The buzz after the storm is that a major reshuffle in the pecking order is now on the cards, and those who had fared badly, while being in charge of poll management, might face the axe. Advani must be hoping that these steps will help him and his rath to be up on their feet again.          
	 Reshuffle isnt the buzzword only in BJP circles. The home ministry, it appears, has also ordered one to set its own house in order. The new man in charge, P Chidambaram, wants a fresh team, both at the bureaucratic and ministerial levels, with which he could work comfortably. The cause for PCs present discomfiture is the communication gap between him and his two junior ministers. Chidambaram does not follow Hindi well, while Prakash Jaiswal and Shakeel Ahmad, the two ministers of state, have difficulties with their bosss impeccable English. As if working to keep the country safe is not enough, the home ministry will now have to devote its time to discover a new lingua franca as well.                            
	 Once an economist, always an economist. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is loving the finance ministers job, and, reportedly, is in no hurry to find a replacement. He has sent a missive to the Speaker to inform him that in the current session, the Union home minister, who was the FM till the other day, will respond to queries and debates on the finance ministry. But a section of the Congress wants Singh to handle a fewer number of portfolios. Now, is that because the partymen are concerned with the burden that has been placed on the PM? Or is it that some half-a-dozen junior ministers are now itching to get into the shoes of their seniors?                            
	 Margaret Alva, who is out in the cold after doing some plainspeak, still shares rather warm ties with Madam. One hears that she was consulted by the party high command on the decision to appoint Vilasrao Deshmukhs successor in Maharashtra. Alva had met the Congress president and suggested the name of Ashok Chavan, it is being said. Thats not all. Alva, who was once the gen-sec in charge of Mizoram, continued to monitor the elections in the state and was in touch with Motilal Vora and Ahmad Patel. She is also being credited with useful suggestions that led to the distribution of tickets to deserving candidates and helped the Congress win the state. Party insiders seem to think that all this indicates that the prodigal daughters return may be near.                            
	 BJP supporters in Delhi are heard grumbling that had Arun Jaitley, and not VK Malhotra been in the fray against the mercurial Sheila Dikshit, the polls would have gone in favour of their party. But then an electoral battle between the two did take place,but it was fought in the shadows. Worse, Dikshit did emerge as the winner in this one as well. OP Sharma, Jaitleys PA, had fought and lost against Dikshits parliamentary secretary, Naseeb Singh, from Delhis Vishwas Nagar. Jaitley had campaigned for his man extensively while the Delhi CM is learned to have paid a visit just once. Time for a better excuse for Delhis BJPwallahs?                            
	 Behenji is on the hunt, this time down South. Encouraged by the BSPs performance in the recent polls in which her party managed to make its mark beyond its traditional domain, Mayavati is hoping to set foot on the other side of the Vindhayas too, by riding on the mantra of social engineering that paid rich dividends in the North. She is expected to visit Chennai soon, where a gala reception has been scheduled in her honour. The BSP supremo, the grapevine has it, is also set to poach AIADMKs SV Shekhar. The actor-turned-politician, who fell out of favour with amma after visiting Karunanidhi twice, wishes to get lucky the third time with the BSP. As for Mayavati, she knows that the road to Delhi cannot bypass the southern kingdoms.  
	FOOTNOTE      
	 Didi has always been considered the enfant terrible of Indian politics. She has often acted unpredictably, changing friends and foes at the drop of a hat. But the other day, it was the moody ladys turn to be shocked, that too by her newfound brother, Amar Singh. The Samajwadi Party gen-sec, who is looking for an alliance partner in Bengal, has been seen keeping Banerjees company of late. However, the otherday, after keeping his appointment with the Trinamul Congress chief, Singh decided to go and meet Jyoti Basu, her arch-enemy and the grand old man of Left politics.      
	Singhs action obviously set tongues wagging in the political circles. There was speculation that he might just dump the TMC and opt to mend fences with the leftists in order to revive the ailing third front, yet again. One doesnt know how Banerjee will feel if Singh pays her back in her own coin. But she will need to think before trusting brothers like Singh again.

	Fire sermon                  
	Sir  The fire inside Readymade Centre in Sodepur that killed 13 people came as a shock (Shut in shop on fire, May 17). The fire is said to have been caused by sparks from a welding machine falling on a tarpaulin sheet and setting it ablaze. How was welding work allowed to take place inside the store during peak shopping hours? Tarpaulin was kept in the way of the falling sparks in spite of the fact that it is inflammable. The fire extinguishers in the shop did not function and the huge department store had a single exit door. It is not enough to blame the shop owners alone for these instances of negligence. The civic authorities, which are supposed to ensure that safety norms are followed properly, are equally responsible. The tragedy would not have occurred had they cared to do their duty.           
	In all the recent cases of fire outbreak  at the Nandaram market in Burrabazar and the Mullickghat flower market for instance  the fire brigade has been found wanting in the way it handled the situation. In this case too, only seven fire tenders were pressed into service to douse the flames. Had local people not rushed in to help, the fire might have caused even more damage.           
	In a developing Calcutta, huge malls are sprouting at every corner. The dangers posed by these are proved by the accident in Sodepur. It is typical of our city, where it is ridiculously easy to hoodwink the authorities, that the fire extinguishers in Readymade Centre were mere showpieces. Civic bodies would never be responsible enough and, taking advantage of their indifference, owners of shops and malls seldom pay attention to safety norms. Accidents such as these may increase in frequency as Calcutta gets swankier.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Sir  The fire at Readymade Centre has brought two important facts to the fore. One is that the common people have no idea about fire-safety measures. Second, the safety devices in Calcuttas supermarkets and shops are as inadequate as the fire brigade is inefficient.           
	When the fire broke out inside the garment store, the shop owners promptly pulled the shutters down. As a result, most of the people died of asphyxiation. This clearly shows that we are completely ignorant about the basic steps that should be taken during an emergency. The owners barred the door because they feared that the shop would be looted in the mayhem. Perhaps the lives of the people were less important to them than financial losses. An investigation should be started against the person who ordered the main exit to be closed. The government should also start awareness campaigns to teach people the ways to protect themselves against devastating fires.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Priyanka Dutta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  After Fridays fire at Readymade Centre, the officials of the fire brigade lodged a complaint against the shop owners because the premises lacked even the basic fire-fighting gadgets. The fire services minister, Pratim Chatterjee, declared that besides a departmental inquiry, forensic tests would also be conducted to ascertain the cause of the fire. The finance minister, Asim Dasgupta, rushed to the shop that falls in his constituency. It is good to see ministers trying to help the victims but sometimes their involvement comes as a gratuitous afterthought. Their assurances and consolations will not bring the dead back to life. Had the leaders really thought of the peoples welfare, they would have been more circumspect about allowing the supermarkets to come up in the first place. Many of the malls and apartments that we see in Calcutta are illegal constructions. Moreover, in most cases, they do not abide by the safety norms. But these buildings are allowed to stand because the rich owners are close to the people in power. It is not only the city proper that is being devastated by land sharks who have no qualms about putting the lives of thousands at risk to fatten their wallets. The suburbs are also getting affected by this malaise, as the incident at Sodepur shows. Instead of bolting the stable after the horse has fled, the ministers should grant permission for the construction of new buildings only if the realtors follow stringent rules.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The way the shop owners at Readymade Centre pulled down the shutters reminded me of the time when a huge fire broke out at the Calcutta book fair in 1997. I was at the fair with my family that day. When the fire started spreading and the people panicked, the personnel in the fairground quickly closed the collapsible gates. As a result, we had to run from gate to gate, with the fire raging behind us. There was a stampede and we escaped with our lives. We dont seem to have learnt a lesson from the incident. The tragedy at Sodepur could easily have been avoided if the men in charge of the store had a little common sense.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Act together          
	Sir  In order to buy a Tatkal Sewa railway reservation ticket, I stood in queue at one of the counters in Ballygunge station at five in the morning. I was sixth in the line. In apprehension that I might not get the ticket, I had asked my son to log on to the Indian railways portal and buy a ticket online at 8 a.m sharp. I was eventually placed second at counter number one and got a ticket on the waitlist at 8:01 a.m. Clearly the counter had opened unofficially before 8:00 a.m, otherwise, being second in the queue, I could not have got the ticket at 8:01 a.m. All the time I was in line, I was constantly in touch with my son over the phone. I was further surprised to find that my son could not go beyond the Plan my travel page on the portal. When clicking on Find train, he was told that he could log in only after 8:00 a.m. This continued till 8:06 a.m, when I was walking back home, having bought my ticket. I wonder why the computerized reservation system and the railways portal do not start functioning simultaneously from 8:00 a.m. If the counter opens a few hours before the public gets access to it, only booking agents or brokers, who buy tickets on behalf of others at a premium, can benefit from the practice. One has to conclude then that there is a nexus between the railways personnel and these agents. Together, they work for the benefit of each other.           
	Yours faithfully,

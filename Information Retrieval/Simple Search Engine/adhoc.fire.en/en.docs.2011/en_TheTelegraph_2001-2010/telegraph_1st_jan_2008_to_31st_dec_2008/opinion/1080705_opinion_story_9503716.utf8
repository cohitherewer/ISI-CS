	The strict grammar of classical Indian dance has its special significance. The discipline required to master this form should not only be reflected in the movements, but also felt throughout a presentation. The 13th Annual programme of Darpani at Rabindra Sadan, on June 27, failed to realize this aspect of classical dance. The bazaar ambience of the auditorium ruined the serious tone. Conceived and choreographed by Arnab Bandopadhyay, an earnest dancer, the programme was an array of various classical styles alongside creative numbers. Divided into three parts, the show began with nivedanam, a bouquet of traditional invocatory numbers, along with pallavi, todayam and shabdam. The younger students gave an average performance of these items from Bharatnatyam and Odissi.         
	The second half, Tomar Banshi Bajao Asi, featured 13 dance numbers accompanying Tagore songs. It was a relief that the composition of Ami chanchalo he was not literal and the group choreography was well-synchronized. Sakhi oi bujhi banshi baje, a solo by Soumili Biswas, was gracefully expressive. However, the inclusion of co-dancers in the group seemed redundant. Dressed in well-designed costume, the dancer enacted the lyrical mood of Amar ekti katha. Utilizing the full stage, the male dancers tried to capture the emotion of Madhya diner jabe gaan. This was followed by Utsav  the festivals of India. Music arrangement was by Swapan Banerjee and light designing by Rakesh Barik.

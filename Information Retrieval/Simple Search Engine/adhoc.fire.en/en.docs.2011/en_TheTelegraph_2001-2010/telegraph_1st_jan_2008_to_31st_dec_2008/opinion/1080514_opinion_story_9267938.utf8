    A company printed pictures of vegetables such as cabbage and carrot on the label of the soya bean oil it manufactured. A case was initiated under Rule 37D of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules, which prohibits the use of labels that exaggerate the quality of the product, including terms like ldquo;extra-refined rdquo; and ldquo;soothing to the heart rdquo;. The Andhra Pradesh High Court quashed the exaggeration proceedings and made out a case of misbranding instead. Setting aside the finding, the Supreme Court held that the high court had ignored the fact that the oil could be used to cook the vegetables on the label. The vegetables otherwise had nothing to do with soya oil so it couldn rsquo;t be said that the label exaggerated the quality of the product (Parakh Foods Ltd vs State of Andhra Pradesh).     Rules overruled
    An electrician who sustained injuries while on duty was denied the alternative employment he was entitled to under Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. The employer contended that alternative employment was not feasible because their service rules did not provide for a transfer from the technical to the administrative side. The Madras High Court held that once an Act comes into force, it will prevail over all service rules. It directed the employers to provide the man alternative employment as well as salary for the time he was kept on leave and not given an alternative job (P. Ravichandran vs TN Civil Services Corporation Ltd).    Value judgment
    A deputy collector in the revenue department was charge sheeted as he had determined the market value of a property at Rs 22 per square feet although the value of the adjacent land was Rs 58 per square feet. Setting aside the proceedings, the Madras High Court held that if the department was dissatisfied with the valuation, it could have filed an appeal before the inspector general of registration. The court reiterated that it is a settled position that charges cannot be framed against a quasi judicial authority where there is no proven ill-motive or bad intention on his part (S. Muthuramu vs State of Tamil Nadu).

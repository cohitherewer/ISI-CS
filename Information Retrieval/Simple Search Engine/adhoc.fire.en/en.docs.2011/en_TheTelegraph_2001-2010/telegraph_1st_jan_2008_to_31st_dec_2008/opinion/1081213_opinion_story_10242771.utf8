                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       AN ENCHANTING WEB                              Mohua Mitra      Music                                                
	Mayar Khela is an opera by Rabindranath Tagore that has been staged repeatedly, more for its music than for its dramatic content. In fact, the romantic theme of the play is somewhat frivolous, revolving around love in a world of illusions. The workings of Maya create dream-like situations that trap Man and Woman. The musical was composed by Tagore at the age of 27, published in 1888, and first performed at Bethune College. Though hybrid in form, it is a delightful and unique blend of songs composed in classical tunes and a dance narrative. The poet himself called it a garland of songs, connected by a thread of drama.         
	As part of its diamond jubilee celebrations, Dakshinee staged Mayar Khela at Kala Mandir on November 21. In this production, the visual element was elegantly orchestrated with melodious singing, confident instrumental accompaniment and suave dance steps. The use of geometric patterns in the stage dcor was aesthetically pleasing, and the lighting was quite brilliant. The distinctive musical and visual elements of songs like Patha hara tumi pathik and Aamar paran jaha chaye found a wonderful vehicle of exposition in Kamalini Mukherjee, playing Shanta. The dilemmas of the human mind, the complex shades of the man-woman relationship, and emotions playing havoc with the characters pitted against the backdrop of an illusory world were portrayed in a nuanced and convincing way by the actor-singers.        
	The two women protagonists  Shanta and Pramoda (Sangeeta Gangopadhyay)  are lone, storm-swept figures, fighting their yearnings for the same men, and looking for an anchor while trying to etch out their own space. Mayar Khela is marked by the absence of an all-seeing, superior being. As a result, the characters need to find their own ways of coming to terms with the sea of conflicts and confusions.        
	The three male protagonists, Ashok, Kumar and Amar (played by Saikat Shekhareswar Roy, Arunabha Chakrabarty and Shamik Pal respectively), do justice to their characters, which are caught in a turbulent maze of emotions. Songs like Eshechhi go eshechhi, Dekhate parine keno pran and Aami jene shune bish korechhi paan were poignantly rendered. Some of the choral numbers like Biday korechho jaare and Kaachhe ache dekhite na pao took off well but were marred at times by bad acoustics and failing lapel microphones. Sangeeta Gangopadhyays Aami hridayer katha and Kamalini Mukherjees Sakha bhul kore bhalobesho na left a lasting impression. The latter showed promise as a budding director as well.

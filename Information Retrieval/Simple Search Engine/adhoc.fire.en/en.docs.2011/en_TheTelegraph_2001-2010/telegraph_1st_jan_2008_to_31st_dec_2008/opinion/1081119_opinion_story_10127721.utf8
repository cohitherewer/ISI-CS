The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Free Fall From A Great Height
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             FREE FALL FROM A GREAT HEIGHT                                  Fifth Column -Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	There had been an unexpected boom in the Indian civil aviation sector in recent years. With more than 20 per cent growth in passenger traffic, liberal banking credit, and fast government clearance of the requisitions for new aircraft by private airlines, one thought that the civil aviation industry was on an overdrive.        
	However, it did not take long for the bubble to burst. India forgot the previous mishap resulting from over-spending in this sector that had led to the premature demise of domestic carriers like Modiluft, East-West, City Airlink and Damania in the 1990s. India also seemed to be oblivious of the latest victims of financial mismanagement  Sahara and Air Deccan  airlines that lost their identity completely as Jet and Kingfisher consumed them. However, the ongoing slump was also inevitable as the result of reckless route expansions and mindless purchase of new aircraft.The private operators, in their greed to take over the market of the state carriers, had ignored the ground realities.         
	Things began moving, but without a plan to guide them. Aircraft were imported by the dozen even as the number of airports remained static. Air traffic shot up but the number of air traffic controllers declined and pilot shortage continued. The last straw was pulled from the already rickety edifice with the surge in fuel prices. It led to a free fall of the private airlines from the great height they had found themselves in.        
	Passenger load decreased, but fuel burning increased, both on ground and in the air, owing to unprecedented congestion. Long wait in the lounge and taxiway and a longer delay in the vicinity of the landing station made air travel a nightmare. I had to wait for 30 minutes before landing and suffer a 20 minutes delay at the take-off point on an average during the last 18 months at Delhi airport. If an aircraft burns its fuel for 50 minutes in doing nothing and then spends 100 minutes in flying from Delhi to say, Mumbai, its balance sheet will obviously go haywire.                
	Flight to safety        
	The Indian aviation industry is shining undoubtedly. The facts published by Janes All the Worlds Aircraft for 2008-2009 regarding the orders placed by five Indian airlines for some four hundred new aircraft indicate this. But aircraft require money to be purchased. Who is funding them? Obviously, the banks. But banks charge interest, which would escalate the debt and hence, the liquidity ratio. Passenger load has to be high if the borrowed amount and the interest are to be paid back. Unfortunately, rising airfare and surging fuel costs are acting as deterrents to passengers.        
	To make matters worse for the Indian carriers came the news that Emirates Airlines will add 31 weekly flights to India. This will result in 35 flights per week to Mumbai, and 20 to Bangalore. British Airways too is trying to capture the Indian market by striking a franchise deal with GoAir that would allow the London carrier to extend its network within India without having to make an investment. British Airways is naturally keen to consolidate its market position in India, which is its second biggest market after the United States of America in terms of passenger volume.        
	It is thus clear that something somewhere has evidently gone wrong. If both Emirates Airlines and British Airways start having an open field in the domestic aviation sector, there is little chance that the Indian airlines will survive. It is not surprising then that the private airlines have lined up for doles from the State exchequer, which appears more than keen to bail out all and sundry, even to the detriment of the public aviation companies.

	India has yet to develop a culture of consulting the people on matters of public interest. The best example recently of this disconnect between the government, represented by the bureaucracy, and its political masters is the series of bad decisions and judgments on the new Bangalore international airport.        
	The award of the contract to build, operate, own and transfer the new airport to the consortium of Swiss and German interests (Zurich Airport and Siemens) was taken in relative secrecy with no public consultation or even transparency regarding the bidders and the considerations on which the award was made to this consortium. Siemens is a company that has been mired for many years in scandals and bad decisions. It could be expected to try and squeeze the maximum profit from the airport venture. This appears to have happened, with customer interest sacrificed at the altar of maximum profit for the investors.        
	Initially, it looked as though the appointments of the management icon, N.R. Narayanamurthy, as the chairman, and a go-getting bureaucrat, K. Jairaj, as the managing director, would ensure the proper balancing of public interest with the interests of the investors. In retrospect, without knowing who took which decisions at what stage, it seems that a series of bad decisions was made. Forecasting passenger traffic, the architecture and features of the terminal building, the avoidance of extra cost for passengers, adequate facilities, what to do with the existing HAL airport, and other such issues related to the airport have created dissatisfaction. On top of these, the new airport lacks fast connectivity to the city.              
	In India, we have become accustomed, after many years under a command and control economy where the government took all decisions in secret, to let it decide what the needs of the future will be. Planners and bureaucrats in India think small. They are quite unambitious and, in recent years, have not adjusted to the needs of a fast-growing economy. After four decades of three per cent annual gross domestic product growth and a few years of five per cent, we have arrived at an annual growth rate of seven to nine per cent. We could do even better if our governments acted in a coordinated fashion. They do not, and the same bureaucrat will oppose in one ministry the proposals that he had pushed when he was in another ministry. This turf protection is without any consideration for overall public interest.        
	Execution matches this lack of ambition, and lags behind even modest demands. This is true in every area of infrastructure  power, roads, railways, airports. For example, General B.C. Khanduri did a superb job of building the expressways under the prime ministers Golden Quadrilateral programme. When he moved on and another minister took charge, the whole programme got mired in difficulties and delays and is yet incomplete. Power-generation targets have never been achieved in any of the past five-year plans. The railways had little expansion and were for a long time very short of money because of poor leadership and worse management. Airports were shoddily planned, with inadequate space and poorly planned runways. Political considerations prevented timely land acquisition and clearing of squatters, holding up the building of roads, airports and the like.        
	To poor execution was added the incapacity to forecast needs in relation to the new rates of economic growth. If Chinas economic growth was driven by exports (largely through adding value by the assembly of imported parts), it was also driven by massive investments in infrastructure. In India, a good part of the growth rates of the last few years has been a result of investments in roads. We have yet to learn the lesson that prior investment in infrastructure stimulates growth. Instead, we wait till roads are clogged with traffic, airports are like fish markets, or power is short, before we go for some modest expansion and new projects. The result is congestion, pollution, higher costs because of delay in movements, and a lack of public confidence in governments that they will look after the public interest.        
	The Bangalore International Airport Limited story illustrates all this. Passenger traffic forecasts were related to past traffic growth and past economic growth. When these numbers began to rise, there was no quick response, until the minister intervened at the last minute to arrange for additional but quite inadequate capacity. The location was decided entirely to suit the interests of the ruling political family of Karnataka. The people were never consulted about the location of the new airport. Neither were they involved in the decisions to close the old airport to commercial traffic, the extra user charges that the investors asked for (known only when the airport was ready), or the features of the airport, such as escalators, walkways, baggage-handling amenities, and so on. The investors had no interest in building for Bangalore an airport in keeping with its high-tech image. They were not out to match Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok or Singapore. They wanted to build the lowest-cost airport, with minimal features that would satisfy the terms of their contract. Neither the bureaucrats nor their political masters made any contribution towards looking after the public interest.        
	Since the airport opened, there have been many passengers who have written bitterly about its inadequacies. To quote a typical one: It is good in parts  but certainly not the breeze that the airport management is touting. It took them fifteen minutes to find someone to operate the aerobridge to our aircraft. It took him another ten minutes and several tries to fit it to the aircrafts door. Viewed from the aircraft, the building was unexciting. In this day of wonderful new airports springing up in the region, this was disappointing. The architect was apparently not pushed to give something to be proud of. Perhaps not enough of the available money was made available for the task.               
	The disappointments continued on exiting the aircraft. We actually had to walk down a few flights of stairs  no escalators or elevators in sight. Then we walked the best part of a kilometre down winding corridors, at least one stretch of which was no more than 3 metres wide, to the baggage collection area  no moving sidewalks. There were no electric cars to ferry physically challenged people around. There were many baggage belts spread out in a long hall. But they are as small as they always have been at our domestic airports. Delivery of the baggage was wholly manual, with the usual baggage trains bringing the containers to a hole in the wall, and two handlers unloading them on to the roundels  no automated system. The toilets were filthy. No water. The women specially complained that there were only three stalls inside theirs  with long queues of women waiting. The main arrival/departure hall was a disappointment, with no architectural or decorative wonders. It was shiny and well-polished but humdrum and functional. Some elements of this airport are almost already obsolete. Outside the airport there was complete chaos. Private cars were not allowed near the building. We had to walk almost a kilometre to board the bus that was waiting to ferry us home. This airport is nearer the Age of Dinosaurs. It will not stand scrutiny for even 20 years.        
	Future infrastructure projects should have a detailed process of public consultation and scrutiny. They should not be left to the good sense of bureaucrats and politicians. Traffic forecasts should be made by expert forecasters, not by government departments. Architecture and facilities must be open to public scrutiny. This need not delay things if the consultation process is widely publicized and if there is a cut-off for decisions. There must be a representative overseeing body to ensure that the management looks after the public interest.

                 IN MEDIAS RES
   In the audio-visual medium, we need to take care about what we see and remember as true, writes Bhaswati Chakravorty
             Remote control
                    
	A television remote in the hand is a peculiarly empowering feeling. Sitting or lying down in our own private, peaceful, comfy place, we choose what to see. In this day of set-top boxes and satellite dishes, the choice is very specific, individual, and we pay for what we watch. But Im not sure that we all like our favourite film or talk-show interrupted with seven repetitions of, say, the indestructibility of Bhuban cement or the dazzling variety of saris in Belarani Stores in Rampur. We may adjust our routine to this  quickly return that missed call maybe, or give our tired eyes that break the doctor ordered, channel-surf across more of the same, or even develop a zombified addiction to the spectacle of little boys and has-been filmstars brushing their teeth together with the only right toothpaste. But, empowered though we may be, we cannot escape traders selling their ware right inside our private spaces without our invitation. There is an insidious strain of coercion eating into our empowerment, we cannot avoid remembering certain brands, certain products, they are imprinted on our brains.
    
	The double edge of empowerment by the media, in this instance the audio-visual media  what we choose to see and what we involuntarily remember  is an experience that goes much further than our forced consumption of repetitive advertisements. In these days, when the TV is peoples first-hand witness to shocking, devastating or tragic events, the impression of truth it creates in viewers minds is a significant spur to action and protest. How many of the thousands of people who walked in silence from College Square to Esplanade on November 14, 2007, and how many of those watching the procession go by, would have walked or stood in silence had they not seen images of violence, menace and devastation in Nandigram, and bloodied bodies in hospitals, made out through pictures and sounds the positions of the two warring parties or gained a sense of the actions of uniformed forces, heard women weep and men tell their stories, seen ravaged greens and the still, wary eyes of children? Images, commentaries and reports from the spot have a tremendous impact and value, and the reporters, photographers and cameramen, who overcome obstacles and dangers made visible to the viewer and speak with a composure that again, sometimes, visibly overcomes perturbation, gain proportionately in stature.
    
	The media have gained an enormously important position as an instrument of exposure, a word that is allied in our minds with the word truth. Simultaneously, the media become the consumers window to a fairness: sitting at home, we are given the chance to see all sides of an event and come to our own judgment. The presence of the TV camera is like an assurance: we are witness to what really happened. But this undoubtedly positive role, without which we would be much the poorer in understanding, lowers our guard at other times. For example, exposure and investigation can go beyond the big events and focus on specific, personal crimes too. Competing TV channels have to do that to hold their viewers. And sometimes, this opens up dangerous territory, where what we choose to see and what we involuntarily remember may lead us away from fairness and objectivity into areas where our impression of the truth may no longer be dependent on austere fact.
    
	Reconstructions of crimes provide a good illustration of the problem. Unlike American and British channels that we get to see, regional channels here do not always focus purely on forensics in the reconstruction of a crime that is being investigated by the police or has gone to court, nor do they project alternative possibilities of the crime scene. They cannot resist making the easiest narrative out of the facts that have been made public. Everyone likes a good story. So the drama at the crime scene imputes motive and points to a killer, perhaps, without anything having been proven. I have even seen images of actual people being arrested on suspicion being superimposed on the image of the TV actor playing the part of the supposed killer. The viewer is involuntarily made to incline towards the predetermined reconstruction of a TV channel, without the police having made their case, or the court having pronounced on it, eliminating in an instant all other possibilities.
    
	It is inevitable that such a powerful news-cum-entertainment medium should penetrate into all spheres of our daily existence, should hold all institutions up to scrutiny. Its positive role should not be undervalued. But the medium itself should also be scrutinized. For the power of the audio-visual image on the mind should not be undervalued either. For example, every time we watch a programme that reconstructs a crime still unproven or allows accusations of one side to flow unhindered, we need to take care about what we see and what we remember as the truth.

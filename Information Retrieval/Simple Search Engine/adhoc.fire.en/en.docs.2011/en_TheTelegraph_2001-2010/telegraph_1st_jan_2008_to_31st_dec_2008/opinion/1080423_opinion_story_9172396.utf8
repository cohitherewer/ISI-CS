	The embarrassment in the Tripura government cannot leave the West Bengal government unaffected. That Shahid Chowdhury, the food and civil supplies minister in Manik Sarkars mint-fresh cabinet, should have to resign because of alleged links with Mamun Mia, a suspected Harkat-ul Jihadi Islami militant and Bangladeshi national, is a double awkwardness. The West Bengal criminal investigation department picked up the suspect in Agartala, following leads provided by two other terrorists arrested earlier in Howrah. Allegedly, Mr Chowdhury had helped Mafizur Rahaman, or Mamun Mia, get a passport and a permanent residence certificate that allowed him to live in Agartala as Suman Mazumder. The arrests suggest an arc of militant activity that embraces West Bengal and Tripura at least, and throws into stark relief the easy route for militants that has been created across the border with Bangladesh because of the interest in settling migrants that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in both Tripura and West Bengal very obviously has.        
	Mr Chowdhury, who resigned professedly to allow a fair investigation, has claimed he has been framed. His party insists on his innocence, at least of the knowledge of Mr Mamun Mias terrorist links. Mr Chowdhury must have a lovely unsuspicious nature, since his alleged protg lived in Agartala under a false name. The Centre has decided on an investigation parallel to the CID inquiry being instituted by the state. This is not just a case of another CPI(M) minister being caught in a rough spot. Politicians in the Northeast have sometimes been suspected of encouraging or benefiting from illegal cross-border activity, whether smuggling or helping rebel groups. Mr Chowdhurys alleged involvement may be a symptom of this. The West Bengal government, too, is deep into the business of providing residence certificates and ration cards to migrants in the border districts. A spurious legality is used to erase all illegality. Sixty thousand officials in the state have the power to sign PRCs. To draw the obvious lesson from Mr Chowdhurys predicament, all 60,000 would have to be absolutely sure of the individuals they recommend for PRCs. But the system the CPI(M) has put in place over the years is geared precisely to render such legal niceties irrelevant. The horse has bolted long ago.

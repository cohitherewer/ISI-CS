The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Long days journey into unquiet night
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       LONG DAYS JOURNEY INTO UNQUIET NIGHT                                  Jatra may be a more democratic and less corrupt medium than films, but its hopes of survival in trying times rest on expensive imports from tinseltown                                            
	In a one-roomed office of a firm that specializes in handling publicity material for jatras, three men sat discussing a scene from Satyajit Rays Nayak. Discussing perhaps isnt quite the right word to describe the goings-on. The room, cluttered with dusty files, tea cups and faded posters, felt more like a stage, and its occupants  Debu, a man with drooping eyes, Thakur, his cheerful, rotund business partner, and a nameless, shrunken jatra correspondent behaved like actors. Thakur, like Uttam Kumar in the scene, sat with his head lowered, listening to Debu who ranted and raved just like the brilliant Somen Bose. His voice rose and fell as he mocked the pastel world of cinema and its puppet actors. After he finished, he struck a pose and beamed at the correspondent, who filled the room with applause. I was the fourth man in the room. I said little, and watched, fascinated, wondering about the greater claim of the stage-actor, as opposed to the filmstar, to real art.         
	The stage  be it in jatra or theatre  is a beautiful and complex space. Thakurs eyes twinkled as he described a typical jatra performance: the fog hanging low on a wintry night; the glowing stage on a brown, barren field; melodramatic actors in bright costumes, and a hushed but excited audience. Jatra, it was reassuring to hear, hadnt become as contaminated by the trappings of technology as cinema. It still retains a pure, natural creativity. Jatra is also the more democratic, and ethical medium, added the correspondent. Unlike film production teams that follow an invisible hierarchy, a jatra unit is structured more equitably. Everyone involved  from the actor to the cook  shares the same food, dingy hotels and the stage. (Legend has it that Jatra Samrat Swapan Kumar had once given a lift to junior artists as he flew to the Sundarbans in a helicopter for a show.) Commercial transactions are transparent too, as most jatra groups file returns diligently.         
	But like most indigenous, folk traditions, jatra too is struggling to survive. Entertainment, I was told, is an ever-shrinking space; in Midnapore alone, there are over 50 jatra companies competing with films, video nights and television in the villages. A dwindling audience has dried up their revenue. Then there is a domineering, and biased, State. The West Bengal government had banned palas that dealt with Dhananjoy Chatterjees hanging four years ago. A rule that prohibits performances in and around Calcutta during board examinations is still in place. What about the jatra academy at Girish Mancha or the jatra utsav at Mahajati Sadan? Debu sighs, and says that cosmetic measures cannot sustain or revive a dying art.        
	Some of jatras problems are also of the intangible kind: such as prejudice in the form of class and cultural condescension. People in the city, for instance, prefer kitschy cinema to jatra, even though some commercial films like Beder Meye Jyosna have fused folk elements and become immensely successful. The real tragedy, though, is that in order to survive, jatra companies have started to innovate, cruelly altering form and technique, thereby losing their distinctiveness. Dolby sound, choreographed sequences and bawdy plots have replaced the gentle, make-believe universe of myths and legends. Also fading out are small-time actors, whose careers are being threatened by well-paid actors from the film industry.         
	Suddenly, I am reminded of Chiranjeet Chakraborty, and his solemn voice. Chakraborty, who has returned to jatra this season after a few years, had told me over the phone earlier that he had learnt about cinema and acting through Manikdas eyes (Chakraborty had done a bit role in a documentary that Ray made about his father, Sukumar Ray). When it came to jatra though, Chakraborty sounded like the proverbial missionary: he was merely spreading the light of his knowledge among less gifted actors. Perhaps he did deserve his fee, I thought. (Chitpur insiders put it at approximately a lakh per show, while Satabdi Roy is paid Rs 35,000). Thousands, apparently, turn up for a Chiranjeet Night anywhere in Bengal. But I found it improbable that jatra will be able to retain its intrinsic equality as well as its pampered stars.         
	Hours passed inside the cramped office, and some people joined us with bags slung across their shoulders. They joined the conversation after reminding Thakur that it was getting late. I wondered whether these people were actors. Was there a show planned somewhere, I asked? But in that commotion of many voices, moving bodies, and stifled laughter, nobody paid any attention to me or to Debu, who sat with his drooping eyes and a half smile, taking pleasure in watching a motley group of lesser-known actors preparing themselves for yet another performance somewhere near or far.                    UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

	If intelligence and security failed to do their jobs, the driver of the pilot car for Ram Vilas Paswans convoy did his job excellently. It must have taken a wounded man nerve and unerring professional instinct to shoot across the bridge in a car that had leapt into the air and burst its tyres. In spite of the deepening atmosphere of violence and fear, a driver in a convoy transporting two Central ministers preceded by the heavily guarded vehicle of the chief minister of the state would hardly have been expecting an explosion on the main route. Particularly when that route had been known ever since the date of the founding of the Jindal Steel project in Salboni was announced a month ago. When the state government is ready to rattle off hair-raising tales of Maoists at the drop of a hat, it is incomprehensible that security and intelligence would have been so shoddy in a district like West Midnapore. Not that there was no warning. A Maoist source had declared the intention to resist the Salboni project. It was not taken seriously; maybe the authorities themselves do not believe the tales they tell.        
	That West Bengal is casual about the very real threat of terrorism is not a new discovery. The Assam blasts have made no difference. But the irony does not lie only in the fact that such apathy brought the threat to the car-door of the chief minister. The greater irony is the exposure of the levels to which work culture has sunk. The terrorists laid a 1200-metre-long wire across the bordering paddy field in peace, while, apparently, the Special Security Force night patrol either slept or looked the other way. After all, there was no senior officer to monitor them. The police did not bother to check the area on either side of the road; checking the road was strenuous enough. The Intelligence Bureau did not bother to form a network of information through villagers as planned. But then, dutifulness and accountability are looked down upon by the states political masters.

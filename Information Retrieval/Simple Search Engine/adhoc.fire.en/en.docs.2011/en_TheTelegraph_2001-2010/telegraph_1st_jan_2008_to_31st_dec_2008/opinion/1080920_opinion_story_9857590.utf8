The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Tagore remembered and forgotten
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TAGORE REMEMBERED AND FORGOTTEN                              THEATRE      Ananda Lal                                                
	For its third edition, after inaugurating its annual Rabindra Utsav in 2006, Happenings continued the policy adopted last year in opening out the festival to arts other than theatre. This may have been practically necessary, because to find half-a-dozen theatrical productions of Tagore to premiere at the Utsav may have become an impossible job. There is a chastening lesson in this reality  approaching 70 years since the death of modern Indias greatest artistic creator, his works still do not inspire enough directors to ensure just six or seven new shows every year. Contrast with Shakespeare in the UK and US: so many annual Shakespeare festivals do brisk business, and attract tourists too, only because so many companies regularly mount new interpretations of his plays. It is not as if Tagore is a lesser author than Shakespeare. Therefore, Indian theatre workers ignore their pre-eminent modern dramatist, and Bengalis fail to project his genius convincingly to the rest of the country.        
	There is, of course, nothing wrong in Rabindra Utsav diversifying into music concerts, dance programmes or poetry recitation, though the simultaneous scheduling at Birla Sabhagar and Bharatiyam, at Salt Lake, meant that Tagore buffs could not watch two events at both venues at the same time. Consequently, much as I would have liked to see and hear some of the dance or music, my beat took me to the theatre segment, which featured just three items this year.        
	On September 10, Ideas Unlimited (Mumbai) staged Achalayatan in Gujarati, directed by Manoj Shah, the translation uncredited. For reasons related to Gujarats present politics of religion, Shahs choice seemed quite brave, for Tagore is at his most scathing about fossilized, institutionalized Hinduism in this play. What struck me about the audience reception was that the smattering of Gujaratis in the hall was obviously moved; they responded appreciatively at the right moments and applauded loudly at the curtain call. Evidently the dialogue hits home, even though Shahs interpretation is not the best I have seen of this text. He presents a simple, stripped-down version, with just a few actors constituting the various groups of young men, virtually no songs (which add so much to the impact of any Tagorean drama) and only a ramp upstage by way of set.        
	The following day, Nirman Kala Manch (Patna) put on Swapna Mangal Katha, a collectively-written script on Tagores sacrifices to keep Santiniketan running. The director, Sanjay Upadhyay, applied Bihari folk performance to help it reach out to the masses of Bihar. He should know best about his own constituency, but I found the production weak compared to his earlier Bidesiya, which had used that village form so dynamically. Here, Tagore (Subro Bhattacharya) looked like a short, starving Santa Claus in cottonwool wig and beard, which he had a disconcerting habit of stroking from the back down. Also, Upadhyay took considerable liberties with chronology and biography; for instance, Tagores tours of India with his dance-drama troupe began only as late as 1933 and lasted just a few years before his health failed. Leonard Elmhirst, a major character here, is spelt as Alemhurst.        
	Seagull Theatre (Guwahati) sprang the biggest surprise with its dramatization of that most unlikely short story, Madhyabartini (September 13), one of those rare Tagorean touches of the grotesque in which a childless wife nags her devoted husband to remarry (picture). He does, most reluctantly, but then gradually becomes besotted with his young new wife, leading to complications, one after another. Director Baharul Islams achievement lies in making the tale realistically credible, while using the Assamese folk form of Dhuliya and its clowns as narrators. As usual with Seagulls performances, the acting is of a high standard, led by Bhagirathi and Baharul Islam as the married couple. The scripter, Naren Patgiri, stays faithful to the original except at the very end  where Tagore has the husband creep like a thief into his first wifes bed to lie beside her. Islam throws a spotlight on the bed but shows her settling down in a corner of the room to beat cotton forcefully. One hopes that Seagull brings Madhyabartini, instead of something older in its repertoire, to Nandikars National Festival in December, so that more viewers can see it.

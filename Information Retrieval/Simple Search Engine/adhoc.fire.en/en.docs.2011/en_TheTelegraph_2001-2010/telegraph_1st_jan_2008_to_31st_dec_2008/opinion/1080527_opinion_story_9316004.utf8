	The finance minister, in his unending quest for votes, decreed in his last budget that farmers who have less than two hectares do not have to repay bank loans. He forgot farm labourers, who are farmers with no hectares. But they will be wise to read the signals, plead for justice and stop repaying their loans. It is reported that over a third of the increase in banks bad debts in 2007-08 consisted of loans to farmers. So from now, lending to farmers is as good as giving them charity. If banks so indulge themselves, their auditors will pull them up. Even if they do not, tax authorities will ask them what business they had to go into the business of gifting money. The State Bank of India has already decided not to give tractor loans any more; all rational banks will follow.         
	The ICICI Bank has been repeatedly admonished by courts for using strong-arm tactics against defaulting borrowers; the Madras high court was the latest to take it to task. There is something abhorrent about breaking someones legs because he is not paying back a loan. But if farmers can treat borrowings as gifts simply because they are politicians darlings, other people will wonder too why they should repay loans  and feel safer to default after the courts judgments. And the safer they feel, the more clearly will banks see the folly of giving loans to new borrowers. They will confine themselves to old clients and to big companies in stable industries. New entrepreneurs and men of ideas had better give up the idea of going to a bank for money.         
	As it is, the flood of liquidity in the past six years has left banks with more funds than they could lend. As they become wary of unknown borrowers and known farmers, they will find it even more difficult to find borrowers they can trust. Better keep ones cash intact than to lose it to a State-protected crook. But cash earns no return; banks have huge staff to support and expensive offices to maintain. There was a time when all they had to do was to give loans that would turn sour. Then, some years later, the finance minister would give them government securities to replace their bad debts. That was not ready cash, but it at least brought some income. Now, however, the finance minister has set himself against such charity at the expense of the taxpayer. So now banks have started parking their money in mutual funds. If they invest in equity funds, they will lose much money when share prices fall. If they invest in debt funds, that too is lending to the government; and the more they invest, the higher the price of the fund units and the lower the return. That is the plight to which the government has reduced banks.

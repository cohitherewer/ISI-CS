               This above all

	Shakespeares plays and sonnets were not written by Shakespeare but by another man with the same name, remarked a witty scholar of literature. That pretty well summarizes the controversy that started several centuries after the death of the greatest figure of world literature over his real identity. He wrote nothing about himself and none of his contemporaries bothered to write anything about him. We do not know what he looked like: a large portrait found later shows him as a balding man in his thirties with a ring in one ear, a goatee on his chin and dressed in the fineries of Elizabethan times. Other portraits and statues followed the pattern of this painting. We are not sure when exactly he started his writing career and in what order he wrote his plays and sonnets. Though public records, including church and school in his birthplace and in London, have been thoroughly researched, they reveal very little about the man. Most of what is to be known about this great man is based on conjectures, created around a few bare bones of authenticated facts. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon on April 26, 1564 and died on April 23, 1616. His father, John Shakespeare, became an alderman in charge of quality and quantities of ale served in taverns and meat and bread by butchers and bakers. The family must have lived well. His mother, Mary Arden, was the daughter of a farmer. She bore eight sons and daughters, including William. William spent seven to eight years in school cramming Latin. He never went to college. He married Anne Hathway, eight years older to him and pregnant at the time of marriage. She bore him three children.
    
	It is assumed that Williams interest in theatre was kindled while watching troupes of players from London performing in towns all over the country. One such group lost its principal actor and William was chosen to take his place. He thus became an actor. He left his family in Stratford and moved to London. At that time London was a dirty city frequently afflicted by plague and other diseases, which killed more people than were born. Nevertheless, it continued to grow, with the influx of job-seekers and Protestant refugees from Catholic France. There were quite a few theatrical companies with playhouses of their own. Shakespeares company performed in the afternoons. There were roughnecks and pickpockets snatching bags and wallets. Women seldom went out unaccompanied. There is a story of a young wife who wanted to see a play and persuaded her husband to let her go alone. He agreed and advised her not to take a wallet but to put her money in her bra. She returned home desolate as her money was gone. Didnt you feel the fellows hand inside your bra? asked her angry husband. Yes, I did, replied his wife, but I didnt know it was money he was after.
    
	Shakespeare first made his mark not as a writer but as an actor. When the theatres were closed for some reason or the other, he took to writing plays and poetry. It is likely that he visited France and Italy because several of his plays are on Italian and French themes. When his sonnets were published, doubts arose about his sexuality. Among his most celebrated lines on love are:
    
	Shall I compare thee to a summers day?
    
	Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
    
	Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
    
	And summers lease hath all too short a date.
    
	The lines were not addressed to a young lady, but to a young man who was master-mistress of his passion. And this in a time when homosexuality was frowned upon and sodomy was punishable by death.
    
	Although Shakespeare is regarded as an Elizabethan, it was during the period of King James, who succeeded Elizabeth I, that he won acclaim. It took no more than a couple of centuries for scholars to conclude that he was the greatest of the great poets and playwright of the world. All these I got from the most delightful book, Shakespeare, by Bill Bryson, who subscribes to the view that all the plays and sonnets ascribed to Shakespeare were actually written by someone with the same name.
        
	Make it short
               Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary: friends forever				 
  
	I can claim a tenuous connection with the Everest conqueror, Edmund Hillary, who died a few days ago at the age of 88. When he came down to Delhi with the leader of the victorious team, Colonel John Hunt, in the last week of May or in early June 1953, I was working in the external services of the All India Radio. I was picked up to interview both men. The question uppermost in my mind, and that of everyone else, was whether it was Hillary or Tenzing Norgay who had put his foot first on the peak. Apparently both men had sworn not to tell anyone and simply said, We did it together. That was accepted by Colonel Hunt as the right line to take. However, I kept badgering both men, hoping to get a more positive answer. 
    
	Colonel Hunt was a man of few words, but Hillary went on and on about details of how close they came to being swept to death by an avalanche and how exhilarating it was to have the whole world under their feet. While he was at it, Colonel Hunt scribbled something on a slip of paper and pushed it towards Hillary. He gave it a brief look, crumpled it with contempt and threw it on the floor. And then he continued to drawl on and on. At the end of the interview when no one was looking, I picked up the crumpled piece of paper and put it in my pocket. It read, make it short. I pasted it on my copy of the book on the Everest by Captain M.S. Kohli, who led the Indian team on a repeat performance. It is still with me.

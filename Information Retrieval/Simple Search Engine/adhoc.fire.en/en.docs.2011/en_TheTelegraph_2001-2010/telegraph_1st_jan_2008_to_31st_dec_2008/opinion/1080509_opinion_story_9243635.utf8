The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | in the red zone
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             IN THE RED ZONE                                                    
	Flesh, marble and turf are all in deep peril in Calcutta. So the courts and a few active citizens have been trying, from time to time, to rescue all three from irreversible damage. Their doggedness has been admirable  but the effort has been thankless, and more or less in vain. Following the petition of an untiring environmental activist, the Calcutta high court has now passed a series of orders to the police with a view to preserving the Maidan as well as the Victoria Memorial from air pollution. The courts have tried to strike a bargain: political rallies will be allowed on the Maidan if the organizers of these rallies promise not to park cars and buses on the green, dig holes in it and cook in open, makeshift ovens on it. If they fail to keep these conditions, then they forfeit their right to hold rallies.         
	To call the protected area around the Memorial, where these conditions would apply, the red zone is superbly ironic. The entire tradition of ruining the green is founded on a brand of politics the ruddiness of which is beyond dispute. That the courts latest order is addressed to the police should inspire little hope in the ordinary Calcuttan. This is not the first time that the high court has expected this of the police, and in every previous instance the latter have unabashedly failed the former in keeping their side of the bargain. The response of the other habitual offenders, political parties of all hues, has also been uniformly nonchalant. West Bengals indomitable transport minister  the person most responsible for the dangerousness of the citys air  has already courted arrest for disregarding the court order. When party and police are so much in harmony over the will to be destructive and disruptive, then the courts persistence, let alone the citizens, could only be of little avail. And if one moves from the courts concern for marble and turf to its alarm over the fate of human flesh in the city, then the scenario is hardly any better. A whole history of orders and injunctions brazenly ignored in the name of peoples rights, and ignored by the government and the police, makes up the story of the courts and the peoples battle for clean air in Calcutta. Nothing but criminal indifference, inefficiency, corruption and vote-bank politics meets these efforts in Bengal. Particulate matter is not the only poison in the Calcutta air.

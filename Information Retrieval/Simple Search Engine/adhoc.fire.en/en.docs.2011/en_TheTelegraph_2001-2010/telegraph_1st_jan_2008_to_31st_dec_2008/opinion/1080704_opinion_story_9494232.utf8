	Islam and healing: Loss and Recovery of an Indo-Muslim Medical Tradition 1600-1900 By Seema Alavi, Permanent Black, Rs 695        
	When Akbar or Aurangzeb or for that matter any other Mughal nobleman fell ill, what kind of medical treatment did he receive? The answer is that they were probably treated through the Unani school of medicine. This was an Indo-Muslim tradition that came and developed in India along with Mughal political culture. Seema Alavis book is a pioneering exploration of the many facets of Unani medicine. She studies Unani texts and its practitioners from the 17th to the 20th centuries and places them in the context of the social history of the period, and of the encounter of this tradition with Western medicine. She is uniquely placed to undertake this kind of study since on her mothers side, she is descended from a distinguished line of hakims in Lucknow.        
	She learnt from her maternal grandmother that Unani was not just a system of medicine but a form of healing, a way of life. She grew up hearing stories of the friendship her family members had with the civil surgeons of Lucknow. The result is an extraordinarily rich book. But the problem, as with all pathbreaking works, is that it is impossible to benchmark it. One can only be in awe of the material presented and of the analysis made.        
	There is another very important historiographical departure that this book makes. Most of the work on Mughal history, including the stupendous work of Irfan Habib and his colleagues in Aligarh, has had the Mughal state as its focus. Very little work has been done on traditions and institutions not associated with the state. Alavi writes, This book does not disprivilege the state. But it sees the state as fluid entity located within society constantly piecing together a fractured political culture. Alavis real focus is the internal history of a tradition of healing, and how it encountered the coming of modernity.         
	She, however, also makes the claim that in the Mughal empire, medicine was a form of healing central to the building of an imperial political culture. She makes this claim because, the healing tradition expanded and was consolidated in tandem with the entrenchment of the Indo-Muslim fabric of the regions society. Thus the Mughal medical tradition is of significant import for Indian society and politics. The state thus comes into Alavis discussion not directly but at a tangent.        
	There could be an argument about the implication of the words in tandem. Does something happening together suggest a causal link, an association or something else? Coincidence is not always a link. It is necessary perhaps, and provocative, to look at the argument through a counter factual. What would have happened to the tradition of healing if there was no Mughal state. The fact that it survived even after the decline of the Mughal Empire suggests a certain robustness of the tradition that may have made its role in the building of an imperial political culture somewhat irrelevant.        
	In the high noon of Mughal India, hakims produced Persian medical encyclopaedic texts that codified elite social manners since the belief was that outward bodily deportment as being critical to health. This fitted in well with a court culture marked by hierarchy and ritual.        
	Unani medicine was forced to break from courtly culture when the Empire declined and regional powers came to the fore. It became more popular and resorted to Arabic as the language of learning and dissemination. This created a new medical community since Arabic medical texts were not concerned with courtly virtues and drew from such writers as Avicenna, Hippocrates and Galen. This transition is important for the understanding of the Unani tradition.        
	A nodal point in the argument of this book is what happened to the Unani tradition with the coming of colonialism. Alavi counters the conventional wisdom that colonial intervention in the 1830s stifled indigenous healing practices. Her point is that in the transition to Arabicized learning, Unani medicine had been shaped in some ways by the Western context. Moreover, the tradition of healing espoused by hakims had become too embedded in cultural norms and society to be too easily stifled or overwhelmed.        
	Implicit in Alavis analysis is a critique of the accepted notions of colonialism. She does not see colonialism in India in terms of conflict. She argues, rather tantalizingly, that colonial concepts like public health had indigenous Indian origins. She questions the idea of Western models of civil society being imported into India to be imposed through colonial administration. In her view, the colonial state was a weak one and it failed to carry through its own revolutionizing project. She locates this failure in the strength of indigenous traditions like Unani medicine. Alavi is thus trying to draw the attention of historians away from the standard trajectory of colonial state and resistance to it. She is drawing attention to indigenous traditions of learning that were strong enough to meet Western learning and to negotiate with it.        
	Alavi thus breaks new ground in her choice of theme, the archive she uses, the approach she takes and the implications she draws out. This is a major book of historical scholarship, refreshingly free from jargon and needless theorizing. It is good to see the good old historians craft thriving in the fragmented world of postmodernist scholarship.

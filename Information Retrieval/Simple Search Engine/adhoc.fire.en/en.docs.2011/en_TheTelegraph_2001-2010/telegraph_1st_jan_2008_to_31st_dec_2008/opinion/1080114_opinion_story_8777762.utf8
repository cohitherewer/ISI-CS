	Disasters happen without warning. But some people are trained to see them coming, and some to deal with the aftermath. The long and devastating fire in the Burrabazar markets signals the failure of both sets of people. But the negligence, in this case, arises out of a complex set of interlinked factors that implicates a range of people and institutions. First, most of the gutted buildings were illegal and old, and hence outside the pale of precautionary regulations. Such illegal structures exist through the collusion of powerful local politicians, promoters and inhabitants, and any long-term vision of safety remains alien to their mindset and ways of functioning. Besides, Indians excel in ignoring laws that exist to make life safer for them  out of a sort of collective death-wish that is difficult to explain. Seat-belts and helmets, for instance, are yet to become part of Calcuttas aspirations to modernity. Fire safety regulations figure only nominally in the imaginations of those who form Calcuttas civic bodies. So conditions prevail in and around these buildings that are not dissimilar to those in mid-17th-century London when the Great Fire happened in that city. Narrow lanes, defunct hydrants and power failure further maintain medieval conditions in the city. The municipal authorities will have to take responsibility for this.
    
	The state governments fire department has also been showing an alarming lack of readiness and coordination. It has not properly maintained expensive emergency equipment, and has also failed to make proper use of the resources that were made available to it. The army, airforce and the Airports Authority of India, all of which rushed their men to the scene, have complained of a lack of cooperation on the part of the fire services men. The former spent most of their time standing around for the lack of proper guidance from the firemen. Finally, there seems to have been only a few  among the many who used these buildings  who had bothered, though in vain, to try to bring to the notice of the government and its civic bodies that a disaster was waiting to happen in these markets. That their appeals fell on deaf ears is part of the entirely avoidable shamefulness of this situation. Hence, both governance and citizenship have to radically alter their modes of functioning in order to reduce the inevitability of accidents like the Burrabazar fire.

	In political theory there exists an absurdity called constitutional monarchy. According to this concept, defended by no less a thinker than G.W.F. Hegel, a hereditary monarchy can be at the head of a parliamentary democracy. It is an absurdity because a parliamentary democracy cannot logically recognize hereditary claims to any public office. The idea of a constitutional monarchy emerged from a peculiar set of circumstances in 17th-century England. After a few years of being a republic in the 1650s, the monarchy was restored with its wings clipped, especially by the settlement of 1688, which enshrined the concept of a constitutional mon- arch. England  and later Great Britain  has muddled through with the contradiction of an elected prime minister reporting to a hereditary monarch. But this in no way removes the absurdity of the concept.
    
	Yet, the idea has strange upholders. Witness the defence of the constitutional monarchy in Nepal by L.K.Advani, the man projected as the prime ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party. He objected to the United Progressive Alliance governments refusal to intervene when the monarchy in Nepal was pulled down. This is odd because Mr Advani has always professed his commitment to democracy and to the democratic process. By upholding the monarchy in Nepal, he is also following an absurd line of thinking, without perhaps even being aware of the contradiction he has landed himself in. How can Mr Advani be an ardent admirer of the principles of republicanism  as he indeed must be if he is to see himself as a prospective candidate for the Indian prime ministership  and at the same time uphold constitutional monarchy in Nepal? The principles of republicanism and parliamentary democracy cannot be country specific. They are universal principles to be upheld by all who believe in democracy. Mr Advani cannot have it both ways  be a democrat in India and be a monarchist for Nepal. To be fair to Mr Advani, his contradiction is rooted not in his personal beliefs, but in the ideology of the sangh parivar which is Mr Advanis ultimate loyalty.
    
	The sangh parivar, since the idea of Hindutva was first formulated, has elevated Nepal to a privileged position. This had nothing to do with Nepals mountains and spectacular natural beauty. It had everything to do with the fact that Nepal was the worlds only Hindu monarchy. The Nepalese polity thus embodied something very special for the sangh parivar. Mr Advani, ever since he was a young man, has been nurtured on this ideology, which the BJP has inherited. The monarchy in Nepal was seen as something sacred. Its dismantling by popular forces is not something that can be supported from within the sangh parivar ideology. The contradiction belongs not to Mr Advani alone, but to the politico-cultural family of which he is a proud and a prominent member.

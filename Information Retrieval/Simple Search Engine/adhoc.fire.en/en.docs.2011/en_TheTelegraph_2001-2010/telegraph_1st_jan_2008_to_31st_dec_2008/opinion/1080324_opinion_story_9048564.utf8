                                                                                                                 WHATS SPECIAL?                                                    
	It is difficult not to hear a disproportionate emphasis in West Bengals IAS Officers Association insisting that non-Bengali civil servants posted in the state must be educated in its local, especially rural, cultures. During their first year of posting, and later when they serve as district magistrates, the association wants new civil servants from other states to be posted in those districts of Bengal where they might pick up the nuances of the local panchayat system better than in other districts. The suggestion implies that being brought up in another state is a disadvantage for understanding Bengal. This seems to be particularly applicable to Bengal, which demands a special sort of training from those who are posted here.        
	It should not have to be stated separately that civil servants should do their homework, and classwork, about the states they come to work in for the first time. To tap into various forms of local knowledge and adapt ones education as a civil servant to their structures and content should, indeed, be part of the acquired skills of an IAS officer. But to state this perfectly obvious idea as a regional entitlement is to risk sounding unacceptably parochial, even chauvinistic. Those who are making such a demand sound suspiciously like the people who insist on Bengali signboards and streetnames in order to sustain a regional identity. What, they might be asked, is so special about Bengal? A Bengali civil servant going to work in Madhya Pradesh should know about Madhya Pradesh. This should apply equally to any two states taken at random, and this kind of region-specific training should be built into a civil servants education, if it isnt already so. Besides, to know about the peculiarities of the panchayat system as practised in a particular region should not always mean endorsing and perpetuating them. There might even be an advantage in an outsider bringing to a posting his own fresh approach and understanding of the system. Parochial thinking in such matters could end up being a hindrance to such independence.

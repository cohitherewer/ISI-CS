	The tastefully designed invitation and the programme notes reproducing Nandalal Boses beautiful mural of a dancer led one to expect something better than the run-of-the-mill. But Saptaks production of Rabindranath Tagores Natir Puja (Sisir Mancha, May 18)  directed by Nandita Basu Sarbadhikary, who also plays the nati  managed to murder a brilliant play with a bloodlessness and lack of originality that make one wonder who the keepers of the sacred flame are in Santiniketan today. What sort of standards do they embody when it comes to the basics of music, performance and creative interpretation? (Saptak is reputed to be Santiniketans most distinguished body of flame-keepers, formed by students, teachers, staff and alumni.)        
	The soullessly smooth and correct singing (ineptly lipped by the actors whose voices never matched their singing counterparts), the absurd lack of speaking, acting and dancing skills in everybody on stage, the tawdriest of costumes, the less-than-amateurish lighting, and the sorriest of stage design left one somewhere between sadness and fury. Its easy to excuse schoolchildren for not understanding this plays tragedies of renunciation, its depiction of a mysterious death-wish in women and of their hunger for worship, its exploration of the limits of dance, and its sense of the radical challenge of Buddhism. But one feels less indulgent towards educated adults playing to a literary and academic lite, which seemed to like what it saw quite a bit.

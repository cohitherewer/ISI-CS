	The boomerang effect                  
	Sir  Now that the countrys highest court has unequivocally quashed the amended AIIMS Act and reinstated P. Venugopal as the director of that prestigious institution, our maverick health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, has only one option: to apologize to the nation for causing turmoil in the countrys premier medical institute and resign from the Union cabinet (SC reinstates Venugopal, May 10). Last year, Ramadoss had armtwisted the United Progressive Alliance government into amending the act with the sole purpose of evicting Venugopal. Ramadoss should now be paid back in his own coin and forced to give up his portfolio. Ironically, Ramadoss is known for his sermons to celebrities on how they should behave on and off screen. Given his own wayward behaviour, it now appears that such homilies did not mean much, but were dispensed every now and then only to grab media space.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J. Akshobhya, Mysore

                
	Sir  Having declared the AIIMS Act unconstitutional, the apex court has not only restored the rule of law but also proved how judicial review can act as an effective check on arbitrary legislation. The court should be applauded for upholding the appeal challenging the act as illegal and discriminatory, enacted solely for the purpose of superannuating P. Venugopal following his differences with Ambumani Ramadoss. At present, Venugopal has two months of service as the director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. But the apex court ruling sends a clear message to power-hungry ministers like Ramadoss. The verdict should also bring to the forefront certain related issues, such as the parliaments exclusive right to enact laws.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

                
	Sir  The honourable thing for Ambumani Ramadoss now would be to resign, failing which he should be removed from office. Ramadoss has done no memorable public good during his tenure as health minister but spent most of his time trying to control the functioning of the AIIMS. Venugopal must be congratulated for sticking to his guns and not accepting injustice. The clash between Venugopal and Ramadoss is not just a conflict of interests or personalities. Rather, it reflects an Indian trend  ministers behaving as demigods and expecting unquestionable allegiance from their subordinates. This culture has turned India into a nation of sycophants. People endure humiliation, unfairness and injustice so as not to disturb the powers that be and to advance their own careers. That is why Venugopals tenacity and courage are all the more exemplary.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Height and distance          
	Sir  The Gorkha Janmukti Morchas rally at the Indira Gandhi Maidan in Siliguri has proved, contrary to the leftist governments suspicions, that it is possible to arrange a peaceful political meeting in the hills. Bimal Gurung and his followers deserve to be praised for not letting the gathering lead to a law and order crisis. The rally also highlights the hill peoples resolve for an autonomous Gorkhaland. If anything, it is the Communist Party of India (Marxist) that should be ashamed of the assault led by three partymen on some Gorkha people who were on their way to the Siliguri subdivisional office for a hunger strike (Morcha guns for CPM trio, May 8). The Gorkhas, unlike the CPI(M) cadre in Nandigram, did not descend on Siliguri with weapons.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Amar Singh Rai, Darjeeling

                
	Sir  The Left Front government of West Bengal  a self-proclaimed harbinger of peace  has been shamed by three of its party leaders, who attacked some Gorkha people a few days before Bimal Gurungs rally in Siliguri. As if it is not enough to deny the Gorkhas their right to a land of their own, now the so-called protectors of justice are turning into culprits. Had the CPI(M) not resorted to violent reprisals at the drop of a hat, Nandigram would perhaps have been a better place to live in today. It is time now to rise above selfish politics and face the facts for what they are worth.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Tilak Sharma, Siliguri 

                
	Sir  There was no reason for dithering, in the way the Bengal government did, before giving the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha permission to hold a rally in Siliguri. In a democratic country, citizens have the right to express dissent. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha is doing just that. The party is a channel through which the hill people are trying to air their grievances. They have suffered a great deal under the leftist government. In the past decade, they have faced nothing but under-development, exploitation, and injustice. As for holding a rally in Siliguri, the Morcha did not go wrong there either, because the town falls under Darjeeling district. It must be understood that Bimal Gurung is not trying to play the hill people against those in the plains. On the contrary, the hill people have always held those in the plains with respect.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Prashant Chettri, Siliguri 

                
	Sir  Sumanta Sens analysis of the agitation by the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha deserves serious attention (Clouds on the horizon, May 7). That the agitation is receiving support from insurgent outfits in north Bengal and neighbouring Assam illustrates the essentially separatist character of the movement fuelled by divisive politics. It is unfortunate that some opposition parties are keen on disintegrating the country further. Sens contention that the government is not serious enough about tackling the problem politically is hard to accept. The state government declared long ago that it was open to discussion with the Morcha leaders. The solution to the Gorkhaland tangle lies within the framework of the Sixth Schedule that has already been agreed upon by both sides. The Union government ought to have passed the bill instead of sitting on it for so long. The state government should not give in to the pressure tactics of Bimal Gurung under any circumstance.           
	Yours faithfully,

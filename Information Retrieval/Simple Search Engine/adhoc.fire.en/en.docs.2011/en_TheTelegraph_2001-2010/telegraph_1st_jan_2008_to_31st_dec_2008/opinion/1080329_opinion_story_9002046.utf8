The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Cant do the Can Can
                                                                                                                 CANT DO THE CAN CAN                              Fauzia Marikar      Music                                                
	The Calcutta School of Music boasts a Bsendorfer concert grand, now long past her prime, and an original Steinway grand that is even older, as well as a few upright pianos all of which need urgent and major repair. In a bid to raise the funds for this and with the generous help of well-wishers, artists and of ITC Sonar Bangla, an extravaganza of art, music and food was presented at the Sonar Bangla on March 2, where eleven works of art were exhibited for sale, generously donated by eminent artists in the city.         
	The elegant little brochure announced a musical programme at 8 pm, consisting of short popular works from the light classical repertory. The Calcutta Chamber Orchestra was presented as the premiere string orchestra of the city. Led by Joseph Rozario, it also introduced the talented Sandip Halder who has recently returned from Goa as the winner of the David Menezes Memorial Violin Competition.        
	Preliminary introductions were made and the orchestras visiting conductor, Pheroze Mistri, stepped on to the dais and raised his baton, and the opening bars of Mozarts Overture from The Magic Flute fell ever so slightly askew on the tolerant ears of a friendly audience of well-wishers. Next came the Concerto in D minor for Two Violins by J.S. Bach. The soloists, Rozario and Halder, acquitted themselves well, inspiring the orchestra to a stronger and more confident performance. Then, Palladio by Karl Jenkins and some of Brahmss Hungarian Dances were conducted by Sanjib Mondal, the resident conductor of the CCO. The orchestra was generally mindful of the dynamics of the music, but the rather careful pace of the wild Hungarian dances robbed them of their gypsy passion. But the audience loved it, cheering and smiling encouragement, clicking away on their digital cameras.        
	With Mistri conducting again, it played two movements from the Suite for Strings by John Rutter. These were racy little cameos in the style of Scottish airs that took some nifty conducting. It could not have been easy with the syncopated rhythms of the second movement. Then came the lovely Adagio in G minor by Tomaso Albinoni. The violins came into their own with this difficult, long and sustained movement.        
	Finally Jacques Offenbach, the low strings taking on the usual brass passages in the ever-popular Can-Can. But given the orchestras persistent inability to keep up with the exuberant tempo of Offenbachs semi-quavers, it was more Cant-Cant than Can-Can.        
	To sustained applause and cries of Encore!, a delighted audience was given Johann Strausss Vienna Life, an appropriately light-hearted end that put a spring in everybodys steps as they went off to the splendid buffet, after announcements that more pictures had been sold  bringing us closer to that concert grand.

Many a true word comes out in a cartoon. The best cartoons are those that need no words to bring out the humour. Too many words distract attention from the drawing, and thus take away from the main purpose of a cartoon. MARIO DE MIRANDA (Architecture Autonomous, Rs 2,700) presents a selection of the cartoonists works. There is also a short biography by Manohar Malgonkar and also some of Marios anecdotes. None of the cartoons is particularly funny even though Mario had his very distinctive style. The drawings are chronologically arranged and range from doodles in his diaries to the famous cartoon strips that included such characters as Ms Fonseca, Bundaldass, the Boss and others. Mario loved crowds and drew good faces (as one of the pictures on the left shows). His cartoons were not restricted to Indian scenes, but spread their wings to New York, Paris and Singapore. If only a majority of cartoons could go without words and annotations.

	 Our history books tell us that come summer, our British rulers would move to cooler climes. Earlier, the Mughals were as keen to escape the heat. Taking a cue from these ancient traditions, J. Jayalalithaa has shifted to Kodanadu near Ooty, away from the heat and dust of Chennai. She has been running her fief from there  sending missives, issuing statements and press releases. Senior party functionaries have been warned off her sprawling estate even as the Empress of Poes Gardens cools her heels, and, reportedly, spends time building a Mughal Garden. Meanwhile, temperatures have been rising in the party. There are murmurs that Jayalalithaas long absence from the political capital, just a year before polls, would harm AIADMKs prospects, with actor Vijaykanth and his DMDK party eating into its support base. But Amma is unconcerned. It looks like she hasnt learnt her history well. Otherwise why would she be content playing Nero while Chennai burns?                
	 They say a picture speaks a thousand words. And the Congress-led government certainly believes in the wisdom of this old adage. It has now made it more or less mandatory for all Central ministers to insert photographs of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, along with that of the concerned minister in every advertisement released in print. There is a separate clause that binds ad material issued by ministries headed by a partner in the coalition. In such cases, the picture of its supreme leader can be carried, in addition to those of the above. So a DMK ad, for example, would feature a beaming Singh, Madam as well as a photo of the Kalaignar. But then even the most stringent government rule has its exceptions. In this case, it happens to be Mani Shankar Aiyar, who heads the ministries for the development of the Northeast as well as the panchayati raj. A recent campaign that exhorted Indians, especially Central government employees, to holiday in the Northeast, featured the lone snap of a youngish Aiyar, with no signs of Manmohan Singh or Sonia Gandhi. While some have praised Aiyars guts, others, one hears, have quipped that after seeing the Congresss performance at the Centre, Aiyar couldnt risk putting Singh and Sonia together, even if it was only a picture.                            
	 The Upper House is in search of its own lingua franca , because the floor managers of the UPA belong to the South of the Vindhyas while Opposition NDA leaders hail from the North. The noise and chatter during business advisory panel meetings have thus given way to a heavy silence. Sushma Swarajs heavily sanskritized Hindi sounds unfamiliar to UPA men like Vayalar Ravi, V. Narayanswamy and P.J. Kurian. On the other side, Sharad Yadav of the JD(U) or Gandhi Azad of the BSP have been heard grumbling about how they are unable to comprehend what the Southern Brigade of the UPA says. The fact that the deputy chairman, K Rahman Khan, and chair panel, Jayanti Natarajan, come from the South has further compounded the problems for Messrs Yadav and Azad. A language class seems to be the only solution and a few episodes of Mind your Language might just be what the doctored ordered.                             
	 A television channel recently reported that Indians have the maximum amount of dough stashed away in various Swiss bank accounts. Apparently, the Swiss Banking Association has come out with a report to this effect. It states that Indians have $ 1,456 billion stowed away, while the Russians, with $ 470 billion, come a poor second. The Chinese are in the race too, but their $ 96 billion is nothing to write home about. The news, surprisingly, did not create a flutter among our netas who are wont to make a lot of noise, usually over nothing. Now that doesnt mean that the report is all bluff. It only shows that our leaders have learnt that it never pays to open a can of worms.                  
	Road before you leap          
	 More on politicians versus television channels. A young TV reporter recently called on Janardan Dwivedi, the AICC gen-sec, who thrust a copy of the Indian National Congresss constitution into her hands. Dwivedi, who says that he is a stickler for rules, has often expressed his unhappiness over scribes on the political beat having little knowledge or understanding of the Congresss constitution and history. Dwivedi may have a point, but some scribes say that he would have done well to give a copy each to his colleagues. For even a cursory look at the constitutional provisions regarding discipline, probity and ethical conduct shows that it is the partymen, rather than journos, who have a greater need to leaf through the copy.

                Divine offerings may not always taste sweet. Ask the Pashupatinath temple authorities and they will tell you why. Some time back, they discovered, in their donation box, a cheque carrying several zeroes, worth, what they thought, was a crore. It turned out that a devotee from Zimbabwe had left the cheque in the temples name, and the samiti members in their haste calculated the amount in US, and not Zimbabwean, dollars. The cheque was duly deposited in the local bank, which sought the help of the Forex Treasury in Mumbai. The Treasury informed that owing to the collapsed economy in Zimbabwe one US dollar now equals 190,910,632 Zimbabwean dollars. The cheque, thus, was worth a princely sum of Rs 2.26. Additionally, the temple authorities were told to hand over a sum of Rs 4,000 as clearance and verification charges. One doesnt know what the temple would do next. Accept pranami only in American dollars perhaps?

                   Devi Prasads RAMKINKAR VAIJ: SCULPTURES (Tulika, Rs 1,995) collects the authors photographs of the works of one of the most significant Indian sculptors of the 20th century. Devi Prasad  potter, pacifist, photographer, painter  was Ramkinkars student at Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan, in the late Thirties and early Forties. This book reprints the photographic study that he made of his master in 1978. It also brings together biographical materials and critical accounts of Ramkinkars life and works by friends, students and associates. There is a section entitled Ramkinkar in His Own Words. On the right are three yakshinis, and on the left, Famine. What I see in the garden of life, I paint in the light of day, Ramkinkar had said, and what I touch in darkness, I turn into sculpture.

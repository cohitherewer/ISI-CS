	The ghost of military dictatorship continues to linger over Bangladesh. After much dithering, the army-backed interim government has given former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed permission to travel abroad for medical treatment, but the concession comes with a few sinister strings attached. Ms Wajed, who is being tried under corruption charges, has been prevented from visiting her fathers grave or from making any public statement. Given that the courts were trying to detain Ms Wajed on graft charges until recently, this sudden reversal seems like a suspiciously calculated move. Khaleda Zia, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Ms Wajeds arch-rival, who is also facing anti-graft proceedings in Dhaka, considers this to be the governments ploy to keep major politicians out of the country ahead of the general elections scheduled for the end of this year. There may be a grain of truth in this contention. Ever since the interim government came to power after the declaration of a state of emergency in February 2007, it has single-mindedly tried to remove both these leaders, along with dozens of high-profile politicians of their parties, all allegedly involved in corruption. However noble its intention, this government did not secure the unqualified approval of the people simply because Bangladesh had been plagued by too many military regimes too frequently. Although the end of H.M. Ershads military rule in 1991 ushered in democracy, the political record has not improved much. A series of ineffectual governments, until 2006, virtually reduced Bangladesh to a failed State. Between corrupt democracies and a stable military government, the choice had become pretty obvious.        
	The present government, inextricable as it remains from the ghost of a military past, first came into the scene as a friendly ghost. It was supposed to act as a watchdog over a nation where the rich and the powerful remain notoriously fallible, corruption, political rivalry and misuse of privileges stand in the way of public good, and make a mockery of public mandate. The current dispensation is supposed to facilitate a free and fair election, pave the way for democracy and lead to a complete independence of the judiciary from executive control. But, along the way, this government too faces the danger of becoming a victim of its own power. After all, there is no greater pleasure than to be a watchdog when no one is watching over.

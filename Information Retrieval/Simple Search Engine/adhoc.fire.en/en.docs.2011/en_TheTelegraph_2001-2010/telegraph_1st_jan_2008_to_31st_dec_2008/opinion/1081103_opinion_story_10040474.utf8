Rao                                                            
	Astrologers are forecasters constrained by the positions of stars and planets. Business forecasting in a growing economy must be similarly constrained by costs, prices and demand. Many forget and identify wants with demand.         
	Our economic forecasting is poor. No one anticipated the nine per cent gross domestic product growth rate of recent years, the precipitous decline in growth this year, high levels of inflation this year (not caused only by the rise in crude oil prices but also by uncontrolled government deficits), the rupees strengthening to 40 to the dollar and its ignominious fall to over 50 to the dollar within nine months, the rise and fall of the Sensex to 21,000 in January 2008 and within 10 months to almost 8,000.        
	This weakness in forecasting is worse with infrastructure needs. We have never correctly forecast Indias demand for electricity nor achieved its availability anywhere near predicted quantities. One fortuitous result is that economic growth has used less electricity per unit of output than many other countries. Indians learnt the value of conservation and efficient use of electricity because of its shortage.         
	A general weakness in forecasting demand in India has been the inability to recognize that demand is always in relation to price. For example, the Central Electricity Authority for years forecast electricity demand almost on a straight-line basis by asking people what they needed, not how much they could use at what price. This blindness continues. The mammoth ongoing programme for rural electrification will spend hundreds of crores on hardware for connecting rural India. But demand for electricity in rural India is not forecast in relation to its price (and cost).               
	We also do not recognize the consequences of price signals and their effect on demand. Karnataka is the latest state to give free power to farmers. There is no limit on how many pumpsets each farmer can energize with free electricity, nor any limit on the crops that can be grown. The result will be, as in many other parts of India, that farmers switch to higher earning water-intensive crops, deplete ground water, increase land salinity and, in the long term damage the land for most uses. At zero electricity prices, demand for power will obviously have no limit. For a few years farmer earnings will improve with water intensive crops; afterwards, earnings will collapse.         
	When telecommunications were opened to private investment with the introduction of cell phones, the government sold licences to the highest bidders. There was a scramble for licences, for which companies paid hundreds of crores. They had not estimated demand realistically, accounting for three principal factors  quality of the service, cost of cell phone instruments and the cost per call-minute. At the outset, a cell phone cost Rs 20,000 and Rs 20 per call-minute, declining to Rs 10 or so. These costs would and did limit demand. To recover the high fees from call earnings would take many decades at the low level of demand at such prices. Companies paid high licence fees without estimating this equation and had poor revenues. They appealed to the government to save them. So it is not just the government but many in the private sector also that do not consider demand as related to price.         
	One company aggressively went after customers, dropping call charges and sourcing low-cost instruments. It led the way for the industry. India underwent a telecom revolution led by cell phone companies from both private and public sectors. Cell phones have overtaken fixed line phones. Operators make good profits despite charges being among the lowest in the world. New companies with only a licence are worth many times what the licence cost. With Indias low-income population, volumes depend on low prices.         
	A recent example of poor business forecasting is that of the airline industry. Ratan Tatas executives must be happy that his passion for flying was grounded by government obduracy. The Tatas would, like the others, have lost a lot. Airlines and airports are notoriously cyclical industries everywhere. Yet, many businessmen emulated Tata but took off  Naresh Goyal, Vijay Mallya, Jeh Wadia, and many others. Like lemmings marching behind each other to drown in the ocean, they started new airlines. They could not have had realistic forecasts of demand and price. They bought the propaganda about Indias Growth, imminent double digit growth, India as a Great Power and the unstoppable India. They also saw an opportunity as government owned airlines went steadily downhill, helped by venal politicians and some bureaucrats. None anticipated the extent of competition but only foresaw easy pickings. Jet and Kingfisher even acquired Deccan and Sahara on top of their already large commitments on aeroplane fleets.         
	Low cost airlines followed, selling below cost, without compensating cost savings. At these low prices many travellers switched to air travel. A huge market resulted as airfares fell close to the level of rail fares. Unbridled price wars began. All airlines lost money. Each expected others to fold up, leaving the market to the rest who could then charge remunerative prices.        
	These operators never grasped the essentials of a budget airline. It is tight cost control. Ryanair or Air Asia are profitable because they work with low fuel costs, low operating costs, low airport charges (by using the less popular air terminals and airports), restrict baggage, food and other services, and utilize aircraft to the maximum. Outstanding managerial skills gave low costs, low prices and large demand from undemanding customers who only wanted on-time safe travel.         
	Indian airline operators displayed no managerial skills, nor did operating conditions make it possible to keep costs low. Indian aviation fuel taxes are more than their cost. Fuel prices in most cases are 100 per cent higher. Sales taxes on fuel amount to 27 to 30 per cent. Aviation turbine fuel in India is subject to eight times higher taxes at 66 per cent versus eight per cent for international airlines. Fuel costs are fixed: at 35 to 40 per cent of total costs they are the largest component of airline expenses. Other taxes  service tax, excise and customs duties, user development charges in new airports, add to costs. Our airport charges are said to be 62 per cent higher than comparable tariffs abroad.                     
	When prices of aviation fuel rose with crude prices, so did passenger fares, leading to a precipitous decline in airline traffic. The low-cost airlines realized their un-viability and disappeared. Air fares have risen. Traffic has dropped and overheads are unbearable. Many airlines will close down.         
	Business leaders with demonstrated commercial success in other businesses went berserk in their airlines businesses. They bought new craft with borrowed funds. They leased many aircraft. High interest and repayment costs, high lease rents, high-priced aviation fuel, and high airport charges are inflexible. An aircraft with empty seats is a loss of revenue. Filling it requires unviable low fares. Despite this simple economics, airlines opened new routes, hired foreign pilots at higher wages, added expensive cabin crew, and ignored the relation of costs to prices and volumes.         
	Airlines have shown a lack of foresight, poor skills in forecasting demand at different prices, poor understanding of irreducible costs, and sunk costs on borrowings and lease rents. India, to be globally competitive, must learn better business forecasting.

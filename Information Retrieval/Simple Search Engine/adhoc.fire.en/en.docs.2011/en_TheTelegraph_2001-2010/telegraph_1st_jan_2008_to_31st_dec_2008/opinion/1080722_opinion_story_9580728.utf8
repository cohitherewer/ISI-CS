                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       MAKES NO SENSE                                                    
	The brand of patriotism that is written in saffron stands a trifle exposed in the debate over the Indo-US nuclear deal. This is because the Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of L.K. Advani has done a hundred-and-eighty-degree turn on the deal and on what Indias relationship should be with the United States of America. Mr Advani is clearly more keen to topple the United Progressive Alliance government than to pursue Indias national interests. He obviously thinks that the educated people of India, who are concerned with the deal and with nuclear power, have very short memories, and therefore can be easily fooled. Without going into the merits and demerits of the deal, it is undeniable that it was a BJP government, of which Mr Advani was the second most important member, that took the dramatic step of declaring to the world that India was a nuclear power. Mr Advani and the rest of the saffron ilk had then hailed this as a great achievement that boosted Indias national pride and patriotic morale. The decision to go nuclear was also the beginning of Indias isolation in many important international fora and the stopping of uranium supplies to Indias reactors. The present deal takes the logical step of winning India recognition and resuming supplies. Yet the most vocal critics of the deal, other than the Left parties, are Mr Advani and the BJP. While the Lefts opposition is driven by blind ideological prejudice, that of the BJP is incomprehensible.        
	The only explanation that sounds feasible is that of sour grapes. This deal would have been perfect had the BJP negotiated it and signed it. Unfortunately for the party, this is not the case. As a poor loser, what the BJP is seeking to do is to bring down the UPA government. For this, it is willing to sacrifice its platform of patriotism and national interests. Mr Advani is willing to live with the label, unpatriotic, provided it brings him a few moments of parliamentary glory. Reports suggest that his position is not without its critics within the BJP. They feel that the deal should not be opposed and nor is this a convenient time to topple the UPA government. But this debate within the BJP is of little relevance to the public image of the party. And that image, thanks to Mr Advani and those who sail with him, is being tarnished. Mr Advani has actually fooled no one.

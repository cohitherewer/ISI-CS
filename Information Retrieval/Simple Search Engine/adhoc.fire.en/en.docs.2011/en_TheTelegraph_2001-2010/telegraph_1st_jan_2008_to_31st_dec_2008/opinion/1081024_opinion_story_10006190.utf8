	Marriage, morals and manners                
	That Long Silence (Penguin, Rs 200) by Shashi Deshpande has its protagonist, Jaya, entangled in various troubles. Midlife crisis, marital discord, hostility between her two teenage children and the professional uncertainty faced by Mohan, her husband, make for a claustrophobic setting. Life seems even gloomier for Jaya when Mohans authoritative behaviour brings back memories of domination by her chauvinist father. And to top it all, there is her failure to become an author. Writing about her experience as a woman  typecast as daughter, wife and mother in a bourgeois conservative fold  seems to be the only way to break out of the approved image of the silent and pliant woman. But Jaya is more used to the silence and is scared of writing, scared of failing. First published in 1988, this novel is unlikely to make feminists jump for joy. Not only does the heroine fail to break the patriarchal shackles, but she also oversees the death of her ambitions.                        
	The Sequel (Docsen, Rs 250) by Rahul Sen talks of the world of publishing and media with its attendant glamour and gloom. But a good subject may not always flower into a good work. The plot is not easy to follow and the intended narrative twists are too contrived. An aspiring Calcutta-based author, Sarat, has no takers for his work, while far away in England, a well-known novelist conceives of the same plot and wins several awards. While Sarat sues him for plagiarism, out of nowhere comes Ria, an Indian journalist. The author seems to think that publishing and media can be used interchangeably. Ria is abducted in Kosovo and falls in love with her captor, Fen, who plots another crime with the help of his lady love. The lurid mixture of the elements of romance and thriller, with implausible cross-cultural connections, sadly, leads to no convincing closure. Even more unfortunate is the tacky cover, with little hearts embossed on a frightfully hackneyed picture.                        
	Negotiating Glocalization: Views from Language, Literature and Culture Studies (Anthem, Rs 295) edited by Saugata Bhaduri presents a collection of scholarly essays on different aspects of experiencing the global and the local working in tandem. The focus shifts from the media to the use of New Media for uniting the local and the global, from Francophone literature in Quebec and Algeria to translation and its irresolvable problems. Some literary texts are reviewed from the glocal perspective, with proper notes and glosses. The bibliography at the end is useful.                        
	ABCs of Parenting (Jaico, Rs 175) by Gouri Dange offers a guideline for parents to manage their wards. The alphabetically arranged chapters take up issues that frequently cause furrows on parents foreheads. The problem here is that A for apologies has more or less the same advice to offer as Z for zombies and the rest of the chapters. And it provides no additional insight from what other, cheaper, books on the subject do.                                  
	Muslim portraits: Everyday lives in India (Yoda, Rs 250) edited by Mukulika Banerjee is a collection of anthropological essays exploring the lives of Indian Muslims whose religious identity somehow forces them under the same umbrella. The diversities in their professions, hobbies and customs, and the divergences in their views of life and the world do not fit the stereotypes imposed on them. Mohmedhusain, with his interests in tours, bird watching and anthropology, or Aisha with her mischievous sense of humour, or the gym-going Zamir form a lovely mosaic in which every micro-pattern has a delightful human story to tell.

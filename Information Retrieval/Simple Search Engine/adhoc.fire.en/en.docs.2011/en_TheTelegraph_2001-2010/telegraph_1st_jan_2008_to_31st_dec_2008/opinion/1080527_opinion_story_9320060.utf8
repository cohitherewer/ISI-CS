Singh                                                      
	India has been in the forefront of nations that have championed the cause of freer movement of people across nations. The recent Maharashtra Navnirman Sena offensive against north Indians  including Biharis  from Maharashtra strikes at the very root of the liberal, rational and humanist tradition that we represent.         
	I wonder what my teacher, Jagdish N. Bhagwati, the eminent economist who has championed the cause of nations without borders (the reality is that borders are beyond control, as he put it in one of his widely-read articles on migration), thinks about the current MNS agitation. Not that the MNS would have heard of him or would have cared. But the world does. And the world takes note of his perspective that governments attempting to stem migration (will) only be forced into retreat and accommodation by factors such as civil society activism and the politics of ethnicity... there must be a seismic shift in the way migration is addressed: governments must reorient their policies from attempting to curtail migration to coping and working with it to seek benefits for all.         
	Given Indias advocacy in global fora of freer movement of people, it is ironic that within our own borders we experience a competitive feud in a political family to propel the most evil form of sub-national xenophobia.         
	The Global Commission on International Migration, of which I was a member, recognized that States, societies, economies and cultures in different regions of the world are increasingly integrated and inter-dependent and that while migration poses multiple challenges, it also offers enormous opportunities. The commission evolved some core principles which are applicable to all migrant movements, nationally and internationally, driven by the quest to realise their potential, meet their needs, exercise their human rights and fulfil their aspirations but in a manner which strengthens social cohesion through an integration process. They must respect their legal obligations and benefit from a mutual process of adaptation that accommodates cultural diversity and fosters social cohesion.              
	In international migration, highly skilled workers leave developing countries in search of better opportunities in wealthier countries, while unskilled migrants try to cross borders looking for work. Inter-state migration within a country is a replication of a similar pattern. People migrate from poorer regions to destinations that promise opportunities. Inadequate employment opportunities, growing regional imbalances, poor governance holding little promise for the future are seen as the key factors spurring inter-state migrations to greener pastures. Demographic and growth differentials are crucial factors.        
	In India, according to the 2001 census, the number of inter-state migrants was 42.34 million, just 13.8 per cent of the total number of migrants, suggesting that a vastly greater number moves between cities, villages and districts within a state. The total number of migrants in Maharashtra from other states is over 7 million. The number of migrants from Maharashtra to other states is 2.16 million. And thankfully there is no threat to them.        
	There are issues of politics, economics and, indeed, of ethics arising from the present controversy:        
	First, the concerns raised by the MNS are no different from the apprehensions expressed by developed countries  that migrants might usurp local jobs, upset the cultural ethos and cohesiveness of their society, cause a strain on civic amenities and infrastructure. However, successive studies have proved these fears to be grossly exaggerated. Migrants all over the world, and indeed in India, add value and create wealth for the sustenance of a competitive economic order. This is equally applicable to the more prosperous states like Punjab, Gujarat, Haryana, and Kerala. In fact, migrants move to destinations where they know there is a demand for their services. Indeed, large areas of activity in Maharashtra and elsewhere are dependent on the skills and endurance of migrant labour and many of these would become unviable if flows were curtailed. Market forces ensure equilibrium between demand and supply in matching skills with emerging demand. Policy planners, no doubt, need vision to expand and rejuvenate infrastructure, particularly in the planning of new cities and satellite configurations.        
	Second, the development impact of remittances by migrants, including unskilled workers, especially in poor states, supports the needs of poor families that are left behind. Thus, it eases pressure on the home state. Indeed, dispersal of social pressure and receipt of remitted money are acknowledged to be the two important positive effects of migration  whether international or national and inter-state. This is particularly so because migrants are either relatively affluent people driven by the urge to improve the quality of life or extremely poor people seeking a modest livelihood. Therefore, catalysing remittances for capital-creating assets constitutes an opportunity for states from which migrants originate. Globally, remittances are believed to constitute one of the largest flows of funds from rich to poor countries, dwarfing official development assistance. Recent studies by the World Bank estimate such annual flows to be around 26 to 30 billion dollars through official channels alone, which is less than half of what comes through the informal route.         
	Third, investment in human resources, especially vocational training and skill upgradation, will improve the wages and remittances of migrant workers. Imaginative arrangements with large corporate organizations, both public and private, will be mutually beneficial. For instance, if a substantial part of the workforce in the new Reliance Jamnagar refinery is from Bihar, then training them in Bihar will reduce cost and improve productivity. Mainstreaming corporate needs into the national planning process is central to managing migration in a non-contentious way.        
	Fourth, considering that intensive urbanization has scarcely begun in India, the complexities of relocating large numbers of people seeking alternative livelihoods outside agriculture need an innovative policy matrix. States need to forge a greater social and political compact for responding to the challenges of the greater interchange of people through shared mutuality of benefits between states of origin and states of destination.               
	The truth is that even if the endemic development deficits of demographically dense states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are substantially bridged, migration will remain a reality. In a large country like ours, it will be driven by wide variations in growth, demographic differentials, perceived opportunities, differences in quality of governance, and above all, the constant urge to improve lifestyle. Again, in the evocative phrase of Bhagwati, it is a door that will not close.        
	Studies on migration in recent years have correctly diagnosed that the resentment and rejection of immigrants or migrants is rooted in misplaced fear and frustration in the tardy improvement in their life quality. Allaying their apprehension, creating greater awareness of the multiple advantage, the creation of value and wealth by migrant workers, sustaining activity patterns which otherwise would become uncompetitive, can create a new social compact. This requires attitudinal change beyond short-term and partisan electoral politics. Both the destination states and the Central government have a constitutional and moral obligations to do so.        
	Short-term sub-national xenophobia has no place in our ethos, Constitution and development imperatives. Managing sensible migration while allaying misplaced fears is the way forward. The rights of the migrants have to be protected. The positive elements of migration must be recognized. Optimizing multiple opportunities while mitigating the risks in a spirit of creative accommodation will be in everybodys interest.

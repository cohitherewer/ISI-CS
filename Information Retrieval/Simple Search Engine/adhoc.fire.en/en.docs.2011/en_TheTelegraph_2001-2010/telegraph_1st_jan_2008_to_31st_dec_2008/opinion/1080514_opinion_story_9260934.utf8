	It was bound to happen. Even in the best-run households there are disagreements, and I have one with the Telegraphs very own style book.        
	Ill admit at once that in such case it is always the chief subeditor and the style book that win and the recalcitrant writer who loses. As he should. We journos are ephemeral; a newspaper may be a daily (which in ancient Greek was represented, as it happens, by words very close to ephemeral) but it is an institution that hopes to last for centuries. And in any case, a newspaper office around midnight is no place for discussing whether the first e in moveable is, after all, removable or not.        
	So a style book there must be, to dictate, say, how certain words are to be spelt (or should I write spelled?). Are verbs to end in -ise or -ize, for example? There is excellent authority for both. Are book titles to be in italics? Films too? Ships? When do you use single quotation marks and when double? How do you write out dates?         
	All these are matters of choice. But that choice has to be made for everyone, and in advance. Hence the style book. I put one together myself when I ran the English-language edition of a Paris monthly, and Id have jumped on any subordinate who chose in its print to show that he thought he knew better  even if, in my heart, I had suspected that arguably he did. And Id have been right: style books are there to end arguments before they start.                 
	Time for revision        
	So back to my disagreement. I write the 1970s, and the Telegraph turns this into the Seventies. Its perfectly entitled to, and its version is wholly intelligible. Yet what does it print if I write the 1870s? Answer: the 1870s. Wouldnt it be more logical, says I, to have a style that is consistent from one century to the next? And when will the 20th century be far enough behind us for the 1970s to be so named, in figures, like the 1870s, the 1770s and all the other Seventies before them?         
	Yet my would-be logic too has its own feet of clay. What does one mean by the early 1800s? The years from 1800 to, say, 1803, or those from 1800 to maybe 1830: the early years of that centurys first decade or of the century itself? I reckon the former, and Id use the early 19th century if I meant 1800-30. But there are plenty of people who disagree.        
	I can see their point if we go back a few centuries. If I write that something happened in the 1400s, do I really mean strictly between 1400 and 1410? Well, er, um. Or come right up to today: is the present decade to be called the 2000s? And if so, how do we pronounce it: the two thousands or, bizarrely, the twenty hundreds? There are problems with both.        
	How convenient, then, that some ingenious fellow has invented the Noughties for the decade we are now in. But that brings my problem with the style book back again. If the book says put the Seventies, not the 1970s, so be it. But will some eager-beaver young Telegraph subeditor push the books rules right to their logical conclusion and use the Noughties in place of the 1900s?        
	Perhaps it is just as well that even a newspaper based in once-united Bengal does not too often have to rake over the events of a century ago.

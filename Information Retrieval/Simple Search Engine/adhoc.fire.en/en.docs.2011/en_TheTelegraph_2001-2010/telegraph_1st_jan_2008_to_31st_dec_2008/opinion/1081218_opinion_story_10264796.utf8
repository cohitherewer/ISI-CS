	Fear and haste are not the best conditions for the production of laws. Yet the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill, 2008 and the National Investigation Agency Bill, which were presented to the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, bore the signs of both fear and haste. The immediate context of the bills was the terror attack on Mumbai, and the glaring gaps in Indias intelligence system that came to light in the post mortem of the strike on Mumbai. While there can be no questioning the governments motives behind introducing the bills, some of the features pose fundamental problems. The entire edifice of the Indian judicial system and therefore of Indian jurisprudence, such as it is, rests on the Anglo-Saxon system and procedures. One of the fundamental assumptions in that system is that a person is innocent till proven guilty. Indian law has proceeded on this premise. Yet the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill reverses this. It says that the onus of innocence will rest on the accused who will be presumed to be guilty. No adequate reasons, save expediency, have been cited for this reversal, a radical departure that rests very uneasily within the existing philosophical principles underpinning Indian jurisprudence and the procedures that flow from it.        
	The two bills grow out of the atmosphere of global terror that has been created by the rise of militant Islamic fundamentalism. The latter, as is evident from its operations, aims at killing innocent people to grab maximum attention. It goes without saying that this is a dangerous development but there are no grounds for concluding that this turn to violence within a section of the followers of Islam is a permanent feature within Islam. The contrary conclusion is, in fact, more justified: this is a passing phase that needs stricter, but temporary, counter measures. The new bill on the prevention of unlawful activities, however, does not have any temporal dimension. It would have been realistic perhaps to say that the bill would come up for review after five years or so when a new assessment could be made of the threat perception.        
	The giving of extraordinary powers to the police is invariably a double-edged sword in a democracy. While circumstances often justify the creation of these special powers for the police, the powers are always open to abuse. What is important is that the amendment to the bill for the prevention of unlawful activities has been tabled with the proposal to create a federal agency for intelligence gathering and investigation. Prevention of terrorist attacks is much more important than counter terror. The government has rightly adopted a two-pronged approach, but the art of intelligence gathering may be scuppered by an over-enthusiastic police force armed with special powers.

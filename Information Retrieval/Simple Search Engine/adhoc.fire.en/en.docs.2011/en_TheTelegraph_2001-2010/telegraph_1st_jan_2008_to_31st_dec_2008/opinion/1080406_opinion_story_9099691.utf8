	 Bloomers or not, My Country My Life has catapulted LK Advani to the centre of public attention in a way even his rath would not have managed. The significance of this feat in a crucial election year was not lost on the Congress. There are plans afoot to cross pens with the saffronites. And who could wield a mightier pen than (hold your breath)... Pranabda? The Congresswallahs are obviously no fools to think of the contest in terms of pitting literary skills of one against that of another. After all, literary excellence is not why Advanis 900-page tome is doing the rounds with such speed. What matters is the weight of experience, and who has it in the Congress camp more than Pranab Mukherjee? He can lay claims to being the original financial wizard, and given that he has worked for both the Mrs Gandhis, the tale he has lived to tell can be more fascinating than the dour account of Advani. But now that the Congress has more or less made its mind up about the writer, the next big question that is worrying heads is who will write the foreword to Pranabdas memoir. Manmohan Singh? Sonia Gandhi?... Last heard, they were thinking about Prakash Karat, known for his measured words and sharpness. Do they suppose Pranabdas account will lack either?          
	 The Congress continues to play footsie with the Samajwadi Party. But the Congress high command is still unwilling to admit it. At a recent party conclave of the UP unit in Kanpur, the AICC secretary, Digvijay Singh, was hauled up by no less than the party president for taking the liberty to mention that the Congress had no problems joining hands with the Samajwadi Party. But that Mulayam Singh Yadav is being seen as a viable option to checkmate the Dalit queen is evident from the fact that the CBI has not gone ahead with investigations into the disproportionate assets case against Mulayam, nor has it accepted the plea to probe the Noida land allotment scandal during the time of the Samajwadi Party. An alliance with Mulayam will help the Congress regain a foothold in UP and salvage Rahul babas face. It will also allow the party to clip Mayavatis wings outside UP. Now if only Madam Sonia would deign to call a spade a spade.                            
	 Kamal Nath had a great fall in Betul while campaigning for the parliamentary by-elections. The dais suddenly gave way under the collective weight of the luminaries. Nath came out unscathed, but his soothsayers pronounced it as a bad omen. Taking the cue, Nath is supposed to have changed plans. If the high command permits it, he will quit the cabinet, re-enter state politics and take on the assembly polls in November. The announcement has taken the wind off the sails of the MP state unit president, Suresh Pachouri, who is said to be eyeing the chief ministers chair with some intent.                             
	 Green fuel alone does not ensure a smooth drive. Prominent lawyers in Delhi are now so disgusted by the early morning traffic chaos that they have changed their schedules so that they no longer have to miss the first cases in the morning. One even checked into a five-star hotel in the vicinity of the court on a semi-permanent basis. Now that the honourable judges of the Delhi high court too have voiced their protests against the traffic congestion, the government is suddenly sitting upright. The registrar of the high court is supposed to have written to the Union home secretary, pleading for pilot cars for judges. And there is every chance the request will be honoured. The problem is that more red lights will only make matters worse for lesser mortals.                             
	 Does the Delhi and Mumbai police need a department of wardrobe security to monitor fashion shows? The recent Lakme Fashion Week saw Czech model, Fiona Moravec, trying desperately to cover her derrire when her skirt slipped down on the ramp. For many, it was a sequel to the wardrobe malfunction at the earlier Delhi Fashion Week. Fionas designer, by the way, has promised to get to the bottom of the matter.

	 The Union minister for culture, Ambika Soni, seems to have burnt her bridges completely. Unable to get back to the circuit at 24 Akbar Road, she may end up as the Congress party chief of Punjab. The bed there may not be full of roses either. Rajindar Kaur Bhattal, who holds the dual post as chief of the state Congress committee and the Congress legislature party, has refused to quit. But the party is desperately looking for someone stronger to take on the Akalis. There are complaints against both Bhattal and Amarinder Singh, the former CM. While the latter is embroiled in a controversy over his relationship with the Pakistani journalist, Aroosa Alam, Bhattal is under fire for her alleged proximity to the Akali CM, Parkash Singh Badal. Soni is not happy with the party plan to push her into the wilderness of regional politics. She had been eyeing the I amp;B ministry. Now she may have to make do with a chief ministership, and that too if she is lucky.

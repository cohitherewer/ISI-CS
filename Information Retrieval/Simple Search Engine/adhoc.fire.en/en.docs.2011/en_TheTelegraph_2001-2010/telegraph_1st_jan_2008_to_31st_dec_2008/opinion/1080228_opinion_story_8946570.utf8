The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Time for rich pickings
                                                                                                                 TIME FOR RICH PICKINGS                                  Cricket can survive hiccups such as the Indian Premier League and its lure of money, writes Raju Mukherji                          Price war                                  
	Many cricket lovers are concerned about the commercial onslaught on the modern game. They fear that certain innovations, such as the Indian Premier League, would threaten the games culture, its ethos, ambience and spirit. Over the years, cricket has undergone many revolutionary transitions but it has, so far, managed to adapt to the new trends. But what if the trends become contrary to the spirit of cricket? Would the game then be able to survive and retain its character?         
	The only consolation seems to be that the games foundation has been strong enough to withstand every kind of threat. Sponsorship is nothing new to cricket. It began with Spiers amp; Pond sponsoring the English teams first ever visit to Australia. Neither did match-fixing begin with Mohammad Azharuddin. It could be traced back to the middle of the 19th century in England. The game has also survived players revolt (Australia, 1912), bodyline series (1932-33), one-day internationals (1971), Kerry Packers World Series Cricket (1977), racism (in South Africa before 1991) and sundry other problems. But these were mere hiccups. The actual game and the real worth of the players were not affected.         
	The only novelty about the IPL is the idea of auctioning cricketers. Never before have cricketers come under the hammer. This throws up many questions: where are the funds coming from? Would the investors get back their money? What were the yardsticks used to measure the worth of players? Why did Ricky Ponting fetch a lower price than, say, Suresh Raina?               
	These are, of course, the commercial aspects of the auction. But what about its human aspect? The young, millionaire players in the IPL may actually end up losing their focus. Further, would they still be interested in playing Tests and ODIs, in which the match-fees are only a fraction of what is being offered for the IPLs Twenty20 matches? Would the dressing room atmosphere remain congenial, considering the disparities in income?         
	Donald Bradman earned far more than his contemporaries. As did Sunil Gavaskar, W.G. Grace and Brian Lara. Keith Miller and Denis Compton were given more modelling assignments than their peers, not only because of their looks but because of their cricketing skills as well. No one minds when the truly deserving reap rewards. But if undeserving cricketers are given more importance than worthy candidates, then the games fabric would be torn asunder. Is Murali Karthick, for example, a better bowler than Glenn McGrath? Or is Piyush Chawla really worth any amount in a Twenty20 fixture?         
	Overseas cricketers playing for clubs and private teams is nothing new to cricket either. The trend began in Lancashire years ago, and the practice still continues. Most of the worlds top cricketers have, at some point, been overseas players  Learie Constantine, Frank Worrell, Vinoo Mankad, Cecil Pepper, to name just a few, would congregate in the Northern leagues during the English summer. Players would even travel overseas, representing private clubs. Don Bradman had visited America and Canada with Arthur Maileys team.         
	Cricket, however, underwent a vigorous transformation with the arrival of Kerry Packer who was the first to flood the players pockets with money. He was genuinely innovative. His marketing men copied the limited over format from the English championships, but added day-night matches, coloured clothes, white balls, and field restrictions. He offered cash incentives for performance, in addition to hefty contract amounts for international stars. He did cause quite a flutter at the time but, god bless him, did not violate the games ethics. Packer had the courage to commercially exploit the popularity of cricket. At the same time, he wanted to improve the players financial status. Packers great contribution to the game is that he made cricket attractive to spectators.         
	At a time when conventional cricket is under siege with speculators, auctioneers and agents handling the show, the men who have made cricket a game of art and skill seem to have receded into the background. With crickets popularity on the rise, it is now the right time to pay homage to those magnificent men.         
	K.S. Ranjitsinhji gifted the cricketing world with the subtlety of the flick that sent deliveries racing to the square-leg fence. W.G. Grace had installed the basic tenets of batsmanship by the 1890s. At a time when most batsmen preferred to grope forward or play back from the crease, Grace showed the usefulness of the back and across while playing on the backfoot. Bart King, the American fast bowler, was the first to bowl dipping in-swingers while Fred Spofforth is credited with developing the break-back at a scorching pace. Bernard Bosanquet, a leg spinner, bamboozled batsmen in the 20th century with his discovery, the googly.               
	Another modest performer who has left his imprint in the game is Hanson Carter, an Australian wicketkeeper. He was the first keeper to squat low unlike his contemporaries who would only crouch as slip fieldsmen still do. Carter had also pioneered a stroke which has become popular in cricket only recently. He was the first to scoop a ball over the wicketkeeper and the leg slip. Today even Sachin Tendulkar has found the scoop to be highly profitable, especially in the one-dayers.         
	Among the first to hit the reverse sweep was probably Pakistans Mushtaq Mohammed. India s Mushtaq Ali was the pioneer in hitting the ball towards the square-leg region with the front leg raised. Colin Cowdrey is generally credited with hitting the first paddle sweep, while Alan Knott was the first to use smaller wicketkeeping pads. Mike Brearley was the first to use the skull cap, while Dennis Amiss was the first to wear the helmet. Another man who deserves mention in this context is the West Indian batsman, Rohan Kanhai. Kanhai introduced the falling hook or falling sweep. He would sweep or hook while falling backward! After completing the stroke, Kanhai would be lying on his back and the ball would be sailing beyond the boundary.         
	The power of commercialization notwithstanding, the contribution of these magnificent cricketers would not be lost from the annals of cricket. This is simply because no commercial venture is strong enough to erase the art and craft of the great game of cricket.

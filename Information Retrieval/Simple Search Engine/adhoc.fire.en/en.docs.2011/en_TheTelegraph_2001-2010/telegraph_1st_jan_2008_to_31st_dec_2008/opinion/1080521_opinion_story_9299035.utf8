The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Taking on Nargis   by coming together
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Taking on Nargis   by coming together                              A proposed law hopes to lessen human misery in a natural calamity. Shibani Chattopadhyay reports on a campaign by the International Federation of Red Cross and the Red Crescent Society on disaster relief                                                       Myanmar cyclone victims clamour for relief           
	Three weeks after a tropical cyclone hit Myanmar, the images are still vivid. Swirling waters, displaced people, houses that collapsed like matchboxes, uprooted trees and long queues in relief camps  this was the haunting aftermath of cyclone Nargis. The world had hardly got over the calamity when a massive earthquake hit the Sichuan area of China.         
	If a group of international bodies has its way, natural disasters may not lead to such misery. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) are campaigning for a draft law that would lead to easier, faster and better relief for calamity victims.         
	The International Disaster Response Law (available at www.ifrc.org) or IDRL calls for drastic steps to co-ordinate disaster relief. What nations have right now, the international groups argue, are clearly not enough. IFRC hopes that sovereign countries will overcome national differences to make this draft law a legal treaty with more teeth.         
	In November 2007, the Red Cross unanimously adopted a set of guidelines that nations could follow to facilitate and regulate international disaster relief. These guidelines are recommendations to governments on preparing disaster laws to overcome common problems that come in the way of international relief operations.         
	These advise them as to the minimal quality standards that should be insisted upon in humanitarian assistance and the kind of legal facilities aid providers need for working effectively, says David Fisher, architect of this draft and senior legal research officer, International Committee of the Red Cross, Geneva, Switzerland. These guidelines are not legally binding on governments though they are based on existing international law tenets.         
	Entry of trained personnel in disaster-struck zones is a commonly encountered problem. And the main reason is the difficulty in obtaining visas / work permits. This draft plans to solve this issue by opening communication channels between nation states and having a separate channel for processing these entry documents.         
	Another common irritant is irrelevant or inappropriate assistance that does not respond to the needs of disaster affected people or their cultural traditions. After the 2004 tsunami, for instance, truck loads of clothes reached Tamil Nadu from the West  but these were outfits that the people of the state would never wear. Aid, experts point out, cannot undervalue local knowledge and capacities.         
	The draft hopes to reduce such instances by having guidelines for relief operations that reduce cultural misunderstandings.         
	Expired goods, untrained and unqualified personnel and religious advocacy for refusing aid are other major issues. These will be reduced by the draft laws stress on quality check for goods and accountability.         
	But its important to see how this draft law can be implemented. A careful study of the draft will reveal how prepared nations are for the next tsunami  or cyclone Nargis.         
	By following the guidelines governments can become better prepared to handle legal problems in international disaster relief. This will lead to quicker entry of relief goods, equipment and personnel, coordination of relief activities and improved monitoring of the quality of relief, says Fisher.         
	The present system of international relief has serious problems. For one, the frequency of disasters has increased over the last few decades. But, more important, nations reaction to disasters and relief has been poor, resulting in massive loss of human lives and property. Stressing on local capacity-building will mean more civil society participation, which will reduce the burden on international agencies.         
	There are two issues which are important in the event of a disaster, says Bhagirath Behera, assistant professor, department of humanities and social sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. One aspect, he says, is mobilising resources, and the second is distributing the resources to victims.         
	Experts stress that when a disaster occurs, what is most important is the speed with which relief is delivered.         
	Most governments still leave all the details of regulating international disaster relief to the last minute. And with the increasing complexity of cross-border relief and the growing number of organisations involved, this is not going to be tenable over the long term, notes IFRC deputy secretary general Ibrahim Osman.         
	Despite the lofty ideas in the draft  especially on issues such as co-operation, co-ordination and movement of aid and displaced people  it is riddled with loopholes. For instance, there is a need to identify the administrative, legal and financial policies that can assist in speeding up relief. Wherever needed, the policies have to be amended if they are seen to lead to delay.         
	There is another problem  and that is known as free riding, an economic concept that means you dont want to pay for a service, but want to avail of it. This is an issue that the draft does not look at. At the international level, there have been numerous occasions of countries unwilling to contribute resources voluntarily. This reluctance on the part of the richer nations was seen in the aftermath of the tsunami.         
	The UN had to make several requests to donor countries to contribute. This is a typical free-rider problem that international aid agencies face, says Behera.         
	Relief should also deal with healthcare regulation, many experts feel. For example, diarrhoea control, maternal and child health, nutrition and water purification need to be emphasised upon after a disaster, says Raja Tarafdar, a Calcutta High Court advocate who deals with environmental law.   
	What is of concern is the future of the draft law. The guidelines are only an expression of the international consensus on how governments should prepare their domestic laws for the legal issues in international disaster assistance but the long-term aim is to make it legally binding. That of course is a long shot since the first hurdle is to get all the nation states to sign the treaty.  
	In fact, the first ominous sounds have come from India. Experts feel that India is wary about international regulations on disasters, and would rather go it alone. Also, as a rapidly developing nation, it wants to be seen as an aid giver rather than an aid seeker. India, for instance, offered aid to the US when hurricane Katrina hit parts of that country in 2005.         
	Fisher points out that the IFRC is planning to initiate 10 pilot projects with interested governments and National Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies over the next two years to help them identify the areas where improvements can be made in their national laws.         
	Another niggling question, says environmental economics expert Thomas Sterner, is how the framework would stand up to the disasters of the future  notably those caused by climate change.         
	They risk being much more long run  almost permanent rather than the typical short-run episodic disaster as typified by a storm or an earthquake, says Sterner, president of the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists and professor of environmental economics, University of Gothenburg, Sweden. For example, when the sea level rises, more and more states will see parts of their territory inundated, he says.         
	Clearly, problems are still to be ironed out in the murky world of international disaster relief law. But the draft law is at least a reminder that a united effort by all nations is required to beat Natures fury.

	Bengali theatre celebrates the birth centenary of Buddhadeva Bose, who would have turned 100 on November 30 this year, with two productions of little-known plays by him, Kalsandhya (by Bohurupee), and Nepathya Natak (Theatron). Not only do they enable us to glimpse hidden aspects of Boses dramatic creativity, they also surprise us with greater relevance than his more famous works.         
	The bigger eye-opener is the almost un-Bosean domestic realism of Nepathya Natak (picture), in which an elderly poet and his wife (once a freedom fighter), living in a small town going through unstated turmoil in the 1970s, long to see their son and daughter-in-law. Instead, a visiting young couple enter their home unannounced, initially receive cool treatment from them, but win them over with warmth and charm. Asked about their antecedents, however, they give contradictory information. Meanwhile, the tense town erupts in violence after an incident involving a group of strangers. The situation pressures the elders to ask the scared youngsters to leave.         
	Their betrayal of the surrogate children, perceived as a vague threat of the unknown, exposes the sad phenomenon of distrust in the modern world, the unwillingness to help others for the fear of getting embroiled in unwanted complications. As directed by ensemble, Nepathya Natak gains an uncanny sheen of the eerie and surreal that overhangs the immediate context of loneliness within and insecurity without, which we can relate to even more today.        
	Kalsandhya, on the other hand, represents the typical Bose verse-drama set in classical myth, in this case the extinction of Krishnas clan in the Mausala Parva of the Mahabharat. Yet it is not rated as highly as his others based on the epic, justifiably perhaps, for he deviated substantially: Boses Krishna relates to Satyabhama and Subhadra how the Yadavas annihilated one another, then meets Arjuna, who comes to Dwaraka. (In the original, Krishna dies soon after the Yadava massacre, and his father tells Arjuna what happened.) Although Boses models, the Greek tragedians, also altered their sources, the changes in Kalsandhya do not add value. The dialogue among Krishna, his wife and sister sounds forced and, worse, Arjunas amnesia about Krishnas Gita advice quite unbelievable. Fortunately, Bose kept the strikingly metapoetic ending where Arjuna goes to Vyasa for explanation.         
	Kumar Roys directorial insertion at the start, of slides illustrating wars throughout history, seems too explicit an elucidation of the Mahabharats doomsday scenario. But the actors in both productions leave a strong impact  Theatrons by their naturalistic credibility, and Bohurupees by persevering with Sombhu Mitras tradition of poetic articulation, though Amiya Haldars manner turns Arjuna into a bit of a namby-pamby.

	Terror unlimited                  
	Sir  Now that the involvement of the Inter-Services Intelligence has been suspected in the serial blasts that ripped apart Ahmedabad and Bangalore over two consecutive days, it seems that Pakistan is bent on not sustaining neighbourly relations with India (Terror taint tells on Pakistan, August 3). The bombs found in Surat which were fortunately defused show the extent to which the terror trail was spread with the help of some cool calculation. It seems diplomacy would never become a viable option for Pakistan, which consistently endorses violence on defenceless civilians to achieve its nefarious ends.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

                
	Sir  As long as India fails to settle its many points of contention with Pakistan, our cities will continue to be at the receiving end of brutal terror attacks. The period of lull that generally comes after a major blast is nothing but a strategic retreat for the perpetrators of mindless violence. They simply lie low for a few days to plot the next attack. During this lean phase, Indian intelligence and security forces too seem to become temporarily inactive, only stirring themselves into action by the time it is already too late. Trade relations or diplomatic tours with suspect neighbours should be suspended immediately until the complete cessation of terrorism.           
	Yours faithfully,      
U.S. Bhattacharya, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Given the frequency of terror attacks and the number of lives that are lost, more severe anti-terror laws are called for. When the Prevention of Terrorism Act was introduced, there was a great hue and cry against this piece of legislation. Under the present circumstances, it is the glaring absence of anti-terror laws such as Pota that has made India more vulnerable to militant strikes. To counter something as monstrous as terrorism, draconian laws are the only answer.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Samriddhi Sharma, Kankinara

                
	Sir  Serials blasts in two major cities on consecutive days have shown that Indias security agencies cannot afford to lower their guard at any point. It is easy to make post-facto analyses of terror attacks, but it is mightily difficult to prevent these from taking place. Since the twin blasts in Bangalore and Ahmedabad made the police more vigilant, the danger was averted in Surat. What India needs is fool-proof security even when the situation is normal. Public places  hospitals, railway stations, and airports in particular  must be scrupulously checked for any breach of security. It is also futile to carry out ethnic profiling in the aftermath of an attack. Instead of pointing fingers at a particular religious community, impartial enquiries should be carried out so that the guilty can be punished.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Farzana Nigar, Ranchi 

                
	Sir  The repeated incidents of serial blasts indicate that the state and Central intelligence agencies are not doing their job at all. Perhaps intelligence networks need to be widened and experts brought in to head our premier security bodies. The Centre should get intelligence officers trained by the Scotland Yard or the MI5, which have the know-how and means to get to the terrorists before the latter get to ordinary citizens.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Anil Kumar Choudhury, Kalyani

                
	Sir  The nation had been put on high alert after the blasts in Bangalore. So how could the blasts in Ahmedabad take place the very next day without as much as an inkling to the police and intelligence officials? The United Progressive Alliance government as well as the Bharatiya Janata Party- led government in Gujarat must try to find the answers to these questions. If the involvement of any foreign power is proved, India should not hesitate to take a firm stand.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
B.C. Bhowmick, Asansol 

                
	Sir  Despite repeated attacks, intelligence bureaus and the administration seem to be clueless about how to combat terrorism. We are tired of hearing the droning ministerial comments, combining the customary strong language with false promises of redemption. The people of India know very well that the government is too timid to take decisive actions against real culprits. The innocent such as Afzal Guru, against whom no evidence has been garnered, continues to languish on the death row instead. The judiciary has earned a reputation for delayed justice. Perhaps special courts should be created to deal with those accused of abetting the cause of terrorism. That way, quicker and more effective decisions can be taken at a short notice.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

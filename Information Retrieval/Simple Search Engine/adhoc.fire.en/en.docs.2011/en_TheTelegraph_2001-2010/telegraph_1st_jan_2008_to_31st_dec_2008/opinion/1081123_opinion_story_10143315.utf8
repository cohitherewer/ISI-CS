	Arjun Singhs ministry of human resource development is about to come up with a complicated set of dos and donts for international schools in India. Mr Singh loves to do these things; but if he had wanted to be spared the trouble, then the easiest way to enforce them all without the Centre having to lift a finger would be to persuade these schools to move to Maharashtra, and especially to Mumbai. Who better than Raj Thackeray and his merry men to make sure that no international school has a foreign principal, that all such schools promote Indian culture, and they do not hire more than 20 per cent of their staff from abroad? These are only three of the long list of rules for Indian schools that are affiliated to international boards, but they give a sense of the direction in which Mr Singhs ministry is moving.         
	The zeal with which this ministry meddles with every level of institutionalized education in the country would have been quite comic, had this enthusiasm for regulation been directed at a sphere less important than education. But the Centres attitude to international schools betrays something worse than a passion for control. It amounts to nothing but a knee-jerk xenophobia that would probably invoke the bogey of neo-colonialism to justify itself if cornered. Such racist restrictions look particularly ridiculous today when globalization is freeing up the traffic in every kind of skill, especially within what might be called the republic of letters and learning that has begun to make national boundaries look archaic. If an Indian is honoured with a distinguished academic post anywhere abroad (and there are, and will continue to be, innumerable examples of this), will Mr Singh do anything other than congratulate himself? Conversely, if Amartya Sen had been barred from being Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, because he is not British, then would this not have been condemned as the worst kind of racism by Mr Singh and his peers in the government? There is also a kind of (equally archaic) socialism working behind such a set of attitudes that perceives international schools as elitist, and therefore takes particular pleasure in imposing controls upon them. Nobody can dispute the absolute unacceptability of different scales of pay for Indian and foreign teachers in the same school. But the matter can be regulated within the existing laws of the land without the HRD ministry taking upon itself the task of framing special rules to ensure such justice.        
	The job of the State is to facilitate education and make sure that various institutions  schools, colleges, universities and other centres of excellence  are allowed to work out and sustain their own benchmarks of merit. Anything more than such minimalism ends up looking absurd and even, as in this case, offensive.

	There is one principle from which the government of West Bengal cannot bear to deviate: never address a problem while there is time. The result, when things come to a head, is high comic drama, even if the comedy is of the darker sort. The sudden roar of Bengals transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, that all auto-rickshaws have to be using liquefied petroleum gas as fuel by December 31 has caused consternation and confusion. He and his department have remained untouched by the horrifying indicators of pollution in Calcutta; studies showing that vehicular emissions cause 65 per cent of air pollution have left them sleeping the sleep of the innocent. Even then, a few optimists had expected some response to the Calcutta High Court directive in July to phase out all auto-rickshaws running on petrol by December. Mr Chakraborty, however, retained his Olympian calm till, perhaps, the possibility of contempt of court galvanized him into fearsome speech. Can it be possible he means to do something?        
	Controlling vehicular emissions and making vehicles change over to cleaner fuels take time, money, and planning, but both can be done. Delhis change-over to compressed natural gas was neither smooth nor painless, but after almost eight years of struggle and resistance, phased planning and political will had their way. For many years, Calcutta has seen emission checking centres with machinery and personnel, and has heard rolling speeches about the administrations drives to reduce pollution. Things have simply got worse. Now that the high court has come into the picture, there is a sudden promise of action three months into the time-frame.         
	Mr Chakraborty has been equally thunderous about wiping out illegally plying auto-rickshaws. He and his department do not have a clue to the number of these on the road, either because they are habitually ignorant or because they do not wish to know. Three thousand such autos have been ground to dust, the minister has said. He has evidently spared the others for reasons inaccessible to the uninitiated. He would have persisted in his calm had the high court not given its direction. Now that he has burst out in righteousness, he will probably also pull out of his hat not the predictable rabbit but an adequate number of pumps to supply LPG to at least the legal auto-rickshaws, and a solution to the problem of the cost of change-over in fuel. The Rs 2 crore from the Centre intended to begin the change-over in February does not seem to have been used. Or mentioned. Nothing has been done for years, or even in the last three months. Pollution has grown unchecked because nobody is bothered. Mr Chakraborty may be roaring to distract attention. Or he may have decided to let the poor Calcuttan have a whiff of clean air. For Bengals transport minister nothing is impossible.

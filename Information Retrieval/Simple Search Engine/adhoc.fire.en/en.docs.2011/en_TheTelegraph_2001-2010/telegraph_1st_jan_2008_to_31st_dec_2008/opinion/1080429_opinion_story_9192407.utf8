The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A city above pretence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A CITY ABOVE PRETENCE                                  An exhibition of photographs of the Chitpur area makes Somak Ghoshal ponder again the divide between North and South Calcutta                                              
	It was not until my late-teens that I first learnt about the existence of Chitpur Road. Born and brought up in the South, anything north of Esplanade was North Calcutta for me. There the streets had no names. Rather, the lanes and alleys were all held together in a rag-tag jumble called the North: crumbling buildings breathed down each others necks along narrow by-lanes, the roads were dug up most of the time (this was in the Eighties and the Metro was being extended up to Dum Dum), and the traffic frightfully chaotic. But there was always a quaint edge to the air. In the North, the sun shone sharper, the wind blew more ragged, the days were filled with an intensity that I seldom felt in the comfortably numb South.         
	Somehow, in spite of the allure of the Unknown North, or perhaps for that reason itself, I could never quite imagine living there. The houses seemed too grand, too archaic, too historical to be inhabited. There were splendid old buildings around Bhowanipore, where I had grown up, but those in the North somehow seemed unhomely  too disturbingly beyond the pale of familiarity. Like many of my friends who lived in South Calcutta, I grew up with a patchy vision of North Calcutta, satisfied with the annual tour of the area during the Pujas. For the rest of the year, we were all blissfully distant from the place.        
	Nearly twenty years later, as I look back on my wondrous fascination with the North, I am reminded of Freuds notion of the uncanny, a word that also resonates with my childhood memory of unhomeliness. (Freuds term, das Unheimliche, literally translates as the unhomely.) For me the uncanny lay in the peculiar eeriness of North Calcutta, in its ability to defamiliarize my perception of the familiar. It was not as if I had never seen a grand faade in the area where I lived. But somehow a stately house on Harish Mukherjee Road was less intriguing than a similar one on Shovabazar Street. In North Calcutta the mundane became mysterious. This charm was singularly lacking in the peaceable South. The romantic fascination with the other half of the city has been fostered, over the years, by the images I have looked at in photographs, in the unforgettable city films of Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak or Mrinal Sen made in the Sixties and the Seventies.              
	But even in the innocent Eighties, although the two Calcuttas existed as separate entities, they were not without common points of reference. The strangeness of the North had not led to its total apartness from my half of the city. The economic liberalization of the Nineties, followed by the bounties of globalization, has deepened the North-South divide and severed the city into mutually aloof halves. The South, with its shopping malls, multiplexes and towering apartment blocks, looks dazzlingly brilliant, reinventing and updating itself every other day. While the North, its neglected grandeur steadily reduced to ruins, remains snuggled in a time warp.        
	This difference between the two halves is sharply evident from the current exhibition of photographs, Calcutta: Chitpur Road and Neighbourhoods, at CIMA gallery, on display till May 3. These images were taken in November 2006 by 21 students from the University of Arts Bremen, who worked on the Kolkata Heritage Photo Project under Pieter Biaolobrzeski. The collection includes some magnificent street photos (M.G. Road, Sovabazar, Beniatola Lane, Colootola crossing) alongside details of legendary structures (Putul Bari, Khelat Ghosher Bari, Tagore Palace, the Butto Kristo Paul Medicine House). Many of the images brought me face to face with these hidden spaces for the first time.        
	For me, a visit to the show meant engaging with the images not at an exclusively aesthetic level, being moved not so much by their technical acumen as by what they depict. I processed these images first as pure visuals, noted the difference of these images from what had surrounded me, even moments ago, as I had walked up to the gallery along Ballygunge Phari. I did not have to figure out the differences intellectually, through reasoned analysis. The spectacle of daily life, its disintegrating texture in the photographs, set it apart from my life in the South, and signalled how the common points of reference between the two Calcuttas have faded. I, too, had grown up among ancient buildings in the other part of the city. But those houses of my boyhood have been turned into state-of-the-art highrises. When I looked at the Chitpur images, and followed the looking with a visit to the places in reality, the images came to me filtered through the vestiges of my memories of South Calcutta of the Eighties, now morphing itself beyond recognition. The novelty was not just in the fact of this recollection, but also in my recognition of the past as irredeemably past and in experiencing it as absolutely discontinuous from the present.         
	Undoubtedly, there are possible variations of my intensely personal reaction, each validated by its own history of remembered images. What, for instance, would be the reaction of a person living on Chitpur Road for years to these images? Perhaps not as nostalgic, or tinged with reminiscence, as mine has been. It is unreasonable to expect, say, a shopkeeper on Colootola crossing to be struck by the vivid photograph of the place in the same way as the person who lives on the top floor of South City. Each of the many Calcuttas that lie sprawled across the city carries its distinct and inherently private code of meaning.               
	Yet, some images do remain, and become associated with the visual archive of a city. There is a suggestion of this persistence of memory in the teasingly audacious title of the show. For years now, Chitpur and its neighbourhoods have provided, and by now standardized, the iconography of Old Calcutta. These areas have survived the wear and tear of colonial modernity, followed it up with an anxious, though incomplete, transition to postcolonial modernity, and, in the process, transformed themselves into something rich and strange. At present they exist as virtual ghettos, with just the patina of modernity on them. While the South has determinedly attempted to beautify itself, struggled to scrub off the film of poverty from itself, the North remains unabashedly, abjectly dismal.        
	The North has held on to its own form of visual hygiene. This is not the squeaky clean hygiene of shopping malls, but a deeper, spiritual hygiene of remaining alert to reality. For the developing South, the project of becoming modern has not been about alleviating poverty, but rather about keeping poverty apart from itself by confining the poor and the ugly to obscure corners so that they might not contaminate the sanctity of civic life. The unruly North, on the other hand, has taken the full measure of this frayed modernity in its avoidance of a scripted path of development. Calcutta is earnestly schizophrenic in the way its two halves have turned away from each other. Despite its new sheen, it remains, as Kipling said famously, a city above pretence.

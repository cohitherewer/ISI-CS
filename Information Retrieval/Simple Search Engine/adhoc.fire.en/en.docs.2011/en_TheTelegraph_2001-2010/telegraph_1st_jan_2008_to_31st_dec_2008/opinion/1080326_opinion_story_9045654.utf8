	Precious time lost                  
	Sir  It has taken nine years for a Delhi court to deliver its verdict on the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case (Guilty, but demeanour top cops, March 20). After Bhatnagar was killed in 1999, there was incriminating evidence to nail the culprit, R.K. Sharma, then a high-profile official with the PMO. But what transpired later was unbelievable. In the course of the trial, about 51 witnesses turned hostile, and the case dragged on interminably. After Nitish Katara and Jessica Lal, this case has once again exposed the lacunae in the Indian judicial system. Presumably, witnesses are still coerced  either by threat or by the lure of money  and hearings continue to be postponed on flimsy grounds. The long-winding judicial procedure ends up punishing victims and their families instead of the guilty.           
	Yours faithfully,        Md Ziyaullah Khan,Pune              
	Sir  It is evident from the photograph of R.K. Sharma that he has been well looked after in custody. Like most high-profile convicts, Sharma, dressed in a fashionable T-shirt, looks healthy, relaxed and unconcerned. One wonders what other privileges he has been enjoying so far. It is unfortunate that VIP treatment, at the taxpayers expense, has bestowed on him an air of absolute confidence. He has been behaving as if he knows that the life term would not be carried out eventually.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Bitter parting          
	Sir  Taslima Nasreen has been sensible in going away from India (Other freedoms, March 23). She never came to terms with the basic norms of being a guest in this country. Having received asylum, she seemed to assume that she would get her way all the time, even if her ways might appear to be unacceptable. India tried to be as accommodating as possible, but there is little point in becoming a doormat for the sake of preserving the secular image. Secularism assumes that the religious sentiments of any community would not be hurt intentionally. Taslima has not only failed to honour this code of conduct, but has also behaved ungraciously by putting all the blame on India.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Goa

                
	Sir  It is not difficult to see why Taslima Nasreen should feel bitter. Ever since her arrival in India she has been at the receiving end of the fundamentalists ire. The virtual house arrest in Delhi for last few months served as the proverbial last straw. She has now threatened to expose the secular, democratic character of India as a sham. There is more than a grain of truth in her claim. First, Bengal succumbed to Muslim fundamentalism and removed Taslima to Delhi, and the Centres treatment of her did not help matters. The liberal image of India will take a beating if Taslima carries out her threat.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Asit Kumar Bhattacharya, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Bangladeshi writer, Taslima Nasreen, is ungrateful to the host nation which tried to keep her safe and happy for so long. Had she been sensible and kept her best interests in mind, she would probably have continued to live in Delhi. However, she was adamant to return to Calcutta, where the minority community had turned against her for her anti-Islam comments. But even in a democracy nobody has the absolute right to free speech. The right to freedom of expression cannot be used as the freedom to abuse others.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Thanks to Pranab Mukherjees cowardice and the pussyfooting of his Left allies, Taslima Nasreen has been hounded out of India. This incident makes us ponder the nefarious structures of coalition politics in contemporary India. The episode makes obvious how both the Congress and the Left are desperate to grab minority votes.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

                
	Sir  Taslima Nasreen was forced to leave Calcutta in the wake of fundamentalist violence last year, and now the Centre has subtly, but effectively, pressured her into leaving India. This was clearly done to appease sections of the minority community. But can a state like India be run on such a policy of appeasement? We have a Constitution and an independent judiciary to decide on controversial issues. Instead of keeping faith in the system of redress why should politicians take upon themselves the power to decide such issues? Taslima should be urged to return to the country, apologized to and given her right to a safe and normal existence.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  For a huge country like India, Taslima Nasreens presence or absence does not make much of a difference. Taslima has been able to draw much more public attention here than what she would have in the West. This was owing to the public sympathy for the writer. By badmouthing India, Taslima has shaken the trust that her readers had put in her judiciousness. India does not require a certificate of good conduct from the fugitive writer. She forgets that it was the proactive role of the intelligentsia, the love of the people and the support of the government that helped her establish herself as a freethinking writer.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Surajit Das, Calcutta

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       MAKE WAY FOR CHANGE                                  MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Delhi is dangerous to live in, to work in, to honestly and professionally operate in any manner, shape or form. Crime and corruption have reached their peak, nobody is accountable, assaults are commonplace, bribery rules and law enforcing agencies are either in cahoots with the law-breakers, or in denial. The lawlessness here is the most scary part of the Indian reality because Delhi symbolizes the rot and signals what is in store. The trickle-down effect has begun to show results in other urban centres.        
	Rape is commonplace; brutal murders are fearlessly described as honour killings conducted to protect some warped and mindless, regressive and despicable traditions; political alignments are done on the basis of big bucks passing hands in order to further appropriate institutions and parties; blackmail has replaced discourse, discussion and debate; dissension and disagreement is seen as disloyal and therefore damned; fresh thinking and energetic action is sabotaged by those who have betrayed and failed this nation; possible correctives are crippled by whisper campaigns and the spread of lies; irregular practices are condoned to maintain the status quo and India has been thrown into the worst ever turmoil since 1947.        
	Those men and women who have nurtured this horror seem to have perceived the beginnings of a rumble beneath the surface, a sense that the lawlessness they pardoned and let pass, has become a monster waiting to ravage them. In self-preservation, a revolt of the revolting public figures has begun. Threats from ageing but wily politicians have been flung about over the last few days. As they see their insular edifices being exposed and threatened, they scamper about like rats deserting the ship as it goes through a tortuous phase. They must be compelled to leave the ship. The more they go away, the better for the cleansing of a virtually terminal, contagious disease.                
	Exit time        
	Think of a scenario where the BSP embraces all the disgruntled men and women within the Congress, politicians who have failed to preserve civil society but have successfully destroyed dignity, who have not ensured the devolvement of goods and services that were meant for Indias progress, who have ruthlessly exploited the poverty and patience of millions of anonymous Indians  the Congress would have a chance to reinvent itself and become a powerful political party for the next generation. When Indira Gandhi split the Congress and broke ranks with the suffocating strongmen and whining elders of her time, she renewed hope and brought in another lot of young turks. Then at the Guwahati session of the Congress, Sanjay Gandhi resurrected the Youth Congress with all the oldies smarting with suppressed anger as they saw their days numbered. Another generation entered the fray. Rajiv Gandhi brought in another crop of leaders  Ashok Ghelot, Ahmed Patel, Ghulam Nabi Azad and others as his immediate coterie. Sonia Gandhi did not rock that boat.        
	Decades later, nearly a generation later, Rahul Gandhis silent but definite moves seem to be signalling change yet again and that has frightened the moribund lot who thought they were secure in the status quo. This lot, terrified of the possibility of having to lead an ordinary life, has seen the writing on the wall and begun to prepare for departure.        
	Encourage them to retire and go. Split the party, if that is what is needed to revive. Sit in the opposition benches. Restructure the party from the base. Attempt to win a decisive mandate in 2014. By then, hopefully, the satraps who do not deliver will have been exposed and ejected by a new generation of voters. Work towards restoring the Congress to the stature of a national party. Rule the federal polity from Delhi with regional parties ruling in the states. Help India rise out of the present mire.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the battle goes on
                                                                                                                 THE BATTLE GOES ON                                  MALA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The amazing and persistent campaign carried out by a TV channel in an effort to prevent the imminent death of the great Bengal tiger in India, by making people aware of the facts that have led to the destruction of the species as well as of our shared natural environment and habitat, can only make us proud that an arm of the media is pushing a humane cause to its limits.         
	Watching and hearing young kids express their concern, and many adults their anguish, at the unacceptable and unforgivable lethargy of prime ministers, chief ministers and administrators, towards working out a simple and straightforward set of laws and, more importantly, ensuring that the rules are enforced with honesty and integrity, was heartening, to say the least. We were no longer a small group of people who had raved and ranted over the years, warning through private and public interventions, and later, through direct confrontations with members of the ruling party. Today, more and more people from across this brutalized land have joined in this crusade and hopefully someone up there will see sense.        
	Here is a thought  if a handful of leaders can be protected by the SPG, why not a handful of tigers as well, by a TPG  tiger protection force  equally armed as the SPG happens to be? Let those special guards clear the forests of trespassers as they do the roads of Delhi for those men and women professing to rule India to allow for easy passage. Make the protection of the tiger a centrally-controlled subject instead of passing the buck and putting the blame on other ruling dispensations in the many states of India, and show that we are not some banana republic unable to enforce the law. Let the prime minister sign off on the campaign that reflects the failure of the State and its corrupt machineries, and pledge to change the course of the degradation of our forests, the flora and fauna, and of the eco-systems.                
	Nature care        
	Our philosophies and mythologies stem from respect and awe of animals, and the sacred forests are part of our ethos. As the pressure of a booming population, continuing to grow at a ridiculous pace, overwhelms India, wreaking havoc on the natural and man-made environment, to have a corrupt administration that reaps a harvest from this complete confusion of decision-making and action can only annihilate more than what meets the imagination. The curse of Durga and her vahana, the tiger, will rest squarely on inept and senseless governance. Govern they did, but dishonestly.        
	The government had been in denial for at least three years since the first feelers of the rampant killings had begun to come in. Tiger experts asked to meet the prime minister because of the urgency of having to deal immediately with the declining numbers and he, in turn, set up a Tiger Task Force. To save the tiger and its shrinking habitat, needs political will. No allocation of resource will be of use without the will to use it correctly, honestly and in a direct manner, where the tiger is of import, not babus and committees. To link forests and wildlife is no good since forest departments have taken on the avatar of being development agencies.        
	If the United Progressive Alliance government is serious about saving and nurturing the tiger, it needs to create a wildlife service administered by the Centre, remove all state interventions, establish a set of rigid rules, enforce the law  something that has, sadly, been forgotten in contemporary India.         
	Maybe Sonia Gandhi, carrying on in the tradition of Indira Gandhi, should restore what Mrs Gandhi understood well. Unlike her colleagues, then and now, she realized the need to protect our natural environment as well as the regeneration of a green India with its valuable natural treasures.

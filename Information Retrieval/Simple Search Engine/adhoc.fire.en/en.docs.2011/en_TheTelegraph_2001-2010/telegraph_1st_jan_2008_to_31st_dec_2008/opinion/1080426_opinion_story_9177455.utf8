	My father was a compulsive party-giver. Curiously enough, no sooner had he invited half-a-dozen people for drinks and dinner, he would start fretting and hope his guests would make their stay short and leave as soon as the meal was over. Once in a while, my mother, who did not have many friends, would invite her sisters and their husbands and other relatives. On those occasions, my father used to panic because the men were all teetotallers, their wives vegetarians, and preferred to sit apart from the men and talk in whispers. All of them also believed that politeness required them to keep silent. One thing my father could not stomach was a silent party. He insisted that my wife and I be present at these funerary gatherings. He would ring us up to remind us of our duty and check if we had left our home and were on our way to his residence. We would dutifully arrive a few minutes later. From the line of cars along the porch we could tell that the guests had arrived; from the silence that prevailed we could guess my father was having a hard time. My wife would announce our arrival by asking at the top of her voice, Kaun mar gaya  whos died? My mother would snap back: Maran saaday dushman  our enemies be dead! And the party suddenly came alive, my fathers worried scowl changed into a beaming smile. Hed shout at his life-long servant, Hariva, do whiskian  two Scotches. My wife would join the mens section with her drink in hand. I flirted with my ageing aunts as I sipped my Scotch. The evening passed off till everyone embraced everyone else or touched the elders knees in gestures of farewell. Shaking hands was disdained as Westernized bad manners. My father sighed with relief and helped himself to a digestive liquor to ensure a good nights sleep.        
	The moral of this long recounting of days past is that there are times when silence can be a bad manner, showing lack of breeding. One must cultivate the art of good conversation. There are a few rules which should be observed. The first is that you must not hog the conversation. If you do so, you deprive others from saying their bit, and you will be regarded as a talking bore. Second, and more important, is to avoid talking about yourself. People are not interested in your achievements or in your good opinion of yourself. Sheikh Saadi has a very telling couplet on the subject which is one of my favourites:                
	Sana-e-khud-bakhud quftan
  Na zebad mard-e-daana ra
  Choon zan pistan-e-khud maalad
  Kuja lazzat shaved baqi?                
	It does not behove a man of
  wisdom
  To use his tongue in praise of
  himself,
  What pleasure can a woman
  beget
  If she uses her own hands to rub
  her breast?                
	A not-so-subtle from of self-praise is name-dropping. However casually you say, Manmohan rang me up yesterday and asked me how I was doing. Or You know Gursharan sings Gurbani very well. Or Sonia was kind enough to send me greetings on my birthday. Or Amitabh, you know Amitabh? I have known him and Jaya since they were married  be sure your listeners will sense that you are a lying name-dropper trying to make yourself out to be a somebody.        
	I know a few other rules to be observed as I fancy myself to be a good conversationalist. There I go breaking my own rules and praising myself!                  
	One law for all          
	Many of my friends feed stray dogs. My next door neighbour, Reeta Devi, the couple who live on a floor above me, Bika and Hiranmay Karlekar, my niece, Veena Balwant Singh, and Parveen Talha of the UPSC, who lives down the road. They set out every evening with packets of cooked food for stray dogs who wait for them in packs wagging their tails in gratitude. I also know a few people who regard stray dogs as a menace and carry sticks in their hands in case any of the animals get too close. Stray-dog-haters are more vociferous than stray-dog-feeders. The former try to persuade the municipalities to catch and kill dogs without collars. This is inhuman and brutal, and against the law. The municipality is authorized to catch strays and neuter them, but not kill them. But a slug of lethal poison is the cheaper way of getting rid of them. Dog-lovers sentiments be damned!        
	What applies to humans should apply to animals. Although animals breed in larger numbers than humans, their life spans are shorter. We are trying to control the population- explosion by advising couples not to have more than two children, and to have nasbandi. The same should apply to dogs and cats: one litter, then full stop. Neutering by qualified vets should be made compulsory                
	Word games                
	Impetuous is our spinner, Habhajan,
  Whether he is in or out of form. Whenever he passes or gets a remark
  He is in the eye of storm.
  The Aussies accused him of being
  racist,
  But the judge rejected their
  accusation
  He might have said something in
  his native tongue,
  Still it did not amount to
  denigration!
  Now Hayden has regretted his
  remark
  I shall not have called Bhajji an
  obnoxious weed.
  My choice of words added fuel to the
  fire,
  I am sorry, Bhajji, I am sorry,
  indeed.

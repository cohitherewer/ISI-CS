										                        Padatik Dance Centre presented         its annual programme at Swabhumi on January 20. The show, featuring solo and group compositions by talented members of the organization, commenced with the traditional Guruvandana based on teentaal. The performance was choreographed by Souvik Chakraborty and the young dancers put up a memorable show. It was followed by a solo presentation by Sohini Ganguli who proved her command over taala in her repertoire based on sixteen beats.   
	Mahamaya, a group composition performed by Ayantika, Debjaya, Ritaprava, Tiyash, Anandita, Adrija, Namrata and Sweety, was thoroughly enjoyable as well. Aaheli Chakrabortys choreography impressed by its blend of Western-style movements with traditional Kathak. The duet by Kajari Majumdar and Surasree Bhattacharya, under the guidance of Sandeep Mullick, combined skill with vitality. Thaat, amad, tihai, tukra and paran  the typical components within a traditional kathak presentation  were performed with a degree of finesse. The programme ended with a refined dhrupad performance, which was choreographed by Madhumita Roy.

	On January 7, Bhowanipur Baikali Association presented Tagores musical, Phalguni, at Madhusudan Mancha. It was an accomplished performance, with some fine individual contributions. Young Tamojit Das evoked the restlessness of the South Wind well in his singing. Udit Basu gave a spirited performance as Chandrahas. Even the lesser characters, such as Majhi, Dada, and Kotal elicited excellent performances.         
	Aniruddha Ghoshal (Sasha) was a good choice for Baul, particularly since the role had a song like Tomay notun kore pabo bole written into it. But actor Sasha was simply not as good as singer Sasha. Monojit Saha as Sheet (and later Basanta) deserves mention for his expressions. Some of the choral numbers suffered for lack of synchronization, while some solo songs were affected by the shortcomings of the sound system. The instrumentalists maintained a perfect balance with the singing.         
	Both Pramita Mallick as music director and Tapan Mallick as the director of the play (he also turned up in the role of Sardar) can be said to have emerged with flying colours. The next time, though, they could think of experimenting with a symbolic rather than realistic stage decor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Another kind of deal
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ANOTHER KIND OF DEAL                          - The American interest in Karnataka will be good for the BJP        Diplomacy - K.P. NAYAR                                                    
	It should not come as a surprise to anyone that for some Americans, the poll results in Karnataka are of greater interest than elections in some of their own states, for example, in North Dakota or in Wyoming. Nor did it come as a surprise that The New York Times on Thursday published a feature  complete with photographs and graphics  on the new airport in Bangalore ahead of its opening last weekend. The Times website even featured a slide show with as many as 14 slides of the new airport and its opportunities or problems. It is not often that in the insular United States of America, one of its prestigious newspapers would publish a feature about an airport opening some half way round the globe. But Karnataka is different. Anything that happens in Bangalore is of immense interest to a cross section of Americans.        
	The reason is obvious. The Times story speaks for itself. The new airport, no matter how modern it was intended to be, seems destined to be the latest repository of Indias astonishing inability to plan for its future and fix its sagging infrastructure, wrote the author of the feature story. The way things stand now, the trip to the new airport, 21 miles outside town, will easily take 90 minutes from the city centre, and even longer from the software companies that have turned Bangalore, also known as Bengaluru, into Indias own Silicon Valley. In 2005, Thomas Friedman elevated Bangalore into a subject of curious interest to many Americans with his best-seller, The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century. In this book, Friedman narrated the story of his own journey to the south Indian city where he discovered a new meaning of globalization.              
	The Times noted in its feature on Thursday that adding to the confusion, the state (Karnataka) has been in the grip of political squabbling for many months. Corporate America has a stake in Bangalore, which, in a sense, is its laboratory for experiments in investing in India. Corporate America is now hoping that the formation of a stable government in Karnataka that supports growth will augur well for Indo-US economic relations. The expectation that the Bharatiya Janata Party will bring a much-hoped-for stability in Karnataka after the months-long Deve Gowda farce in Bangalore is not the only reason for hope in the US over the states election results. In India, where one committed individual holding the levers of power can make a difference in delivering on promises, corporate America has immense faith in Karnatakas chief secretary, Sudhakar Rao. They have dealt with Rao before, when he was the point man for India in the US on economic relations between Washington and New Delhi.        
	On a tenure that lasted longer than the usual three years for an Indian official posted to Washington, Rao, an IAS officer from Karnataka, in fact, laid the foundations on which the current architecture of Indo-US economic engagement has been created. For many years, the post that Rao filled in Washington was merely an opening for a Union minister or a cabinet secretary in India to dispense patronage within the Indian Administrative Service.        
	While Rao has been an exception, such is the scramble for what the IAS lobby sees as a comfortable posting in Washington that there have been occasions in the history of this post when ministers doling out favours could not agree on a candidate. As a result, the job had remained vacant in the past for as long as a year.        
	It is to the credit of the finance minister, P. Chidambaram, that he recognized the importance of the job of the minister, economic affairs, at the Indian embassy in Washington. He picked Anoop Mishra, an IAS officer from Uttar Pradesh, who had not only worked in the cabinet secretariat, the ministries of commerce, petroleum and finance, but also handled some of the trickiest negotiations involving both corporate America and the American government in which the vice-president, Dick Cheney, is on record as having taken a personal interest. The results have been there to see in the last three years.        
	American interest in Karnataka did not start with the era of the so-called Next Steps in Strategic Partnership between the two countries or the Indo-US nuclear deal. The Americans expressed interest in setting up a consulate in Bangalore during the prime ministership of P.V. Narasimha Rao, who gingerly began a post-Cold-War opening to Washington. But the ministry of external affairs and the agencies under the Union home ministry as well as the cabinet secretariat threw a minor fit. Using the argument that the Russians had been allowed to have a presence in Thiruvananthapuram for a very long time, the Americans continued to press their case with both the South and the North Blocks. Today, there is a unique institution in Bangalore called the American Corner, which is a partnership of the US consulate general in Chennai with the American Information Resource Center and the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in Bangalore. In addition, the US Commercial Service for India headed by a minister counsellor  Mishras US counterpart  at the American embassy in New Delhi has a thriving office in Bangalore.              
	When the US was recently permitted by South Block to open a new consulate in India, the choice for the state department was between Bangalore and Hyderabad. It was decided to pick Hyderabad, largely because of an internal argument in Washington that the Deccan city was home to an Iranian consulate and that it was in Americas longer-term strategic interest to counter Iranian Shia influence there and handle any Islamic spillover into the rest of south India. When Bill Clintons celebrated trip to India was being planned in 2000, there was similar rivalry between Bangalore and Hyderabad for hosting the then president. Andhra Pradesh won out because its then chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu, had a fan following in the US administration and he had created a reputation abroad as a reformer and a modernizer. Despite Bangalores image as Indias Silicon Valley, Karnataka has failed to throw up leadership that could catch the imagination of Americans who want to do business with India.        
	A brief exception was S.M. Krishna. This columnist was once witness to an exchange in the US where one of Krishnas well-wishers told him that he had no future in the Congress with its dynastic politics where sycophancy was the most valued political asset. The well-wisher joked that in such an atmosphere Krishna was a misfit because he was once a Fulbright scholar at George Washington University. If only he was half bright, he might have done better in his party, Krishna was told then.        
	If the new BJP government could make a decisive break with this unflattering shortcoming in Karnatakas past, it will find a willing partner in the US at a time when there is an urge across America to prove that Indo-US relations are not based on a single-point agenda built around the star-crossed nuclear deal. In looking abroad, B.S. Yeddyurappa could learn a thing or two from fellow BJP chief minister, Narendra Modi of Gujarat, who has proved exceptionally successful in steering his states external affairs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Dreary spring
                                                                                                                 DREARY SPRING                                                    
	It may be spring but the Calcutta art scene shows no sign of rejuvenation. Arts 39 (March 7-16), an exhibition featuring some wellknown artists at the Academy of Fine Arts, proved the point. Paritosh Sen, whose works were also on display, was felicitated there. It is futile trying to make a mention, even in passing, of all the participants, but one was taken aback to see the painting, if it can be called so, by the filmmaker Goutam Ghosh. Dabbling with colours does not amount to painting. Strange that this should have been included at all. Bina Pradhans paintings of huge faces with chiselled features and exposed breasts looked more like posters.         
	Breast-exposure was mandatory, and Tarak Garai did just that in his large painting of a group of women. Alok Bhattacharya was back after some time. A graceful jungle man and dreamscape with soft colours were all that he presented. Shyamkanu Borthakurs sculpture of the goat with a beard had clean lines and was the picture of simplicity. Suvankar Maitras small pastel-on-paper hillscapes were skilfully executed. His larger paintings did not show such finesse. Gopinath Roys star-studded Milky Way was a sensitive and compact piece of sculpture. The rest was eminently forgettable.

	Other colours        
	Dimensions amp; Directions at Mon Art Gallerie (till March 31) brings together works by 22 artists from Orissa. Apart from the regional specificity, there is little else in the exhibition suggesting a thematic continuity. Evidently, these images arise out of certain shared concerns, particularly with environmental hazards. The spectacularly garish installation by Biswaranjan Kar makes us aware of the dangers faced by the Olive Ridley turtles. Noble intentions mostly give rise to earnest propaganda and seldom produce anything worthy of art. Rajibalochan Panis Yellow Rain, though marginally better, is affected by a blinding literalism. Likewise, one might wonder if the inane sculptures by Lalat Kishore Pradhan mean anything beyond what they resemble. The spectre of 9/11, in the form of minuscule aeroplanes, haunts Debarchan Routs twin compositions. Along with Rout, Jagannath Mohapatra, Pratul Dash and Satyabhama Majhi should be noted for their skilled draughtsmanship as also for their delicately distorted perspectives. The watercolours by Alok Bal are, by far, the finest and most sophisticated. Haunted by a stark minimalism, these inscrutable images startle the viewers with their reticence, and not with the excess so typical of the other works.        
	S.G.

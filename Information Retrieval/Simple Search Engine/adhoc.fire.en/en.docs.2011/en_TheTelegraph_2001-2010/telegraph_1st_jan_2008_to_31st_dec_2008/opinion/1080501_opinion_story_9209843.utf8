	Gordon Brown is probably the least popular prime minister in Britains modern history. Like many other people  people from the minority who like him and the majority who dont  I feel sorry for him; and when electorates feel pity for a leader, that leader needs to worry. Brown looks utterly miserable in his job. Throughout the Blair years, he struggled and intrigued to make sure he was Tony Blairs only successor and now, barely a year after his succession, the longed-for prize turns to dust and ashes. Brown was advertised  advertised himself  as the most successful chancellor of the exchequer since World War II, but it turns out that the great achievements of his decade at the helm of the British economy are no more securely founded than those of his predecessors. An end to Thatcherite boom and bust was his boast, but now, after ten years of boom, Britain is teetering on the abyss of recession. The truth is that the ups and downs of the globalized economy lie beyond the reach of any governments influence, and the long boom owed much more to cheap credit and consumer spending than the prudence (a favourite Brown word) of his financial management. But a man who steals the glory must also take the blame. Hardly a day passes without some new political crisis staring him in his clouded face.        
	I dont know how he manages to sleep at night, a woman said to me at dinner the other night. He must take pills, surely? How can you sleep knowing that youre making such a pigs ear of the job you wanted for so long? That every morning youre going to wake up to still more people being rude about you in the papers?               
	Any prime minister who lasts long enough in the job develops armour-plating against personal abuse  from the media, from voters, from the parliamentary opposition. Thatcher was latterly abused for her egoistic convictions, Blair for the self-righteousness and showmanship that sent the British army into Iraq. But Brown suffers from a more wounding critique: that in his personality there is something more disabling than mere vanity, a quality which in any case must be a prerequisite for anyone with political ambition. Ten years ago, Blairs PR man, Alastair Campbell, said that Brown was psychologically flawed and nobody has ever forgotten the remark. What he meant (at least as others have glossed it) was that Brown was too thin-skinned, too slow on his feet, too sullen, too cautious, too fearful ever to sell himself successfully to the public, especially when compared to Blair, the consummate actor who strode about smiling and was everybodys friend. Before Brown got the job, Frank Field, a former Labour minister, said that allowing Gordon Brown into No 10 would be like letting Mrs Rochester out of the attic. Readers of Jane Eyre may enjoy the comparison. To me a closer one comes from Shakespeare. Brown is Hamlet to Blairs Prince Hal. What you see in his eyes is worry, inexpertly disguised by a meaningless smile that his media advisors have taught him to practise in the belief that on television he can be made to look more reassuringly normal.         
	Recently Lord (Meghnad) Desai said the cruellest thing. According to the economics professor who once sat on the Labour benches in the House of Lords, Gordon Brown was put on Earth to remind people how good Tony Blair was. Lord Desai, professor emeritus at the London School of Economics, may be better known in India as the biographer of Dilip Kumar, but what most people know him for in both countries is his astonishing hairstyle, a silvery cloud in which a flock of crows could hide. Its hard to know how an academic from Baroda could come to look like this. Who was the inspiration? Einstein? Sai Baba? Jimi Hendrix? The bewigged courtesans of Louis XVI? A quicker-witted man than Brown might have replied, And Lord Desai was put on earth to make Marie Antoinette look bashful or to show us what Hendrix would have looked like aged a hundred. But Brown isnt a man for banter. Lord Desais comment remains yet another ember stoking the fires of the prime ministers brooding resentment.               
	*************        
	My own theory is that Brown is crippled by the old Scottish disease of self-consciousness. We come from the same part of the world (the county of Fife), went to the same kind of state schools, and grew up in similar atmospheres. Last year, I went to interview him in his Fife house and discovered it was one Id delivered newspapers to as a newspaper-boy fifty years before. In private, hes likeable: informal, ungrand, the smile more believable. The inside of his house suggested that its owners had next to no interest in dcor or fashion. I cant remember a single thing in it apart from lots of plastic toys for their two children and a photograph of a dead Scottish footballer. Brown (and Mrs Brown), unlike Blair (and Mrs Blair), doesnt seem to care about making money or taking free holidays in villas owned by dubious potentates such as Silvio Berlusconi. Blair said of himself that he was a pretty straight kinda guy, but with Brown you could almost believe it might be true, at least a year go, before he grew curlier with office.         
	Then the photographer arrived. Over a long career in politics, Brown must have had his picture taken many, many times; appeared in many TV studios; had face powder applied in many make-up rooms; squinted into fierce lights; read from autocues; adjusted his head to suit a cameramans demands  all the things that go with political celebrity. In other words, a photographer in his house to take a few snaps for The Guardian should have given him no trouble at all. But I could see that Brown hated it, and not because he did it so often but because the act of posing  Could you look to the right? Could we have your jacket off for this shot?  made him deeply uncomfortable. Many of us are the same, but most of us dont aspire to be prime ministers. Blair, by contrast, loved to act  like his model Clinton, or Bush even, he loved showing off a version of himself. The strange thing is that it doesnt seem to have occurred to Brown that he desperately wanted a job that a part of him would loathe, and that he would therefore be rather bad at (or vice versa, bad at and therefore loathe).               
	How long will he last? The London media is filled with reports of panicking Labour MPs wanting to ditch him before the electorate chuck them out at the next election, but there is obvious replacement waiting in the wings and an election neednt be called until 2010. Thanks mainly to the Iraq War and the ruthless suppression of any policy that implied socialism, however vaguely, the Labour Party has imploded in its old heartlands of northern England, Wales and Scotland. In southern England, the Tories are resurgent. Scotland and Wales have fallen to the nationalist parties. Property prices everywhere threaten to slump by 20 per cent over the next two years. Britons may be quite irrationally attached to soaring house prices as an indicator of social well-being, but in the face of all this you would need to be a considerable optimist to see Brown reviving and winning a second term.               
	*************              
	Still, look at the Tory opposition. Can it really be that 40 per cent of the English electorate will vote for them? What you need to imagine is an Indian government where a third of the cabinet went to Doon School, the other two thirds went to Mayo, La Martiniere or North Point, and all of them attended St Stephens College. This very roughly is the Tory party shadow cabinet transposed to an Indian context. Not since the days of Harold Macmillan fifty years ago have so many senior Tories been old Etonians who later studied at Oxbridge. They are young men (not many women) from a narrow and extremely privileged crust of English society that most of us thought had lost its political clout around the same time as the Brahmins of Tamil Nadu. Not so. If you believe recent opinion polls, their leader, David Cameron, is likely to be the next prime minister. Hes very smooth and rather fetching and has copied Blairs persona just as Blair copied Mrs Thatchers policies. Ideology? You must be joking. All we know is that Cameron rides a bike and thinks global warming is a bad thing, prating that Something Must Be Done. His knack is to look decisive and happy. On such small tricks of personality do British elections now turn, unhappily for Gordon Brown.

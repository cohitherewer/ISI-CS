                                                                                                                 MEDIEVAL WAYS IN MODERN TIMES                                  This Above All - Khushwant Singh                          Peoples voice                                        
	On February 25, Muslim clerics gathered at the Darul Uloom in Deoband pronounced a fatwa condemning terrorism as un-Islamic. Four days later, a Muslim suicide-bomber blew himself up killing 38 other Muslims attending a tribal jirga funeral in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan. Two days later, yet another Muslim suicide-bomber blew himself up along with 40 other attending a post-funeral namaz of a slain notable. And on March 4, a series of blasts took another seven Muslim lives in the Lahore Cantonment.         
	No further evidence is necessary to prove that howsoever pious the intentions of the learned ulemas assembled in Deoband were, their fatwa fell on deaf ears. I am pretty certain that it will not have the slightest impact on incidents of terrorism.        
	We should know a little more about the seminary in Deoband. It was founded in 1866 by a mystic, Muhammed Abid of the Hanafi order. It was, and is, strictly a Sunni madrasah, excluding Shias from its fold. It disapproved of Sir Sayed Ahmeds Aligarh Muslim University and the latters attempt to westernize Indian Muslims. The seminarys outlook was, and is, not nationalist but pan-Islamic.         
	Its Pakistani offshoot opened up hundreds of madrasahs providing free shelter, food and Islamic education to orphans and the poor. They also inculcated a militant spirit among their students. The taliban are a by-product of these madrasahs. They showed their martial prowess in driving out the Soviet army from Afghanistan. They then extended their operations to what they conceived to be non-Muslim presence in Indian Kashmir and also against fellow Muslims in Pakistan, who, they believed, had been corrupted by un-Islamic modernism.        
	I have not been to Deoband but have read accounts of it by Indian and foreign journalists. It is an island of medieval bigotry in a fast-changing world. Teaching Arabic is given priority over teaching the sciences. All women are compelled to wear burqas. No man is allowed to talk to a woman who is not veiled from head to foot. There are no cinemas, watching TV is prohibited, photography condemned as un-Islamic. What can you expect from a child brought up in such an atmosphere except that he grows up to be a religious fanatic?         
	What is true about Deoband is equally true about Hindu and Sikh seminaries  all of them are hatcheries of religious intolerance. Their fatwas or hukumnamas dont have the slightest impact on the public. And it is only strong public disapproval that will put an end to the menace of religion-based terrorism.                
	Several versions of the truth                
	You must often wonder why every religion in the world is splintered into many factions. Christianity has three major branches  Catholics, Protestants and Greek Orthodox  all three are further broken into dozens of sub-divisions. Islam has two major sects  Sunnis and Shias  both of which have many sub-divisions. Buddhism has its Mahayana, Himayana, Zen and regional varieties. Hindus are split into innumerable castes and sub-castes. Even religions with smaller followings like Jainism and Sikhism are split. Jains have Digambars, Swetambars, and Sthanakvasi. Sikhs are divided into Kesadhari Khalsa and Sahajdhari as well as Nirankaris (two factions), Namdharis and Radhasoamis.        
	What is baffling is that factionalism exists despite the fact that all religions accept the existence of one god, have one founder-father, messenger or messiah, and one major religious text. Christians believe in one god, one messiah (Jesus Christ), and one book (Bible). Muslims believe in one Allah, His messenger, Muhammad, and one book, Quran. Buddhists and Jains avoid questions about the existence of god but recognize Gautama Buddha and Mahavira, respectively, as founders of their faiths. Hindus believe in the trinity  Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar. Vedas and Upanishads are their holy books. Sikhs believe in one Wahguru, consider Nanak to be the founder of their religion, and the Granth Sahib as their scripture. With these factors shared by all major religions, there should be no disputes between them. But there are. Why?        
	I put the problem to my niece-in-law who goes under the happy name of Happy. She is much into reading religious literature, and what she calls metaphysics. As it happened, she had put the same question to her religious mentor. His reply made good sense to me. He said: In a class of 20 students, there is only one teacher; he uses only one textbook for teaching. However, when he sets out questions for the annual exam, he gets 20 different answers to the same question.        
	Ekam sad bahuda vadanti: There is only one truth. There are many ways of expressing it.                
	Deaf wisdom                
	A friend who was known for his witticisms in his younger days is now very old and hard of hearing. He often gets spoken words wrong and his replies can be quite amusing. Some years ago I told him that Y.S. Ratra of the IAS had been appointed chief secretary of Punjab. He asked Why is the chief secretary going on a rathyatra?        
	More recently, I told him of the mess created by Buddhadeb Bhattacharya (which is usually spelt as Bhattacharjee), chief minister of Bengal, which lead to the agitations in Nandigram. What can you expect of a man whose name is Bhrashtacharya! he remarked.        
	When told Angela Merkel had been elected president of Germany, he asked, How can a great country like Germany elect a woman named after a tiny fish, mackerel?

                                                                                                                                    JUST MERIT
                          
	Merit, as the sole criterion for higher education, makes absolute demands. Any form of reservation becomes difficult to justify. So educational institutions that want to become centres of excellence need to rethink the whole business of quotas from first principles. It is reassuring to hear that the Left Front government in West Bengal is picking up the art of letting go. The Bengal Engineering and Science University at Shibpur is going to the Centre, and this promises a rehaul of this institution that is beyond the merely bureaucratic or political. Yet, one bit of the old mindset remains. Fifty per cent of the seats in the new Central institute will be reserved for students from Bengal. This is in keeping with all other such national institutes of technology, each of which reserves seats for students from the state in which it is located. Hence, effectively, the regional quota becomes yet another element of the reservationist compulsions that dilute and even hinder the pursuit of excellence in these institutions. Together with reservations for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, seats blocked for regional students are also a means of choking merit by the policies of the State. Central universities and medical colleges are already bound to reserve seats for students from the Northeast. Half of Besu having to be filled by Bengalis is going to tie the institute down even more, to the detriment of its commitment to academic excellence.
    
	This also qualifies the relief that one might feel at Besu passing out of the control of the Left Front government in Bengal. To move from being controlled by the state government to being controlled by the Centre cannot quite be described as a progress towards autonomy. In either case, the State  its policies and principles, and, therefore, its insecurities  retains its power to determine the running of the institution. And the basic problem of autonomy remains unresolved. Hanging on to the regional quota, not only at Besu but also at all other NITs, is another way of ensuring that a political, and not an academic, machinery retains its hold over these institutions. There is already a long history of quotas, defined by factors other than the regional, severely disrupting the work of premier institutions of higher education in the country. To make excellence truly national, and then global, such knee-jerk regionalism will have to go.

	Contested Lands By Sumantra Bose, 
  HarperCollins, Rs 395        
	A macabre sight is compulsory viewing for Turkish Cypriot children in Nicosia. School excursions take them to a house on Irfan Bey Street, where the blood-splattered bath and toilet with bullet holes are preserved in pristine condition. On a December night in 1963, a Turkish army officer, his wife and three small children were shot dead in the bathroom, their place of hiding, by armed Greek Cypriots.         
	The date and the event mark only one of the many highpoints in the four-decades-old ethno-national conflict between the two peoples inhabiting the speck-like island on the Mediterranean Sea. But if Turkish Cypriots take so much care in reminding generations of the unmitigated evil of Greek Cypriot domination, the other half of the islanders are just as particular about preserving their collective memory of Turkish Cypriot depredations to destroy their dream of union with Greece.         
	The museums, the recountings and individual experiences of animosities  everything that goes into forming a collective consciousness  reinforce the divides that are a function of history as well as of modern-day politics. And this function continues to shape lives, not only in Cypriot, but also in the four other contested lands that Sumantra Bose takes up for discussion  Sri Lanka, Bosnia, Kashmir and Israel-Palestine.         
	Boses reportage of his own visits to the troubled spots and his interviews with people  some orchestrating the violence, some its silent sufferers  make the account less impersonal than political science, but no less incisive. Bose reduces the readers distance from the happenings in distant shores, and makes obvious the urgent need to find permanent solutions.        
	Crucial to this process, Bose argues, is a pragmatist viewpoint on the part of the conflicting parties. The starting point is acceptance of the current geographical divides  the Green Line in Cyprus, the line of control in Kashmir, the separation of north and east Sri Lanka from the rest of the island or the division between Israel and Palestine  that have been forged by the long years of conflict. Having done so, the parties can look forward to establishing an institutional guarantee of a minimally equitable two-state solution that allows for self-rule, soft borders across geographical divides and the right of return of the displaced. The arrangement also has to be buttressed by federal and consociational structures as the bedrock of peace settlements, and followed up by transnational networks of cooperation for economic and strategic gains.         
	Bose himself acknowledges that this, particularly the first step of accepting the current geographical divides, is easier said than done. But that does not stop him from pressing for third-party intervention by showing how well it has worked in Bosnia, for a time in Sri Lanka, and even in Cyprus. Bose also notes that the United States of America is best qualified to fit the boots of the big brother who is needed to push through solutions and keep the parties from straying. He advocates a role for the US in Sri Lanka, Kashmir and even in Israel-Palestine where, Bose says, the USs position as an impartial peace-keeper has come under increasing scrutiny.         
	Despite his realistic appraisal of the situations in each of the sites of conflict, Boses unwavering faith in the moral virtues of Uncle Sam is unnerving. Either Bose is blind to the designs that guide US interventionism, or he is just trying to stoke up a controversy that usually, in this day and time, sells books well.

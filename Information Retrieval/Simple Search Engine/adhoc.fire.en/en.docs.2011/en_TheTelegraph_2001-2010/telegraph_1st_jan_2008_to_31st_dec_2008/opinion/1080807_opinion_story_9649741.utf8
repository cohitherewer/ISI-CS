	This is not the time for expats here to go home for a short break. Coming back to China during the next three weeks is bound to be a nightmare. One foreigner who lives in Guangdong was recently turned back because her passport was to expire in less than six months; anothers passport was taken inside by immigration officials for what seemed like eternity. Chinese immigration officials, unlike Indian ones, may be easy on the eyes but they rarely smile. For Indians, the normally smooth passage through immigration started becoming bumpy since March, soon after the riot in Lhasa. For the first time in his stay of six years in a small city miles away from Lhasa or Beijing, an Indian found himself stopped at immigration on his way out, and his luggage  a small bag and a backpack  checked. Thousands cross the border to the specially administered region of Macau from the mainland on weekends, encountering no inconvenience other than long queues.         
	Two months back, police started manning the crossing, keeping a watchful eye for anything suspicious. They found what they were looking for  an Indian youngster with a backpack. Having checked his passport, the cop began asking him questions when suddenly his expression changed  the youth had started replying in fluent Mandarin. He was waved through. Speaking Mandarin with the right tones has always melted the most stone-hearted official, not into bending the rules, but into giving you some breathing time to follow them.                 
	Friends and foes        
	However, its doubtful whether Olympic security can be so easily compromised; the above instance must have been an exception. Right now, its not just Indians who are stopped. Everyone travelling anywhere within China has their bags opened, and security extends beyond transit points. Walking streets in all cities, where people window shop, now have armed guards patrolling. A foreigner trying to park outside one such centre was asked to show his passport. Luckily for him, the Briton, owner of a popular bar, was carrying it that day.         
	Expats are chaffing at such restrictions, but what about the Chinese? Anyone looking Tibetan or Uyghur can be stopped on the street by the police. Hotels across the country have reportedly been told not to rent out rooms to these minorities. As for the residents of the glittering Olympic city  that is, those whove survived the continuous demolitions over the last five years, and the campaign against street vendors, migrants, beggars  Beijingers have been inundated with instructions. Theyve been told not only how to behave with foreigners, but also what not to wear on the street  no pyjamas, no bathroom slippers, no white socks on black shoes, and nothing in three colours. Old women should avoid high heels, youngsters should avoid displays of affection, and those wanting to enter an elevator should wait for those inside to leave first. The bureaucrat who framed the rules obviously knows his fellow country men and women.         
	Just a few months back, the average Chinese was confident that the Games would be safe. What worried them more was the economy after the Olympics were over. Today, post-Lhasa, in Shanghai, Kunming and now Xinjiang, few Chinese are as confident. But excitement is at its peak and on Friday, offices across the country will close at 4 pm to enable everyone to reach home well in time to watch the 8 pm opening ceremony on 08.08.08. The Birds Nest will be packed  this is said to be a rare sold-out Olympics, as was evident in the last-minute stampede for tickets last Friday in Beijing. Hong Kong journalists covering the stampede were pounced upon by the police. Ironically, that days edition of the Peoples Daily asked Chinese to be friends with the media.

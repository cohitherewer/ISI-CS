                 MIND THE GAP
   To survive in changed times, it may be necessary to sell tradition and protect memories 
                         
	Dilhar Kumari, once the Maharani of Panna, still remembers the day she first set foot in the former princely kingdom. The young princess from Bhavnagar, Saurashtra, was marrying into the royal family of Panna. Diyas had been lit in the havelis, and a grand feast planned. There was even a gun salute in the brides honour, as the guests, royals and other luminaries milled about the premises. Somewhere, Pannas national anthem was being sung too. For a moment, even Purana Panna  the majestic old fort  looked beautiful, as it stood in silence, bathed in the warm light. 
    
	Today, over four decades later, Panna has changed. There are plans to transform this busy Bundelkhand town into an important destination on Indias burgeoning tourist map. Not for nothing though. Situated close to Khajuraho, Panna is dotted with old kothis, palaces and temples, many of which belong to the royal family. Then there are the diamond mines nearby. The tourism ministry, aware of Pannas potential, has not sat idle. The roads have improved, and there is talk about a small airport coming up someday. There is a stillness in Pannas air now, as the dusty town waits for something to happen. 
    
	Pannas former Maharani is waiting too. The titles have gone. So have the privy purses. Many of the properties that once belonged to the royal family have been taken over by the State. A few others remain, and some are in ruins. But Dilhar Kumari, always a quick learner, has survived these changes, even accepted them as inevitable. Now, she waits, hoping that the government will declare Panna a heritage city. 
    
	This is the only way forward, she feels. Yet she and her family are not ready to part with their properties. They can never be sold, she knows. Instead, she hopes that private investors, hotel chains, as well as the government in the role of facilitator, will work together to preserve such heritage properties. They could be turned into museums, hotels, and other places of tourist attraction. The revenue generated could then be shared between the owners and entrepreneurs and used for further conservation. But there can be no sale, just a transfer, which, she would like to think, could be purely symbolic. 
    
	There is a caveat too, from the Maharanis side. The conservation of heritage sites can only be done by involving the members of the royal family. After all, one is dealing with a piece of history here. Commerce is a necessity, but, for some of the blue-blooded at least, it needs to be blended with, and not obliterate, tradition. 
    
	Dilhar Kumari is a great supporter of the concept of heritage loans, a business model which is already in place in Rajasthan. According to this, a royal family interested in maintaining its properties can obtain loans that are then paid back with the help of the money that is generated in the form of revenue. This, she believes, could work in Panna too.
    
	How does she feel about all kinds of people stepping in to have a glimpse of the most intimate spaces in her home? Once her household becomes heritage property, visitors to Panna would certainly be able to peep into her rooms. Dilhar Kumari is unperturbed. For, even in these changing times, she is assured of one thing. No one can quite intrude upon the memories of these places that she holds in a corner of her mind.

	Arpita Saha, a young Bharatnatyam dancer with a pleasing stage presence, made her debut at Sisir Mancha on February 29. Under the tutelage of Khagendra Nath Barman, Saha presented some of the traditional components of Bharatnatyam, starting from alarippu to tillana, with fervour and passion.         
	It is interesting to watch a debut performance that is lively and spontaneous. Dressed in a white-and-gold attire, Saha commenced her recital with todeya mangalam, a tribute to Rukmini Devi Arundale. Choreographed by Barman, this invocatory piece set the mood for the evening. Sabdam, based on raag ragamalika and taal mishrachapu, started as a pure dance form and went on to explore the sahitya of the song. Saha proved her mettle as a performer with her impeccable rhythm and her powers of expression in this presentation. The most interesting composition of the evening was varnam, based on raag devamanohari and taal adi, that depicted the protagonists pangs of separation.         
	The performance also featured songs composed tunefully by Barman rendered in Tamil and Bengali. Saha was accompanied by Himika Barman (nattubhangam), G. Suryanarayan (mridangam), S. Vishal (violin), B.V.S. Sharma (flute) and Barman (vocals).

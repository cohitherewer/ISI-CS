The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A morning of exquisite whims and fancies
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A MORNING OF EXQUISITE WHIMS AND FANCIES                              Somak Ghoshal      MUSIC                        Manas Chakraborty, 1991				                                               
	It was a privilege to listen to Manas Chakraborty present khayals in raga Alahiya Bilawal at a morning programme organized by Sangeet Ashram at G.D. Birla Sabhagar on May 18. Since most concerts these days do not begin before the latter half of the day, one seldom gets to hear the beautiful late-morning ragas of the Bilawal thaat. Chakrabortys sensitive rendition succeeded in drawing out the exquisite nuances of this vakra raga. The performance was prefaced with comments from the eminent sarod player, Buddhadev Dasgupta, who pointed out how Chakraborty has reinvented the gayaki of the Kotali gharana, handed down to him by his illustrious guru and father, Tarapada Chakraborty. Brief extracts from recordings of Gujri Todi and Chhaya-Hindol by the latter were played to bring out the essential features of this style.         
	Gifted with a sonorous voice like his father, Manas Chakrabortys singing combines vigorous masculinity with innate gracefulness. An acclaimed composer, poet, musicologist and teacher, his approach to music is multifarious  sensual, cerebral, playful, even dramatic. Every performance, for him, becomes an occasion for abhinaya, a theatre of many emotions, whims and fancies. The vilambit khayal in Alahiya Bilawal began with a traditional exposition, following the pakad of the raga. Languorous meends, intricate phrases, the gently alternating shuddh and undulated komal nishads came together to invoke the shringar rasa, a mood associated with this raga. Erotic pining and the pain of separation were beautifully embedded in the bandish itself  Zara thehro  composed by Chakraborty himself in the alias of Sadasant. As the slow movement matured, flashes of sapat taan, sargams and bol-bant were thrown in. There was a fine balance between the display of virtuosity and self-aware variation of themes and structures. The drut composition was feisty and enlivened by excellent accompaniment from Samar Saha on the tabla and Ranjan Mukhopadhyay on the harmonium.        
	Chakraborty continued with a madhyalaya jhaptaal khayal in Brindavani Sarang. Again, the double nishads returned, more emphatically this time, conjuring up a sublime grandeur. Using the rishab and pancham as fulcrum, Chakraborty made sly references to the dhaivat, introducing it with the utmost delicacy. There were breathlessly exciting games with tempo, building up the tension close to a climax and then letting it go all at once.        
	The final offering was a thumri in Piloo-Barwa, steeped in the kind of sentimental ardour eminently suited to Chakrabortys musical idiom. Using all the major and minor notes ingeniously, he cast a spell of yearning and piety. A short composition in Bengali (Kholo kholo mandir dwar) by Tarapada Chakraborty, based on Mishra Tilang, was sung as an encore. So rarely heard these days, this mystical piece was a fitting conclusion to an excellent programme.

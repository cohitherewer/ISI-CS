The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Trailed by historic blunders
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TRAILED BY HISTORIC BLUNDERS                                  MULTIPLE CHOICE      The CPI(M) can either be a Marxist or a parliamentary party                                                  
	Prakash Karat has purged the comrade out of Somnath Chatterjee. The purge revives the old question of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s relations with parliamentary democracy.         
	But Chatterjees expulsion also raises the question  has the speaker committed the crime of placing his position over that of his party?         
	Before him, Jyoti Basu, who skillfully defended parliamentary democracy as a system, sought and failed to be prime minister in 1996. Subsequently he described the partys decision as a historic blunder. The statement did not reflect the partys position. In fact, it underscored the propensity of the party to discipline its members.        
	Even this time, there must be grudging admiration for a party that puts its organizational rules above those of the individual. Chatterjee, a former central committee member of the party, could not have been unaware of the party constitution. He knew article 19 clause 13 of the party rulebook. He may have had his reasons for defiance, but if he placed himself, as the politburo sees it, above his party, that argument is not necessarily wrong.         
	Chatterjee has more to get outside the party than by staying within it. He can count on getting more popular respect because of his defiance.         
	By expelling Chatterjee, the politburo might hope that the partys rank and file will have some of its beliefs in Leninist organizational principles strengthened after the four years the party propped up Manmohan Singhs government. There are other issues too. In West Bengal, the CPI(M) is being acutely tested. The communist party that campaigned for land-to-the-tiller is today seen as the usurper in Singur and Nandigram. Then again, infighting and the exchange of corruption charges between the state secretary in Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan, and the chief minister, V.S. Achuthanandan, has forced the leadership to suspend both from the politburo.        
	Yet it seems strange that the CPI(M) should be torn between Leninist principles and the compulsions of power politics when Karats predecessor, Harkishan Singh Surjeet, had negotiated deals for coalition governments at the Centre. At the provincial level, the party has created space for policies to sustain three decades of rule in West Bengal. In Kerala and Tripura, too, it has accommodated policies it once abhorred. Possibly, the CPI(M) is now emphasizing its ideology in a kind of back-to-basics programme designed to appease a demoralized cadre while trying to limit the damage that has recently been done to it. A study by its West Bengal unit has resulted in fears that if the panchayat election results are reflected in the next Lok Sabha polls, the CPI(M) is in danger of losing as many as 15 seats.         
	Simultaneously, in Kerala, where the Left won 19 seats in the last elections, it cannot hope to win much more than half that number. The Left Front may end up with less than 40 members of parliament with its relevance in national politics whittled down way below Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party in the next Lok Sabha.        
	The expulsion of Chatterjee comes at a time when the party is desperately seeking to resuscitate itself. After propping up the Central government with a prime minister who believes in market economics, after Nandigram, and after accepting a policy of special economic zones where workers rights will be reduced, the CPI(M) can either be Marxist or a parliamentary party. At the moment, it is trying hard to be the Marxist parliamentary party.                    SUJAN DUTTA

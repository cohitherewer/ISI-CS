	Disruption personified                  
	Sir  It is interesting to read the anguished, exasperated views of the people lamenting the fate of Singur. While we all seem to agree that Mamata Banerjee is nothing but an irresponsible, rabble-rousing, self-serving politician, we need to stop and ask: who are this we that we are talking about? And as The Telegraphs own opinion poll has shown, almost half the people still believe that Banerjee has the good of the peasants at heart.           
	But while Banerjee enjoys this popular clout, she must not forget to thank her opponents for all that they have done for her. It is really a telling commentary on the negative and destructive effect of 30 years of leftist rule in the state that any opposition to the Left Front now must become like the Left itself in order to survive and succeed. Any victory that Banerjee would eventually claim in Singur would then, actually, be a victory of the Left Front itself.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Jit Roy Chowdhury, Calcutta

                
	Sir  What were the prayers that Mamata Banerjee was muttering while offering namaaz at Singur, asks Sunanda K. Datta-Ray in Capture and control (Sept 6). The namaaz, as practised by Muslims, entails a strict code of ablutions to cleanse oneself and it can be performed by a Muslim only. Banerjee as usual is neither here nor there on this. She is, in her inimitable manner, doing something that she knows little about, possibly to ingratiate herself with the Muslim voters. Strangely, Muslims of this land, who rise up in protest when cartoons are published denigrating the Prophet in distant Denmark, have chosen to keep mum on Banerjees namaaz.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Imtiaz Chowdhry, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Calcutta High Court has already approved the acquisition of land at Singur. The Supreme Court, in a similar case from Andhra Pradesh, has ruled that acquisition of land by the state government is permissible and the government is the final authority to decide if the acquisition is in public interest or not. The Left Front government of West Bengal is already armed with these two rulings, so it is likely that the ruling party was waiting for Banerjees agitation to lose some of its steam. It was gracious of the government to still agree to sit for talks with the Trinamul Congress leader and consider her demands as well. Now Banerjee can beat a dignified retreat. In any case, her agitation was only strengthening the governments case.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Benu Kumar Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  All this while, as Mamata Banerjee has been occupied in the task of ensuring that Tata Motors cannot roll out the Nano from Singur, the people of her constituency (Calcutta South) have fallen victims to a plot hatched by the communist government of West Bengal.           
	On a visit to Calcutta recently, I was shocked to see that the island on which trams run from Tollygunge to the rest of the city, was in the process of being tarmacked over, in the name of road-widening. This will mean that the people who travel by trams will put themselves in the way of rushing cars and buses when they step off the tram. I now live in Nottingham, United Kingdom, and find it amazing that the capitalist government of the UK goes to great lengths and cost to ensure the safety of people using the new tram system introduced in Nottingham. The safety measures in some cases meant reducing the width of the road. This is in contrast to the communist government of West Bengal, which is putting poor commuters in danger so that car-owners can have a wider road.           
	Banerjee could put her skills as an agitator to good use by protesting against this pro-rich ploy, which will directly affect the people of her constituency. She has little to gain from taking up the cause of the people of Singur. As soon as the profits from the Tata Motors plant will become apparent, they will prefer industrial work to backbreaking farm labour which yields far meagre returns.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilip, Nottingham, UK 

                
	Sir  The Singur episode will push back investors at least till the next assembly elections in West Bengal. Whether the Tata factory can function or not, the fact is that no serious investor would like to have his operational factory shut down. And therefore, they would like to see the outcome of the next elections.           
	One should keep in mind that the Tatas had invested in the state knowing full well its reputation for bandhs and strikes. The industrial giant is probably regretting its decision now. I have been working for 32 years and have always had to defend my state and its people when they were lambasted for their poor work culture. The Nano had begun to offer a glimmer of hope and pride to people like me. But with the Singur agitation, we are back to square one.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayant Roy, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It seems to me that Mamata Banerjee has arrogated unto herself the role of the supreme arbiter of peoples destinies in West Bengal. She has cared little for the peoples feelings, and has inflicted more damage upon the state than all the Left-sponsored bandhs and shutdowns taken together. Singur could well be the watershed in Bengal politics that will exonerate the Left of all its past wrongs, provided it mends its ways hereon. Banerjee has emerged as a greater negative force than the Left. If she can halt work in the state with a puny 30 seats in the assembly and a few panchayat blocks, then I shudder at the thought of what she will do with an absolute majority. I have finally decided to vote not so much for the Left as against her. And I think I am not the only one. It is time for the people to show that the real force rests with them in a democracy.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Anjan Sen, Calcutta

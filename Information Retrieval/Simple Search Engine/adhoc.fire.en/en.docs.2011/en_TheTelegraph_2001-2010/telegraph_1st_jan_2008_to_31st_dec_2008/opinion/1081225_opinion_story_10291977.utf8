	Mixed bag                  
	Sir  The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill, 2008, tabled in the Lok Sabha in the wake of the Mumbai terror attacks, does not seem to be powerful enough to prevent terrorism (Double-barrel strike on terror, Dec 17). The amended bill has merely expanded the ambit of the definition of terrorism, and included some other technicalities. All these pertain to issues after a terror strike takes place. Thus, one fails to see how the bill can be effective in preventing terrorism. Also, it should not be forgotten that terrorists, unlike petty criminals, cannot be deterred by threats of stringent punishment. The amendments to the bill  denial of bail to foreign nationals who enter the country illegally, longer prison terms, extension of no-bail period from 90 to 180 days and so on  should have already been in existence by now. Care should be taken to ensure that the provisions of the bill are not misused, as in the past.          
	The National Investigation Agency Bill is a step in the right direction though, given the need for a central agency to override state governments in matters related to terror. Terrorism is a global phenomenon, so the onus to curb it can no longer rest on state governments alone. For preventing and pre-empting terror, the NIA will need to coordinate inputs and monitor actions of the various intelligence agencies. Tabling bills in Parliament on what is to be done after an attack takes place can hardly protect the country from future assaults.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Flawed practice          
	Sir  The Union ministry of education has various schemes offering scholarships to needy students. But if they are not dispensed on time, what is the use of these scholarships? The postgraduate scholarship for rank-holders of all Indian universities for the academic session 2007-08 has been sanctioned by the University Grants Commission. The fund has been issued to the universities, and the awardees have been asked to contact the registrars of their respective institutions. However, the registrar of the University of Kerala seems reluctant to confirm when and how the students will receive the funds. As a guardian of one of the awardees, I got in touch with the registrar over this several times, but to no avail. I even submitted an RTI application enquiring about the process. In his reply to the RTI query, the registrar admitted that he has received the funds from the UGC but not the list of awardees. This is difficult to believe because the UGC is unlikely to send the funds without the list of the names of awardees. Moreover, the registrar has admitted that he knew that eight students would receive the scholarship for the given year from his university.           
	In fact, the registrar can easily find out who the awardees are by looking up the results of the concerned departments for the particular academic session. It is unfortunate that the toppers of a university recognized by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council are being mistreated by the institution that should have been proud of them.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  As per UGC rules, applicants for the post of lecturers are not required to appear for the National Eligibility Test if they have a PhD degree or an MPhil. The practice of exempting doctoral or MPhil degree-holders from this national-level selection test is unacceptable. Completing a PhD or an MPhil is by no means easy, and only real scholars are capable of obtaining these prestigious degrees. But the NET evaluates candidates in a manner that is very different from that of doctoral and MPhil dissertations. Doctoral students require thorough knowledge of their chosen subjects, but the NET examinees have to answer questions on varied topics within a limited time. It is shocking to note that one can bag the coveted post of a lecturer without sitting for a tough competitive examination. PhD and MPhil degree-holders should be made to prove themselves through a national screening to show that they are better than post-graduate students.           
	The process of obtaining a PhD degree is often dubious. The research supervisors may enrol their favourite students only. Also, candidates coming from the affluent classes are capable of sponsoring their research unlike poor students. The UGC has now acknowledged that the rules of obtaining doctoral degrees should be made stricter (Tougher screening for PhDs, Dec 24). It must also make the entry into university teaching more difficult by instructing aspiring lecturers to clear the NET.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Better than the rest          
	Sir  It is wrongly believed that government airlines provide poor service to customers. Recently, I travelled by a private airline from Delhi to Pune, and flew back to Delhi the same day by Indian, formerly known as Indian Airlines. The manners of the crew and the other facilities on board were far better during the return journey. The private carrier could not provide basic amenities. Even regular beverages like coffee and tea had to be purchased. Indian, however, provided nutritious meals. Even Jain food (without onion and garlic) was available, alongside vegetarian and non-vegetarian fare. The cost of meals was included in the price charged by the government airline. Even then, its fare was lower than what was charged by the private carrier.          
	Yours faithfully,

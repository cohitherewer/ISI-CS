	The transfer of P. Chidambaram to the home ministry may be good for the nation, but it will miss his good advice. There was a time, when the economic crisis began, when he went about advising people not to lose heart, and in general to be of good cheer. The advice, coming precisely when people were short of things to be cheerful about, was difficult to follow, but if followed regardless of troubles, could make them more bearable. It was unfortunate that at about the same time, the former finance ministers beatific smile began to fade. But he was only taking everyones cares on his shoulders so that they could be cheerful as instructed.         
	Then, however, matters went so bad that if people had gone about looking cheerful, they might have been locked up for being out of their senses. So the ex-finance ministers advisories had to change. His next advice was that industrialists should reduce prices. Why? He said it was because prices have always come down in a recession sorry, depression. Sometimes they have and sometimes they have not, but there is no need to cavil; let it be granted that inflation shows a certain correlation with overall growth rate, and that when growth slows down, so does inflation, sometimes to the extent of turning negative. But unless one is pious and believes that god does everything for the good, it needs to be asked if a fall in prices is good; and if it is granted that it is good, Mr Chidambaram should surely have been giving the same advice to industrialists through good times and bad: reduce prices. That he did not do so may be due to preoccupation; maybe he just did not get the time during the boom to give that advice. At a time when sales are shrinking and margins are narrowing, a price reduction may drive businesses into losses; if losses persist, they may run out of money and have to close down. That may not be such a bad idea, because bankruptcies create a demand for lawyers; so at least the market for law will boom.         
	But then, industrialists are liable to run up against another advisory: the prime minister has told them not to dismiss anyone. A business could in theory close down without dismissing anyone  if it pensioned off all workers. But if it was closing down for lack of money, it would be unlikely to be able to pay pensions. So the present home minister should consult the prime minister, and the two should issue a joint advisory on correct behaviour to settle all doubts  should businesses cut prices, or should they try to survive? The point is important since now a different kind of crisis, which led to Mr Chidambarams move to the home ministry, could produce a loss of confidence among businessmen.

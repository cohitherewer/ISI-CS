                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       IN THE GARDEN OF FORKING PATHS                                  This above all - Khushwant Singh                          Finding new homes                                        
	With only two collections of short stories and one novel, Jhumpa Lahiri has created a niche for herself in the literary world. She ranks with the likes of Amitav Ghosh, Vikram Seth and Salman Rushdie. She has won the Pulitzer Prize, OHenry and the Hemingway awards as well as the Guggenheim Fellowship. Like the other celebrated authors I have mentioned, although Lahiri writes about Indians, she lives in America, is married to a white American and is the mother of two children. I guess she is only in her early thirties. And with this promising start, she is likely to go far.        
	The surprising thing about Jhumpa Lahiris literary style is that unlike other writers who touch upon a variety of subjects, she sticks to only one theme  the losing battle that the Bengali bhadralok or genteel migrs fight to retain their ethnic identity. There is something yet undefined in their cultural psyche that makes Bengalis living abroad seek each other out. Other Indian immigrant groups like the Sindhis, Sikhs, Gujaratis and Malayalis also set up organizations of their own, meet in temples, mosques or gurdwaras to keep in touch with others of their faith and language. But Bengalis abroad dont bother about religion. For them Bengaliness is more important. Common language is their strongest bonding factor. However, they do not extend it to Bangladeshis, who are largely Muslims. Love for their own cuisine comes next. Whenever they entertain each other, they lay out lavish feasts of rice, fish and crustaceans cooked in Bengali style. Their social backgrounds are also different from those of other Indian migrs. They come from middle or upper-middle class homes where higher education and books are valued. In America, they aspire to have their offspring make it to the Ivy League universities. Their values are those of the bhadralok and not of chotolok. They go abroad not to make money but to excel in their professions as doctors, engineers or teachers. And no matter how Europeanized or Americanized they become, when it comes to marriage, their first preference is someone from similar backgrounds.        
	Jhumpa Lahiri expanded on the theme of Bengaliness in her novel, The Namesake (made into a film by Mira Nair). The theme remained the same in her first collection of short stories, Interpreter of Maladies. In her second short story collection, Unaccustomed Earth, all her stories revolve round the same theme. The title story is a masterpiece of elegant prose and captures the subtle nuances in the changing relationship between a widowed father, his married daughter, her husband and their two children. The widowed father, who is in his seventies, has a liaison with a Bengali widow in her mid-sixties whom he met during a conducted tour of Europe. His devious attempts to keep it a secret fails when his daughter finds a postcard written by her father to his mistress that he had forgotten to post. That single story encapsulates just about everything Jhumpa Lahiri has written so far. It is one of the best stories I have ever read.                
	How to spend the money?                
	Virendra Trehans Foundation for Amity and National Solidarity gave me an award for being a good chap. They did it in style in the parliament annex where they had invited a galaxy of celebrities for the occasion. Somnath Chatterjee, speaker of the Lok Sabha presided. Soli Sorabji read the citation. Vasant Sathe and some others made laudatory speeches. I cant pretend that I was not flattered. I was. However, I was also left with a dilemma because the award included a substantial sum in cash and I dont know how to spend it. My main indulgences are tasty food and good booze. I have had to cut down both as over-eating creates indigestion. Ive also had to reduce my drinking to one slug of single malt every evening before dinner. Even if I continue with the spartan regimen, there will be a lot of money unspent. I am 94 and know that I have little time left to enjoy life. I also know I cant take the money with me. So what are the options? I can think of three: two conventionally religious, the third, personal.        
	The first is offered by Semitic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. They assure me that if I have been a good boy, I will be allowed to enter paradise. I have not been too bad a boy (as the award assures me) and have a good chance of gaining admission. I am assured that in paradise, booze flows freely in streams and virgins are available for the asking. So there will be no need to have money on my person.        
	The second is the Aryan option: Jain, Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh. They assure me that I will be reborn. I may not look the same as I do now but the spirit in me will be the same. But shall I be able to transfer my past bank account to the new that I open in my second life? I doubt it. When I shall go to the bank and ask my cheque to be cashed, they are sure to question my identity. I may quote the Bhagvat Gita in my support and assure them that I am the same person I was, but in a reincarnated garb. They will either treat me as a nut case or an imposter and hand me over to the police.        
	Since I do not subscribe either to the Semitic or the Aryan religions, I have to fall back on my mental resources. Here the picture is bleaker than those painted by men of religion. This is because I have no idea what happens to a person when he dies. So I will spend whatever I have on looking after myself while Im alive and leave it to my children to decide what to do with what remains: they can keep it for themselves, give it to my servants or to some charity. And thanks to Trehan for making me think about the dilemma of old age  for letting me know that you cant take anything with you in your last journey.

	The horror of what is happening in Mumbai is matched by the incompetence of the government and its intelligence agencies. The present continuous tense is used deliberately in the previous sentence to highlight the enormity of what is happening and the time taken to restore a semblance of normalcy to a city that is under siege. All the facts are not known, and given that the country concerned is India, they will probably never be known. But what is known is that a group of young men arrived in Mumbai by speedboat with arms and then spread terror and mayhem in well-chosen locations in a planned and coordinated manner. The terrorists continued to give battle for many hours, and this suggests that they had support and supplies within the city, perhaps from Mumbais notorious underworld. The sequence of events  coming in by the sea, the spread of terror, the duration of the violence and the kinds of arms used  leads to the conclusion that collusion with the terrorists was spread over a very wide network. The inevitable question follows: what were the intelligence agencies doing? It is obvious that either their flow of information has dried up or the information they provide is not acted upon. Incompetence is the only word to describe the situation, except that the incompetence has left Mumbai strewn with dead bodies.        
	Incompetence always flows from the top. It has been obvious for quite sometime, that the Union home minister, Shivraj Patil, has no control over the critical portfolio he is supposed to handle. The prime minister cannot be unaware of the fact that Mr Patil cuts a ridiculous figure. Yet he remains the home minister: the prime minister has been unable to explain this bizarre situation. But the situation cannot be explained only by the failures of individuals. All political parties, when it has suited them, have spread the politics of hatred and violence. The spread of terrorism has been facilitated in this climate and the influence and intervention of unfriendly neighbours have aggravated the situation. Violence and terror have now become issues in the electoral game. Consequently, no one in power or in the shadow of power is seriously interested in the eradication of terrorism in India. Passing the buck and blame has become an easy pastime with dangerous consequences.        
	Terrorism is thus taking on newer forms and becoming more ambitious, as the attack on Mumbai exposes. Wednesday nights assault was focussed: foreigners seemed to have been made special targets. This indicates a global dimension previously not noticed in terrorist attacks in India. Unless Manmohan Singhs government wants to appear a sheep in sheeps clothing, it must stop the sweet talk and act. The eradication of terrorism is now the countrys first priority, and people who are not up to this task have no right to claim the trust of the people.

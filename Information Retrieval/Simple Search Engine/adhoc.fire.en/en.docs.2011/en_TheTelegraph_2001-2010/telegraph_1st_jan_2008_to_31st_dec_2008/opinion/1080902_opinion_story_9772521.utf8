                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       EVERYBODY LOVES THE LAST ACTION HERO                                  When Chiranjeevi launches his political party, why does Jayalalithaa think it is a disease? asks Chirosree Basu                                            
	I dont know when or how I will make an appearance , but I will come at the right time. That was Rajanikanth in the film, Muthu, in 1995. But while he is still deciding on the timing, another in the same business as his is stealing the show in the neighbourhood. The actor, Chiranjeevi, launched his party, Praja Rajyam, in a mammoth rally in Tirupati last week, and his timing seems to be perfect. The assembly and general elections are months away and the people are tired of the drab fest of the Congress and the Telugu Desam Party. Chiranjeevi promises freedom from corruption and poverty, and, above all, mega shows aboard raths which the people of the state seem to have missed since the time of N.T. Rama Rao.         
	All that seems to be a problem with J. Jayalalithaa, the All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader. She thinks that filmstars launching their own political parties is a disease which has spread to Andhra Pradesh from Tamil Nadu. Several months back, she had made a similar remark about a slew of film actors flagging off their own parties in Tamil Nadu. Among them is Vijaykanth, whose Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam makes promises identical to Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyams, and tries to position itself as an alternative to the older parties.         
	Ammas invective is directed at Vijaykanth for obvious reasons. Vijaykanth calls himself Black MGR and hurts Jayalalithaa more than he hurts M. Karunanidhi, by poaching on her political legacy. Not unnaturally, Jayalalithaa has been at her venomous best. She did not show the same fangs when Rajanikanth started his political dalliances in the late Nineties and lent his weight to the opposition  leading to her defeat in the 1996 assembly polls. But then, Rajani has proved to be doubtful about his political calling.         
	No such doubts assail Vijaykanth and the others. Like Chiranjeevi, they have their strategies chalked out. Lending their much-rehearsed voices to caste, regional or class aspirations, they want to reach out to as many as possible, and yet retain their appeal for bigger players (both Vijaykanth and Chiranjeevi will have few problems allying with the Bharatiya Janata Party). Like Vijaykanth, who has avoided being bracketed with any of the big political groupings till now, Chiranjeevi too may go it alone for the time being. Then, if it is all smooth sailing, concentrate his energy on forging post-poll alliances that could get him the hot seat.         
	That is something Amma finds particularly galling  people getting into politics and making the most of it without any previous political association or experience. That is perhaps what she means by disease. Despite being part of the film industry, what differentiated her, M.G. Ramachandran and Karunanidhi from the new crop was their long association with politics before they tried their luck at the hustings. But what of N.T. Rama Rao, who entered politics and made his mark within a few months? Was that disease as well? How much political association is necessary to be not called a political opportunist? Was it not opportunism when she helped (some say provoked) MGR to break away from C. Annadurai, cock a snook at Karunanidhi and ride the crest of his own popularity as a cinestar to become chief minister? What about her own political ambitions? Vijaykanth, in fact, believes Amma to be Tamil Nadus biggest disease.        
	Amma, evidently, does not see it that way. Unlike Vijaykanth or Chiranjeevi, who have entered the political stage when their careers are still on the roll, Jayalalithaa was already an artist of yesteryear when she made her bid for bigger things. And unlike them, she could not depend on her own fan club to do the groundwork. She depended on MGRs. But public opinion turned against her after MGRs death. She was the other woman laying claim to a married mans property, in this case MGRs legacy  much like Lakshmi Parvathi, who laid claim to NTRs legacy and found herself trumped by the son-in-law. But there was only an inexperienced wife in Jayalalithaas case, and she had greater stature and presence of mind than Parvathi. She, of course, had to work hard on her inheritance, harder than most. She built on it by promoting her own image as leader with her larger-than-life hoardings and the culture of sycophancy that she institutionalized. Jayalalithaa obviously resents the younger men for having it easy.        
	If filmstars wanting to become chief ministers is a disease, is it really the disease or just a symptom? What of the people who want them to become their leaders, who prostrate themselves beneath their pictures and latch on to every word they speak on screen in the fond hope that some day their reel-life heroes will come and deliver them from their sufferings? The pressure on Rajanikanth to join politics is so severe that he had to scrap some of his dialogue in Kuselan so that it was not misconstrued as a signal of his arrival.        
	Unlike MGR or NTR, todays stars are no longer cast, nor do they wish to be cast, in stereotypical roles that would make them folk heroes. Neither Rajanikanth nor Chiranjeevi has taken up roles which promote their images as messiahs of the poor or protectors of womens modesty. Yet they have been unable to ignore the weight of public expectation. Both Vijaykanth and Chiranjeevi have done a lot of charity and invested in healthcare for the poor. And Rajanikanth, reportedly, gives away a substantial part of his earnings for the welfare of the members of his fan clubs which spread to the remotest corners of the state.         
	Stardom and politics today are no longer as inseparable as they were before. Although Karunanidhi would still pen a script or two and the movies would translate into a box office hit, neither Stalin nor Kanimozhi has shown much inclination to follow the same route to political success as their father. They have found other ways of mass contact.         
	Politicians, it seems, can do without being filmstars in the South, but filmstars cannot do without being politicians. One reason is their obvious ability to pull crowds and the efficacy of fan clubs in mass mobilization. In every election in the South, political parties rope in a huge number of filmstars, and they report more success than parties in north India, where fan clubs have never performed a political function of this kind.         
	The second, and probably the most important, reason is the refusal of the established political leadership to let the association between the tinsel world and politics die. This is achieved by keeping alive the memories of heroes like MGR and NTR both as film stars and leaders. It is the success of these southern heroes in their own regions that allows leaders like Jayalalithaa to continue to have a say in politics. Filmdom was so intrinsically connected to the success of these leaders  in helping them build on the themes of language, regional pride and syncretism  that the association persists. It is a case of instant recall.        
	The third reason has to do with need. Given the caste polarization in politics and society, the need for a leader with an appeal over and above the restrictions imposed by the Mandalized politics of today is keenly felt in the South. The region has a unique advantage. Unlike north India, which has found a messiah in Mayavati and her social and political engineering skills, people in the South have a wider choice. They only have to turn to the silver screen and pick their hero. And if their urgency matches that of their chosen one, you have a surefire hit like Chiru.

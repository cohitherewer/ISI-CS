	It is unusual for an artist who does caricature-like drawings to create sculptures of snorting wild boars with fire in their eyes and capricious goats. At least in our country, humour and seriousness rarely go hand in hand. Happily, Shyam Kanu Borthakur does both. In his recent exhibition, The Lyrical Images (December 6-13), at Chitrakoot Art gallery, Borthakur proved that he is a dab hand at both media. Both his sculpture and drawings have a strong graphic character. With a sure hand, he draws kettles that could be out of Disneyland. They have ballooning cheeks like the portraits of Wind depicted in many antique maps. Borthakurs kettles, however, have a character of their own. One has slanting eyes like a Chinaman, another wears the cap of a clown with ribbons of steam trailing from the spout. A human face in profile becomes indistinguishable from the snout of a pig. A boar with an armoured body similar to that of a rhinoceros seems ready to charge, its beady eyes glowing embers.        
	He uses soft pastel as well as charcoal. While the drawings done with the latter are charged with kinetic energy, the ones executed with the former are more charming, with a toy-like look about them. He tells sweet stories with soft pastel that could be out of folklore. The plump piglet (or is it an armadillo?) could be a cuddly soft toy. His sculptures are another matter. They are sinewy creations and have a more muscular rhythm and verve than his drawings. The gigantic heads of these boars and goats seem to burst with energy, their nostrils flared with rage, perverseness, obstinacy or plain bloody-mindedness. The boars are armed with mean-looking tusks, while the moody goats have horns that resemble wind instruments straight out of the Bible (picture). The bulls are mountains of muscles topped by the hump like a super-size scoop of ice cream. Ready to wreak havoc, they have none of the docility of their ancient cousins depicted on Harappan seals. All these creations are alpha males, and Borthakur does not believe in blurring gender disparities. Their pizzles are very much in evidence, and the Pope would certainly approve of these creations. These mean machines have lean and tough bodies and are defined by angularities unembellished with details. Their armature makes clear that these animals were meant to resemble machines with a fearful symmetry. With smooth flanks and stumps for legs, their heads are blown out of proportion. They are raring to go.

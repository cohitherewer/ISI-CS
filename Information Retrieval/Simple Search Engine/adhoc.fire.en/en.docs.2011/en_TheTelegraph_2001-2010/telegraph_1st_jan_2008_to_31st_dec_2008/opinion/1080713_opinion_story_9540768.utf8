	On a train from Newcastle to London earlier this week, a reporter put it to Gordon Brown that some women say he reminded them of Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights. Mr Brown readily agreed, and added, Well, maybe an older Heathcliff, a wiser Heathcliff. Endearingly human as this moment may have been, the fact is that most of Britain seems to like less and less the idea of a darkly Gothic prime minister like Mr Brown. Downing Street and Westminster, unlike the Yorkshire moors, are not the best setting for being stormy and uncommunicative. But the comparison has caught on. The shadow chancellor, urging drastic changes in Mr Browns car-tax plans, declared in parliament that it was time for Heathcliff to come down from dithering heights. What is interesting in all this is how readily literary allusions, and those too from the classics, are played about with in British political culture. Perhaps, with monochrome men like Mr Brown and the grey decencies of British politics, people have to rummage desperately in the rattle-bag of literature to liven things up a bit.         
	How refreshingly different things are in the subcontinent. Here one positively longs for the grey decencies sometimes. But only sometimes. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee might sprinkle his interviews with Proust or Mayakovsky, but one searches in vain among the colonial and native masters  Shakespeare, Dickens, Austen, Tagore  to find characters that could compare with the great stars of Indian politics. Even Lewis Carroll, Sukumar Roy and Parashuram seem too politely funny for the rollercoasting topsyturvydom of democratic India. Think of the icons (as opposed to the real people behind the cut-outs): Vajpayee, Advani, Modi, Laloo and Rabri, Mayavati, Mamata, Jayalalithaa. And above them, in their own high Valhalla, that other pantheon: the Mahatma, Nehru, and the tragic Gandhis. Contemporary Indian politics  and the history behind it  is a mythological system in itself: a vast Sea of Stories that is in an endless process of churning out its own classics, its own Amar Chitrakathas. There are only three other mythological systems comparable in scale and scope which exist as parallel universes, and are sustained by a constant traffic with this unique world-in-itself: the Hindu pantheon, the epics, and Bollywood. Durga, Ram, Hanuman, Yudhisthir, Mother India and Munnabhai are some of the dramatis personae that come to mind  figures not just of comparison, but often also of identification, which, by a strangely reversed traffic, come alive in the imagination and become most entertaining only when projected upon the real leaders on their rathayatras or campaign trails. It is the rich cross-fertilizations among these different mythological systems  sometimes parallel, often intertwined  that produce the rules, values and images making up the spectacle of Indian democracy, its elections and riots, deals and dynasties. The only English novel that manages to capture some of this endless work is that great one, which the British seem unable to stop giving the Booker to.

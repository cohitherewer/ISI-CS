The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | sound and fury
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SOUND AND FURY                                                    
	At any other time of the year, except the so-called festive season, law-abiding Calcuttans, even with a modicum of civic sense, would be able to identify the possible sources of noise and air pollution. They would rail against the deplorable failure of the government in curbing vehicular emission, point at the ancient buses and auto-rickshaws making a holy din on the city roads, and lament how civic laws in Bengal are going to the dogs. But come September, and the ever-growing list of festivals evidently induces a spirit of self-forgetfulness. These conscientious citizens, swept along the heady wave of carnival, do not mind bending the law just that much. Such, it seems, was the attitude of those who flouted the ban on firecrackers this Diwali. It is not as if the ignorant and the unaware were caught in an open violation of norms. Rather, and not all that surprisingly perhaps, residents of some of the most privileged areas of the city  Jadavpur, Regent Park, Ballygunge Circular Road and Salt Lake  were picked up by the police for this offence. Their denial of what their actions amounted to was matched only by their sheer audacity and the collective will to overpower the custodians of law and order. When the police tried to arrest some allegedly inebriated youths for bursting banned firecrackers at a respectable housing complex off VIP road, the offenders turned violent.        
	Most of the 800 odd people who were arrested on Diwali for either bursting or possessing banned firecrackers would not find it too hard to comprehend what scientists of the Pollution Control Board had to say about the effects of their mirth-making. There was an increase in the level of particulate matter in the air on Diwali evening, leading to some palpable and intangible results. Low visibility caused by smog over Dum Dum airport delayed several flights. At a subliminal level, the lethal combination of deadly gases emitted by vehicles and those released by the firecrackers seeped into the respiratory tracts of thousands. Noise levels around hospitals and residential areas far exceeded the stipulated number of decibels as well. Instead of roundly blaming the administration, Calcuttans have to be more proactively involved in the welfare of their city. Their quality of life would depend very much on what they wish to make of their civic responsibilities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Towards a middle ground
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TOWARDS A MIDDLE GROUND                              The BJPs position on the nuclear deal is more nuanced than that of Manmohan Singh or Prakash Karat, writes Mahesh Rangarajan                                                
	There is little doubt that we are at a turning point in Indian foreign policy. There is still some way to go before the country becomes a fully participating nation state in the global exchange of nuclear materials and technologies for peaceful purposes. But the impact of matters atomic on Indian domestic politics has been no less decisive. It has put an end to the bonhomie of the Left parties and Congress that had been such a marked feature of the later years of Harkishen Singh Surjeets general secretaryship of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Keeping the communal danger at bay even brought the Left into a post-poll embrace with the Congress-led coalition. That phase is now decisively behind us. Not since the outcry over Bofors in the late Eighties have the Left parties and the Bharatiya Janata Party been on the same side of the fence on an issue.        
	For the Left, the agreement has implications that are wholly negative as much for the Indian nuclear programme as for the course that the nation charts for itself in the world and in Asia in particular. The BJPs position is somewhat different, as was cogently explained by the former deputy prime minister, L.K. Advani in an interview with a leading national daily. The strategic partnership is more than welcome and seen as a logical culmination of initiatives under- taken by the second Vajpayee government. But the loss of strategic autonomy is another matter altogether.              
	Advani is thus carving out a middle position for his party and his alliance. He accepts the imperative of Indian engagement with the US. Here, he is in line with his partys ancestor, the Jana Sangh. That party saw the United States of America as an ally against communism in general and China in particular. In an important speech delivered in the US in 2003, the national security advisor, Brajesh Mishra, revised the maxim for our own age when he spoke of the friendship of India, the US and the Jewish people. Yet, there is a second strand in the thinking and legacies of the Hindutva party and it bears closer attention. In a speech in parliament last year, Advani ranked Indira Gandhi with Atal Bihari Vajpayee as a leader who would not have compromised the countrys interests. In his recent interview, he again sought out continuity in policy that transcended narrow party lines.        
	He even singled out the dispatch of the US Sixth Fleet in 1971 as the factor which prompted Indira Gandhi to go in for Pokhran-I in 1974; we completed the process in 1998. Much of the political commentary has rightly focused on the Damascene conversion of that staunch critic of US military actions in west and south Asia, Mulayam Singh Yadav. This is crucial for the survival of the coalition government that desperately needs his cohorts to help make up the numbers in the trust vote in the House. But equal attention should be paid to the way in which the premier opposition party is staking out a middle ground. It will clearly oppose the United Progressive Alliance government in a vote of confidence. The division of the members will be historic as when the Lok Sabha voted out the V.P. Singh government in the winter of 1990. But while all parties notionally, if not practically, supported B.P. Mandal, the divide this time is much sharper.         
	The government, led now as much by Sonia Gandhi as by Manmohan Singh, believes in the deal as integral to Indias future. It is more than an issue of energy autonomy or Indo-American ties. The restoration of nuclear give-and-take will be a logical corollary to the process of liberalization that was unleashed by the reforms of the summer of 1991.         
	In Hokkaido, the prime minister did not mince words and referred to the strategic partnership with the US. Coming within days of the attack on the Indian mission in Kabul, it had a larger significance few will have missed. Bill Emmott, former editor of The Economist goes as far as to argue in his book, Rivals, that George W. Bushs opening up to India may well rank in the long run as a keystone event much like Richard Nixons visit to China in 1972. India will counter-balance China, and the US will be a key ally. For critics, nothing could be less desirable. Prakash Karat goes so far as to see the deal as undoing the work of Indian scientists working on their own for several decades. More than that, the close strategic ties will alienate neighbours like Iran and China. It will also tie down Indian foreign policy to periodic processes of review required by the Hyde Act. As for the virtues seen by the Congress in a tie-up, for the Left these are encumbrances to be avoided at all cost.              
	The BJP has a different position far more nuanced and subtle than of either Manmohan Singh or Prakash Karat. With general elections imminent and its alliance a contender for power, it cannot afford to foreclose options. With serious restiveness even among parties aligned, until recently, with the ruling coalition, it cannot afford to support an initiative that has, from its outset, borne the personal imprimatur of the prime minister. It is also suitably ambiguous about how it would remedy the effects of such an agreement. Were all hurdles to be cleared and the US Congress to eventually ratify the agreement, there will be little left but for the two governments to operationalize the deal. That bridge can be crossed at a later date. Indias polity has been deeply divided on earlier occasions, like the Emergency, Ram Mandir and Mandal. But a foreign-policy issue never ruptured leaders in quite so marked a manner.         
	There may just be scope for a middle ground. It is this window of opportunity that the BJP hopes to exploit. For now, there is restiveness even among those who are not against a partnership with the US. The governments ineptitude in disclosing its stand at the right time has not helped its case. It is this restiveness and the diminishing clout of the ruling coalition that makes the UPA vulnerable. Advani hopes the middle ground will make his party a natural claimant for power next time. Whether he will get there is a different story, but the deal has given him a chance for taking centre stage.

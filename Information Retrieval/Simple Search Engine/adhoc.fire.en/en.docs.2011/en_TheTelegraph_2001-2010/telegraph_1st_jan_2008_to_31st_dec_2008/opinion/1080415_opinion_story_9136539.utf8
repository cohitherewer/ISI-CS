The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Having a pancake and eating it too
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       HAVING A PANCAKE AND EATING IT TOO                          - Sweet shops may soon become the Bengalis rsquo; only link with a swiftly vanishing past

	Roshni is always in a hurry. There is a five-year-old to attend to, the clamour of the maid reminding her of the depleted stocks of washing powder. Then there are the unpaid bills that unerringly pop out of her handbag a day after the due date is over, and there is, of course, her office. Had it been a few decades ago, Poush Shankranti, the last day of the month of Poush, would have replaced some of these in the list of matters demanding her attention. There would have been rice to be soaked overnight and then ground, milk to be thickened, rice crpes and pancakes to be fried, and that special seasonal jaggery, nolen gur, to be added to most of the sweets.        
	Time is a great liberator. It has now set Roshni free of such sticky chores. She now has to only faintly remember that it is that time of the year when her mother-in-law holds in front of her two rolled rice crpes with coconut stuffing. She is supposed to have them in fond remembrance of a tradition her parents-in-law have been desperately trying to pass on to the next generation.        
	After a hard days work, Roshni readily obliges. Minati Devi, her mother-in-law, is no great cook. The crpes or patishaptas Roshni is offered are the better ones of the evening spent in trials. While she goes to wash her plate in the sink, Roshni comes upon the work table next to the gas. The traces of Minati Devis long battle with the dough are all too evident. Some patishaptas lie in lumps, others have shed large portions of themselves on the pan itself. Yet Roshni cannot but salute the effort.         
	Patishaptas are not the only outcome of the days work. There are little pillows of unfried rice moulds filled with coconut and dipped in condensed milk. Nolen gur has found its way into each variety, blended into the coconut on a slow flame. In another day, the pillows will become rock-solid and the family will have to be coaxed to finish them off. But for Minati Devi and her husband, it is a special day remembered in a special way.        
	Yet, even before they start the preparations, sweet shops throughout Calcutta have become harbingers of the months of Poush and Magh. There are special sweets made of nolen gur on the shelves, and they remain there for a good five to six months. And there are the patishaptas  a symbol of the markets invasion into the sacred domain of the Bangali bodhu.        
	Santiranjan Ghorui of Tripti Mahal in Baranagar, who has worked assiduously over the last few years to build up the reputation of his shop, has an explanation for this. Bouera ar shashurir boshe nei (the daughters-in-law are no longer in the control of their mothers-in-law). He says that given the time constraints and the lack of interest, there is no way the skills can be passed on within the household. The Ghoruis have thus turned saviours of a vanishing skill, the link between generations of Bengalis. But not without a reason perhaps. Santiranjan and his brother, Paritosh, have found in patishaptas yet another way of endearing their shop to customers. So have many other shopowners, overseeing modest enterprises that have to compete with others like them.         
	Dilip Boali of Jadabchandra Das in south Calcutta says that shopowners make a profit of around 30 per cent from the sale of patishaptas. He has no intention of following the trend though. For one, labour does not come cheap for these traditional sweets. Trained, extra hands have to be hired. These karigars, usually from Hooghly or Midnapore, have to be paid around Rs 100-150 per day for the three to four months they are in the city, and on some years they might not be available at all, bought over by another shop willing to pay more. For quality stuff, quality ingredients are also needed  the right kind of rice, for example. For many like Boali, it is too much trouble, especially if there is already an established shop with a longstanding reputation. He proudly announced that Ramakrishnadeb used to love Jadubabus sweets.        
	For Sudhir Kumar Maity, who looks after Mukherjee Sweets in Ballygunge Place, the trouble is part of the trade. So he does not complain that the special Kamini rice and the besan have to be fetched from a particular shop in Chitpur. The stuff that goes into the goodies have to be good as well. Others are not so particular. A worker in Mukh Mishti in Lake Market, which did not make patishaptas this year as the karigar did not turn up, says that most other shops on Rashbehari Avenue (his eyes pointing at his shops nearest competitor) get their supply from a factory somewhere in Tollygunge.         
	A short walk down the avenue from Mukh Mishti is Laxmi Narayan, and its workers are about to divulge details about this factory, but their better senses prevail and they shut up. In the evening, the owner, Anadi Ghosh, seems entirely unaware of any such factory and rattles off the names of the other traditional sweets they have been making for the last 60 years  chhanar mudki, chandrapuli, nikhuti. (He mentions that his shop had supplied the sweets for the funeral of Suchitra Sens husband.) He insists that all sweets are made by the shops own karigars, including the patishaptas. Dilip Boali says that most shops, especially the smaller ones, which set much store on variety and less on quality, get their supply of traditional sweets, needing extra care and attention, from outside.         
	For Roshni, however, where exactly the shops make their sweets hardly matters. She now has the option of trying out two or three local shops and then deciding whose patishaptas are the best. This bit of knowledge would be necessary in about a decade or so when she might not be able to sample any more patishaptas at home. A few more decades later, the ones on the shelves, of a more-or-less uniform taste and without the special feel of Minati Devis labour, may be the only ones on offer for Roshnis son, who has not yet developed a taste for sweets (not even the home-made patishaptas) beyond the routine Cadburys.         
	Boali of Jadabchandra Das acknowledges the service his counterparts in other shops are doing by keeping alive a bond with the vanishing past. One does not know if Roshnis son will realize what his generation has lost, for he might never get to taste the ranga-alur pithe (one made with mashed potatoes stuffed with chhana and then dipped in nolen gur) his mother had at work the other day. A casserole full of these pithes was sent over by her colleagues mother, who can no longer make them herself, but gets her maid to make them for her.       CHIROSREE BASU

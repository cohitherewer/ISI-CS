The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | year of the rats
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       YEAR OF THE RATS                                  FIFTH COLUMN - Sudipta Bhattacharjee                              
	It may sound suspiciously like the nursery rhyme about the three blind mice, but be warned. This one deals with farmers chopping off 14.56 lakh tails of rats, and counting        
	Every summer, a tiny state celebrating the anniversary of its peace accord is pitched into the limelight, either as being Indias most peaceful, the second-most literate or the second in effectively tackling mortality rates, and this year, as the greenest and yet the most devastated. It was in June 1986 that Mizoram ended two decades of insurgency to sign a truce that is touted as the countrys most successful. Switch to 2008, the Chinese year of the Rat, and Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga is sitting on a veritable powder keg on election-eve. The second-in-command to the firebrand Laldenga who headed the Mizo National Front, Zoramthanga knows the nitty-gritty of guerrilla warfare from the time his outfit fought in the jungles in the Sixties. Today, instead of the defence forces, he is facing an army of rats that has ravaged the state.         
	Ironically, the MNF grew out of the Mizo National Famine Front, a voluntary social welfare organization formed in 1960 to collect relief to help villagers struck by famine (mautam). The destruction of crops was caused by rats feeding on bamboo (mautak) flowers. Since it is an established fact that bamboo flowers every half a century, the Mizo administration was supposedly equipped to combat the consequences since 2006, when the first florets bloomed.        
	Zoramthanga devised his anti-rat strategy with the Bamboo Flowering and Famine Combat Scheme (Baffacos) well in time. In 2005, he spoke of using the catastrophe as a stepping stone to economic development by harvesting 25 million tonnes of the green gold his state is blessed with. He hoped to export this resource to countries like Japan and Indonesia. Subsequently, he cut deals with paper mills in Bangladesh and Assam and promoted its use locally for building houses.                
	Hit and miss        
	Zoramthanga cannot be faulted on his research. He went on record saying overheated bamboo made an excellent clarifying agent for sugar; he named big automobile companies who were replacing fibreglass dashboards with bamboo ones. When asked whether bamboo seeds, which were proving to have aphrodisiac qualities for rodents could replace Viagra, he enthusiastically contemplated a scientific probe!         
	Three years ago, the then chief secretary, Lalringa, was confident that the state would be able to take on the rat brigade. The projects under Baffacos appeared foolproof: the health department had geared up to tackle rat-induced diseases like typhoid and bubonic plague, arrangements were to be made for the air-dropping of relief materials and rat-proof granaries were constructed.         
	So what went wrong? Why are villagers today on the brink of starvation? If there are no hunger deaths yet, it is not for any government help, but the fact that members of the clan are helping each other survive on one meal a day. Why did the government not harvest the bamboo as planned? Why were armies of rats allowed to invade the villagers when a buffer zone could have been created? Why are NGOs having to adopt villages in the devastated districts, not to mention the funds donated by the United States of America and Britain? Why is the state sending frantic SOS to the Centre for money when it allocated Rs 25 lakh for cutting tails of rats between October and December 15, 2007? Why was the scheme stopped in December on the assumption that the rat army would naturally fade away?        
	On June 30, when Mizoram celebrates 22 years of its exemplary peace accord, Zoramthanga had better realize that a hungry electorate is not the most forgiving, especially in an election year. Time, indeed, to turn adversity into the promised opportunity.

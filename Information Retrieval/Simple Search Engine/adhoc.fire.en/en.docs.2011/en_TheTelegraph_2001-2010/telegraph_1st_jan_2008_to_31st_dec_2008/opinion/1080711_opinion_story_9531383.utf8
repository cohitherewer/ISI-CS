	Lorenzo Da Ponte: The Adventures of Mozart rsquo;s Librettist in Old and New Worlds By Rodney Bolt, 
  Bloomsbury, pound;15  
	It goes without saying that only a very select group of people, even in Europe, listen to Western classical music. Within that select group, only some are opera buffs. For opera buffs, the operas of Mozart are a special trove of absolute delight and enjoyment. So powerful is the grip of Mozarts operas that it is often forgotten that he only provided the musical score. Someone else wrote the words and the songs. Thus it is an error to say  as is often said  as Mozart says in Don Giovanni or The Marriage of Figaro or Cos fan Tutte. In fact, Lorenzo Da Ponte, provided the words of three operas just named. Unfortunately, his name and his life have been lost to posterity as compared to, even perhaps because of, the fame of Mozart. This book tries to rescue Lorenzo from this obscurity.  
	Who was Lorenzo? He was born Emanuele Conegliano, a Jew, near Venice in 1749. His father converted to Christianity in 1763 and Emanuele acquired a new name. In his life, Lorenzo dabbled in many things. He was a poet, a priest, a lover and libertine, who counted Casanova among his close fiends. He was a great favourite of Joseph II of Austria, who was a great patron of music. He was once a friend of Salieri, and later turned a foe. He was the librettist of three of Mozarts operas. In 1805, in New York, Lorenzo established a grocery store. But very soon he established New Yorks first opera house and became the first professor of Italian at Columbia University. As this thumbnail sketch suggests, Lorenzo was quite a character.        
	He spent time in four important cities  Venice, Vienna, London and New York. And three of these were very important in the world of the 18th century in the West and New York was just emerging. Was Lorenzo important? He himself perhaps best described his role: If not the protagonist of the tragicomedy, at least one of the leading players. Lorenzo died in New York in 1838. It was not until 1987 that the city had erected a monument to him. This book tells the story of his life and of its high water mark, his partnership with Mozart. It is ironic that the sublime music of Mozarts operas has pushed into the unknown the achievements of the man who wrote the words and set the plot.

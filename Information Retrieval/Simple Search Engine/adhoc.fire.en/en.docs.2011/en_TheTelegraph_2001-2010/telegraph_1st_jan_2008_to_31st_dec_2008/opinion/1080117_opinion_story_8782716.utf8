	A prize for the leader
         
	Sir  Eyebrows were raised, and with good reason too, at L.K. Advanis plea to the government to confer the Bharat Ratna on Atal Bihari Vajpayee this year (Uneasy lies crown that awaits Ratna, Jan 10). Few would deny that Vajpayee has had a long, eventful and dignified political career deserving the highest civilian honour. Advani need not have troubled himself to campaign for Vajpayee so unabashedly. This is especially unfortunate, since Vajpayee himself has never tried to push himself to the forefront in any obvious way. Perhaps Advani has been impelled by strong and just emotions to make this demand, but such aggressive campaigning only strengthens the perception that the choice of the awardee is determined by the lobbyists power to influence the authorities. The issue here is particularly sensitive. Over the years, there has been a growing belief that such awards go to self-interested individuals, not the real public leaders who deserve to be felicitated. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  While political parties push their preferred leaders for the Bharat Ratna, they seem to have forgotten that it is the common man who deserves the highest civilian award most. Leaders may be the driving force behind a well-founded nation, but the citizens help run it efficiently. It therefore makes little sense to single out an individual for an honour that each law-abiding citizen deserves equally. What makes this process even more execrable is the petty politicking that goes with it.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

        
	Sir  The Bharatiya Janata Party, led by L.K. Advani, has made a laughing stock of itself with their letter to the prime minister demanding the Bharat Ratna for Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The BJP seems to have done away with even the pretence of dignified behaviour. Vajpayee would probably have been considered for the honour, but thanks to Advanis over-enthusiasm, his chances may have been weakened. Even if Vajpayee is given the award, it will always have the taint of controversy and unfair play associated with it. Misuse of national awards by political lobbies could be avoided by making the selection public.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

        
	Sir  Shouldnt the highest civilian award be decided privately by a select committee, and not dragged to a political bargaining table? More importantly, such honours are meant for distinguished individuals who have served the nation selflessly. No political party can claim to have done that. I would like to suggest a restriction in the number of such honours  only one from each category, such as sports, films, journalism, art and so on. Awards for bravery may continue, but in no case should these be given to any politician.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

        
	Sir  L.K. Advani has sparked off an unwarranted controversy by proposing A.B. Vajpayees name for the Bharat Ratna. One wonders if this is a favour returned, since Vajpayee had earlier endorsed Advanis name as the partys next prime ministerial candidate. By canvassing for Vajpayee in this manner, Advani, unfortunately, has reduced the achievements of this outstanding parliamentarian to mockery. Will Advani win additional credit from his party if Vajpayee gets the award?
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

        
	Speak no evil 
     
	Sir  I was shocked to read Sreyashi Dastidars tutorials to Harbhajan Singh to help him improve his linguistic skills. Dastidar argues that Bhajji should have called Andrew Symonds a malevolent macaque instead of monkey. Presumably, the Aussies would have found it difficult to understand the phrase and there would have been no cause for complaint (Its a jungle out there, Jan 10).
     
	Over the years, cricket has become the force that moves India most powerfully. The media has fed this craze to a large extent. Hence the chauvinism, conspiracy theories and general paranoia that accompanies every match India loses. The appalling behaviour of some of the Indian players  including a jig with the bat, a somersault after taking a wicket, or stripping down to the waist and waving a shirt from the balcony of the dressing room  are glossed over and perceived as acts of bravado. Action against an Indian player for his misdemeanour is considered to be an insult to the entire nation. Public outrage is stoked by sensational media reports. Most shocking in Dastidars article was the photograph of Symonds grimacing wildly, and the question to the readers, Which animal do you resemble most?. Symonds may not be the most handsome man around, but what point does the writer wish to prove? There might have been a balance of sorts if some of the moody shots of our own S. Sreesanth were printed alongside Symondss to prove that Indians too, when highly excited, are capable of looking rather odd. And advising the Indian cricketers to learn Shakespeare deserves a sweet ho-hum.
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Clarification
     
	Sir  Although The Telegraph thinks Orient loses Longman (Jan 15), the statement from J. Krishnadev Rao, our director (commercial)  quoted in the report contradicts it. He said clearly that Orient Longman has given up the suffix Longman  and not lost it  as an out-of-the-court settlement with Pearson Education, UK. We object to the use of the word loses, since it is incorrect.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Sonali Sengupta, Regional Manager, Orient Longman, Calcutta

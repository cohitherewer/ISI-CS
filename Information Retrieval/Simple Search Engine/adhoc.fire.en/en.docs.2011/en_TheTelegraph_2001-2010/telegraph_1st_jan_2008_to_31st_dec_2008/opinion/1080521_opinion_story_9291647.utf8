	President Putin has become Prime Minister Putin, without the presidential system of government becoming a parliamentary one. This ostensible political demotion, voluntarily accepted, may seem surprising. Why should a highly popular president, who has served out his two terms remarkably successfully, want to immediately occupy a lesser post and subordinate himself to his erstwhile subordinate? There have to be compelling reasons for this.        
	The key reason is to ensure that the country follows the course set for it by Vladimir Putin in his eight years in power. Mikhail Gorbachevs legacy was the collapse of the Soviet Union. Boris Yeltsins was a collapsing Russian state. Putins legacy lies in the restoration of the authority of the Russian state, the redressal of the countrys shattered economy and the re-establishment of its international role. This legacy the Russian ruling class wants not only to preserve but also to build on further, with Putin within the system rather than playing a mentors role from outside.        
	Putin has undoubtedly provided Russia stability and self-respect after the traumatic Yeltsin years. A broad consensus exists in the country on his policies and their direction. Only at the two ends of the mainstream political spectrum has there been opposition. The communists, with limited national support, confined largely to the older generation, have charged Putin with neglect of pressing social reforms and of the condition of those marginalized by the changes in Russia. The liberals have berated him for rolling back democracy and distorting economic reforms by creating a corporate state. Their criticism has found wide audience in Western political and media circles, creating negative impressions about Putin internationally.              
	But this Western attempt to bolster a few outspoken Russian politicians has damaged the cause of liberalism and democracy in Russia. The Russian liberals, lionized abroad, have become politically irrelevant at home. The more the West has lectured Russia on democracy, the more the Russian ruling class has muzzled the liberals at home with little adverse public reaction, as these elements are seen as instruments in the hands of the West to destabilize Russia from within in the way Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan were destabilized through coloured revolutions. Even the younger generation in Russia has become more conservative and nationalist in the face of slights administered to Russia and of Western disregard of its interests.        
	But for the phenomenal rise in oil prices, Putin may not have been able to pursue his internal and external agendas with the vigour with which he did. Russia now looms as an energy superpower, with Europe nervous about its growing energy-dependence on Moscow. With one billion petro-dollars flowing in daily, Russia has accumulated almost $530 billion as foreign exchange reserves, the third largest in the world, besides building a stabilization fund of almost $150 billion. In 2007, Russia grew by 7.7 per cent and the net private-sector flows into the country amounted to $82 billion. Gross domestic product per capita grew to $8660 in 2007 from $1320 in 1999. Whatever the political attacks on Russia, Western business interest in Russia, including American and British, is booming. Putin has ambitions to make Russia one of the five most developed economies of the world by 2020.         
	If growing Russian internal prosperity and external self-confidence are a reality, so are the major problems that the country continues to face. Russias industrial infrastructure is largely obsolete and its modernization requires massive investments. Russia had strengths in heavy engineering, civil aviation and ship-building and power sectors. Today the manufacturing sector contributes only 3.9 per cent to Russias export earnings. In space, atomic energy and defence, Russia is still competitive. Here, as in some other fields, Russia is consolidating its assets and creating mega state corporations to position itself better in the global market. It has begun to invest substantially in the knowledge economy, aware of the time it has already lost to others, including India, whose success in the IT sector has spurred Putin personally to build Russia into an IT power. For 14 years, Russia was strapped for financial resources for rebuilding its economy. Today, it has all the resources it needs, thanks to rocketing oil prices; indeed it has, in its recent history, including the period of the Soviet Union, never had it so good financially.        
	Russia cannot, however, be content to be primarily an exporter of oil and gas, raw materials, minerals and metals (69 per cent of its exports). Ironically, it has become an exporter of raw materials to China and imports manufactured products from that country  a far cry from the Soviet times. The bonanza from hydrocarbon exports has raised concerns that other sectors of the economy would get neglected at great future cost, and much needed economic reforms will be abandoned in the face of easily obtained prosperity  the so-called Dutch Disease. Russias demographic situation is calamitous, with the population declining by 750,000 people annually. Rampant corruption, bureaucratic heavy-handedness and a weak legal system are other ills affecting Russia. Social sector reforms in education, health and housing sectors and in agriculture are key to the modernization of Russias society and economy.        
	It is in the background of success already achieved, and all that remains to be done, that Putins decision to stay on in power should be seen. The Constitution obliged him to step down after two terms. He did not want it to be amended to accommodate him, although if this had been done, the public at large would have approved, given his wide popularity. As prime minister, Putin would be involved even more directly in implementing what really would be his own policies. Putins prime ministers were his creatures, but he will not be the new presidents creature. To the contrary. Therefore, whatever the constitutional position, power will shift de facto from the Kremlin to the Russian White House, the prime ministers office.               
	President Medvedev is Putins protg. His career has been built by Putin, whose election campaign manager, chief of staff and first deputy prime minister he was. As chairman of Gazprom, he has experience in a core area of the Russian economy. He can be best relied on to provide policy stability at the highest levels in the current context. Dmitry Medvedev, remarkably young at 42, untainted by any KGB background, presents a modern face of Russia, more congenial for the West. The Medvedev-Putin duo would be a well-adapted combination to deal with Russias internal and external challenges, of proceeding with modernization in secure conditions by retaining control over its vital national resources and resisting Western strategic pressures.        
	For India, Medvedev is an unknown entity, as he has had no direct contact with India. His rival for the presidency, Sergei Ivanov, had had extensive contact with India as defence minister. But continuity of relations with India will be a function of the reality of our common interests. Russias resurgence is occurring in parallel with Indias own economic rise, and this will dictate the course for the future. But as we wait to establish an equation with Medvedev, we already have a tried and tested equation with Putin. This would be most valuable in the period ahead for our ongoing cooperation in many sensitive areas. That Putin is prime minister may be troubling for the West, but for India this should be comforting.

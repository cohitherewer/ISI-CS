	There is life beyond euphoria, and that life may lie in the details. The fulcrum of Barack Obamas campaign was the message of unity. His victory speech also echoed that theme. The voting figures, despite his landslide win, and his capturing over 52 per cent of the popular vote, reveals startling fissures. The most obvious of these is the geographical divide. The south still remains Republican save New Mexico, Missouri and Florida; the last named showing a remarkable swing in favour of the Democrats. By and large, the south remains red, with a few dots of blue. This is worth noting in terms of history since originally it was the north that was strongly Republican. Other divisions are also equally revealing. White voters preferred John McCain, who secured 58 per cent of the white votes. Not unexpectedly, the trend is completely reversed if the black voters preferences are taken into account. Only four per cent of the black voters cast their ballots in favour of Mr McCain. The first time voters and the voters between the ages of 18 and 29 overwhelmingly favoured Mr Obama. This is only a mixed blessing since in 2004 adults over 55 years comprised 31 per cent of the electorate and 35 per cent of the voters. Mr Obama thus, in his message of change, cannot ignore the old and aged. The point is fortified by the results of at least two of the swing states: Florida and Pennsylvania where the old are a critical block.        
	The statistics suggest that the rainbow vote that Mr Obama had expected is somewhat discoloured at the edges. The president-elect cannot afford to ignore these edges if he wants to live up to his promise of being the president of even those who did not vote for him. This is where he should not allow the euphoria to get the better of his strong political and common sense. It is worth pointing this out because an overwhelming triumph, such as the one Mr Obama has achieved, tends to engender myopia. There is also the danger that Mr Obamas best intentions might get hijacked by a so-called black agenda. Mr Obama has deliberately positioned himself on a non-racist platform. For the sake of his call for unity, he cannot abandon this platform.        
	What will immediately demand Mr Obamas urgent attention is the future of the economy, Here Mr Obamas position is not too clear, but for the fact that a protectionist rhetoric runs through his speeches. Mr Obamas relative lack of experience may well be his biggest liability. The good thing is that he is fully aware of this. He described himself as never the likeliest candidate for this office. That he now occupies that high office is largely due to his charisma and the way he ran his campaign. Most of his problems will be those that he inherits. He has to solve these problems and give to his country a new vision and direction.

  In a case of dowry death, parents of the bride claimed that she died because they could not meet the in-laws demand for a scooter and a gold bangle. The husband contended that the question of asking for a scooter did not arise because he already had one. Upholding the view of the lower courts, the Supreme Court held that it was common knowledge that even if in-laws have several things, they still demand dowry. Dowry demand cannot be disproved on the ground that the in-laws already had the article claimed to be demanded as dowry, the court held. In this case, when it has been proved that there was demand for dowry, it is irrelevant that the accused already possessed a scooter (Kishan Singh vs State of Punjab).

	A case was started against a man for forcibly causing the miscarriage of a woman he had impregnated. The victim eventually got married to the accused and applied for setting aside the order of conviction. Rejecting her plea, the court said that the conviction could not be set aside as the offence was a non-compoundable (could not be taken back) one. However, in the light of the victims plea, the court reduced the mans sentence to the period of imprisonment already undergone (Hasi Mohan Barman vs State of Assam).
             
	Trade off
    
	A man who was accused of forcing a girl into the flesh trade filed an anticipatory bail plea claiming that the victim was a girl of easy virtue. Turning down his plea, the Supreme Court held that even if the statement were true, it was not a relevant factor for granting him anticipatory bail (State of Maharashtra vs Mohammed Sajid Husain and others).

	Amongst other, more immediate, emotions, Ratan Tata must have experienced some self-fulfilment when he unveiled the little Nano last week. For it not only marked the end of a project after years of co-ordinated effort; it was also the culmination of his own odyssey, which began much earlier. The Nineties caught the Tatas on the wrong foot. In the last days of J.R.D. Tata, the hold of Bombay House had weakened, and satraps had taken control of the various Tata companies. They did well in the protected world of controls; but the small firms that had flown below the radar in those days had started nibbling away at some of their markets. Worse, liberalization exposed the companies to foreign competition at a time, and it was followed by a downturn that affected the Tatas biggest companies in steel, automobiles and chemicals. Those were difficult times; the Tatas faced not just decline, but eclipse.        
	The vision Mr Tata brought to bear made all the difference at that stage. He aimed to make his companies competitive not only in India, but also in the world. He replaced satraps who could not perform, but to replace them, he sought able men and women from the next generation within his companies. He centralized just enough to impose financial discipline; within the financial parameters, he gave his executives considerable autonomy. He did not pursue short-term profits; but he defined a time horizon for each business within which the executives had to show performance. In a few cases, where the road to success was not clear, he sold off companies.        
	That saga has now ended; all the Tata companies are leaders in their fields. There is talk of Mr Tata hanging up his spurs, handing over to a new chairman. He has himself toyed with the idea; perhaps the only thing that has stopped him is that there is no obvious successor. He must also think that after having imposed a retirement age on over-aged satraps, he can hardly exempt himself from it. But the age criterion was really a proxy for competence; and Mr Tatas performance hardly leaves doubt on that count. Titles are unimportant; what matters is function. Someone else can take over the chairmans mantle; another title can no doubt be found for Mr Tata  mentor, elder, or whatever. Whatever it may be, he should stay on. For someone has to lead the Tatas into new territories. The Tata companies are already in command of their industries. They will not lack opportunities for expansion; and for it they would turn to Bombay House for resources. But all industries have their cycles; for a business house, it is important to scan the horizon all the time, and to enter emerging industries early. No one is better qualified for this residual function. It calls for a somewhat longer stint from Mr Tata.

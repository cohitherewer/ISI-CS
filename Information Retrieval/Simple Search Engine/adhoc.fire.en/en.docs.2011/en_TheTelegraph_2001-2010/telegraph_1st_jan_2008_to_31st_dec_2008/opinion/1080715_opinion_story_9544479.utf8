                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       MANY TASTES OF INDIA                                  Malvika Singh                              
	A midsummer madness seems to overwhelm India each year at this time. With Prakash Karats shenanigans having become predictable fare, spiced up with the Bharatiya Janata Party mouthpiece hailing him and a saucy Mayavati chatting with him about how to demolish the United Progressive Alliance government, the bhelpuri dished out to us last weekend was a forerunner of what we can expect over the next ten days. A variety of khichdis will be simmering on front and back-burners, some laced with hot red chillies and others bland and tasteless, competing to win the final accolade. A hungry India and Bharat, looking for healthy sustenance, will once again be disappointed.        
	The police in Uttar Pradesh have been shown up for having bungled the chargesheet of the Aarushi Talwar murder. The horrific truth that has emerged has brought to the fore the frightening reality of a corrupt authority. It has compelled decent and dignified citizens who want to live a clean and civilized life in a country that respects and abides by the law to step out and begin a fight for social justice that has ceased to operate in our democracy. Indians have become immune to corrupt leaders and their ill-gotten, undeclared wealth. This happens to be true of all parties and most politicians.        
	In this context, the recent CBI assault on Mayavati has no impact on the citizenry of this country. The latter has no respect any more for the mechanisms of good governance because such mechanisms, mandated to execute the law in a fair way, have now been brutally degraded to serve only the empowered individuals. The perception is clear  when Mayavati was a partner of sorts of the UPA, the governor of the state had saved her from the Taj Corridor mess and now, since she is an opponent, the CBI has begun to chase her on another case of disproportionate assets!                 
	Persistence pays        
	Wherever one goes, whoever one meets, they all, in tandem and across all party lines, believe that corruption is condoned if team members are guilty of malpractice. Only if you are outside of the dispensation, even if you are extorting less than some of the chaps in the ruling gaddis, you are deemed crooked and harassed. This CBI case will generate much sympathy for Mayavati and she will gain brownie points. Different rules for different people at different times spell anarchy!        
	As a professional voyeur, it has been quite amusing for me to watch all the senior Congress leaders who had, till very recently, damned Rahul Gandhi as an unthinking, non-political heir, suddenly matching their body language with his. They have now realized this is necessary if they want a future for themselves in the Congress. Their shift of stance has been blatant and unsophisticated as they run about giving the impression of secret power and prowess. These egoistic and failed Congressmen think they are infiltrating into a hitherto safe, isolated place and feel happy for being successful in breaking through the door. The renewed vigour and arrogance in their strut, with their noses in the air, give them away. What joy if they were to be used and then unceremoniously dumped for being opportunists and discarded for doing what they are best at  playing at being chameleons in the forests of political, administrative and corporate India. I say this because most of their ilk represent some entity, more often than not a corporate entity, occasionally a think-tank, for whom they play broker, helping to deliver favours from the sanctums of power that they have entered through sheer perseverance.        
	Manipulators and fixers understand the virtues of persistence even as they are insulted and ignored. They hang in at the door, scraping and bowing, knowing well that their day in the sun will come. That is what makes them different.

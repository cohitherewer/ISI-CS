	The trouble with all or nothing deals is that disagreement over a minor issue can neutralize the gains achieved on the rest of the agenda. The failure of trade ministers at the latest round of the World Trade Organization talks is the recent example. After having reached convergence on 18 of the 20 issues put before the trade ministers in Geneva, disagreement over tariffs on agricultural imports scuttled the entire deal. Cotton  which is of interest to several west African countries  was not even tabled. The United States of America and France blamed India and China for the inability to reach closure on the Doha Round. Both countries wanted a special safeguard mechanism to be able to raise import tariffs even beyond the level agreed to in the WTO. The US was unwilling to further reduce subsidies for its farmers  even if they were admittedly already below the levels agreed to in the WTO.         
	Political considerations emerged as drivers in the negotiations. The commerce minister, Kamal Nath, is adamant that farmers interests in India must be protected  especially following the spate of farmer suicides, and given that national elections are barely 10 months away. The US presidential elections are even closer: given the recession and declining consumption, the presumptive candidates from both parties are unlikely to make concessions. But there is one larger, adverse consequence of the failure of the Doha Round: food prices will not decline, which means that food price inflation is likely to stay high, or worse, get even higher. With inflation at the highest India has seen in almost a decade and a half, and a slowdown in the economy, high food prices cannot be good news for hundreds of millions of consumers, among them the very farmers whose interests the commerce minister claims to protect.         
	Is the failure of the latest round of talks the last nail in the coffin of the Doha Round, as many seem to suggest? Susan Schwab, the US trade representative, suggested to a newspaper that grand agreements  like the one the Doha Round is intended to conclude with  are obsolete. She also thinks an arrangement like the 1996 Informational Technology Agreement  it restrains the 70 signatory countries from imposing high tariffs on many high-tech products  would achieve separate, sector-specific agreements that work better. But the ITA model of future sector-specific agreements is also under threat: the US and the European Union are deadlocked over its interpretation. The US filed a suit in late May alleging that the EU violated the ITA by imposing high tariffs on new products, including a 14 per cent levy on flat-screen monitors. Now, the US is likely to move the dispute settlement body of the WTO at the end of August for the resolution of this issue. There seems to be nowhere else to go.

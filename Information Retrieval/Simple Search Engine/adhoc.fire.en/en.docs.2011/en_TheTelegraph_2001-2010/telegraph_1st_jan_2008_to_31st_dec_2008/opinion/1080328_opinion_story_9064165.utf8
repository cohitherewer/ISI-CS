	The results of the first democratic elections in Bhutan reflect the paradox that the voting represented. Of the two contesting parties, both of very recent birth, the Druk Phuensum Tshogpa has won 44 of the 47 seats, because voters perceived it as more likely than its rival, the Peoples Democratic Party, to implement the vision of Bhutans king. Bhutan was a contented Buddhist kingdom till the king, Jigme Singye Wangchuk, bewilderingly abdicated absolute power and insisted on a transition to democracy. The people elected a democratic government because their king wanted them to. The turnout was over 70 per cent, the voting well-managed, with none of the threats of disruption from Maoist outfits in Nepal and from militant formations in Indias Northeastern states being carried out. While Jigme Y. Thinley of the DPT takes over as prime minister, the kings son, Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk, will head the new government. A royalist party with the prince as head of government may look like monarchy in disguise. But in the new order, he can be impeached by a two-thirds majority in parliament. The king has determined the gradient of transition from monarchy to democracy in a country that showed no eagerness for change.        
	The people had many reasons to be contented. The kings vision of gross national happiness, which is a measure of progress through sustainable development and equity of distribution, had brought about increasing access to healthcare and education, a pollution-free environment, preservation of natural resources, and a gradual improvement of standards of living for many. Democracy, given the troubles in Pakistan and Bangladesh, had few attractions. Besides, the democratic process of competition, with its aggressive criticism, debate and trumped-up charges, was felt to be alien to the tranquil culture of the kingdom. But in spite of doubts, the first stage of transition to a full-fledged democracy, which the king feels is the best way to fit into a globalized world, has been successfully taken. Yet there remains an old shadow on the concept of national happiness. Thousands of Nepali-speaking Hindu Bhutanese, deprived of citizenship in the Nineties, were driven out and remain refugees within Nepals borders. They have paid the price of Bhutans cultural integrity. Democracy would be truly successful when it is able to embrace difference and pluralism.

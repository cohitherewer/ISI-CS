                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TWILIGHT OF A STATE                                                          
	Anarchy is the absence of government. What is worse is having a government without the ability to govern. This is what West Bengal is suffering from at this moment. A huge portion of one of the states main highways remains blocked with thousands of trucks with their freight lined up on the road, a new car factory with a deadline to meet is not allowed to function, and its employees are abused and stopped from leaving the factory  and the government is not lifting a finger to end this impasse. Everyone knows the person who has precipitated this situation: a political leader bent on getting political mileage at the cost of the economic development of the state. If this is not appalling enough, what is worse is the governments refusal to act even though there is a clear case of a threat to property and law and order in Singur and on the concerned stretch of the Durgapur Expressway. The government is failing to do its duty by the Tatas and by the carriers whose trucks have queued up because they are not being allowed to move.        
	One immediate result of this could be the exit of the Tatas from the Singur project. Ratan Tata cannot be blamed if, after reviewing the Singur situation, he arrives at the conclusion that the government of West Bengal is not in control of the situation or is, for some perverse reason, not willing to bring the situation under control. The management of Tata Motors has already indicated its line of thinking by ordering the workers at the Singur plant to stay away from work till the situation there is considered to be normal and safe. The bugler has taken up his position, as the sun sets over West Bengal, to sound the last retreat. This retreat will not be only that of the investments the Tatas have made in Singur or wanted to make elsewhere in the state. It will sound the retreat of all investments from West Bengal. The sounding of the last retreat would actually be an accompaniment to West Bengals swansong.        
	This inactivity of the government  the clich about Nero and his fiddling comes so readily to mind  is not without a long history. For over 30 years, the distinction between the government and the ruling political party has been systematically erased. As a result, the government of West Bengal thinks like West Bengals ruling party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Even the mandarins of the state do the partys bidding. Under the present circumstances, the government is pondering the political fallout, and not the impact on governance and administration. The whims of an irresponsible political leader are thus allowed to hold West Bengal to ransom. Or another way of looking at the prevailing situation is to conclude that West Bengal is inching towards the communist utopia: the State is beginning to wither away.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DOOMED CITY                                                    
	Indifferent to making people breathe poison air, Calcuttas keepers are just as brazen about being pulled up for this offence. The Central ministry of environment and forests has recently described Calcuttas air quality as significantly worse than the national standard. In an affidavit filed before the Calcutta High Court, the ministry has declared the state pollution control board as duty-bound to monitor the citys ambient air quality and to take all steps for air quality control. It has also asked the court to monitor how the PCB is doing this job. But the situation in Calcutta has now reached a stage when none of this makes much sense, the state government having reduced every kind of legal, political or public monitoring to a form of ineffectuality that is at once absurd, deadly and criminal. No indictment seems to matter any more, and it is also taken for granted that the people of Calcutta do not mind.        
	The Central ministry indirectly implicates the entire state government in its concern for Calcutta and its people. And this is how it should be. But what difference is it going to make in concrete terms? A few weeks ago, it seemed as if the transport minister had, at last, owned up to his responsibility in the matter. The media welcomed this with a new sense of hope. But nothing at all has come of this, and the ministers public statements and acts have shown no signs of heightened resolve, scruple or awareness. The corrupt, negligent, inept and brutally politicized system that keeps Calcuttas air vilely polluted has, by now, come to be a natural aspect of the citys celebrated character. The worst victims of this are the Calcuttans themselves. Not only do they have to die a slow death in the hands of their elected leaders, but they also seem to have accepted this as their irreversible destiny. The inevitability of having to cope with a noxious city seems beyond any form of concerted civic or political action. This vision of changeless doom is the worst thing to happen to a city and its people.

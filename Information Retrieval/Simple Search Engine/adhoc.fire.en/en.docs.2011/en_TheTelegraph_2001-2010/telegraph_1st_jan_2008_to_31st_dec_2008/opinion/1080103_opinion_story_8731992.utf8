	Glory days                  
	Sir  The Bharatiya Janata Party won in Himachal Pradesh and in Gujarat because of the extensive homework done by the party ever since its defeat in the Lok Sabha elections nearly four years ago. (Brave front hides Congress worries, Dec 29). The party now seems all set to return to power at the Centre when the next general elections take place. But the BJP must remember that it won a lot of seats in the two states because of two factors. In Gujarat, the Congress did not have a chief ministerial candidate who could take on Narendra Modi and, in Himachal Pradesh, the Bahujan Samaj Party ate into the Congresss vote bank. To make a comeback at Delhi, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance should provide good governance in the ten states it is in power today. After all, fulfilling electoral promises, especially the one on development, will be the key to win the next Lok Sabha polls.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  The BJP is in power in both Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. This has made the Congress fearful of Hindu votes getting polarized across north and west India. This perhaps has forced the Congress to change its stance on Taslima Nasreens stay in Calcutta. The Centre has now agreed to provide her security in Calcutta, subject to the concurrence of the Bengal government. Surprisingly, the government has not yet spelt out whether Taslimas visa will be extended or not. If the visa is not extended, the majority community in India may view it as the governments capitulation to Islamic fundamentalism. Moreover, the Congress frequently giving in to Left pressure has annoyed the electorate. The Congress, today, is unsure about its future, knowing fully well that it will have to confront the BJP everywhere. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), however, faces no such challenges on its turf. It will thus have no qualms in repeating what it did in Nandigram elsewhere, be it in Bengal or in Tripura.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Congress had portrayed Narendra Modi as a fascist whose wish was law in Gujarat and deplored Modi for his autocratic ways. The Congress prided itself on choosing candidates in a democratic manner, unlike the BJP, which, according to Congressmen, doled out to tickets to those who were close to Modi. However, the Congress seemed to follow in the BJPs steps in Himachal, issuing tickets to Prakash Chand Karad, the son of Sonia Gandhis cook, and Nand Lal, her one time bodyguard, for the polls in the state. Were these men chosen because they are more competent than other men in the party? By choosing these individuals, Sonia Gandhi has displayed not only her arrogance but also her disdain for those who praise the Congresss culture of internal democracy. She has certainly proved that her word is the law for the party.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Sonia Gandhi and her party should stop denigrating the BJP continuously. People are bored with their routine accusations. The electorate is not blind to the Congresss follies either. For instance, the Congress is concerned about the Gujarat riots, but not about issues such as the violence in Nandigram, the anti-Sikh riots in the Eighties, and the displacement of Kashmiri pandits. Similarly, the Congress glosses over the military debacle at the hands of China in 1962 but harps on the BJPs failure to check intrusion in Kargil. The Congress should accept the truth that it is no more a national party that used to form governments independently at one point of time. Today, it is the Left which decides the fate of the Congress government at the Centre. This fall from grace is the result of the Congresss mistakes alone.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Harischandra Parasuram, Mumbai

                
	Sir  The BJPs gains in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh would not be meaningful if it does not conduct itself in the manner of a responsible national party. Proceedings in the current Lok Sabha were disrupted on many occasions and meaningful discussion stalled by the obstructionist behaviour of parliamentarians belonging to the BJP. The party will have to answer the voters for its antics during the next general elections.           
	The party needs to shed its politics of hate and realize that millions of Muslims and Christians have been living in India for centuries and have as much claim on this land as everybody else. Hatred will only beget hatred and the rapid economic development that the BJP wants will never be possible under such circumstances. Seasoned leaders like A.B. Vajpayee and L.K. Advani should change the focus of the party if it is to take the recent victories in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh to their logical end in New Delhi.          
	Yours faithfully,      
N.S. Venkataraman, Chennai

                
	Sir  The results of the assembly elections in Himachal Pradesh call for immediate electoral reforms. It is necessary to stop the waste of resources in unnecessary by-elections that are held because of the chief-minister designate winning assembly elections and having to vacate his constituency seat on becoming the chief minister. The law should be amended to make a legislator resign his current seat before filing his nominations. It may be recalled that India was dragged into costly general elections because the Vajpayee government was defeated by a single, and controversial, vote of the then chief minister of Orissa, Girdhar Gomango, who was also a Lok Sabha member at that time.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                
	Sir  It is now obvious that the BJP is on a comeback trail. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance has been lacklustre in its performance at the Centre, with few successes to show for itself since it came to power. The BJP should now capitalize on its recent successes. The party already has almost the whole of north India under its sway. It needs to steer clear of fundamentalism and prepare itself for a fresh stint at Delhi.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Md Akhtar, Hyderabad

                                                                                                                 JUST ONE LAW                                                    
	Making and breaking rules must be one of the more exhilarating privileges of being a mayor. Calcuttas mayor and his municipal colleagues are about to introduce a bizarre system of legal double standards in this rapidly growing city. Illegal buildings in the citys added areas are going to be regularized (by making special provisions within the building rules), while those deemed illegal in the rest of the city will continue to be pulled down. This is part of the mayors budget proposal to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, and would affect about 2 lakh illegal buildings in the Behala, Jadavpur and Garden Reach area. The rationale offered by the mayor is a combination of dubious equivocation and equally suspect humanitarianism (he suddenly feels deeply concerned for the refugees settled in these areas). What this patently absurd abuse of civic authority undermines, first of all, is the very principle of legality itself, making it dependent on something as flimsy as location and thus paving the way for a mix of greed, lawlessness and local politicking that people in these areas are, by now, thoroughly used to. Inefficiency and corruption, if practised for long enough, cease to be so, and become part of an extended and inclusive redefinition of what is legal. This is, in effect, what the mayor and his men are suggesting through this proposal.        
	But what does this say about the future of this city? (The Supreme Court has been engaging, for the last few years, with very similar attempts on the part of Delhis civic authorities and politicians.) It is obvious that the recent Burrabazar fire has taught the citys keepers lessons that are purely cosmetic. The web of irregularities, involving everybody from landsharks to politicians, continues to be in place, with a few convenient adjustments of the law. But there seems to be no general vision of how to deal with a rapidly growing city. The problem of encroachment touches upon every aspect of civic life: safety, law and order, water supply, ecology and aesthetics, among others. None of this is ever substantially thought through by the citys civic authorities, who have been excited, since the budget, about building more food courts and multiplexes in the outer reaches of the city. This larger context of apathy and lack of scruples is ideal for the pushing through of legal double standards. The notion of legality cannot be altered in order to make it easier for the CMC to do its job properly.

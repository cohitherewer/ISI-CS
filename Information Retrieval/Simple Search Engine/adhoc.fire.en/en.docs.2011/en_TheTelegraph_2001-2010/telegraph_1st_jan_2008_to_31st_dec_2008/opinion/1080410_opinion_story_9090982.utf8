	Songs of experience                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitra agrees in principle with the claim that a crusade must be fought to save the tigers territory (The battle for habitat, March 31). But at the end of his piece, he expresses his displeasure, in a rather ridiculous manner, with the efforts of schoolchildren to spread that message among the masses. Mitra does not like the childrens campaigns ostensibly because there are no similar movements so far as the rights of tribals are concerned. He is perhaps unaware that one of the favourite hobby horses of Indian politicians since Independence has been the restoration of forest lands to the tribals. Of course, they are interested in this not for any altruistic reason, but to grab tribal votes. Since tigers cannot vote, their cause has never been seriously taken up by the people in power. As a result, it has been left to a handful of environmentally conscious men to take up the case of the tigers.          
	While politicians have played at championing the cause of the tribals, the indigenous peoples have been rapidly ousted from their land. And they have been dispossessed not by the tigers but by land sharks and industrialists patronized by politicians, and by illegal immigrants from across the borders. Political leaders have done nothing to check these threats and yet they brag about passing laws to protect the tribals. It is unfortunate that the onus of saving the magnificent beast from extinction has fallen on a few dedicated social scientists and activists just because the peoples representatives would not lift their fingers to conserve this natural heritage for future generations.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitra merely lists the problems around tiger conservation without offering any solutions. While the tribal population is perhaps as threatened as the tigers in the ruthless struggle for survival, tigers cannot be allowed to die simply so that tribals may live. The challenge lies in making the tribals accommodate tigers in their homelands as well as understand the value of the animals. This can be done by linking the local economy to tourism. Since tigers are bound to draw tourists, converting forestlands into reserve forests would benefit the tribals economically. For their own interest they would then stand up against poachers. This approach has worked in many parts of Africa and would no doubt work for India too.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Building blocks          
	Sir  The report, Dublin kids build Bankura school (April 7), talks about the munificence and generosity of the students from Dublin, but it also raises a lot of questions about the values our education system inculcates in the young. We are taught in schools to lend a helping hand to the underprivileged. But our education remains limited to books, to learning by rote, and to answering questions in examinations. We are never encouraged to do something that would actually make a difference to the poor. When it is pointed out to the state education minister, Partha Dey, that voluntary organizations have to undertake the construction and repair of rural schools because the government is indifferent towards them, he calmly denies the allegations. With the usual callousness of ministers towards the condition of schools and students, he says, We, too, allot funds for repair and renovation of schools. Deys apathetic words only bring out his dissimilarity with someone like John Alexander, who is the project leader of the team from John Scottus Senior School in Dublin. He made every final-year student of his school raise funds for building the school in Raotora by selling cakes, pastries and craftwork. It is no use expecting something similar from the sons of our soil. Our career and exam-oriented education system can only produce men like Partha Dey rather than teachers like Alexander.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The sincerity and humility of the young students of John Scottus Senior School in Dublin is to be admired. They served a village some 8,500 km away from their home in a way that few of our own children would ever do. They not only did menial jobs like washing cars to raise money for the school but also, while in Raotora, they dug the soil or mixed concrete from 8 am to 2 pm while living on a diet of mainly rice and mashed potatoes. Ireland had been a poor country, and under British rule, like India not so long ago. But unlike India, in the years following liberation, Ireland has managed to build a prosperous economy while India continues to fester in the dumps. The gulf becomes even more evident when one looks at the students of John Scottus school. The children of affluent schools in India hardly spend any time on social work. They prefer sitting before their computers and chatting with friends than washing cars or laying bricks, and that too for the wellbeing of others. Cant they take a leaf out of the books of their counterparts from Dublin?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Who put her in?          
	Sir  News channels across the country took a break from their routine stories to report the rescue of two-and-a-half-year-old Vandana from a 180-foot borewell into which she had fallen (Child rescued from borewell, March 27). Several children have fallen into uncovered borewells in different parts of India in the past, and, not surprisingly, all of them have been from poor and socially backward families. In the absence of playschools or parks for them, poor children have no option but to play in open spaces. How many more must be trapped in borewells before our administration decides to do anything about the problem of uncovered pits?           
	Motorists and pedestrians also fall into cable trenches regularly, and get severely, often fatally, injured. In this developing country, holes are dug for water pipes or telephone lines right in the middle of busy streets. If only the ditches are covered after the work is over, many human lives can be saved.                     
	Yours faithfully,

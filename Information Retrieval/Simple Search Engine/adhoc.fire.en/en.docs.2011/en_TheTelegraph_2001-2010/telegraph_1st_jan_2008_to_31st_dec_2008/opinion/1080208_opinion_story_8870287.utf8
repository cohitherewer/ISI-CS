	Troubled times and places            
	Without Dreams (HarperCollins, Rs 275) by Shahbano Bilgrami was longlisted for the Man Asian Literary Prize 2007. It tells the story of Haroon and Abdul, growing up in the same aristocratic household, but on two sides of the class divide. Haroon is the son of Javaid and Tahira  Sahib and Begum Sahib  and Abdul a mere servant boy. Different as their worlds might be, they are also similar in their miseries and sordidnesses. While Haroon must witness his mothers abuse at the hands of his father, Abdul silently suffers the violence in the servants quarters. Many years and many turmoils later, Haroon is left wondering whether Abdul existed at all, or was only his alter-ego.                 
	Selected Short Stories (Samay, Rs 200) by Kana Basu Misra is what could be called domestic tales of Bengals middle- and upper-middle classes. These are the kind of stories that have become a staple of the pujabarshiki magazines. The stories are peopled with successful Bengali men in corporate or government jobs, their bored or much-in-love wives and school-going children, young boys and girls fresh in college and eager to find new love, and also the Bengali diaspora in the US. But urban women are by far the most notable presence in the stories, and it is their lives and thoughts that seem to interest the author more than anything else. Aloknanda Roys translation is jerky in places, and the collection could have done with better editing.                                 
	Empower Yourself (Penguin, Rs 295) by Ajay Poddar promises to provide New Life Solutions for Health and Well-being. It lists, in complicated terms, the things many of us have contemplated doing but largely failed to translate into reality. For many others, though, it makes better sense to live in the moment than to worry about such things as the negative chi.

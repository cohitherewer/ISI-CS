	Funny side of democracy            
	Mikes election guide 2008 (Penguin, Rs 250) by Michael Moore is a hilarious account of this years US presidential elections through the eyes of Moore, who explores solemn political issues critical for America and the world with a deceptive, but refreshing, lightheartedness. So we have people asking questions concerning WMDs, gay marriage, abortion and the church, and about Americas waning influence on the globe, and Moore answering them by combining wit and insight. Those looking for a balanced, objective political analysis will find Moore a disgrace, but that is exactly the point of this charming, slim volume: a no-holds-barred look at some of the chequered truths about the worlds most powerful democracy.                        
	The Black Silk Road (HarperCollins, Rs 195) by Janet Wise seems to have been inspired by A Mighty Heart, although the plot has been suitably tweaked for the sake of originality. A French journalist, Claude Bravard, is killed in Karachi when he stumbles on incriminatory evidence pointing to Americas involvement in arms and narcotics trade. Cassandra, his American widow, arrives eight years later to investigate the grisly truth behind her husbands murder, and finds, among other things, a world full of deceit and intrigue, as well as the first flickers of a new love.                                
	Prostitution and Beyond: an analysis of sex work in India (Sage, Rs 395) is an edited volume that uses different methodologies to explore the varied dimensions of sex work.The editors, Rohini Sahni, V. Kalyan Shankar and Hemant Apte, have divided the book to study the notion of space in sex work, its inherent heterogeneity and history, and its bearing on law, economics and health. This is a valuable book for it not only breaks down the popular visual imagery of prostitution but also asks whether the responsibility of bettering these womens lives lies with NGOs and womens groups alone.                        
	The One (Diamond, Rs 195) by Narayan Arvind tells the story of a boys search for a supreme entity who appears on earth with divine powers. The convoluted plot is full of strange things  the Great One speaks in a slightly anglicized tone. It will be a miracle if the reader asks more from Arvind after turning these pages.

	Fuelling trouble                  
	Sir  It is high time the Indian government took quick, hard decisions on fuel pricing. From $50 to $126, and now $135 per barrel, global crude oil prices have been surging relentlessly. Predictions are that oil prices may even go beyond $200 (Rupee feels the jitters, May 7)! The governments populist politics have been making oil companies run at huge losses. There is no economic pragmatism in refusing to reduce the taxes levied on oil. Big names such as Reliance Industries have had to close all their petroleum retail outlets while ONGC has put on hold its decision to open new outlets. The government is issuing oil bonds and creating off-budget liabilities that will at best be a palliative for the increasing prices of petroleum products. This will result in heavy subsidies on petroleum products and consequent deficit financing, leading to inflation. The Indian economy will be in deep trouble unless the government re-evaluates the industrial policy for the automobile sector. With the boom in the automobile industry, fuel consumption has increased, not to mention traffic congestion. A majority of private vehicles carry only about half their passenger capacities. In countries like Britain and the United States of America, car pooling is encouraged and there are specific measures to discourage the use of private cars during peak hours. For instance, parking charges in the central business districts are very stiff in these countries. Most people take the underground rail or bus to work. Vehicular population is thus kept under control.          
	The aviation boom is tottering now with increased fuel prices. Indian roads are so bad and ill-maintained that it is impossible to save fuel while driving on them. With the annual demand for fuel rising by 10 per cent, a time will come when India will not have enough foreign exchange to fund oil imports, which will go on becoming expensive. The fertilizer, power and transport sectors depend mainly on crude and 90 per cent of Indias requirements are imported. There is no reason why fuel for private vehicles should be subsidized. Prices of oil products should be deregulated to their market levels and taxes moderated. The emphasis should be on the expansion of infrastructure for public transport. Since oil is not going to last for ever, its consumption can be contained by exploring alternate sources of energy like solar power. The use of bicycles should be encouraged all over the country. This will also improve the health of the citizens by curbing pollution.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Once again the government is considering hiking fuel prices in the country in view of the steep rise in international crude oil prices (Diesel to be lucky in next round fuel price hike, May 24). It is necessary to ensure that the heavily subsidized diesel is not used by the affluent. For instance, it should not be used for private SUVs or tourist taxis. Surely it makes no sense to spend taxpayers money to provide relief to wealthy owners of diesel cars? Further, diesel is a big pollutant and so the government would do well to adopt the Delhi model of using CNG for public transport vehicles.           
	Yours faithfully,       
J.N. Mahanty, Puri 

                
	Sir  Many are worried about the unimpeded rise in global oil prices, leading to a global energy crisis. With demand rising, production at a near-stand still and cartelization by the Oil and Petroleum Exporting Countries, oil price is now on its way to reaching the $200-per-barrel mark. Oil is indispensable for the transport sector and unless this dependence is reduced drastically, the price is unlikely to come down. Biofuels have been identified as an alternative to crude oil, but they can only be produced at the cost of arable lands. Perhaps the only solution lies in looking to primary energy sources like water and solar power, but it may take years for this to reach a satisfactory scale. India should charge a high duty on oil for private transport and encourage a switchover to battery-powered cars. Diesel must be banned except for rail and public transport, and small cars should be encouraged as much as possible.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  With the rise in oil prices and an increase in the demand for LPG cylinders, consumers in India are bound to be hit hard. The huge subsidies that the government is doling out to appease its vote banks have worsened the situation further, leading to staggering losses. As a stop-gap arrangement, a policy of LPG rationing is doing the rounds in corporate circles. Under this policy, each consumer, who has been allotted two cylinders, will have one of these refilled once in two months. The absence of any alternative fuel has deepened the crisis. Instead of taking any drastic step, the government should bring in differential pricing of LPG cylinders and subsidies should be given only to those who earn below a certain income level. Adequate precaution should be taken against the pilferage of domestic LPG for commercial or transport purposes. Black-marketing and hoarding should also be checked. These measures, if adopted, could improve the situation both for the oil companies as well as the consumers.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Left behind          
	Sir  The people of Northeast have been given the short shrift by the Indian Premier League. This, in itself, is nothing unusual, given the indifference with which the Centre has treated this region for years. We have not been blessed by the surge of development that the rest of the nation is currently undergoing. For much the same reason, the selectors of the IPL teams did not feel it necessary to look for cricketers in this region. Although the celebrity owners named their teams after different regions, no one thought it worthwhile to have a team from the Northeast. This has prompted players like Abu Nasim Ahmed, Sujoy Tarafdar and Pervez Aziz to join the rival Indian Cricket League because they do not seem to have much of a future under the BCCI.          
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Failing to deliver
                                                                                                                 FAILING TO DELIVER                                  Fifth column - Sumanta Sen                              
	When she posted a resounding victory in Uttar Pradesh in the last assembly election, expectations ran high that Mayavati would get down to the task of administering the troubled state in a serious manner. The expectations were roused for two reasons: first, Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party was not sharing power with any other party and hence there was no problem of somebody breathing down her neck. Second, since Mayavati had succeeded in stitching together a Dalit-Brahmin-Muslim combination, her political sagacity, it was hoped, would be reflected in the functioning of her government.        
	These hopes, alas, have being wholly belied. The BSP supremo appears to be more interested in trying out her hand at such social engineering in other states rather than on running the show meaningfully in Lucknow. It is too early to say whether her political ploy will succeed on a wider scale. In Gujarat for instance, she merely managed to put a spanner in the Congresss works. And, in the process, the larger issue of administration seems to have escaped her or, as one view put it, the issue was always beyond her. She is, of course, talking all the while of cleaning up the administration which so often in India means that a witch hunt is on. Her decision to dismiss thousands of policeman who had been appointed by the Mulayam Singh Yadav ministry certainly goes to strengthen the feeling that her primary concern is to teach her principal opponent a harsh lesson. Efforts are also on to get him and his family entangled in various cases over alleged irregularities.                 
	Larger than life        
	And what does she do when she is not after Mulayam Singh Yadav? She is busy getting plans to be drawn up to ensure that she is not forgotten, even in the distant future. She hopes to achieve this not through her work as chief minister, but with the help of a statue of herself. The first instance of a living politicians statue being erected was that of Kamraj in the city then known as Madras. Those responsible for the act were not far-sighted enough to see the day when the man would be forgotten with his passing away.        
	But why are Mayavatis efforts always directed at self-assertion? What prompted her to seek security cover of the type reserved only for the president and the prime minister? She, of course, has made no secret of her desire to be prime minister. But then, that is for the people to decide and, as for the present, there is no reason for Mayavati to be accorded that kind of security. Significantly, the request from Lucknow was made a day after Benazir Bhuttos assassination. Perhaps this indicates the league in which the chief minister wants herself to be seen.        
	It is Mayavatis attitude that poses a problem. In her mind, she has carved out a larger-than-life image of herself. She expects the world to bow down before her and raise a cheer even as she goes about her whimsical ways. Thus, she sees nothing wrong with a picture that shows Dalit subjects worshipping her as she sits in her silken finery, gold and diamonds glittering all over her. She feels there is no need to explain how her humble background could have allowed her to amass the property she has in various parts of north India. A crusader like Mayavati is expected to adhere to some principles in public and private life. Instead, she seems to be using her Dalit identity for self-aggrandizement than anything else. The Dalits themselves cannot be unaware of this, but they are yet to acquire the courage to rise against their leader.         
	Unfortunately, if at the end of her term, she is seen as a failure, as may well be the case, the resultant fall will not just signal the end of the road for Mayavati. It may also put out the hope that the wretched of the earth will, one day, free themselves from their bonds.

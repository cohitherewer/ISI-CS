	Kamal Nath, as minister of commerce, has taken an active part in meetings convened all over the world to prepare for a new round of trade negotiations. In each, he has put forward two views. First, he has told industrial countries that a new round cannot start unless they pay an entry fee upfront in the form of a reduction in their agricultural subsidies. Second, he has told them that Indias high agricultural protection is not negotiable; he has said that he would not throw the poor Indian farmer to the wolves. This position has been criticized in these columns from a liberal viewpoint  which was also the Indian governments viewpoint at the time of the reforms of the early Nineties. Over the years, it brought down industrial tariffs to a level comparable to east Asian countries. It brought down agricultural tariffs as well, but pushed them up again after 2001 when it abolished import licensing. While we have been left behind as liberals, India is now a tiger, and a tiger has a right to change its stripes. So the governments change of position is understandable. 
    
	It is not only understandable, but also defensible. A team of economists, led by Sandra Polanski of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has massaged a computable general equilibrium model of India to obtain results that should warm the commerce ministers heart. It shows how volatile world cereal prices are. From $580 a ton in 1981, the price of rice fell to $180 in 2004, and the price of wheat from $220 to $140. If the government allowed free imports, it would expose Indian agriculture to these fluctuations. If the domestic price of rice fell by 50 per cent, 8 per cent of the workers employed in rice cultivation would lose their jobs. True, there would be a 0.43 per cent increase in manufacturing employment, but that would not offset the 0.86 per cent fall in agricultural employment. Villagers would be adversely affected; the more deprived  whether scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, other backward caste  the more they would be affected. 
    
	The net effect on the entire economy would be minute, and the impact on townspeople would be favourable; but everyone knows that India lives in its villages. The Carnegie team also does not calculate second-order effects: for instance, people may eat more rice, workers may work on other crops, and the money saved on rice may be spent somewhere else. But these are minutiae which need not concern policy-makers. The important point is that opening up to international trade has distributional effects, and one can get an argument against it by concentrating on the groups that lose. In fact, one can build up an argument for restricting trade on this basis. If the government bans all foreign trade, at least some people will be better off; it only has to find out who.

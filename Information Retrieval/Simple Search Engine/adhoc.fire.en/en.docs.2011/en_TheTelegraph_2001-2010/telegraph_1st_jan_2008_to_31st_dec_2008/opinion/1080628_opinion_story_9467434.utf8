	Have less faith  
	Sir  The Kerala education board has taken a bold, progressive and commendable step by encouraging a dumbing down of the emphasis on religion in a social studies book taught in schools (Religious see red in textbook, June 25). While the book has expectedly raised many hackles, the harsh fact is that religion is a major divisive force the world over. Religious bodies and their leaders for the most part have demanded blinkered, unquestioning obedience. Social studies books should instil reason and objectivity in growing minds, and the power to choose ones beliefs.           
	Yours faithfully,         Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 
        
	Privilege and merit          
	Sir  Ashok Mitra is correct about the advantage of affluence for quality higher education in India (The time bomb, June 23). Not only the poorer section of society, even middle class families would find it difficult to finance the entrance fee of Rs 12.5 lakh for a management course at one of the premier business schools in the country. Financially backward families can in no way provide the collateral required by banks for a loan scheme. A possible way out would be the institution agreeing to a deferred payment system, wherein the companies recruiting the graduates in future would be responsible for repaying the institutes fees. This way the meritorious but financially underprivileged students would get a level playing field.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  While it is true that the principle of equal opportunity holds little meaning for those with modest means in India, Ashok Mitra could have chosen his examples better. There are many who take their lives even before they have finished high school. One feels the deepest sympathy for them and their loved ones, but it is not fair to accuse the free market alone for these deaths, letting psychological, academic and personal factors off the hook.           
	In the specific case of exorbitant entrance fees for courses at institutes of higher learning, there should be easy loan schemes with payment holidays. Surely, the vast majority of those bright enough to gain admission in these prestigious institutes will have the wherewithal to pay their loans back within a few years, if not months, of graduating and landing the plum jobs Mitra speaks of. If the government is interested in fostering equality of opportunity, all it has to do is to encourage the movers and shakers of the financial world to announce more loan schemes of this kind. At present, India is providing Western industry and economy with readily available, trained labour at a cost lower than what similarly skilled professionals in their own countries would charge. True inequality of opportunity is where a bright child in a small village does not even have a light bulb to study under. Sadly, this is still a reality in India. Those who have managed to complete their schooling are the privileged lot in our country.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Taking stock          
	Sir  The stock markets seem to be following the format of the Twenty20 cricket match these days. The frenzy is certainly the same. The Bulls and the Bears have reached the finals in what seems like an endlessly continuing match. The star players for the Bulls are good financial policy, the forecast of good monsoons (therefore good crop yield) and excellent performance results of the key companies. The Bears have on their team high inflation, oil crisis and political instability coupled with the impending elections. Now it is up to the stock indices to play umpire and decide who wins, while hapless investors stay glued to their stock market terminals.           
	Yours faithfully,

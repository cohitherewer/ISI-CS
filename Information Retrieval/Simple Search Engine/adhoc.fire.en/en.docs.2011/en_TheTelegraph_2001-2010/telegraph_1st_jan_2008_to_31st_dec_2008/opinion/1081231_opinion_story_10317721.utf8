	Money terms                  
	Sir  Dipankar Dasgupta has discussed quite a few economic theories to explain the uncertainties of market behaviour except perhaps the most relevant one  behavioural economics (Towards uncertainty, Dec 11). All neoclassical models assumed rational behaviour and choice by economic agents, and modern policy prescriptions assume this too. But economic models today rely too much on mathematical abstractions than on real human behaviour. Classical economic models had close links with psychology and human behaviour. Adam Smiths The Theory of Moral Sentiments examines psychological principles of individual behaviour vis--vis economics, while Jeremy Bentham wrote extensively on the psychological underpinnings of utility. Then, economists began to distance themselves from behavioural patterns, as they sought to reconstruct the discipline as a natural science, with explanations of economic behaviour deduced from assumptions about the nature of economic agents. But the shift from behavioural links has had an adverse effect on policy-making exercises.           
	In the Sixties, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman applied cognitive models of decision-making under risk and uncertainty to economic models of rational behaviour. This triggered the study of behavioural economics that is still relevant to the analysis and understanding of todays financial upheaval. Tversky and Kahneman, in 1979, wrote Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk, that documented divergences of economic decision-making from neo-classical theory. Gary Becker tried to establish a link between crime, psychology and economics. In Models of Bounded Rationality, Herbert Simon explained how people act irrationally and instead of maximizing utility, as generally assumed, tend to be satisfied. Other effects have been factored into behavioural economics, such as overconfidence and the effects of limited attention. Daniel Kahneman got the Nobel prize in 2002 for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty. Sadly, behavioural economics still seems to be neglected as a mainstream domain of study.

	Sir  Private banks are not willing to reduce their interest rates even after various measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India, such as cuts in the the repo rate or modulations in the cash reserve ratio to bail them out (Bank lethargy in pruning rates irks RBI, Dec 18). It means that there is greater profit for the banks while the customers are living on the edge. The private banks are well aware that the RBI watchdog may keep an eye on how they function, or may even admonish them from time to time, but it will never act against them. So the banks continue to harass the helpless customers.

	Sir  Srikumar Bondyopadhyays suggestion that Equity-linked savings schemes are still your best bet when it comes to saving taxes appears to put undue emphasis on mutual funds as the preferred route for investments under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act (No place ELSS, Dec 8). Heres why: First, ELSS has a 3-year lock-in period, as the writer states himself, so it is useless to make a review of ELSS over a 5-year period. The specific ELSS details provided on the 52-week low and current NAV are the relevant details and a cause for worry to many who have chosen this form of investment in 2006, 2007 and even in early 2008, because of the possible financial loss on redemption at such low net asset values. It is also too early to state that NAVs seem to have touched the bottom and may not go down further. After this recession, one must be acutely aware of the risks involved in investing in ELSS, and should even be prepared for a loss or a no-gain situation at the end of the lock-in period.

	Out of track          
	Sir  Indian Railways has commendably improved its public relations management system. The organization now has several hotlines, online booking facilities and tie-ups with some tourist agencies, which offer special services to railways passengers. But what has not changed at all is the poor announcement systems installed at the stations. Nasal voices turn the important announcements of arrival and departure into incomprehensible gibberish. The electronic devices and microphones are not maintained properly. Sometimes, at the small stations, where recorded voices are not used for the announcements, the staff use only vernacular languages, much to the inconvenience of tourists from other states or countries. This does no good to the image of the national railways.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Prinsep Ghat-Habra local of the circular railways starts from Prinsep Ghat at 5.30 pm everyday and halts at Tala station for about 25 minutes for unknown reasons. As a result, the train not only gets delayed but also becomes overcrowded. Passengers in the compartments regularly complain of breathlessness and even fall ill. The railways authorities continue to be indifferent towards the comfort of passengers.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Without a right          
	Sir  I shifted residence from Jamshedpur to Calcutta about two years ago. With the move, I have lost my right to vote. My bank account and cooking gas connection have been smoothly transferred, but my application for the cancellation of my voters registration in Jamshedpur was rejected, without any reasons being furnished. I am 79, but a voter no more. Am I not a citizen of the country then?          
	Yours faithfully,

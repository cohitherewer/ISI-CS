	In the history of presidential elections in the United States of America, a caucus or a primary occupies an odd, if significant, position. On the face of it, it is nothing more than an audition for a play where the principal players announce their intentions, and selections are made. In the case of a caucus, the selection is made on the basis of a vote. But winning a caucus is no guarantee of becoming the presidential candidate of a particular party. Thus, Barack Obamas victory in the Iowa primary is important, but it by no means ensures that he will be the candidate of the Democratic Party for the elections in November. The Iowa results suggest that a sizeable portion of the registered Democrat voters in Iowa will vote for Mr Obama at the partys national convention.        
	The importance of the Iowa primary lies elsewhere. Mr Obama is the first black candidate to ever win a primary. (The word black should, however, be used with some qualification for Mr Obama. His father, who came from Kenya, married a white woman from Kansas. Mr Obama is thus not all black.) Even as well-known a black leader as Jesse Jackson had not succeeded in winning a primary. The colour of Mr Obamas skin acquires some salience because race remains a highly contentious and emotive issue in the US, and also because Iowa is 95 per cent white where most people live in villages and are known to be conventional. The Iowa vote might be carrying a message to those states that have a large black population. Such states  for example South Carolina, which holds its primary later in January  might prefer Mr Obama over Hillary Clinton, who emerged third in the Iowa primary.        
	Mr Obamas popularity may be intangibly linked to his mixed origin. The most tangible factor is his open opposition to the Iraq war. This is in sharp contrast with the position of Ms Clinton on the issue. Ms Clintons stand has been somewhat dodgy. Another factor is his promise that he would institute universal healthcare. Both these strike a chord in the hearts of millions of Americans. This is also where Mr Obamas colour of skin matters. It symbolizes change, something that many Americans are yearning for after two terms of George W. Bush. There is also the profound distrust that the surname Clinton evokes in the US. Bill Clinton, unfortunately for Ms Clinton, is a divisive figure, and this may well work to Mr Obamas advantage.        
	One primary does not a presidential candidate make. History has many names who lost the Iowa primary and then went on to get the top job in the White House. The names of Jimmy Carter and Mr Clinton come to mind. What Mr Obamas win in Iowa has done is to throw the presidential race wide open. It has also substantially reduced Ms Clintons predominance in the national and state popularity charts. It has opened up the possibility of a non-white man with the middle name Hussein to be a contender for the worlds most powerful job.

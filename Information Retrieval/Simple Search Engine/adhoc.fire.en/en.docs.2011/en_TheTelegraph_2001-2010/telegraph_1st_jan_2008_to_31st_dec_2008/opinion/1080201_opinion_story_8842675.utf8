	THE BLOODSTONE PAPERS By Glen Duncan, Pocket Books, Rs 326
    
	Glen Duncan is usually crude, increasingly morbid, unnecessarily crass ! But one cant really blame the forty-something author of five other novels who made his name with sex and violence. 
    
	If commerce is Duncans aim, he has just got to keep firing away from the hip, or thereabouts. But if he wants to be a writer who will be remembered well after he has stopped firing, he needs to take a call. He should read some of his own writing  some of the brilliant passages and memorable lines in his latest novel, The Bloodstone Papers.
    
	Like the author, the forty-something protagonist, Owen Grant Monroe, sadly and every now and then, loses it. Both give in to loose talk and looser morals at the drop of the heros pants. 
    
	The first in his family to be born in England, Duncans latest novel amplifies the pain that his racially-mixed heritage has put him through. He moves from his parents past in India to his present in the United Kingdom, pondering on issues of race and roots, of identity and idiosyncracies. He swings from London to Lahore and tiptoes from Bolton to Bhusawal. He bounces from Mountbattens last days in India to todays terror-filled ones in the UK. 
    
	Duncan, though, has made it known that his story  about a young man trying to unravel the truth about his fathers past  is largely fictional. Like Ross Monroe in the book, his father Armine Duncan, now in his eighties, was a railway guard and a boxer in an India where Anglo-Indians had carved out their own lifestyle, their own turn-of-phrase and their own lives. From a comfortable life of songs, dances and servants, the authors own parents settled in Bolton after Independence, where Armine became a bus conductor.
    
	The doting parents, to whom this book is dedicated, have seen it all. Duncan has admitted in an interview with Tim Teeman that they went through a brutal baptism of fire in the principles of racism. My fathers skin is darker than my mothers. He would get turned down by landlords. She would be told that the same property was available. My father had looked down on Indians in India. Now the shoe was on the other foot. I used to joke with him that he had gone from a sahib to a wog overnight. 
    
	The Bloodstone Papers tells the story of a sometimes sentimental, sometimes sexual Owen Monroe, who is balancing three jobs  lecturer in a college, undercover porn-writer and trying-to-get-under-the-covers pub-worker. He is also trying to write an account of his parents lives in India in the Forties and Fifties. Ross and Kate Monroe are ordinary Anglo-Indians whose lives are made to seem anything but that in this masala-filled potboiler. It is an intriguing mix of hustlers, conmen and an unknown future that find relief and sustenance in Owens present.
    
	The Bloodstone Papers is a satisfying read even for prudes like me, for Glen Duncan is as skilled with his pen as Ross was with his gloves on; and he takes delightful word-risks. His is a busy, experimental style that can sting and soften you with the same swishy brushstroke. But there are two more reasons to read Bloodstone: Duncans innocent sense of humour (for example, With millions of other men I feel a draft of death every time Brad Pitt takes his shirt off on screen.) and his Anglo-Indianisms, such as the Chinese waiter with the Hitler tash! Make sure you down a couple of whets before you read about the priest nicknamed Gurru and his GBCs (Gurrus Bum Chums).

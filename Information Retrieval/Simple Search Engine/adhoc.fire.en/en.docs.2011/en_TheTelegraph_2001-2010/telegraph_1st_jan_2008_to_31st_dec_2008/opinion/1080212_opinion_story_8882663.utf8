	Blood and protest                  
	Sir  After the bloodbath in Cooch Behar, the All India Forward Bloc, a constituent of the Left Front government, will think twice before resorting to violent means of protest against the repressions of its Big Brother, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (Bloc salvo at own govt, Feb 7). Nor will bandhs, aimed at shutting down the state, help. Besides, the Forward Bloc leaders know what the party stands to lose if it quits the Left Front. No wonder then that Ashok Ghosh, the general secretary of the party, has been extremely cautious in his statements to the media. The Bloc has two options to choose between: to stick to the Front and enjoy the residual powers bestowed upon it by the CPI(M), or to leave the Left Front to begin a new movement. If the party opts for the latter, it can highlight its commitment to fighting for the poor and the common people of Bengal. It is clear now that the people of Bengal want change, and the Forward Bloc can cash in on this sentiment. Although the party, like the CPI(M), has long degenerated into a bourgeois outfit, its fight for the farmers, especially in Cooch Behar, is still remembered. If it is sincere about peoples welfare, it should continue to raise the demand for Sixth Schedule status for parts of north Bengal. For this purpose, it needs to involve people in a democratic process.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
D.B. Rai, Gangtok

                
	Sir  The Bangla bandh called on February 6 by the Forward Bloc, a Left Front partner, has exposed the opportunism and saboteur mindset of its leaders. The party has been belligerent for some time, ostensibly because of its differences with the CPI(M)s industrialization policy. Should the Bloc leaders not have discussed the matter with the Left Front government and settled the issue then? If a reconciliation with the CPI(M) was not possible, the Bloc should have left the government and the Left Front. It seems that the partys leadership was in no mood to forego the privileges of power they have been enjoying. But they wanted to project the partys rebel image too, with an eye to the panchayat elections. And so, the people of the state witnessed, on February 6, a unique bandh called by a constituent of the ruling alliance. The bandh was far from non-violent, indicating that the Supreme Court ruling against bandhs holds little meaning in West Bengal.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Carrying a deserted picture of Dalhousie Square on the front page (Feb 7), along with the caption, Is Calcutta a city of cowards? was in bad taste. It was an insult to the people of Calcutta because the word coward does not describe the behavioural pattern of even those Calcuttans who prefer to stay indoors during a bandh. They can at best be called timid. After all, the State does not guarantee a citizens safety if he ventures out during a bandh. In fact, if one gets into trouble in a bandh, he is branded a fool. If we must identify the real cowards, we have to point to those who cannot or do not want to enforce the court ruling that bandhs are illegal.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Just the other day, a non-Bengali friend of mine commented that if Mumbai is Indias financial capital and Delhi the political capital, then Calcutta is the cultural capital. I asked him what he meant by the word culture. Agriculture, horticulture, pisciculture and so on could also be called culture. But if culture has to do with creativity in the spheres of art, literature, science, and so on, then it has been dead in Bengal for quite some time now. One should not talk of the 19th century anymore; that was a long time ago. What we have now is the culture of bandhs. I spent several years in Madras (now Chennai), Bombay (Mumbai) and Delhi and never saw anything similar there. But Bengals peoples parties never think twice before robbing the daily wage-earners of their livelihood. Nor have I ever come across a bandh here that has successfully solved a problem. A bandh is just a holiday for a people infamous nationwide for their (lack of a) work culture.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The policemen responsible for the Dinhata incident should be severely punished. Busy in corruption and scams, trigger-happy policemen no longer know when they ought to open fire and when not to. A cycle of police firing and bandhs seems to be repeating itself in Bengal and costing the state crores. Despite Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees reformist agenda, Bengal seems to have regressed by a year in 2006-07.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The headline, The cowardice of Calcutta (Feb 7), was incomplete. Calcutta is full of clowns too. A minister stopping a train while seated on a chair on the tracks best illustrated this. Where else would a minister act against the law that his own government is the custodian of? Calcuttans enjoy their circus and then wonder why the world does not take them seriously any more. The Forward Blocs disregard for the law on the bandh day is a direct function of the greed for power and money. A government takes collective decisions and each minister, even in a coalition, is responsible for them. Thus the Forward Bloc is as much to blame for the Cooch Behar incident as the CPI(M). If a constituent of the government wants to protest against any government decision or policy, it should first of all quit the government. As for cowardice, after Independence, Bengalis have been brave when in a mob, but cowardly as individuals.           
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Caught between the home and the world
                                                                                                                 CAUGHT BETWEEN THE HOME AND THE WORLD
  - Religion has very little to do with the neglect of women rsquo;s education in India					 
										      MIND THE GAP                                                
	At one of the major traffic junctions in central Calcutta, a crowd of raggedy, bright-eyed girls of different sizes comes skipping up to the windows of the interminably waiting cars, asking for money. The older ones  the oldest are around 11 or 12 at most  are fairly serious in their begging. The little ones in the younger group do not always bother to break off from their best friends when they reach the windows, as if begging is just another game they must play as they scamper in-between growling buses and sputtering two-wheelers. They live on the pavements lining the two main roads meeting at the junction, shifting their polythene-sheet-covered homes from one side to the other with the adults who live with them when the rains come or the police pay them sudden attention.        
	Because of the location of this junction, all the girls I have spoken to are Muslim. That is why the location is relevant, because poverty knows no bar of religion. Occasionally, the older girls would disappear for a longish period. This alarmed me, till I found them back at the car windows, as cheerful and persistent as ever. We went home, they said. Home for them is scattered in a few villages in the district of South 24 Parganas, usually along the Lakshmikantapur train-route: a large number of them get off at that station to get to their villages. At home, they have their fathers and brothers, sometimes sisters and mother. The women and the youngest boys come to the city at times, and go back. On the pavement, the girls live with adults who may be part of their families, or in quasi-families with periodic migrants from the neighbourhood. But what had these girls gone back for? We have to study now, they said. They have to study Urdu, they said, and they are learning to write Urdu and do sums. When I asked them whether they could teach me Urdu, they asked me in surprise whether I was a Muslim.        
	Yet to this day I have not worked out from their half-derisive, half-reluctant answers how their school lets them go for such long stretches and how they manage to keep up. And what exactly they have learnt. Do you go to a maqtab? I asked, and was left stranded amid helpless giggles. One of them, now rapidly growing into a tall pre-adolescent, claimed she knew how to read and write a-b-c-d. But they have to come back from time to time when their families need extra money, which they supply by begging. Two little ones I talked to live here by themselves, they said, the elder sister looking after the younger one, half-an-inch shorter. On Thursdays and Fridays, they sit at the mazhar, where the babus give them money, with which they buy rice. But on two days of the week they go to study, all by themselves, to Mintupara  or should that be Minto Park?        
	Should one be reassured that the girls have a sense that it is necessary to study? At one level, perhaps, yes. Yet this feeling would go against the deep perturbation of a group of young Muslim women I met recently, who had fought their own battles against a conservative society to become highly educated. A basic difficulty with this society, most of them felt, was the lack of awareness that girls needed education. Talking mainly of villages and district towns they knew well, and of the poorer areas in the city, the women said that there was a kind of general agreement about a basic religious education. For that, little girls are often sent to the maqtab, where they are given lessons in Urdu, often far removed from the language they speak at home and in play. So the girls learn neither the language nor the religion. There is a kind of indifference in a majority of families towards what the girls do learn, and a passiveness of will regarding their studies as they grow older. To take education seriously, family support is essential, and an educated mother is a great help.         
	But a constant scrounging for the means to live, with which the little girls at the traffic signal struggle, hardly provides the ideal atmosphere for awareness, whatever the faith.         
	Yet the arena of education could open up to the student a set of unexpected experiences. While speaking more hopefully of the high madarsa system, a woman I met spoke of one such school in her village in a northern district of Bengal. Forty per cent of the students there were Hindus and boys from the scheduled tribes, and they excelled in Arabic.         
	For many women I spoke to, though, it is not the lack of awareness about the need for womens education but impenetrable conservatism that is the real problem. Many families believe it is not womens work to study or go out among society. To some extent, this springs from the varying interpretations of religious instruction given by the religious heads. According to this point of view, it is the concentration of social power in the hands of some religious heads and familial power in the hands of the men that lie behind womens backwardness in education.        
	But do we need to bring in religion at all? Womens education has always been an area of struggle in India, irrespective of faith. When one looks at the staggering numbers of young girls working as domestic help, and as many doing chores at home, do we dare ask which community they come from?       BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

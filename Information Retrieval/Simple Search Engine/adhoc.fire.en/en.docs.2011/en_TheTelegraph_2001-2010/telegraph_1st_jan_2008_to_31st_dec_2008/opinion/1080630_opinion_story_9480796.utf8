	Asked about the Henley by-elections  which the Tories won, with Labour pushed down to fifth place, behind even the British National Party  Gordon Brown said, By-elections come and by-elections go. This was on June 27, the first anniversary of Mr Brown entering No 10 as prime minister. And the question in everybodys mind in Britain, even within his party, is whether Mr Brown should also be preparing to go. Something has gone rather badly wrong in a year, and Mr Brown is becoming the object of an emotion that political leaders dread most  pity. This is something people could never have imagined feeling for Tony Blair, for he, unlike Mr Brown, was not considered to be an honourable man. And bizarrely, that now seems, in contrast, to have been Mr Blairs strength. A series of local election fiascos was followed by the twin resignations of Labours Scottish leader and of the Labour MP for Glasgow East on the very day of the anniversary. Huge debts and more than a whiff of corruption also dog the Labour Party, together with rising fuel and food prices following on the heels of floods, foot-and-mouth and terrorism. All this has not made matters any less grim for an awkward and taciturn man who seems to find it difficult to smile in public.        
	The trouble began when Mr Brown opted out of general elections last autumn, largely thought to be because of ominous indications in a number of opinion polls. Then London went for a Conservative mayor, and the opinion polls went from bad to worse. According to the most recent, 74 per cent of those questioned think that Mr Brown has been a change for the worse compared with Mr Blair. Only 24 per cent think that Labour has a chance of winning the next election while he remains leader. The Conservatives now have a record 20-point lead over Labour, who have fallen to 25 per cent, the lowest since 1984. The extent of Conservative support would give David Cameron a landslide victory as big as Labours win in 1997. With regard to the economic downturn, only 13 per cent agree with ministerial claims that Britains problems are the result of global crises; 86 per cent think that government decisions have played a part. Mr Brown had started out, last year, by recalling his school motto, I will try my utmost. A trial it continues to be, and the peoples verdict does not look too kind.

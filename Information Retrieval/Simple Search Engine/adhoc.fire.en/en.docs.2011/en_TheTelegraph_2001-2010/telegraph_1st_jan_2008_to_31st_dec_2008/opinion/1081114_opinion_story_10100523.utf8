	SHEIKH MOHAMMAD ABDULLAH: TRAGIC HERO OF KASHMIR By Ajit Bhattacharjea, Roli, Rs 395        
	The valley of Kashmir remained strangely insulated from the communal tension which was ripping the Indian subcontinent apart in the 1930s and 1940s. At a time when secularism became a much-touted, yet widely flouted notion in India, it was not only a revered concept in the valley, but also a principle rigorously followed in popular practices. The man to whom goes the credit of this near-miracle was Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah. His charismatic leadership earned him the title, Sher-e-Kashmir (the lion of Kashmir).        
	Abdullahs liberal-mindedness and his die-hard commitment to secularism and socialism brought him closer to Jawaharlal Nehru. His secular mindset was evident when he changed his partys name from Kashmir Muslim Conference to Kashmir National Conference in 1939, at a time when the Muslim League was already gaining a strong toehold in India. While his party fought against the oppressive Dogra rule, it also valiantly resisted the Pakistan-backed Pathan invasion of the valley. It was with Abdullahs support that the Muslim-dominated princely state of Jammu and Kashmir opted to join the Indian Union instead of merging with the Islamic state of Pakistan.        
	Ajit Bhattacharjeas biography of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah is a well-documented and sensitive roster of events as they unfolded in post-Partition secular India. It chronicles the sordid tales of intrigue and politicking which not only sought to tarnish the secular credentials of one of the greatest champions of secularism, but also gave rise to such a polarized matrix of religious and political identity-formation that the very concept of secularism became suspect.        
	The biography gives a detailed account of how Abdullah became a target of attacks from different sectors for a variety of reasons. No wonder that Hari Singh, the king of the state who engineered the Muslim oppression in Jammu, would find the secularist Abdullah a bte noire. The case is not much different with Queen Tara Devi, who succeeded Singh after his eviction. Hindu chauvinistic outfits like the Jana Sangh and Praja Parishad were keen to project Abdullah as a man nursing pro-Pakistan sentiments, in order to advance their own communal political agenda. Their arguments, however flimsy, found ready acceptance within a section of the Congress that included the influential home minister, Vallabhbhai Patel. He interpreted Abdullahs demand for autonomy for his state as a sign of Muslim disloyalty to India. Patel assigned B.N. Mullick, the director of the Intelligence Bureau, to spy on Abdullah. Mullick, along with Karan Singh (sardar-e-riyasat at that time) responded by framing Abdullah on false charges of conspiracy and treason. The quirky turns of events forced a broken-hearted Nehru to give his consent to the issuing of an arrest warrant against Abdullah in 1953. Abdullah did not get his due even during Indira Gandhis prime ministership. He was ignominiously made the chief minister of the state of which he was the prime minister during Nehrus tenure.         
	Bhattacharjea captures Abdullahs tragedy in all its nuances, highlighting his rectitude and resilence, and also the compromises he was forced to make. The book is an account of Nehrus tragedy as well. His indecision and its repercussions are analysed quite well in the chapter titled Nehrus split personality. Bhattacharjea also dwells upon the root of Abdullahs religious tolerance, tracing it back to the religious humanism taught by medieval Sufi saints like Lad Ded and Nund Rishi, who had made the valley their home.

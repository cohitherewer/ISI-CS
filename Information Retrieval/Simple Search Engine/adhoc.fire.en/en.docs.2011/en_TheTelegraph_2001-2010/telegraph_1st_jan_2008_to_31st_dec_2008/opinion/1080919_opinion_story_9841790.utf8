The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Wrong man at the helm
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             WRONG MAN AT THE HELM                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Yes, Shivraj Patil should go because he just does not give the public of India a sense of security. Neither does he give the impression that their safety is in the hands of a competent leader, heading a competent organization, which follows the essential modicum of law and order. It is no irrelevant joke when he is accused of being more concerned about his change of clothes than he is about ensuring good, strong and correct governance from inside the home ministry.         
	How can a negotiator from Delhi, visiting Jammu  a virtually strife-ridden state  carry four changes of clothes for a six-hour trip? Surely the priorities should be clear and the purpose of all operations and counter-operations well-defined and properly transacted. This has not been evident through the many crises of differing proportions that have taken place over the last four years. The silent, suppressed anger against this kind of incompetence has had an adverse impact on the credibility of the ruling United Progressive Alliance.        
	In the political space, it is perception that rules. Nobody believes in the ability of Shivraj Patil to deliver the goods at any level of the operation although, as a person, he is intelligent, well-read, urbane and loyal to his party but not necessarily to the tenets that the Congress is mandated to abide by. He is seen as being soft on Hindutva elements in the political arena, not trusted by the larger minorities, and incapable of speaking out with controlled commitment that makes the citizenry feel that they cannot trust the government to protect them.        
	Having tolerated Patil for all these years, it will be tough for the UPA to ask the man to leave office. His removal will be seen as a delayed reaction to months of incompetent handling of internal strife, ranging from the growth of the Naxalite menace which he referred to as a law-and-order problem to the Amarnath explosion that crippled the peace in Jammu and Kashmir. Both Ghulam Nabi Azad and Shivraj Patil should volunteer to shoulder the blame of that horror and put in their papers. Sadly, our leaders are not men and women of selfless calibre, but are people who can think only of their own gaddis and personal aggrandizement.                
	Healing game        
	We are in the month of Ramazan, and Eid is ahead of us. It is a special time in our calendar with Dussehra and Diwali approaching as well. The diversity and plurality of the Indian ethos is celebrated from September to February, with all communities paying homage to their respective, individual faiths. It is a time in which India can heal its wounds that are a result of the violence and partisan politics in Kashmir, for instance. Imagine the effect of Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh addressing the people of the valley and those in Jammu, apologizing for the senseless turmoil, the killings and the brutality, and talking to them about how extraneous elements, angry about the processes of normalization that had begun to kick in in the state, had ruptured the delicate fabric. Or, better still, the fresh voice of Rahul Gandhi, reaching out to the people with his genuine and unencumbered appeal. It could bring the fast changing tide back on an even keel.        
	To err and play bad, parochial politics is human, but to apologize publicly, regardless of the humiliation, to restore the dignity of a people, is true, honest leadership. The people of this land will hail the apology, rather than having to tolerate the pedestrian paces of reaching out with hollow symbolism.         
	India is looking for honesty in politics, administration and in its public life. The people of this country are unable to digest the incompetence, the many failures and the state of denial of those at the helm of the government. Right man for the right job please!

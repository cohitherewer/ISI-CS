	The Supreme Court has held that an order of conviction can be based on evidence adduced by a child witness. In a case concerning the murder of a husband by his wife and her paramours, the trial court convicted the accused on the evidence of the couples 12-year-old daughter. Her deposition revealed that the relation between her parents had been extremely strained. The court held that when a childs evidence was specific and vivid, without any embellishment, there was no reason to doubt its credibility.

	Blame them all         
	In a recent murder case in which a group of individuals was accused, the Supreme Court held that all the members of the group were liable for conviction. The issue came up when it was argued on behalf of one of them that it was not clear what degree of injury had been caused by each one of the accused. The widow of the deceased in this instance deposed that several individuals had gone into the house of the murdered man with deadly weapons and come out with bloodstains on their weapons and clothes. The court held all the individuals equally responsible for the crime. It maintained that Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (act in furtherance of common intention) was clearly indicated under the circumstances. (Balwant Singh vs State of Punjab)                    
	Patients consent        
	 In a case of medical negligence, the Supreme Court held that the consent of a patients relative regarding treatment or surgery was not of consequence. If the patient was an adult and capable of taking decisions, and if there was no medical emergency, her consent had to be sought. The question came up when a patients uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes were removed after she had been admitted for diagnostic and operative laparoscopy. The assistant doctor came out of the operation theatre and obtained consent from the patients mother before the surgery. However, it was found that the patient would have needed the surgery later on and that no health problems had ensued as a result of the operation. The doctor was denied the fees for the surgery and directed to pay Rs 25,000 as compensation. (Samira Kohli vs Prabha Manchanda)

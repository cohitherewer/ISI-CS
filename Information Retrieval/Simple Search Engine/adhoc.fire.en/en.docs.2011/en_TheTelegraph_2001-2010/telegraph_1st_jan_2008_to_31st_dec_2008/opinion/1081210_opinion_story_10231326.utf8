										      Voluntary organisations are up in arms over the stringent provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Bill, reports   V. Kumara Swamy                                                            Not a small price: The law could end up denying foreign funding to NGOs working for child rights        
	When the proposed Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Bill 2006 (FCRB) was tabled in Parliament two years ago, many people had called for changes in some of its more stringent provisions on the monitoring of foreign contributions to non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Recently, both the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs and the Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) have put forth their recommendations on the bill. But NGOs are up in arms over the fact that neither of the bodies has asked for any significant changes to the bill.         
	The bill aims to oversee the receipt and utilisation of foreign contributions received by NGOs and other organisations, including schools and colleges in the country. If passed, the new law will replace the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) that was enacted in 1976.        
	According to the latest figures available, there are around 33,000 voluntary organisations that are registered under the FCRA. And foreign donations to these organisations have been rising at a fast pace. Voluntary Action Network India (VANI), an apex body of Indian NGOs, reveals that Indian organisations received around Rs 7,500 crore in foreign donations in 2006. The figure shot up to Rs 12,000 crore in 2007.        
	Originally, the law was meant to stop the misuse of foreign funds, mainly for anti-national activities. But over the years, the FCRA has been used only to harass organisations in the voluntary sector. I am afraid there is nothing in the new bill to suggest that this will change. Neither the parliamentary committee nor the ARC have proposed drastic changes to the bill, says John Dayal, national secretary, All India Catholic Union, Delhi.        
	According to activists, the bill is more prohibitive than regulatory in nature. The expression activities detrimental to national interest in the preamble to the bill will be interpreted in a thousand different ways by government officials to arm-twist an organisation, says Alok Mukhopadhyay, chief executive of Voluntary Health Association of India (VHAI), a federation of 27 state voluntary health associations.         
	Voluntary organisations point out that illegal foreign funds can, in fact, be monitored under other laws. This, they argue, actually makes the bill redundant. If the government is concerned about the diversion of funds for anti-national activities like terrorism, then it could take the help of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967, that declares the raising of funds for terrorist acts as criminal. It could also use the Money Laundering Act, 2002, says Paresh Tewary, chief executive, VANI.        
	Bimal Jalan, former governor, Reserve Bank of India, and member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha), agrees. The home ministry need not involve itself in this at all. A few simple guidelines would suffice and if some NGOs are indulging in suspicious activities, the law enforcement agencies can investigate them under existing laws.        
	But others hold that a law such as this one would be effective in dealing with the misuse of foreign contributions. Hannan Mollah, CPM member of Parliament, says, Diversion of foreign funds is a huge problem and we need a stringent law that holds the NGOs fully accountable. The old FCRA was not able to solve the problem as many NGOs got their accounts audited by unscrupulous chartered accountants. What we need is a transparent system and not let the NGOs live in luxury on the money collected in the name of development.        
	Naturally, the NGOs dont agree. And critics point out that the bill does not even define certain terms clearly, leading to possibilities of misinterpretation. For instance, Clause 3(1) (f) of the bill states that an organisation of political nature is prohibited from accepting foreign contribution. Experts say that this is inconsistent with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. After all, any organisation working on advocacy issues such as womens rights, rights of ethnic minorities, or childrens rights, is essentially engaging in a political activity and this shouldnt disqualify them from getting foreign contributions, says Tewary.        
	But some actually support this clause. This is an extremely important provision. Politicians are always looking for ways to enter the voluntary sector. Diluting this provision would enable them to misuse foreign funds in the name of social work, says Rakesh Gulati, a Delhi-based chartered accountant and an expert on FCRA.        
	The bill has also angered minority organisations. Clause 12(3)(a)(ii) says that an organisation seeking foreign donations should not indulge in activities aimed at conversion through inducement or force, either directly or indirectly from one religious faith to another.         
	Dayal feels that this clause too will be widely misused. Its simply there to push minority organisations to the wall. The term inducement can be used by the government of the day in different ways to harass religious organisations, says Dayal.              
	Christian organisations like Catholic Bishops Conference of India, National Council of Churches in India, National Council of YMCA of India and others had wanted the word inducement to be replaced with deceit or fraud and the term indirectly to be deleted from the bill. But the standing committee has not made any changes to this provision either.        
	NGOs have also taken exception to the fact that the bill prohibits an organisation from receiving foreign funds if an employee has a criminal case filed against him. Anybody can level a false accusation and file a case. It shouldnt disqualify an organisation from getting foreign funds, says Tewary. The standing committee has been silent on this provision as well.         
	Of course, its not that the standing committee has made no recommendations for change at all. Clause 8(1)(b) stipulates that no more than 50 per cent of foreign donations should be used as administrative expenditure. But for organisations in the health sector, payment to doctors and staff forms a major part of the administrative expenditure. The bill lacks clarity on this, says Mukhopadhyay. The standing committee has, in fact, called for a clear definition of administrative expenses.        
	NGOs have also welcomed the ARCs recommendation that organisations that receive an annual foreign contribution of less than Rs 10 lakh be exempted from registration has been appreciated as well. Another recommendation that has come as a relief to voluntary organisations is that a definite time limit  90 days  has been set within which the government has to dispose of applications for the registration of new NGOs.        
	However, there are those who question the very raison dtre of the bill. Since 1976, not a single case of anti-national activity has been filed against any organisation in the country. That is proof enough that this law has no place in our Constitution, says Dayal.

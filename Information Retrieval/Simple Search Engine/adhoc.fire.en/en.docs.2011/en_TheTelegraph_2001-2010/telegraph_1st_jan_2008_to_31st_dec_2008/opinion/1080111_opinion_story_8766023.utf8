	The Assassins Song By M.G. Vassanji, Viking, Rs 450
    
	The old wounds, the old battles. They and we, and no place in the middle.
       
	These words appear on the plaque outside the spot in Old Delhi where the Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadur, was martyred by the Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb. Karsan Dargawalla, the narrator of M.G. Vassanjis novel, The Assassins Song, comes upon it when he has just found his brother after searching for him in the din and bustle of Delhi. But in the meantime, the little prankster called Mansoor that he left behind in a Sufi hamlet in Gujarat has hardened into the militant Omar .
    
	Karsan is Vassanjis Stephen Daedalus, who is brought up to believe in the existence of a place in the middle. His father is the keeper of Pirbaag, a shrine to the Sufi saint, Nur Fazal, or Pir Bawa. The legend of Nur Fazal  which does not make any effort to cover up or justify the saints carnal weaknesses  is to Karsan the equivalent of the Quran or Gita. He is the gaadi-varas, the chosen one meant to succeed his father as the Saheb of Pirbaag. 
    
	Like Joyces hero, Karsan is caught in multiple worlds. The most tangible among them is the one that lurks outside the compound of the shrine, and also in the old newspapers brought to him by Raja Singh, the truck driver. But there are other worlds too  in which he confronts the growing urges of the flesh, Bapu-jis desire to pass the mantle to him, and his mothers need to visit the cinema hidden under a burqa. 
    
	Which one does Karsan choose? Does his true calling lie in the safekeeping of the shrine, in keeping it as an island of middle-dom in a world increasingly preferring to take sides? Karsan spurns what seemed to be his destiny, and goes away to study at Harvard. But he only manages to take himself out of Pirbaag, failing utterly to extricate Pirbaag from his being.
    
	In Boston, Karsan is lonely. It is the loneliness of the soul which consumes him, keeps him cooped up in his shell: he has acted against his Bapu-jis wishes in coming to Boston. He had made such a colossal effort to free himself, and yet the freedom tasted nothing close to sweet. It was not just that he, Karsan Dargawalla, God-designate from an Indian village, [was] struggling to be just ordinary. It was also that Bapu-ji seemed to have lost none of his equanimity when he, Karsan, was being torn asunder by guilt. Vassanji captures the tormented struggle for an elusive freedom as few contemporary novelists can. 
    
	Karsans way of dealing with his pain is by wrenching himself away from the Pirbaag within him  a forced crisis of faith. He no longer recites the bols Bapu-ji taught him, nor does he revisit the legend of Pir Bawa or socialize with people who may have had links with the shrine. When news of his mothers grave illness arrives, he construes the one-way ticket Bapu-ji has sent him as a sure sign of blackmail with the intent of keeping him chained for life to the shrine of the Pir. 
    
	In this crisis, love blossoms, in the form of Marge Thompson, a flower-child of sorts. Karsan Dargawalla of Pirbaag finds bliss in conjugality, and soon in fatherhood. Winnipeg and small-town Canada replace Pirbaag in his mind. Or do they? 
    
	Little Julian, in whom Karsan comes to repose all his hopes and faith the same way Bapu-ji had done in him, is killed by a rushing car in front of his helpless parents. The darkness had lifted, only to drop again. The marriage loses its raison dtre and disintegrates.
    
	Karsan comes back to Pirbaag after thirty years, but it is August 2002, and there is no Pirbaag to speak of. The post-Godhra violence has razed the shrine to dust and put a gruesome end to Bapu-jis life. The fact that the sect followed neither Hinduism nor Islam is of little consequence. Mansoor, now Omar, is a suspected Islamic militant. The middle ground is well and truly lost.
    
	Karsans return to India  first as a researcher at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Shimla and then to the ruins of Pirbaag  triggers off a series of revelations which leads ultimately to Karsan, like Stephen Daedalus, finding his locus in the sea of life. Like an investigator sifting through useless material in search of the truth, he uncovers the mystery of the deaths of his mother and father. In the process, human frailties are exposed. The Saheb wasnt the saint you thought he was, Mansoor tells his brother while hiding in his Postmaster flat in Shimla. It was Bapu-jis open intimacy with Shilpa, the voluptuous disciple, that drove Ma to hysteria and finally, death. Had the cult of Pir Bawa made as much of a captive of Bapu-ji as Karsan was afraid it would make of him?
    
	In a final epiphany, Karsan realizes that his renegade brother has been the true follower of Nur Fazals cult  the secret order of assassins, the Nizari Ismailis from Mount Alamut. 
    
	In Karsans final return to Pirbaag, Vassanji revives the hope of a place in the middle.

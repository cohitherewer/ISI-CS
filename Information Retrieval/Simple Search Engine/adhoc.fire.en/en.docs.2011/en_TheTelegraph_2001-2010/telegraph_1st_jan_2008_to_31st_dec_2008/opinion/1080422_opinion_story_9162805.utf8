	Damp fire                  
	Sir  In a grovelling genuflection to Chinas wishes (read orders), the Indian government converted the 2.3 km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate into a garrison area for the Olympic torch to pass through smoothly (Torch tyrants run Delhi, April 18). The communist dictators would forever show it to others as a model of pliant behaviour. Our government made a Faustian promise to them to provide safe passage and pressed into service a powerful security force that ensured a complete shut-down of offices of the president, the prime minister, defence minister, external affairs minister and the finance minister  in effect, of the government of India. The half-hour tightly controlled relay encapsulated everything that is a standing negation of the journey of harmony that it was meant to be. No self-respecting government anywhere in the world would so shamelessly dance to the tune of foreign puppeteers.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sarat Pattanayak, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  The Central government and the Delhi administration have brought shame on the country by allowing the Chinese to have their way in banishing democracy from the streets of Indias capital. The Chinese delegates, who came with propagandist placards against Dalai Lama, the French president, and even some news channels, were allowed free passage along with the Olympic torch, but peaceful protesters and ordinary citizens were deprived of their usual democratic rights. Journalists were also not spared the Delhi polices atrocities. The spirit of the Olympic Games has thus suffered in the same way as the people of Tibet are suffering under Chinese aggression.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Which self-respecting government would go out of its way to accommodate the Chinese delegates the way India did at the cost of suspending democratic and human rights of its citizens? It seems that India still has not learnt to stand up for what is right. While the government fails to provide its people with food, shelter or a basic education, it has no qualms in spending money to provide security cover to the Chinese to carry out their propaganda against Tibet. I fail to understand why the Olympic games should be used for political propaganda. Also, if the government can allow the Chinese to hold a rally of sorts against the Tibetans, then why were the Tibetan supporters arrested when they tried to hold a parallel torch relay? We might have gained independence, but obviously our government has not got rid of the tendency to bow down to unreasonable demands from countries it considers superior.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The official Indian attitude towards China in the matter of the Olympic torch relay has not merely been one of bending over backwards, but can be better described as kowtowing. With security personnel in thousands, practical curfew in the relay zone, and a few celebrities and sportspersons (who mouthed the usual words about sport best kept separate from politics) trotting with torches, the event itself was a damp squib. The charade of one star running a few metres, handing the torch over to another for the next 20 or 30 steps, Chinese instructor-monitors always at the side, surrounded by heavy security along a deserted road, was surreal at best, silly at worst.          
	The silliness apart, what was shocking was the way Indians were treated by the Indian police at the venue just to ensure that the Chinese were not annoyed. The photograph of Charu Sudan Kasturi of The Telegraph being roughed up by policemen says it all. It could have been captioned Pleasing China. This, and the fact that Chinese delegates were allowed to display placards against the French president and his wife, has shown India in very poor light before the world community.           
	The parallel relay by Tibetan protesters and supporters stood out in sharp contrast. They carried no weapons, and the run was totally non-violent despite the police brutality on them. One can surmise that television viewers were keener to watch the Tibetan protests on private channels than the sanitized childish drama being enacted along Rajpath. By their non-violent protests (in New Delhi and elsewhere) and the parallel relay, the Tibetans have effectively drawn attention to the plight of their occupied homeland and to Indias weak foreign policy.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Aamir Khan has said that the Olymic Games do not belong to China. He is right, but this time, the game has become an issue for China, because its rabid atrocities in Tibet became embarrassingly exposed just prior to the Olympics. At this juncture, there is a desperate search for real heroes. Bhaichung Bhutia has proved to be one. Aamir Khan has proved that he can only be one on screen.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Jyotirmoy Prodhani, Tura, Meghalaya 

                
	Sir  The stance of Aamir Khan and Prakash Karat on the Olympic torch (read Tibet)  bringing Kashmir and Iraq into the discussion  is hypocritical. One doubts if Khan or Karat would have voiced the same opinion if the function was being held under the patronage of Narendra Modi or George Bush, and not the Chinese government.           
	It can reasonably be argued that Messrs Khan and Karat have allowed their dominant identity of being a Muslim and a communist respectively overshadow any other identity they may have, including that of being Indians. Yet, the irony of democracy is that both of them would still enjoy a considerable degree of popularity. If only they realized that this is by the grace of democracy, whose principles they seek to demean.           
	Yours faithfully,

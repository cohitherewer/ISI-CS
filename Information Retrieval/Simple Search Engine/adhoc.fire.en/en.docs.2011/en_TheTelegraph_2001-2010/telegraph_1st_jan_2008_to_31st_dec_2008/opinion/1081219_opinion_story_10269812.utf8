	Making history                  
	Sir Team India must be congratulated for pulling off a sensational six-wicket victory over England in the first Test match in Chennai (Sachin, Yuvi see India through, Dec 16). It was a remarkable win for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his boys, who fought their way back into the game after conceding a 75-run lead in the first innings. Chasing down a target of 387 runs successfully in the fourth innings is truly an amazing feat, and Virender Sehwag must be credited for laying the foundation of the victory with an explosive 83 in only 68 balls. Sachin Tendulkar then played a memorable knock, scoring his 41st century and striking the winning runs with a boundary. Tendulkar held the innings together while Yuvraj Singh marked his return to Test cricket by remaining unbeaten on 85. The Indian team put up a determined showing in Chennai. Hopefully, our players will be able to maintain a similar tempo in the remaining matches.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  India and England gave cricket lovers a match that they will cherish for a long time. The English team must be thanked for agreeing to come back to India after the terrorist strike in Mumbai. Their batsmen and bowlers terrorized India for almost four days in Chennai. India fell behind their opponents in the first innings, and were set an improbable target by the visitors in the second. Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh put up a crucial partnership to seal the match, but Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir did their bit as well. Tendulkar, nearing the end of an illustrious career, played gloriously and scored a century, which he dedicated to Mumbai and its people. Tendulkar has often been criticized for not playing enough match-winning knocks unlike Brian Lara who has won many matches for West Indies. His performance in Chennai will hopefully silence his detractors forever. The only blot on Indias part was Rahul Dravids poor showing. Perhaps this is the right time for Dravid to retire. He has already relinquished the Test captaincy and is not a regular in the ODI side.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  India recorded a famous win at Chepauk, beating the Englishmen in style. It was a tough task for the Indians at the beginning of the fifth days play. After all, India were chasing a mammoth total. However, a resolute approach on the part of their batsmen resulted in a historic win. Virender Sehwags blitzkrieg took the battle to the opponents, and the innings was later cemented by important contributions from the Little Master and Yuvraj Singh. We are now witnessing the rise of a young Indian team that has the right balance, an astute captain at the helm, and the belief that it can win difficult matches. The reserve players are not that bad either, and this augurs well for the future of Indian cricket. A strong bench will ensure that performance is the key to selection. India must now work hard to maintain its winning streak and root out weaknesses. There is always scope of improvement in the future, but the time now is for enjoying the spoils of a fantastic victory.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The English captain, Kevin Pieterson, returned with his team to India despite the troubled times. Sachin Tendulkar played one of his best Test innings and, like a true sportsman, dedicated it to the victims of the Mumbai attack. The record books will state M.S. Dhonis side beat England, but to my mind, cricket triumphed against all odds to emerge a winner.           
	India may well be inching towards the number one spot in Test cricket rankings, but the Englishmen also showed character by coming back to play in India, thereby making a statement against the perpetrators of terror and their violent ways. Critics should stop finding fault with individual performers, at least in this match, because this game was one of the most historic matches ever played in recent times.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Sachin Tendulkars magical century and Virender Sehwags blistering knock have brought something to cheer for the nation after the horror in Mumbai. Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh also played supporting roles in this famous victory. Tendulkars failure to perform in crunch situation has long been under scrutiny, but that is all set to change after his scintillating performance. The ball did turn and jump but failed to deter Sehwag who was aggressive right through his stay at the wicket. His stroke-play and finesse were indeed a joy to watch.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Anindya Bhattacharya, Calcutta

                
	Sir  By winning the Chennai Test, M.S. Dhonis team has scaled a new peak. Virender Sehwags blows set up the tone for Indias chase. The Delhi lad was high on confidence and low on sympathy for the English bowlers. The following morning, Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh stitched a long partnership to ensure that Sehwags heroics did not go to waste. This win over England is special because Test cricket needed a boost and the nation a balm to treat its recent wounds.           
	Yours faithfully,

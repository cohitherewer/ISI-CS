	False prescription                  
	Sir  The Union finance minister, P. Chidambaram, has asked automakers, real estate firms, airlines and hotels to cut prices in response to the global economic crisis (FM sops with price cut call, Nov 19). By saying so, he is probably trying to endear himself to the people by showing that he cares more for them than for the moneyed classes. But we know better than to be assured by his statements. Most builders and car manufacturers have already said that there is no possibility of a cost-cut in the near future as the prices of raw materials and fuel have increased considerably. Instead of exhorting industrialists to reduce prices, Chidambaram should perhaps set an example by asking for the reduction of his own salary and also that of his fellow politicians.           
	Yours faithfully,      
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  We are alarmed at the nature of P. Chidambarams prescription to treat the economic downturn. The efficacy of the proposed solution is doubtful, and if implemented, it might bleed our industries to death. And reducing prices does not always bring about social good. Ever-falling prices of cell phones and MP3 players have encouraged every member of the present generation to acquire one, and play songs on them aloud in public places, much to the discomfort of the less musically inclined. Lower prices of cars would mean that anybody can buy one. The cars will end up being parked on the open road because the owners cannot afford garage space. Lower airfares have already turned our domestic terminals into a state akin to that of Howrah station before the departure of the Mithila Express. The best way to solve a problem cannot be through the creation of a bigger problem.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

      
	Sir  P. Chidambaram is asking India Inc. to cut prices and boost demand. But has India Inc. been responsible for the inflation that it will lower prices now? The present inflationary condition, which has gone beyond the governments control, has been caused by the imposition of multiple taxes on a single commodity, especially by the service tax, which is levied on almost all transactions. The service tax is collected by the government at the expense of ordinary citizens, who pay heavily for each and every transaction throughout their lives.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

                
	Sir  The present tax structure should be thoroughly revamped if inflation is to be controlled. The government should grant concessions to regular re-payers of loans. Export subsidiary units should get tax holidays. It is also essential to have a revaluation of all international currencies, so that the Indian rupee is saved from being further devalued.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Mohd Mubarak, Ranchi

      
	Sir  When international oil prices have fallen to about 50 dollars per barrel, the governments strategy to stick to the present price is really ridiculous. At the time of the oil price hike, the government made a show of not hiking the price of kerosene, supposedly keeping in mind the interests of the ordinary people. But is the government aware of the fact that kerosene is sold at Rs 30/40 per litre in the black market?           
	Yours faithfully,      
K.I. Jaya Das, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The rising inflation has supposedly been checked. The snippet Inflation drops to 8.9% (Nov 21) says that The countrys inflation rate fell to 8.9 per cent, a five and a half month low on the back of lower commodity and oil prices. But have consumers noticed any fall in commodity prices in the last few months? On the contrary, people are only feeling the pocket pinch harder and harder everyday. Ration shops hand out half a litre of kerosene per head per week. The amount is not enough to meet household needs. In order to compensate, poorer people have to procure kerosene from the black market at a higher price. Is the government at all aware of the existence of the black market for kerosene? If petrol can be sold in the open market, why should kerosene have a black market?          
	The report, Begging bowl in hand, Big Three fly like kings (Nov 22), talks of US lawmakers ask[ing] blunt questions on lifestyle and salary, stun[ing] auto titans seeking bailout billions. Can such a situation ever become a reality in India? Far from questioning the assets of the Central public sector executives, our government has raised their salaries by 30 to 45 per cent.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Chandra Kanta Chandra, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Corporate chieftains are shouting from the rooftops that the government and the Reserve Bank of India are not doing enough to ease the liquidity crisis. The editorial, Bite the bullet (Nov 20), sets the record straight. The government should do anything but lend a crutch to the Indian industries at the cost of economic prudence. It should be remembered that flooding the market with unlimited liquidity might also create its own problems. And before insisting that the banks dilute their standards for loans, the consequences of such steps should be considered carefully.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Rupnarayan Bose, Calcutta

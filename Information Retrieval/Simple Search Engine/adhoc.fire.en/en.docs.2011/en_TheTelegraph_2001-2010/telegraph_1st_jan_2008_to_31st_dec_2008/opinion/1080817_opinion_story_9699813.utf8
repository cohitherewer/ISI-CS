	Independence day 2008 did not free the Indian economy. On the contrary, it put shackles around it by burdening the exchequer with a huge bill by way of a substantial increase in the salaries and wages of government servants. According to the governments own estimate, the total increase in the annualized wage bill is 21 per cent, including arrears. This increase has a retrospective effect going back 31 months. The outlay for this will involve many thousands of crores, a large proportion of which have been worked into the budget figures of last February. There are no reasons to grudge government servants their higher salaries. In this day and age, everyone should earn more rather than less. There is no doubt that in the higher echelons of the bureaucracy, the actual pay is a pittance compared to what a person of comparable seniority, experience and competence would get in the private sector. This is particularly true of the defence services where the pay has actually become a disincentive to join the armed forces. The opposite is true at the other end of the employment ladder: government servants at the lower levels are paid far too much, and it is here that productivity is the lowest.        
	In the general happiness about the governments generosity, and the latters own smugness at having made an election investment, certain very important aspects might be completely overlooked. This bonanza cannot be delivered free. The previous Pay Commission made certain recommendations regarding accountability and on reducing the size of the government. No progress has been made on these fronts. There is no valid reason for the government remaining in such a big way in, for example, health and education. These, especially higher education, can easily be left to private enterprise. Also, government servants cannot reasonably expect to enjoy parity in salaries with the private sector, but enjoy privileged terms of service. A government servant, no matter how badly he performs, cannot lose his job except on the grounds of moral turpitude (whatever that may mean). Salaries and promotions should both be tied to performance. Neither of them can be a matter of right or can be linked to seniority. There is a growing suspicion that no government will ever be able to broach these very prickly issues.        
	The good news is that this pay increase will not adversely and directly affect the fiscal deficit since allowances had been made for this increase in the budget. The bad news is that the extra money in the economy is bound to further fuel inflation. The government has also not taken adequate steps to curtail subsidies and loan write-offs. These will definitely increase the fiscal deficit. From the point of view of the history of the fisc, this governments performance is poor despite Mr Manmohan Singh at the helm of affairs.

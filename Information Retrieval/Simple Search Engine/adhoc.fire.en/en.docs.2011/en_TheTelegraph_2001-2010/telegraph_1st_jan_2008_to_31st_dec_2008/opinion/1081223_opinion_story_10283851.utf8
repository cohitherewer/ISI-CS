	The past histories of India and China followed different trajectories, and both nations have chosen different paths for progress; so attempts to bracket the two in reading the future will be misleading. India and China account for less of the worlds product than the proportions of their populations would suggest as appropriate: China has about 12 per cent of the worlds product and about 21 per cent of the population, and India about 8 per cent of the product with 17 per cent of the population. A few hundred years ago, China and India together were assumed to possess 60 per cent of the worlds output. This is likely to happen again later in this century, and both their currencies will assist in that process by appreciating towards their real purchasing power values.         
	Over history, in the case of India, there was never any central authority that exercised direct power over its whole territory, not the Mughal Empire nor the British Empire nor the present government. Despite the Himalayan range constituting a rather obvious physical boundary, foreign rulers saw India as an easily divisible collection of races and religions. Indians were divided and were ruled by assorted invaders from the 11th century onwards who pined for Arabia, Persia, Central Asia, Afghanistan and Britain. Indias northwestern borders were fixed only in the late 19th century when the British, after two wars, gave up their endeavour to subdue the Afghans and imposed the Durand line. In contrast, China was fortunate enough never to suffer alien domination over the majority of its territory, but Chinas attitude to foreigners is notably more suspicious than Indias, where such hostility melted away after our Independence.               
	China has a clear vision of itself as a nation. In 1949, reunification for China implied recentralization of authority. As a result, China is a unitary hard state, which can pursue a goal with great single-mindedness and determination, and mobilize maximum resources towards that objective; that was in evidence with the Olympic Games, the Szechuan earthquake and the call-up of hundreds of thousands  some say as many as two million  of the army and police to deal with the problems caused by heavy snowfalls just before the Chinese New Year. On the other hand, India has always had major problems in articulating the definitions of Indian nationhood and postulating national objectives, let alone finding the appropriate means to achieve those ends. Being a soft state, the Indian government has always to take pains to work consensually, and exert control only cautiously and sparingly.         
	Both countries started out by being wary of foreign capital, with the result that India sought capital from public rather than private sources, and China only from the Soviet Union. Both nations initially approached economic development by treating industrialization as their main objective, and with emphasis on steel and heavy machinery  department one goods in classical Marxist terminology  since both were inspired by the Soviet Union. But after a few years, China had made the switch to an all-round emphasis on both heavy and light industries, and then made rapid progress, apart from the temporary aberration of backyard steel furnaces under the Great Leap Forward.         
	At the time of Independence in 1947, India was already the worlds seventh-largest industrial country by volume of output, but its then world-class textile industry was to be blighted by governmental emphasis on labour-intensive growth and the set-aside of various manufacturing sectors reserved for small and low-technology firms.         
	Today, China has become the worlds leading producer and exporter of manufactures, having surpassed both the United States of America and Germany. It exports one in three pairs of shoes that walk the earth. In the year 2000, 30 per cent of the worlds toys came from China; by 2007, this had risen to 80 per cent. Between 1996 and 2004, Chinas export values of electronic devices had grown from $20 billion to $180 billion. Chinas success is based on capital investment in plant and machinery, which was as high as 45 per cent of gross domestic product in 2006, a proportion that is unsustainable and which is depleting natural resources and harming the environment.        
	The human cost of Chinas tremendous progress in recent decades has been steep, particularly in cases where life-long farmers have been forcibly thrown off their land to make way for factories or building projects. Pollution is severe, water is scarce and filthy, preventable industrial accidents abound and conditions for labour are generally lamentable. Apart from the low wages paid to them, many workers are forced to continue to work overtime without pay, are left unpaid for months at a time, or are even locked inside their factory premises. The government in Beijing has now had to intervene to blunt the effects of peremptory sackings of workers as a consequence of the economic downturn that has closed 60,000 factories in the past few months.              
	Despite its impressive growth rates, abject poverty and gross inequality still remain in China. The World Bank website is surprisingly coy about the poverty levels in that country, but credible research suggests that there are about 150 million people living with an income of less than one dollar a day, while the top 10 per cent of Chinas population dispose of 41 per cent of the national wealth.        
	There was a marked difference between China and India in agriculture as well as industry. In China, land reform was straightforward, involving the changing of ownership of large landholdings and moving to collectives and communes. In India, there continues to be a maze of regional complexity. The Congress was never a revolutionary party, and it did little over its long years in office to change the methods of rural production. The Green Revolution finally brought a few capital-intensive methods to the Indian countryside, but Chinas lead in productivity remained and widened when it proceeded to household responsibility, a system based increasingly on private initiative. Now China has taken a further step towards de-regulation, in encouraging farm-based industrialization by allowing farmers voluntarily to lease their land or transfer their land-use right in order to inject capital into the countryside and raise farming incomes.        
	By contrast, the dogmatists of both the Indian political Right and Left see the whole economic reform agenda package, even in its presently becalmed condition, in a dubitable or negative light. When a team of agriculture experts from a communist-dominated Indian state visited China, they were thick-skinned enough to presume to lecture the Chinese about the virtues of an ideologically correct agriculture policy. The Chinese replied with asperity that only in India did both the Right and the Left oppose progress. To them, theoretical positions did not count; only the outcomes mattered. The results are there for those who want to see.

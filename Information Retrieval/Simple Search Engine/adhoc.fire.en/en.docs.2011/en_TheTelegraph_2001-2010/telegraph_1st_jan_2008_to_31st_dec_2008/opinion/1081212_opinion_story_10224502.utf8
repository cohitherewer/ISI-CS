The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In a land where all things seemed the same
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       IN A LAND WHERE ALL THINGS SEEMED THE SAME                                                      A still from Matrubhoomi, a film about a nation without women                            
	Escape By Manjula Padmanabhan, Picador, Rs 295        
	Imagine a country that has conquered death. In the world of Manjula Padmanabhans new novel, Escape, men have achieved immortality in the metaphorical sense by mastering the technology of cloning. Here nobody dies, because one is replaceable by ones copy. Having learnt to regenerate themselves, the men have done away with women, labelled the Vermin Tribe by the new rulers of the land, the Generals. In the exclusively male domain of this novel, women exist only as memory.        
	Escape can be said to belong to the genre of speculative fiction, if not science fiction proper. It is set in a time in which the ways of life to which we are used are considered Degenerate. Profane. Perverse. In order to impose complete control, the Generals have wiped out large sections of the populace and kept the survivors under constant surveillance. For the Generals, Nature is excessive and so they have sought to contain birth through cloning. The Generals ideology and influence are confined within a particular country that has shut itself off from the outside world for twenty years. Reference to objects like peepal tree, paratha, veena, churidar or the hookah implies that the country is India. Padmanabhan is taking the widely prevalent practice of female foeticide in India to its logical end and showing us a country where the penalty of being born a woman is death.         
	In the family at the centre of the novel, however, a girl still survives. Her three uncles, who are rich estate-owners, have hidden her from the authorities through elaborate methods of concealment. They have artificially stunted her growth to evade the Generals and their agents of law enforcement, the Boyz, who carry out periodic searches in the estate. When the novel opens, the girl, Meiji, is still a child in her mind and body although she has reached adolescence. Her uncles decide that such a state is unnatural and she must be made to grow up. But it is impossible for her to continue living in the estate as an adult woman without inviting danger upon herself and her family. So her youngest uncle takes her on a hazardous journey to a place preferably outside the borders of her country where she would no longer be deemed an anomaly.         
	Speculative fiction works by posing a what-if. Escape is a speculation on a state of affairs in which men have found women redundant and dispensed with them. The dystopia it presents is supposed to shock us into recognizing the devastation that will be unleashed if men assign no value on women and kill them off. But Escape fails in its purpose because the alternative reality it presents is not terrifying enough. In fact, the life that Meiji and her uncle lead is quite alluring in so far as it is one of endless leisure. The men are served round the clock by drones, who are sub-human creatures generated in factories to perform menial labour. The drones attend to every need of their masters, to the extent that they give the men baths, lay out elaborate robes for them to wear and just stop short of feeding them. Since the drones are not human, the ethicality of making them serve this way does not arise. And so the men, at least those we come closest to in the novel, generally spend their time eating, drinking and being merry, and sometimes deliver ponderous lectures on Meijis future. If they do not have freedom, which can be said to define human existence, then they do not seem to mind it much. It is true that it is a decadent world and the plot necessitates that Meiji and her uncle, Youngest, give up this life to walk the perilous path to freedom. But Padmanabhan dithers in this laid-back world for too long, pointing out its luxuries, so that the depiction of the duos life in the wilderness seems sketchy and too unreal by contrast. The country without women does not quite horrify, either the readers or the characters involved, if one discounts the occasional pricks of conscience suffered by the latter.        
	Since Meiji is the only surviving female in the novel, Padmanabhan would have have done better to give her a more active role than the one she gets to play. It is she who must prove that women are more than passive agents of reproduction who can be eliminated once men master the technique of multiplying themselves. But by keeping her a child for the greater part of the novel, Padmanabhan deprives Meiji of agency. Her bafflement and anger, as the facts about her identity are revealed to her after being kept a secret for sixteen years, are plausible enough. But they remain a childs reaction. The novel ends at the point where she has just started maturing, and so we do not get to know much about her response as a woman to the unique situation she finds herself in.        
	Furthermore, Meiji is overshadowed throughout the novel by Youngest. It is ironical that in a novel meant to emphasize the worth of women, the strongest character is a man. Youngest is the most rounded character in Escape, both literally and figuratively. He is a combination of an angry young man, a chivalrous knight-at-arms, an aesthete and a dandy. He is the one who constantly laments the passing of the spectrum of gentleness and beauty called women from his life. He adores Meiji, even feels lust for her, but is as critical of her as he is of himself. Youngest is the rugged hero, the stern yet loving father figure under whose auspices Meiji must carve out her destiny. Because he shoulders Meijis responsibility and acts on her behalf, the girl stays a child till the very end.        
	Escape is best read as a childrens adventure tale cum science fiction featuring gallant heroes, adorable heroines, cardboard villains and a few fantastic gadgets like a Ruby ring which kills with its rays or a Mirrorskin hood which can make the objects underneath it invisible. As an adult reader, it is difficult to be chilled by a world which is ruled by Generals who strut and stutter, do brisk sit-ups when they are worked up, munch on lotus stems and generally behave like ham actors. Even the Generals army of the Boyz is so ineffectual (being mass produced) that Youngest can finish off a gang single-handedly. Like her Generals, Padmanabhan too emerges as a lotus-eater who would rather linger in the easeful world of a childs fantasy than take on the implications of the very real threat on which her fiction is premised.

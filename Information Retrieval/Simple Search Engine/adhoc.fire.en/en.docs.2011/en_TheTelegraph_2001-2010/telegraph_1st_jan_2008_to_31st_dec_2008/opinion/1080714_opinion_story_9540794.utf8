                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TRUE TO THE CALLING                              Jesse Helms (1921-2008)                              
	When Jesse Helms died last week, I felt America had lost a true statesman, and I had lost a great friend. In 1995, I was contacted by a spokesperson for the Helms campaign seeking support for the senators re-election to the Senate. I declined repeatedly until one day I was convinced to meet the senator personally. The meeting was scheduled for 15 minutes but lasted for over an hour.        
	I told Senator Helms that in my community he was perceived as against Indian Americans, and against India. Whether these perceptions were true or not, I did not know, but in politics perceptions are the reality. Jesse disagreed vehemently, but he did not get mad. He asked what he could do to change what he considered misconceptions.         
	I suggested that he could meet the Indian ambassador, give an interview to a leading Indian American publication, and talk to some Indian Americans. He did all of this  and more. He educated himself on Indian American issues and in 1997 was the keynote speaker of a meeting of the Indian-American Forum for Political Education. This was the first time this national group was holding its annual convention in Raleigh, North Carolina. Jesse went out of his way to establish warm relations with me, my family, and others in the Indian American community.         
	In 1998, when India conducted nuclear tests and the United States of America imposed sanctions, Senator Helms was upset. But he used his position as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to hold hearings. These hearings gave the US and the world a greater understanding of why India, with nuclear-armed China and a nuclear-capable Pakistan on its borders, felt compelled to test. This understanding eventually led to the lifting of sanctions and to a widespread, bipartisan appreciation of why the two largest democracies on earth need to stand together on issues of common concern. Because of this understanding, the US and India are making unprecedented progress on a range of issues, from the fight against terrorism to agricultural development to the use of nuclear technology to provide clean, safe energy. Jesse Helms was at the forefront of US-India cooperation on all these issues.                 
	Good statesman        
	When Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee came to the US in 2000, Senator Helms stepped forward to host a reception for him. Immediately after Vajpayees landmark address to a joint session of Congress, I stood with Chairman Helms as he welcomed the prime minister. The reception was held in the very same room in which the hearing on the nuclear tests had started the US-India reconciliation two years before. It was an emotional moment, deepened by the respect and friendship that Jesse showed to all the Indians and Indian Americans present.         
	Now, it has become fashionable to court the Indian American community. Every politician realizes that the community can be a strong resource, intellectually and financially. But Jesse fought for the Indian American community much earlier. He did not care about our money, he did not seek to hobnob with internet billionaires or powerful doctors or media personalities. He believed that the Indian American community was making America a better place, and that it was in the best interests of the US to have a strong relationship with India.         
	When I last saw Jesse in North Carolina, his health was failing, but his mind was still sharp and demeanour unchanged. He exuded the same personal concern and courtesy I had come to value so highly. He asked about my family and we talked about the old times; the battles we had fought and won, the leadership he has shown on many important issues. The US and India will miss him as a statesman and I will miss him as a friend.

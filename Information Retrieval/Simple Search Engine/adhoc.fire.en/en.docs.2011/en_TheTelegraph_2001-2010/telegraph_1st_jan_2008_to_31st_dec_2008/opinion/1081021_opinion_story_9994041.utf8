The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To have a well-oiled policy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TO HAVE A WELL-OILED POLICY                              Commentarao      S.L. Rao                        End of the road?				                                             
	A recent conference in Delhi by The Energy and Resources Institute and the Khemka Foundation discussed energy security and the future of oil and gas supplies in India. It was clear that energy security is not about mere power generation or discovering oil, but about alternative sources, tariffs, conservation, foreign policies, and so on.        
	India uses much non-commercial energy. This will reduce as the economy develops. India is and will in the foreseeable future be excessively dependent on high ash-producing domestic coal for generating power. India also has a growing dependence on imported crude oil though gas dependence will reduce due to large domestic discoveries. Heavy subsidies to some customer groups, high theft of power, incompetence in the power system, inefficient use of power, uneven consumption over the day, leading to waste of power, little incentive for conservation, and lack of leadership to persuade the public that they must pay for the power they use  these are issues that need resolution. Supplies of oil and gas are mainly from the Middle East where Indian workers have a large presence. Supplies from other countries are minimal while India has not had much success in gaining control over oil and gas fields overseas.              
	Indias power sector, largely under government ownership, is unprofitable and cash-strapped. In the oil and gas sector, diesel, kerosene and cooking gas are subsidized, with the oil companies expected to recover the subsidy by charging higher prices for other oil products like petrol and aviation fuel. The government is not raising retail prices in spite of the rise in the price of crude oil. Public-sector oil companies are incurring huge losses as a result. The government has issued bonds, but the public-sector oil companies are still under tremendous cash squeeze. The private oil companies are not subject to similar pressures. Indeed the largest of the private refiners imports crude for conversion into refined products for export on which it enjoys benefits as an export-oriented unit.         
	Gas is used mainly for power and fertilizer. The private sector gets better prices than the public sector. India should import fertilizers from gas-rich countries, instead of producing all its requirements in India. Pressures of climate change and the need to control emissions from burning coal for producing power will compel us to increasingly use gas for generating power. Gas prices, however, in the context of distorted and heavily subsidized power tariffs, are too high.         
	India must price gas like China, which regulates gas prices in the same way as power and fertilizer prices are regulated. If the contractual arrangements with New Exploration Licensing Policy do not allow this, the excess profits must be taxed for meeting the cost of subsidies to power and fertilizers.        
	Our political leadership is unwilling to allow the power sector to become financially viable by allowing cost recovery. If some customer groups have to be subsidized, they must be clearly identified and the subsidy amounts reimbursed to the producers from tax revenues. Neither is it a solution to target appropriate beneficiaries nor to make all other customers pay for the cost of service.         
	This deprives India of flexibility in its energy policies. We are stuck with coal as the main fuel. Gas, solar and wind power are more expensive than coal-based power. Regulators should set the costs of cleaning the pollution caused by burning coal against the savings made by using renewable energy.        
	Imported gas is too expensive for power generation so long as power tariffs are uneconomic. Pressures of climate change makes coal an unwise choice and the growing domestic availability of gas makes gas the easy option for use in power.         
	Indias energy security requires the expansion of its sources of energy from coal and water to other non-greenhouse-gas-emitting fuels like uranium, wind, solar power and gas. Nuclear energy is ten years from significant generation in overall energy supplies. Like the Atomic Energy Commission, we must focus on renewables and thrust into efficient use of wind and solar energy.         
	We must concurrently enforce measures for optimizing energy use, energy conservation, recharging ground water, rainwater harvesting and improving energy efficiency to reduce our demand for energy while increasing production. We must use differential tariffs for different times of the day and incentives for conservation and energy-efficient improvements. Strong penalties must push industries and households in these directions. Ministerial exhortations must be bolstered by tough legislative and regulatory measures.        
	Thankfully, India now recognizes that foreign policy must look after our interests first and take moral positions only when it does not cost us to do so. Countries that have resources that might be of use to us  oil, gas, uranium, coal, or metals  must be courted. Their political and social systems might be strange to us, but we need them. We have much to offer, especially to African countries in building social infrastructure in areas like health, education, nutrition, and in educating and training people. The Middle East has been a major employer of Indians whose remittances have been a stable source of foreign exchange inflows for almost three decades. We must be a peacekeeper between them and the West. Latin America may be far away but could also be a marginal source of supply.         
	We need productive alliances with economies like ours. These are the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, China), and also Korea and Mexico, all of which are high on population and low on energy. We must engage in joint research on the problems we face. For example, European research on clean coal technologies is not too relevant for us because their coal is superior. China and India have high-ash coal, on which these two can conduct collaborative research.              
	We live in a hostile world and our energy policy must recognize this. The renegotiations on prices for the Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier and the Sukhoi aircraft show that Russia will no longer give India special treatment. But we must still woo Russia as an important oil- and gas-producer, whose goodwill can give us easier entry into central Asian energy resources.         
	The temporary hold-up of Russian gas supplies in transit to Europe through Ukraine demonstrates the possible dangers for us if the Iranian gas supply happens through Pakistan. However, the risk may be worth taking if supplies affect only a fraction of the economy. Our policies cannot be too critical of governments that are important sources of energy supply like Burma or Sudan or Nigeria. We can try to influence them.        
	The huge increase in crude prices has brought immense wealth to many oil-exporting countries. Some of them have created overseas wealth funds which invest in many enterprises around the world. We must be watchful that these countries do not get vantage positions in the Indian economy. We must push hard for transparency in their operation and get international agencies to regulate them. Similarly we must continue to be hesitant in further opening up Indias financial sector to buccaneering practices that have spelt disaster for the American economy. Most important, our economic policies must aim to improve our economic fundamentals in terms of the fiscal deficit, deficit in the balance of payments, volatile foreign exchange reserves and the low share of agriculture and industry in the GDP. Energy security can only be attained through a set of coordinated policies.

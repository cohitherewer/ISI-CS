	Just as Oxbridge has now fallen behind the American Ivy League campuses, so too has British publishing been eclipsed by American publishers. And this applies to all categories of writing  from science, technology and medicine to the humanities and social sciences, down to sex, crime and glitz. The publishing standards of American books in general are much higher than those of their British counterparts. But ask publishers about this and they always say that the superiority of American publications is simply a matter of scale: five times as big an audience equals higher print runs equals lower unit costs equals the possibility of making nicer books.        
	This is true but the issue isnt as simple as that. Good publishing is ultimately a matter of detail  the choice of titles, the editing, design, quality of production and finally, marketing and sales. Each of these functions involves a whole lot of sub-functions that have to be fine-tuned before the package is finally put in the market.        
	Because there is a huge reservoir of intellectual talent available in America, publishers can pick and choose authors or commission them (with huge advances that the Brits cannot afford) to write on subjects they think would sell. And once the subject matter has been decided on by the publishers, it is usually evaluated by two or three experts who give a clear brief on what to look out for in terms of language and style.         
	But this is just the first step; what comes next is the hardest part  the detailed editing of the work. American editing is frugal and ruthless. Everything extraneous is mercilessly taken out. Thats not all. Major American publishers have a separate department consisting of fact-checkers  they go through the works with a sieve, double-checking all the facts down to the minutest detail.        
	This isnt the case with British publishers, who tend to give their authors as much space as they want, sometimes twice as much as they need. The result is too many sentences with useless words, and paragraphs with useless sentences.         
	The biggest difference between American and British publishing is in terms of marketing and sales. Compared to Britain, the American market is huge. To give an example: an initial print of 5,000 copies of an up market science-technology-medical book in Britain would be considered good; in America this would be chicken feed. And when it comes to novels or down-market entertainment, 50,000 copies in America would make no news; in Britain it would be something to take note of.        
	 What all these differences amount to is this: today all major publications in the English language, fiction or non-fiction, originate in America. Even books in other major languages of the world are first translated into English in America more than anywhere else. You simply cant do without American books now.

	The blatant irresponsibility of the political leadership in India, across party lines, is an untenable, unacceptable reality, which is bound to become the real issue at the polls sooner or later. The leaders will then be ruthlessly tried by the electorate. The attitude of our netas makes clear the reasons as to why this young nation did not grow and stabilize both economically and socially as the political class, aided and abetted by the administrative services, turned a blind eye to all the issues and problems that needed to be addressed and rectified. The privilege these men and women had  to rule and build a liberal, exciting and modern extension of a fine and complex, ancient and culturally strong civilization  was misused by them as they pursued their personal agendas and secured their positions, betraying India in the process. Their karma will soon compel them to pay a heavy price as those who were ignored, neglected and demeaned rise to assert their rights and ask to be empowered.         
	A volatile social upheaval is in motion. All Party leaders are playing short-term political games that will set the fabric of India on fire. To think that these elected representatives cannot come up with simple, humane solutions to hold this polity together makes one shudder with deep concern and a sense of fear. The horror of mismanagement in Kashmir brings the larger issue of faulty governance into sharp focus. What Pakistan and the Inter-Services Intelligence have worked for decades to achieve has been served to them on a platter over the last month. India has virtually bequeathed the peace initiative, started by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and accelerated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, to those who want the valley to be freed from India and made independent. Yes, the State machinery can hold Kashmir at gunpoint but it has abdicated its responsibility to the people of the valley and created a new generation of men and women who will not tolerate being brutalized by diktats with a gun pointed at them, whether the weapon belongs to the militants, terrorists or the State.                 
	Human chain        
	Times have changed and this kind of cavalier politics will find few takers. Today, as I write, the sangh parivar is blocking roads and rail lines in Jammu and in Delhi, threatening to immobilize and assault the everyday lives of citizens across India. Is this not an unlawful jihad as well  this attempt at dislocating life? How is this action any different from the eruptions that have affected many states? Surely, this is not the manner in which mature and sincere political parties should deal with social problems? Such behaviour mocks the institutions of equality, democracy and fraternity that are enshrined in our Constitution. It negates the obvious checks and balances that should come into play to coalesce and forge a joint remedy to promote law and order, dignity and safety. How can any national or regional party endorse this kind of disruption of essential and other services?        
	India is crying out for a strong minister for home and internal affairs. The unacceptable dilly-dallying, weak responses, tendency to pass on the buck and the blame, and the pitching of the states against the Centre in an effort to absolve the latter of its moral, national responsibility and of its duty to lead the states and the Opposition with conviction have discredited the United Progressive Alliance which, otherwise, has had a steady and sane track record with many successes. All the positives of the last four and a half years could go to seed if the fire on the ground is not contained, calmed and quelled with intelligence. All political leaders should form a human chain and encircle the parliament singing the national anthem, apologize to India for their failures and salute the patience of India and Bharat.

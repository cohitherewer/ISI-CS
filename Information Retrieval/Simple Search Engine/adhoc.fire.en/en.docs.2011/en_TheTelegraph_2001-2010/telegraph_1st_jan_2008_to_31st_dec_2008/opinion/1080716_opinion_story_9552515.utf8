	Compared to an increasingly delinquent Iran and an equally disappointing Iraq, North Korea appears to be mending its ways. Last month, when Pyongbyong blew up the main cooling tower of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor, the United States of America was pleased enough to reward Kim Jong-ils Stalinist dictatorship by lifting the trade sanctions. After pulling out of a previous deal with the US in 2002, followed by negotiations that seemed to be going nowhere, North Korea finally handed in a staggering inventory of its nuclear activities to China  one of the six nations that persuaded it to give up its underground uranium enrichment programme  last month. Amidst much scepticism over the success of these talks, Pyongbyong has already bettered its good behaviour on July 12 with a historical pledge to disable all its nuclear facilities by the end of October this year. The prizes, expectedly, are many: increased energy aid, better diplomatic relations with the US and Japan, and renewal of broken bilateral accords with South Korea.        
	In this basket of diplomatic goodies, what should please North Korea the most is the sea change in its international reputation: from shining bright on the US terror blacklist to becoming a role model for other rogue states. However, the US would be raising its hopes too high if it imagines that North Korea would surrender like an obedient schoolboy. Already the six nations have sought the help of the International Atomic Energy Agency for verification of pre-existing nuclear reserves. It is believed that North Korea has stockpiled enough uranium to build a dozen bombs. Despite US statutory sanctions on missile trade, Pyongbyong test-fired seven missiles in 2006, including the Taepodong-2, which could potentially hit the US west coast. Moreover, Syria, Iran and Pakistan were once enriched on the finer points of nuclear power generation by North Korea. The allure of increased aid might succeed in containing North Koreas overt ambitions, but friends cannot be made out of foes through economic blackmail.

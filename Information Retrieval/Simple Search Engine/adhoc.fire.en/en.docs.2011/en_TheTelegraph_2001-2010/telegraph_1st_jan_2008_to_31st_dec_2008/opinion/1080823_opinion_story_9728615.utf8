                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Implausible act                                    The American Centre imported The Whale, by the Concrete Temple Theatre from New York, as its theatre presentation this year. This dramatization of Herman Melvilles Moby Dick by Carlo Adinolfi and director Renee Philippi proved overambitious in time and space: compressing such a novel into as little as one hour meant the loss of substantial material; and minimizing the epic scale of the source into the tiny scope of chamber theatre sacrificed its imaginative grandeur. I never sensed its prophetic vision of ecological disaster at work, nor its stunning concept of the white leviathan as Nature embodied into mans nemesis, crushing him for bloodily violating Creation. To have all this in a solo performance required more power than Adinolfi could deliver, though he switched from Sub-sub-librarian to the narrator Ishmael, the obsessed Captain Ahab and even a spouting Moby Dick, enlarged in shadow by footlighting. However, his set and props design enthralled: canvas rigged as backcloth, tackles, oars and wooden blocks carefully hewn and crafted suggesting a sailing ship, and quaint toy models of the Pequod and her whaleboats assembled deftly. David Pinkard composed an evocative soundtrack.

	Colours of love        
	Ranan presented Rangeeniyan at Padatik Buildwell Theatre on July 18. Conceived and choreographed by Debashree Bhattacharya and Vikram Iyengar, the production depicted the various shades of love with the help of elegant compositions that were accompanied by ghazal, geet and thumri. Sohini Debnath succeeded in creating a romantic ambience with her graceful movement and subtle expression. The nimble footwork of the other performers reflected their excellent understanding of the idiom. Despite the small space, the dancers used the props and the backdrop intelligently. The melodious music was arranged by Siddhartha Bhattacharya.

	Sadness on wings        
	Kanchanmala Ghosh paints her moods in colours. After exhibitions titled Blue and Red, she came up with Shades of Grey at the Birla Academy of Art and Culture recently (Aug 12-17). The limpid eyes of the languid faces in the paintings drip melancholy but, otherwise, look disconcertingly flat. Birds of Rain, featuring tiny birds with outstretched wings, surprises with its depth.

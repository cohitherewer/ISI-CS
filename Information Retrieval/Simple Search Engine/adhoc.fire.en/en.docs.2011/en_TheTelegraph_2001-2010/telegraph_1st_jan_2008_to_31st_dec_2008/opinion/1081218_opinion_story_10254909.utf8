	The Ghotala Rath Yatra, a political satire on governance, was storming through the crowded market town of Nokha in Bikaner. The bhajan singers accompanying the handcart, which doubled as the rath for the neta, had changed their refrain from the sarcastic Ghotala raj ki jai jai bolo... bhrashtachar ka hari hari bolo to the more direct Ghotala raj ki pol ko kholo. People gathered around the rath to engage in a lively debate with Shri Rajvani (the voice of the state). An independent candidate decided to follow the rath yatra around, and stood up on a stool as soon as the yatra left, to address the audience and capitalize on the opportunity. As he began his speech, literally beating his breast, people dispersed quickly. The Ghotala Rath had travelled extensively in Rajasthan as the mascot of the right-to-information campaign. The street-corner dialogues with the people during this yatra reflected a much higher level of frustration and anger with the political class than what we had seen in the last decade.        
	Elections are a good time to use the public space and the heightened interest of the common man to begin a serious political dialogue. The Ghotala Rath Yatra was part of the Lokmat Yatra in Rajasthan, which travelled through the state over three weeks carrying a peoples manifesto, and an agenda of election watch for discussion with citizens. About 80 activists drawn from civic organizations travelled in two jeeps and in the back of a truck, and dialogued with people as campaigning was under way. Their points of focus were the electoral system, and the ways to engage the people as voters in a dialogue about what could or should be done.         
	State elections all over India are over and the chief ministers are in place. The media and the poll analyses tell us that development has been rewarded and that good governance has been the peoples agenda. Obviously, that is a priority with the people but such analyses ignore the basic decline in the quality and level of political discourse.                 
	With the masses        
	Whether it is the anti-incumbency factor leading to rounds of musical chair, or the return to power of the incumbent government, the issue of who comes to occupy the seat of power remains a sub-plot in the larger political story of our democracy. That story is actually one of a pervasive sense of despair, frustration and dissatisfaction with politicians, and about the lack of real choice in the electoral process.         
	This is not to ignore the value of our democratic framework. The sense of distress among the voters is a warning as well as an opportunity. While there is popular dissatisfaction with corruption and the way money controls the electoral process, there is also an understanding of the importance of vote. People understand that vote is their only means to enforce some form of political accountability. People feel a need to find various methods to make the elected representatives accountable. One of the demands proclaimed enthusiastically during the yatra was to allow the electorate the right to recall the elected representatives. During the dialogues, Rajvani was overwhelmed by Janvani, and each performance ended with the slogan, Janta, tum aage badho, desh tumhare saath hai.         
	For peoples politics, which has acquired a greater mandate and respectability in the last decade, the challenges are huge. There are very few political formations that can offer a clear definition of an alternative political paradigm. Issue-based politics has gained credibility but the need to more effectively connect with the masses remains. Sandwiched between caste-based politics and corrupt practices lie the mauled ideologies. Politicians have often betrayed their own stated intent and left the voter with an additional set of dilemmas. Social activists have to use these areas of gray to communicate and educate the people, and to evolve a new political lexicon. One hopes that a new democratic discourse will emerge in the process.

	Behind the class
         
	Sir  The dismal state of school education in West Bengal is shocking (School slide for Bengal, comrade still on top, Jan 23). Let Kerala maintain its position of supremacy in the field of education, we must be content being ahead of backward Bihar and Jharkhand! Several questions crop up regarding Bengals disappointing record in school education. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan is nothing but a farce. Most children below the poverty line are sent to school not for the benefit of an education but for the free mid-day meals offered in government schools. However, it is only natural that these malnourished and hungry children would have little enthusiasm for studies when their stomachs are empty. 
     
	The plight of the teachers is even more pathetic. They have to struggle to conduct classes with an unmanageable teacher-student ratio, but are answerable to the SSA authorities for any lapse. How many government schools in the remote areas of Bengal can boast of a proper laboratory, library or computer facility? Needless to say, the infrastructure needs to be improved, but are the government funds put to judicious use? When will the promises made during election campaigns be realized? An information technology hub in the state will come up in the near future, but free and accessible education for all is a more immediate requirement. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The findings of the National University of Educational Planning and Administration that West Bengal now ranks 33rd among the 35 states in India in educational standards  which is just ahead of Jharkhand and Bihar  is shameful. As a secondary schoolteacher, I know for a fact that it took the secondary and higher secondary boards years to revise the moribund syllabus. It is only now that our chief minister has admitted to the governments error with teaching English in schools. There are schools affiliated to the West Bengal secondary and higher secondary boards that have absolutely no provision for computer education. Above all, child labour is a common enough sight in the state and nobody seems to care. Surely our children deserve better. The Centres report should be taken very seriously, or the day is not far when West Bengal, which is already lagging behind in several areas, will be the last on the scale even in caring for citizens.
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Wonder years
     
	Sir  I wish to convey my congratulations to The Telegraph on its silver jubilee. The special 32-page supplement commemorating 25 years of the newspaper was a wonderful trip down memory lane, giving readers the opportunity to relive important events of the past  news that have caused horror as well as euphoria. However, there is one important omission. There is no story either on or by Satyajit Ray. If memory serves me right, there was a priceless rebuttal by Ray to the review of his Shakha Prasakha by the then art editor of The Telegraph, Chidananda Dasgupta. If I am not mistaken, this was in the form of a letter to the editor. Ray aficionados like me would be delighted if letters like this are reproduced.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Anupam Deb, Calcutta

        
	Sir  As a 16-year-old, going through the selected articles that have appeared in The Telegraph over the past 25 years gave me an understanding of things that took place before my time. It was an overwhelming feeling. My mother looked over my shoulder as I was reading the special supplement and she told me that she was 16 herself when she read the first issue of The Telegraph. The paper has set high standards for good writing, and much of my own vocabulary has expanded through a regular reading of the paper. I have followed the changes in layout, the shift from black-and-white to colour of certain pages and the introduction of new sections closely. My congratulations for this fitting ode to good journalism.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Soumashree Sarkar, Calcutta

        
	Sir  As a regular contributor for the first 12 years of The Telegraph, I was filled with nostalgia as I read the supplement celebrating 25 years of the papers journey. However, I must say that I feel pained to see photographs of filmstars almost everywhere in the paper. It does not behove a paper which carries some of the best editorials in India.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

        
	Parting shot
     
	Sir  The British prime minister, Gordon Brown, has recommended the knighthood for Sachin Tendulkar (Hand of friendship from good sport Brown, Jan 22). The cricketing legend and knighthood recipient, Don Bradman, found the Little Masters batting style akin to his own. The former Sri Lankan captain, Arjuna Ranatunga, too has supported Brown. It seems that only Tendulkars homeland will forever fight shy of recognizing his contribution and stop at giving him a Padma award. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	For the police, learning to manage crowds is part of ones basic training. Although Calcutta never fails to provide a reason for people to assemble, this is the time of year when a policeman has to summon all his crowd-management skills. During the Durga Puja, we ensure that each pandal has a wider exit than its entrance, as well as an emergency exit, which is opened when the footfall increases. Another crowd-control strategy is to stagger the entry of people, so that if a stampede-like situation arises, there is only a limited number of people caught in it. A stampede is triggered either by an actual incident  for instance, an explosion  or a rumour, as with the temple tragedy in Jodhpur. We live in unsafe times, but it must be said that the people of Calcutta are, in general, quite conscious and alert. They use their resources to check the truth of a rumour rather than give in to panic. There is always Calcutta Polices toll-free number, 1090, which people can call to put their fears to rest.         
	At places of worship, where a large number of devotees gather in a cramped space, such as the Kalighat temple, the police share the responsibility of managing the crowd with the temple authorities. We do not believe in blaming each other post facto. Though we have an efficient disaster management group, our goal is prevention, not rescue.

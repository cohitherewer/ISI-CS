	For the same reason as it swelled with pride when the Tatas acquired Corus, the proto-Indian heart must have missed a beat when Daiichi Sankyo bought the shares of the founder Singh family in Ranbaxy. The gloom would have been deepened by the prospect that the new Japanese promoter may not be as friendly to Indian shareholders. Daiichi has acquired 35 per cent of the equity. With the compulsory public offer its share could go up to 55 per cent; and it may not stop there. Like many foreign companies with Indian subsidiaries, Daiichi may decide that the Indian shareholder is something between a superfluity and a nuisance. However, the sleeping Indian shareholder may not have noticed how international, and hence how foreign, Ranbaxy had already become. In the last accounting year, Ranbaxys sales in India had shrunk to less than a fifth of its turnover. Ranbaxy decided in 1993 to become a research-based international pharmaceutical company; since then it has followed its corporate mission singlemindedly. The following year it issued global depository receipts in Luxemburg and set up offices in the United States of America and Britain.        
	Since then it has been trying to get a foothold in the US market, the worlds largest and most lucrative. But it is also dominated by a handful of domestic firms which have kept a lead in new drugs ever since World War II and are determined to keep it against rising odds. In the process they do not mind playing dirty. The American regulatory and patent regimes are generally fair, but they do make it possible for big companies to delay the plans of newcomers and impose heavy legal costs on them. Last year, Ranbaxy paid out Rs 1.5 billion in legal and professional charges. That may not sound much for a company with sales of Rs 47 billion; but it is almost a quarter of its net profits. Ranbaxy needed more muscle to fight the big boys. Malvinder Singh faced the choice of becoming a junior partner to a big multinational organization. That would have put paid to the vision that built up Ranbaxy, and cramped the promoters style. So he decided to sell out.        
	Daiichi is five times as large in terms of turnover. It is unlikely to neglect or run down Ranbaxys Indian operations, including its strong research and development outfits, for that is where Ranbaxys value lies. But it will probably try and disentangle Ranbaxy from the vexatious American market, and expand business in east Asia. A change of strategy was required; Daiichi will make it. Meanwhile, it will be interesting to see what Mr Malvinder Singh and his family do with their enormous windfall. Will they build malls? Set up mountain resorts? Start their mutual fund? It is unlikely that they will set up another industrial firm, for the age of industrial enterprise seems to have passed in India.

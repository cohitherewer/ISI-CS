	There is nothing higher than freedom. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, knows this as he declared that he was happy to be a free man. He said this when he had shrugged off his governments dependence on the Left, and had thereby freed himself from the blackmailing tactics of the comrades. It is clear once again that Left support to Mr Singhs government will only be forthcoming with a very heavy price tag. Sitaram Yechuri asked the prime minister to reconsider his economic policies if he wanted the Left and the Congress to work together for secularism and national unity. Mr Yechuris statement contains an implicit admission of his priorities. That apart, what is obvious is that Left ideologues, with no answers to the present economic crisis, are peddling their own tarnished clichs. Whatever ill happens or has happened must be the fault of liberalization; and the immediate answer is a return to the planned and protectionist economic regime of the pre-liberalization era. That such a reversal will mean a return to the Hindu rate of growth is of no consequence to the comrades since an investment in poverty is the communists stock-in-trade. The impoverishment of leftist ideas is revealed by the claim that by preventing pension funds from entering the stock market, the leftists have done a service. It does not strike them that pension funds are relatively less volatile, and thus their presence would have prevented exposure to more volatile instruments available in the bourses.        
	The bigger lesson for Mr Singh is that his differences with the Left on issues of foreign and economic policies are absolutely fundamental. Mr Singhs wisdom and sense of reality tell him that the future of India lies in being part of a globalized world. This participation, Mr Singh will be the first to admit, is not without certain risks. But these are risks worth taking, because the dividends are enormous. A blip in the market process should not be interpreted as a signal for doom. This is not to deny that things are gloomy, but there is no reason to bring about a radical shift in economic policy. The cause of secularism is an important one in India. Upholding it should not tempt Mr Singh to surrender his freedom by seeking leftist bondage. The comrades would dearly love a reversal of economic policy, but that is as remote a possibility as the communist utopia.

	Who says that economists have no sense of humour? Here is a joke about economists told by an economist.Such a severe depression and banking crisis could not have been achieved by normal civil servants and politicians. It required economists.         
	But perhaps a sizeable section of the world believes that this is actually not a joke. Economists are certainly not looked upon very kindly by the rest of mankind today. Queen Elizabeth is said to have asked recently, Why did no one warn us? as she stepped across the hallowed portals of the London School of Economics. Her Majesty was, of course, only asking a question which has been asked by many others as they blame economists for not anticipating and preventing the global economic crisis.        
	This is not completely fair to economists, at least not to all economists. Many economists, the most vociferous being Nouriel Roubini of New York University, have sounded repeated warnings about the inevitability of a financial crisis for over two years. Indeed, Roubini had written about the American housing market crisis as early as in September, 2006. Other economists have pointed out the dangers posed by the United States of Americas huge external deficit, the frailty of the new financial capitalism and so on. Unfortunately  and this is where the profession of economists is guilty of serious crime  the group as a whole did not seem to have taken these warnings as seriously as they should have been. Surely, most governments would have been forced to act many months ago if the vast majority of economists had warned the world even six months ago about the severity of the economic crisis?        
	But that is now history. The million-dollar question today is how soon the world economy can climb out of the recessionary phase.               
	In this globalized world with a well-integrated world economy, individual country initiatives are not the best course of action. Perhaps this realization prompted leaders of the G-20 countries to meet in Washington a few weeks ago. The meeting turned out to be a damp squib. All the participants in this meeting recognized the need to implement coordinated rescue plans. Unfortunately, no concrete plans were announced during the course of the meeting.         
	The closest that the G-20 countries came to taking some coordinated action was the promise that countries would not try to be selfish  they would not raise tariffs in order to protect their own domestic producers. Sadly, both Russia and India broke that promise within a couple of weeks of that meeting by raising some import duties.        
	Fortunately, there seems to have been some coordinated action even if it is not the immediate outcome of the G-20 meeting. Just last week, simultaneous interest rate cuts were announced in several Asian countries. A few hours later, the Bank of England slashed the rate of interest by one per cent to take it to the lowest level since 1951. Soon after, the European Central Bank as well as the central bank in Sweden followed suit. The obvious purpose behind the interest rate reduction is to stimulate both the housing market by lowering mortgage payments as well as the industrial sector by providing cheap credit.        
	Of course, the pursuit of cheap money policy is a standard prescription to combat recessionary trends. However, it is worth keeping in mind that interest rate reductions are not necessarily the most effective anti-recessionary weapon. These can only have an indirect effect on aggregate demand. These help the private sector to increase expenditure, but may be ineffective if the private sector still finds the overall environment too gloomy to implement new projects. Perhaps this explains a part of recent Japanese experience. Although the rate of interest in Japan was virtually zero for a relatively long period of time, it did not help the Japanese economy to climb out of a recessionary phase.         
	What holds out much greater promise is the initiative on the fiscal front taken by several countries including the US, the United Kingdom and China. All these countries have either announced  or given every signal of planning to do so  gigantic increases in government expenditure. For instance, Chinas fiscal stimulus plan totals a massive $500 billion, although this is spread over two years. In the US, the Obama presidency is reported to be thinking of an expenditure package between 400 to 700 billion dollars. (India too has joined the action although the size of its stimulus plan pales into insignificance.) The sheer size of these pump-priming measures was unimaginable even a few months ago. Perhaps, these governments read a recent piece by the Nobel laureate, Paul Krugman, in which he argued that the severity of the recession means that it is much better to plan stimulus packages which are too big rather than too small.              
	Increases in public expenditure are a very direct means of boosting aggregate demand. The massive size of these programmes, even in a few countries, ensures that they will contribute towards a large increase in global demand. There is every reason to believe that the increased public expenditure will in subsequent periods induce or stimulate the private sector to increase expenditure. After all, the governments in major economies will have signalled in unequivocal terms that they will bring out every powerful weapon that they have to ensure that the world economy comes out of a recession. Expectations are of paramount importance. If a sufficient number of firms and entrepreneurs believe that the major economies will be able to stave off recessionary pressures because of the increased public expenditures, then they will try to get into the act early in order to beat the competition. Their actions will then become self-fulfilling in the sense that their actions will make it easier for the world economy to climb out of the recession.        
	Much depends on trends in the Chinese economy. The economy in China is quite far away from a recession. But there has been an appreciable slow-down in the rate of growth. The size of its economy ensures that even a one per cent fall in the Chinese growth rate creates relatively big effects in the rest of the world. So, if the fiscal stimulus in China is successful in restoring the economy to the earlier growth path, then that will be a giant step towards lifting the world economy out of the doldrums. Perhaps, this process will also represent a step in a new direction  a new world order with China where China takes the position of the US in the current scenario.

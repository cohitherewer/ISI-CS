	Democracy works in mysterious ways. It may look as if the first phase of the elections in the state of Jammu and Kashmir has gone off unexpectedly well. Even if the officially reported voter turnout  55 per cent  is regarded with some scepticism, there can be little doubt that notwithstanding occasional false voting and charges of coerced voting, some allegations of incomplete rolls and consequent trouble, a far higher number of Kashmirs people voted in the first phase than the unacceptable 25 per cent that separatist outfits had hoped for. While it is true that no major disruption was engineered by these outfits, which were calling for a complete poll boycott, it is also true that the people went to vote in the intense cold, through hundreds of security personnel, braving the possibility of violence. By scheduling the seven-phase elections so soon after some of the fiercest anti-India protests in the state in recent times, the Indian government has taken a calculated risk, almost as if to test the credibility of the democratic process there. The state government disintegrated after the Peoples Democratic Party pulled out of its alliance with the Congress as one of the fallouts of the Amarnath land-diversion fiasco. The Indian government is doing what is normal in such a situation in the face of the rejuvenated separatist movement and sectarian tension.        
	It may feel cautiously pleased after the first phase. But the clarity of those voters who frankly support a separate Kashmir should give pause for thought. The people want better roads, water, local facilities, education, development. There is no reason not to exercise the right to ask for these. The new members of the assembly may also be expected to support the demand for a separate Kashmir, some feel. In any case, democratic elections and the demand for separation are different issues; hence the absolutism of the separatists  no vote till Kashmir is free of Indian rule  did not find many takers, at least in the first phase. Yet, no one can tell if a stable and peaceful environment, presided over by a forthright government that can begin to rebuild trust, may not ultimately lessen the appeal of separation. The power of democracy remains enigmatic.

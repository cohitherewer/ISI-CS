	It is not often that the platitudinous expressions of shock and sympathy for far-away disasters are truly heart-felt. We are hardened to distant death and destruction or choose at least not to think too much about those injuries and losses of life but rather, in unspoken and deniable thought, to congratulate ourselves that it was not on our doorstep this time. In the case of Mumbai, the Victoria Terminus, the Oberoi, Leopold and, most of all, the Taj Mahal Hotel, we have been truly shocked. There are a lot of keen travellers to India here, and we are stunned by the destruction of what is undoubtedly an iconic building but also a living entity in a way quite unlike the beautiful piles of stones we marvel at as tourists, whether in India or other countries. For my family, the Taj is something special and a place we know so well that we could imagine the rooms and public spaces almost as clearly as our own house when the terrorist attacks were reported. The hotel has at times been our home in India; my husband both lived and had an office there, overlooking the Gateway of India, for nearly a year, while I and different children at different times came and went. When we found a flat in Malabar Hill, my husband moved from his safe haven only with the greatest reluctance.        
	These days, when any of us is in Mumbai, we have too many hospitable friends to allow us to stay there, but the Taj still feels like an old friend where we are welcomed by doormen and porters and by the building itself. Interior facelifts, changing staff and restaurants notwithstanding, the bones of the place remain the same; the smiles, the smells and the comfortable atmosphere of Victorian solidity undisturbed by designer shops and designer guests. The familiar sounds of heels as they clickety clack down long passages upstairs or en route from the lobby to buy the best sandals in a spectrum of colours and heel heights from Joy Shoes, stopping on the way to gaze covetously at spectacular antique and contemporary jewels in Gazdars windows, where great ruby and diamond necklaces rival the treasure of the Nizams. Astonishingly, given television coverage of the wreckage, the Gazdar shop, hard by the swimming pool, has survived, intact.               
	I am sure the spirit of the place will survive too, when the mourning is done, the building revived and the terrorist devastation set to rights. Memories of the heroic staff who behaved with calm professionalism and extreme bravery throughout the siege, many losing their lives as a result of putting their guests first, will burnish and enhance the reputation of the hotel. As the backlash against local politicians, security and intelligence agencies and, all too inevitably, the always available enemy, Pakistan, consume the population, we can only hope, from this removed vantage point, that national politicians keep their heads and remain as cool and sensible under attack as the staff of the Taj, from the lowest to the highest.        
	Recent events in India have rightly overshadowed the wintry economic news here, and the ceremony of the opening of parliament by the queen will have done little to lighten anyones life unless you were actually there to witness the colour and arcane detail of a ceremony that showcases the pageantry of monarchy and our parliamentary system. On an icy day, the streets between Buckingham Palace and parliament were closed for carriages carrying the queen, the imperial state crown, royal dignitaries and servants for the pomp of the opening ceremony where the queens speech outlines the legislation of her government in the forthcoming parliamentary session. In this case, the speech itself was brief. Whether a somewhat incongruous measure under current circumstances to open the whole coastline of the British Isles for walkers was meant to cheer everyone up, I wouldnt know.        
	Otherwise, there was nothing new and little substance in the few minutes drawing of a mere 14 legislative measures and an unsurprising focus on security, stability and transparency. The last being of particular interest, given the parliamentary uproar over the arrest of a Conservative member of parliament and shadow minister by the police and the search of his office without a warrant, in breach both of parliamentary privilege and his rights as a private citizen. His alleged crime involves the leak of Home Office information that the police or others are said improbably to believe may have threatened national security. Transparency has not been the watchword in this case, but rather, obfuscation by all involved, especially the unpopular speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin.         
	Sitting on gold-painted chairs in the Royal Gallery of the House of Lords, in azure blue enclosures like stage-set race-stands, all was forgotten beyond the colour, trumpets and, in the end, sheer Britishness of parading elderly gentlemen at arms in bright metal helmets with tremendous swan feather plumes; the heralds and kings of arms looking like so many Alice in Wonderland playing cards in their stiff heraldic costumes; the yeomen of the guard from the Tower of London in beefeater uniforms with red and blue rosettes on shoulders and toes; the most elegant figure of the hereditary Lord High Chamberlain, the Marquis of Cholmondeley, in gold embroidered red tail coat; and, notwithstanding his red and gold robes, the naturally more rustic appearance of the Earl Marshall, the Duke of Norfolk, who bears hereditary responsibility for the machinery of such occasions of state.        
	The Gallery leads from the Robing room, where the monarch assumes her robes and the imperial state crown, surprisingly, unlike other crown jewel, lacking stones of Indian origin and imperial depredation. It is a spectacular object with diamonds and rubies the size of a babys fist. It must be unaccountably heavy to wear, especially for an 82-year-old, but, whatever the indications of the discomforts of cold and unaccustomed dress on the faces of young pages and other courtiers, the queen carried herself as upright as ever. As she progressed to the throne in the House of Lords, she was looked upon not only by an audience of wide nationality, colour and creed but also by the various representations of her ancestors. Portraits of the more recent impress less than the gilded statues of earlier kings and queens; an imperious Elizabeth I; warlike and armoured Henry V and Richard the Lionheart; William III and a flatteringly slimmed down Queen Anne, both looking as if they would rather be anywhere but there. Scenes of past battles run half the length of the walls and, high above the azure and gold carpet, hundreds of carved and gilded red roses of Lancashire cover the ceiling.              
	As we waited for the queens and the Duke of Edinburghs arrival, peers and peeresses wandered in and out in red, ermine trimmed robes fitting more or less well or flung over an arm to be put on hastily before entering the chamber of the Lords. This is one of the few days when the old families with ceremonial duties are to be seen in a contemporary House of Lords that is largely meritocratic if not yet democratic. It was encouraging to see a healthy contingent of women amongst the peers, although their appearance failed to raise the tone in the style stakes when expensive peers robes are often second- or third-hand and hang at entirely arbitrary lengths and angles in contrast to immaculate parliamentary and royal officials in silk knee breeches, perfect tail coats, ruffles and rosettes. A peculiarly British state of affairs that lordly disarray, and one that fit well with the friendly, apparently laid-back, policemen on security detail at the entrance doors, and the tacit expectation that everyone would behave just as he or she should without undue instruction or interference. The Lord Privy Seal, the Right Honourable Harriet Harman, might, however, have done better to consult some style guru before appearing amongst the gilded robes in a black trouser suit that failed to diminish her less satisfactory attributes.        
	I dont know about being proud to be British and a pageant is no reason for a rush of national pride, especially in these times and in a place where, later in the day, furious politicians were again at one anothers throats. Nonetheless, for a brief suspended hour, it was easy to ignore reality; the wounds inflicted on other countries that we love, the open doors allowing a howling draught round the feet; economic storms, and a long cold winter ahead and just revel in the sheer spectacle of a something we are really good at.

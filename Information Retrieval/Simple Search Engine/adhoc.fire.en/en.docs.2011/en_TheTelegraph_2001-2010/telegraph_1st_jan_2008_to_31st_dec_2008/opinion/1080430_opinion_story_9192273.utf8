The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When a City Becomes A City
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WHEN A CITY BECOMES A CITY                                  WORDCAGE -Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	Exactly what is a city? a Calcutta reader asks me. He seems, for some reason, not to think much of Bangalore, and indeed strangely challenges its right to that title. Hes certainly mistaken in that respect, but his question raises a wider issue.         
	The broad answer, as any dictionary will tell you, is any large or important town. But there are other places that qualify. In the United States of America, umpteen one-horse dumps call themselves city because they are officially incorporated as such. In Britain, some large towns have been awarded this title by the Crown. But equally any British town is a city if it has a church, normally an Anglican one, that qualifies as a cathedral, the home church of a bishop. Even little St Davids, a speck on the map in far-west Wales, is a city.         
	And Britain offers more niceties than that. Theres a city of London and a City of London, with a capital C. The latter is the quite small financial district  its familiarly known as the Square Mile  of the former; its title comes from its ancient royal charter, not its cathedral. Within the real, giant London, the borough where I used to live calls itself (though no one else does) the city of Westminster, again for historical reasons; its only cathedral is a modern Roman Catholic one. Theres another London borough, Southwark, that has an old cathedral but makes no claim whatever to call itself a city.                
	Partly right        
	My nearest city today is Winchester. It has an ancient cathedral, and ten centuries ago was the capital of England. Yet, recently, an ex-mayor, no less, declared that, strictly speaking, it isnt a city at all. In the Seventies, it seems, Winchester City Council decided to keep that title even when its domain was extended to take in various villages round about. The central government agreed. So Winchester itself, quoth this worthy, is now merely part of a city  most of which is, in fact, green fields.        
	He was, of course, not speaking strictly but talking nonsense. And thats where the wider issue of language arises. Officialdom, if the national constitution permits, is perfectly entitled to widen or narrow local administrative boundaries, or to rename the bodies that run them. But no local council, no central government, not God almighty can dictate the use of language. Only we users can do that. A city is a city if we say so, a village is a village (and not, part of a city, as our ex-mayor presumably believes), green fields are fields.                 
	Calling names        
	Of course, there are grey areas. Governments, central or lower down, can legitimately rename places, not merely the bodies that run them, and if enough people agree, so be it. But if not, not. The Northern Irish town officially renamed some two centuries ago as Londonderry, and now so called by its Protestant inhabitants, is invariably known as plain Derry by its Catholic ones. Both have a fair point.        
	Within limits, of course. neither sect is entitled to refer to its home town as Timbuctoo. But grey is how these areas should remain. Against my usual inclination, I deliberately wrote Calcutta at the start of this article. Most Britons would still do the same, just as they would write Rangoon, not Yangon, and you cant yet say theyre wrong.         
	But Ill bet at least one Telegraph reader has already leapt to his keyboard to insist on Kolkata  and maybe another will say exactly the opposite. I wonder whether any among the three of us three can spell the official new name for Bangalore.                            thewordcageyahoo.co.uk

	Fatherly concern                  
	Sir  It was a matter of expediency rather than professional ethics that had driven Jet Airways to sack close to two thousand employees. But Naresh Goyals effusiveness while announcing their reinstatement overnight seemed quite cosmetic (Sorry and salary salve for Jet kids, Oct 18). The company was bound to adopt cost-cutting measures, considering the present crisis in Indias aviation industry. Even the now aborted retrenchment drive had been anticipated by many, after Jet Airways and the Kingfisher Airlines joined hands to combat the fiscal terror.           
	Goyals theatrics while announcing his decision to take back his employees was unnecessary. Goyal has underestimated the intelligence of ordinary citizens, who, he thought, could be won over by his change of stance. Also, by posing as the father of his family, Goyal has compromised on the ethics of equality in a professional space. Goyal may be in a position of authority, but he should remember that he is merely the first among many equals.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Farzana Nigar, Ranchi

                
	Sir  The drama over the sacking and the subsequent reabsorption of Jet Airways employees provided some entertainment amidst the financial gloom. The aviation companies have landed themselves in trouble by following thoughtless management policies. For years, flight attendants and cabin-crew were being paid princely sums, and given luxurious accommodation and transport facilities. Now, thanks to the tottering markets, airline employees are having to swallow a bitter pill. Naresh Goyal may have taken back his children, mouthing sweet words, but the fact remains that he was forced to take such a step only on account of the pressure applied by labour unions and politicians.          
	Yours faithfully,      
A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It was absolutely unbecoming of Naresh Goyal to swear by his late mother to convince the journalists that he was unaware of the decision of sacking his employees. A businessman of his stature should not have to go that far to convince scribes that he is saying the truth. For all his protestations, Goyals claim that he did not know of the managements decision is surprising. A major decision to fire 1,900 employees, all of them probationers, could not have been taken solely at the behest of the management. In fact, it would not be a matter of pride for Goyal even if what he said was true. After all, the fact that a chairman was actually kept in the dark about the goings-on in his company cannot be flattering for him. He may also have denied any knowledge of a salary cut, which now seems to be distinctly possible. After such a scare, the Jet Airways employees will now agree to any conditions, however unfair, to save their jobs.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The reason cited by Naresh Goyal to call back his sacked employees was quite difficult to believe. Apparently, Goyal spent a sleepless night after seeing the jobless employees breaking down. However, Goyals conduct has set an ugly precedent. Important decisions by big industrialists should not be based on erratic whims and fancies. The incident has also shown that even the employees of big companies are sometimes deprived of minimal legal protection. This must have forced the probationers to seek help from the militant trade unions. This was certainly not the right approach, and the probationers should have approached the owners first before seeking out union bosses.           
	Yours faithfully,       
K. Venkataraman, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  The employees of Jet Airways have been reinstated, possibly because of political pressure on the management. Now it is being speculated that they may face a salary-reduction, just as the trainee co-pilots of Kingfisher Airlines (Kingfisher cuts trainee salary, Oct 19). Political coercion may sort things out in the short term, but private-sector employees must brace themselves for worse financial jolts. The global market is in recession, and its repercussions are being felt far and wide.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Rajyasree Bagchi, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is condemnable that Jet Airways resorted to the sacking of thousands of employees for no fault of theirs. Although the decision has been withdrawn, it showed that there is no provision of social security for employees in India. Our economy had been booming with mounting GDP rates, but we are yet to be given the benefits of a first-world economy.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Md Ziyaullah Khan, Pune

                
	Sir  If Jet Airways could opt for mass expulsion, one shudders to think how insecure professionals are in lesser-known institutions. Without remaining a silent spectator, the government should immediately step in and stop such arbitrary acts in the private sector and introduce legal protection for the employees in India.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Sambamurthy, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It was quite generous of Naresh Goyal to take back the probationers after just a day. Now that the employees have been reabsorbed in the airline company, they seem to have deserted their friends in the trade unions.           
	The entire episode served as a mirror to show how superficial the values of the youth have become. It is only when their careers are affected that they turn to politics. Otherwise, they are blind to incidents of national importance and spend their time in puerile pleasures.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kakali Mitra, Calcutta

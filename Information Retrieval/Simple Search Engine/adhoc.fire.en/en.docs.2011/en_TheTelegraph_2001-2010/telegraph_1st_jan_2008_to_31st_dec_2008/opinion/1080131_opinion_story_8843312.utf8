             - Does the truce over Harbhajan signal the end of sledging?

	The two greatest Test series India has played in recent times have been against Australia, 2001 at home and 2008, Down Under. Theres a curious symmetry in these two contests: India won the first one, 2-1 and lost the second one 1-2. Harbhajan was the pivot on which both turned: as a hero in the first (he took an astonishing 32 wickets in three Tests), and as a villain in the second, after his run-in with Symonds. If the 2001 series saw the beginning of Tendulkars transformation into an attritional player, the one just ended saw that master-craftsman persona discarded as Tendulkar went back to being the Master. And in both series, India stopped a great Australian teams astonishing winning run: Waughs team and Pontings were looking for a 17th consecutive victory and both were thwarted by unlikely defeats. 
    
	In the seven years between these two 21st-century contests, international cricket was dominated by two developing narratives. 
    
	One was driven by the strength of the Indian economy, the purchasing power of its consumerist middle class and the consequent and massive increase in the television revenues controlled by the BCCI. The Indian board became the paymaster of world cricket and crickets calendar became India-centric. This made other countries understandably uneasy. And when incidents like the Sehwag controversy in South Africa provoked the BCCI to flex its muscles, Anglo-Australian commentators saw not an evolutionary shift in crickets centre of gravity, but a thuggish take-over, while south Asian fans and journalists saw a Western unwillingness to acknowledge the end of Empire. 
       
	The second story was a growing south Asian unease with the successful Australian attempt to claim the moral high ground in world cricket. Australians dont like it but the countrys cricketers are widely seen as potty-mouthed bullies who manage to get away with murder partly because they sledge strategically and partly because the Australian definition of Hard but Fair filth on the field and a beer off it  seemed to have been swallowed whole by the umpires and match referees who supervise international cricket. Every time Ponting tells TV cameras that after 2003 the Australian team cleaned up its act and then cites figures to show that Australian players have been brought before the match referee much less often than any other major Test side, aggrieved Indian supporters put this down to Australian hegemony. They remain convinced that umpires are willing to sanction manly truculence (obscenity, lewdness and intimidation) but not shrill petulance (jack-in-box appeals, visible disappointment) because the former affects players while the latter is directed at umpires. This sense of being hard done by is reinforced by the pattern of bad decisions suffered by touring teams in Australia, Kumar Sangakkaras appalling decision being perhaps the worst in recent times. 
    
	Australian cricket is hegemonic for the best possible reasons. Australia has had the best cricket team by miles for more than ten years, its coaches have, at one time or another, tried to drill Australian skills into other national squads, its sports science and its training methods are cutting edge and Channel 9s cricket telecast has taught the world how to cover cricket. But because its players fetishize a hardnosed take on the game, they, unlike the West Indies in their pomp, are universally unloved and, in recent years, the Ugly Australian stereotype has been rendered uglier by Pontings charmless leadership. 
    
	Indians dont think much of Ponting for several reasons. His first tour was dogged by rumours of bad behaviour, his second tour was an embarrassment (he scored 11 runs). His on-field aggression strikes them as offensive, he spits into his palms and rubs them together (leaving desis to wonder how he gets people to shake hands with him) and not only does he look remarkably like George Bush, he behaves like him too. Bush invaded Iraq and then managed to get the invasion ratified by the United Nations. Anglo-American rhetoric about the legitimacy of pre-emptive war is similar to Australian crickets argument that bullying (so long as it wins matches) can be justified as robustness. Hard but Fair in the world defined by Bush begins to read like Shock and Awe. 
    
	It is in this charged context that the just-concluded Test series between India and Australia unfolded, and in the second Test at Sydney, the two grand narratives of 21st-century cricket  Indias growing economic clout and Australias cricketing hegemony  met like unsheathed live wires. 
    
	From the Indian point of view, the Sydney Test was a textbook illustration of the way in which an Australian series is loaded against the opposition. The Indian team got a slew of awful umpiring decisions, the Australians did their tiresome all-in-the-game-mate routine, Michael Clarke exploited a gentlemans agreement to claim a dodgy catch, Ponting disclaimed a catch and then unsuccessfully appealed for another that he had obviously grounded (and, post-match, shouted at an Indian reporter who questioned him about it), then reported Harbhajan for racially abusing Symonds. 
    
	When Mike Procter upheld the Australian charge and banned Harbhajan for three matches, he brought the two live wires into contact and the lights nearly went out on the game. Indian players have been at the receiving end of the match referees kangaroo court before and know it to be dysfunctional. Mike Procter is a notably inept referee who presided over the shambles created by Darrell Hair and the Pakistan cricket team last year. For him to have taken the word of the likes of Clarke  who as a batsman had stood his ground after being caught off a massive edge at slip and who as a fielder had confidently claimed a bump-ball catch  over the testimony of Tendulkar, who insisted he hadnt heard monkey being said, was the final straw. 
    
	I think its likely that Harbhajan called Symonds a monkey. The trouble is there was no corroborative evidence and the hostilities of the Sydney Test had destroyed any trust between the two sides and left the Indian team in a state of thin-skinned rage at being robbed. Procter managed the incredible feat of compounding this mess by unequivocally finding for the Australians without explaining how he had come to his conclusions. 
       
	This is when India flexed its economic muscle, but the India in question wasnt the BCCI, it was the Indian team. Anil Kumble and Sachin Tendulkar, the two most senior players in the Indian side, one its best bowler and the other its best batsman for nearly twenty years, put the BCCI on notice. They insisted that the Board stand by Harbhajan and made it clear that the team was unwilling to go on with the tour if Procters decision wasnt reversed. 
    
	Journalists who think the BCCI used the occasion to assert itself are just plain wrong. The Indian board has no interest in cricket as such: witness the absurd schedule it framed for the Indian team. Left to itself, the Board would have hung Harbhajan up to dry (as it had sacrificed Bishen Bedi over the Vaseline affair decades ago) and gone on with the tour: it was Tendulkars ultimatum that goosed them into action. Peter Roebucks criticism of the BCCIs brinkmanship in chartering a plane to fly the team home from Adelaide if the appeal went against Harbhajan ought to be directed at the Indian team, because Im certain that its that old firm, Kumble amp; Tendulkar, that called the shots and insisted that the arriving one-day specialists be quartered in Adelaide in solidarity with Harbhajan to make it clear to the Australians that Procters judgment based on an uncorroborated accusation had to be reversed. 
    
	I suspect the reason for this last flourish was the report that Judge Hansen was likely to consider new audio evidence that had not been made available to Procter. The tapes didnt have Harbhajan saying monkey but they had Hayden telling Harbhajan that a word he had used amounted to racism. My guess is that the possibility that the Australians would spin this as clinching evidence drove Kumble and Tendulkar to circle the wagons in Adelaide. And heres the thing: it worked. 
    
	Is this the end of the rule of law as we know it and the onset of anarchy? No. On the evidence of the third and fourth Tests, it feels more like the dawn of a new age of civility on the ground and a possible end to sledging. There was a time in Test cricket when Australia and England were more equal than the rest and the game survived that asymmetry. Itll survive this one.

	Why does it feel good to thrash a child? Why does it feel even better when the child is poor, his pants are taken off, he is tied to a pole and his thrashers greatly outnumber him? The nine-year-old to whom this treatment was meted out recently in Berhampore was allegedly trying to steal something from the toolbox of a motorcycle. On being searched, a bunch of keys was found on his person, which was taken to be enough proof of the boys career in thievery. So he was taken into an alley, stripped, tied up and soundly thrashed for a longish while. All this happened only a little way away from a police station. There is obviously something in excess of a passion for justice motivating this extraordinary expression of collective cruelty. What is even more striking is how frequently this sort of thing happens all over India  across the social spectrum, although the victims are usually poor.
    
	A great deal of Indian public behaviour, individual as well as collective, is driven by the deliciousness of being at the right end of absolute inequality. That heady feeling of power that comes when one is rich, or uniformed, has a red light flashing on ones car, or is part of a mob is very difficult to moderate. And what this form of empowerment revels in, then, is a public spectacle in which another human being is rapidly, ritually and brutally deprived of his or her very personhood through extreme pain and humiliation. This is why stripping becomes an essential part of the ritual, supplementing the beating. The boys silence was broken not by the beating, but only when his pants were taken off. That is when he started crying, although the confessions that followed made little sense, showing the extent of his pain and trauma. What sort of citizen would this child, and numberless others like him, become after they grow up? And what does it say about a society whose juvenile justice system allows such parallel forms of justice to flourish robustly?

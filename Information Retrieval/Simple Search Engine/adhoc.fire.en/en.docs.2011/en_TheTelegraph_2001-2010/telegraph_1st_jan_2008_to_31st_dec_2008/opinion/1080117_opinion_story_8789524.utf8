                 The media are expected not only to report what happens, but also to act as guarantors of truth, writes Aveek Sen
                      
	With just a couple of months between them, two recent incidents provide a way into the conflicting roles that the media have begun to play in the lives of ordinary people in extremis. 
    
	As the Burrabazar markets burnt, a group of devastated traders, apparently volunteering at the site, chose to direct their rage upon the reporters and photographers who had come to gather stories and images of the fire. Some of the volunteers beat up the journalists, snatching away their cameras and films, for reporting that the fire has been brought under control, when nothing of the sort had actually happened at the time. But that was the ostensible reason. It is also being alleged that the real reason for roughing up the journalists is that a whole web of illegal goings-on had been exposed by the media, as part of the circumstances of the fire. These revelations implicate all kinds of people, from businessmen and promoters to politicians, policemen and corporation bosses. The volunteers were also using their fire-fighting loudspeakers to drive out the journalists: Amra apnader chai na. Apnara mitthyabadi. [We dont want you. You are liars.]
    
	Yet, in the other incident in November last year, the situation was exactly the reverse. The presence of journalists was actively being sought  not primarily to report an event, but to stand as witnesses to it. Normally, the event they were being asked to participate in would have been an intensely private one, not requiring any such authentication. But, when Rizwanur Rahmans mother and brother wanted to return Priyanka Todis belongings to her, either at their Tiljala home or at the Todi residence, they insisted on the presence of journalists as one of the inflexible conditions for the handover. Just a couple of weeks before this was to happen, the chief minister had called off the judicial investigation into Rizwanurs death. So the onus of arriving at the truth behind the tragedy was the CBIs. But, if truth is what is at stake here, and the CBI had already been entrusted with the job of establishing it, then why the journalists? 
    
	The Burrabazar men did not want the journalists to be present, while the Rahmans did. In both cases, the media came to stand for a relationship with truth that is significantly in excess of their official role of objective reporting. So, what seems to be at stake in each scenario is not simply truth and nothing but the truth, but something else, too, that is a lot more complicated. The media are not only expected to report what happens, but also to act as guarantors of truth  that is, to end up doing, in civil society, what the justice system is normally supposed to do. We therefore have to start thinking about the representation of truth here  or perhaps, its re-presentation.
    
	What distinguishes these two incidents is the difference between public and private. On the one hand, we have a raging fire in the heart of the city. On the other, two homes, a marriage, and a mysterious death. The former is stridently on the streets, while most of the latter happens behind closed doors and barred gates. Immense, charred buildings stand as spectacular proof of public corruption and negligence. But a dead man, together with an invisible woman whose few public words are framed in fear, compels quite another kind of investigation. The former confronts us with the evident, the latter with the hidden and perhaps the unknowable. Hence the question of witnessing takes on another kind of edge with the Rahmans. 
    
	As breathless messengers in Sophocles and Shakespeare know only too well, to report is to create the illusion of graphic presence, through words or images, where there is essentially an absence. It is to have been where others have not been, to make the invisible visible. In many of the Rizwanur stories in the papers, there was an attempt to fill in the silence and absence that was, and is, Priyanka with tokens or imagined narratives of her presence  scripts that stand in for the voice, things that stand in for the person. Thus the much-publicized list of her belongings  left behind with, and then claimed back from, her in-laws  reads like an incomplete jigsaw-puzzle of a vanishing, barely-held-on-to personhood. Clothes, private and personal photographs of family and friends, greeting cards and letters, CDs, diaries, school and college certificates of age: each item privately stands for, and legally attests to, a different aspect of the self. And around these objects are words that suggest different ways in which things can be made to stand in relation to a person. They can belong, or be returned, to her; they could be used to identify her; and most important, they can be displayed to the public, by their custodians, through the media. 
       
	In her repeated pleas that the privacy of her belongings be respected, and in her in-laws parrying insistence that both the list and the handover be made public, what became clear is how Priyankas absent presence is made to move, from one moment to the next, between the private and the public, the individual and the familial, the protected and the displayed. And it is the media that are seen to be, and therefore actually become, the all-important manipulators of these identities, and of the various parties claims to them.
    
	Few would fail to have noticed, by now, that this emphasis on witnessing is taken over from the language of law. The courtroom has always been a kind of theatre, just as the theatre has always been a kind of courtroom. In both, the enactments of justice must devise verifiable means of making the invisible visible, especially when private acts are being tried in public spaces. Evidence  its Latin root means to see  is a matter of coming upon ocular proof, as Othello realizes, consumed by the desire to see and know another persons thoughts and deeds. 
    
	We must judge by what we see  or by what we are shown. But who does the showing? And believing what you see will have very different consequences in the bedroom, in a theatre, in a courtroom, and at breakfast, as you reach out for your coffee and the morning papers.

	I remember the festive season in England as a time of bleakness and vexation, when a nation naturally given to gloom wakes up to the hideous business of making merry. O the burden of good cheer! I would say to myself every year as a student. From the second week of December, all the undergraduates in Oxford would pack up and leave with their parents, who looked pale with apprehension at the thought of being pent up for weeks with their flown brood. Everything boiled down to the presents. I would go to the Covered Market with my friends to help them choose gifts for the family, and all the bitterness and resentment and repression would come out as we moved from perfume to tie to chocolates to computer game, each family member associated not only with a standard gift (repeated every year) but also with a specific history of nastiness and misery. Looking back, I realize that was when I picked up my vague fascination with dysfunctional English families. I would eagerly wait for my friends to come back after the holidays and tell me about the hysterical showdowns that marked the high point of their break.        
	These showdowns happened usually during meals and were usually about lovers leaving used condoms floating in the loo, lovers who were not approved of by the family but were taken along to meet the parents and stay, just to make a point. Usually of a different class or ethnicity, they were always given Chinese walkmans by their hosts (these were the early Nineties). A glut of fruitcake, brandy butter, left-over turkey, bad heating, incontinent granny and trash on TV can be a deadly cocktail. (Granny must watch the Queens speech after lunch, wearing her own paper crown askew. Diane Arbus would have loved to photograph her, my friend added.)        
	But the best part for me, after they all left, was an absolutely empty Oxford, like a ghost town, the doner kebab van the only sign of commerce after week-long orgies of shopping. It would be as grey and cold as hell. The meadows in North Oxford would be flooded at first, and then the water would freeze, the skaters would come out and be there until dark. Their voices would be high and bright as the evening fell. I loved the ruthless sound of metal skates on ice, as they cut across the reflex of a star  so the little Wordsworth did once, long ago among the Lakes.

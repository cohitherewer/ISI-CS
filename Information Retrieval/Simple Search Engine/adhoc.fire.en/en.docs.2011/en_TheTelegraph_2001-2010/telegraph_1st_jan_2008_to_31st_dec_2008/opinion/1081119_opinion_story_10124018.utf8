	Iconic presence                  
	Sir  While mentioning the fact that a portrait of Sarada Ma adorned the panoply of mascots on the Bengal trade fair stall in New Delhi, it was not necessary to cite the sour relationship between Belur Math and Alimuddin Street (Ma in temple to trade built by Marxists, Nov 16). The report criticizes the Communist Party of India (Marxist) for being pseudo-secular because it included the Holy Mothers image, as if she were only a religious icon. The truth is that Sarada Ma had been involved in, and inspired, the social reformation of Bengal. That is why the state government chose to represent her in its stall, in keeping with the theme of womens empowerment in this years trade fair. The other luminaries featured, such as Rani Rashmoni and Sister Nivedita, had also been directly or indirectly associated with Ramakrishna Paramhansas spiritual movement, as was Swami Vivekananda and his social revolution. In fact, the inclusion of the Holy Mother in the series of images of social reformers did justice to her reformist role, which has been camouflaged by her spiritual associations all this while.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Neha Kamani, New Delhi

                
	Sir  It was a pleasure to note that Sarada Ma now adorns Bengals stall at the New Delhi trade fair along with Annie Besant, Sarojini Naidu, Rani Rashmoni, Sucheta Kriplani and Sister Nivedita. The representative icons were chosen by stalwarts of the Left Front ministry  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Nirupam Sen. Thankfully, the ministers ideological prejudices and secular principles did not come in their way while selecting religious figures such as Rani Rashmoni and Sarada Ma.           
	It is evident from the photograph accompanying the report that the panoply had space enough to accommodate many other notable examples of womens empowerment from Bengal. Hence it was surprising to see that Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hussain (18801932), who had contributed immensely in the field of Muslim womens education and employment in undivided Bengal, had been excluded. Sadly, the report does not mention this gross omission. Instead, it provides a clichd analysis of how the Marxists have turned non-secular through the inclusion of the Holy Mother in the list of eminent women personalities.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

                
	Sir  It was amusing to see the CPI(M)s hypocrisy get exposed through the presence of Sarada Mas image in the Bengal stall in Pragati Maidan. No matter how bitter and unfriendly the party-leaders (barring a few such as Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee) had been towards the Ramakrishna Mission in the past, the Marxists are now exploiting the organizations goodwill among national and international visitors for their own interests. They no longer hold their political principles dear to their hearts. They are keen to follow capitalist policies, as seen in West Bengal. Hence, putting up the Holy Mothers portrait or endorsing Durga Puja and Kali Puja is now a common practice among the rank and file of the party. There have also been occasions where state ministers have participated in pujas and visited temples. With the exit of the Nano project and widespread disturbances in the state, the communist rulers perhaps are in dire need of divine blessings. But that will come only if they refrain from perpetrating atrocities on poor farmers and landless labourers.          
	Yours faithfully,      
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The report on the inclusion of Sarada Mas image in Bengals kiosk at the trade fair venue wrongly suggests that the CPI(M) and the Ramakrishna Mission are the two legs on which Bengal society rests. Such statements not only belittle Bengals glorious heritage, but also mislead readers from other states and countries. Bengals excellence in diverse fields  art, culture, economy and politics  has always been a matter of reverence. The personalities whose portraits are on display at the stall have been involved in social reform in various inimitable ways. In a bid to mock the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, the report has ridiculously trivialized Bengals prestige as something that depends on only two entities.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Bhimsen Joshi will apparently be honoured with the countrys highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, at long last. Bestowing this award on this aged maestro who has made the nation proud is perfectly justified. It has often been the case that on the insistence of our politicians, the honour has been conferred upon those who are less deserving.           
	The misuse of such awards can perhaps be prevented by selecting the awardees through a consensus between the prime minister and the leader of the Opposition to ensure optimum transparency and neutrality in the process of selection.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Having been away for a week to another Asian country  Hindu Bali in majority Muslim Indonesia  the sharp contrast of disorder, chaos, political and social criminality in our land, with the mature handling of a diversity of faiths and cultures, growth and development in other Asian countries, smacks one hard across the face. Clearly, south Asia is not taken seriously anywhere in the world because we do not have the intellectual skill and maturity to deliver basic dignities of life and living to our people and our leadership remains simplistic, motivated by personal agendas that have nothing to do with governance.        
	The endless chatter about growth and change falls apart when one arrives at Delhi airport. It remains a scandal, a despicable truth that makes one want to cringe in embarrassment. We land on what seems like a potholed dirt track, not a runway, and bounce about to a stop. An international airline has no parking bay and then, when the steps are brought to the aircraft, it takes ten minutes for them to fit the exit in a rather dangerous manner. You are then put into a bus that belongs to another age, spluttering and rattling, that just about manages to get you to the terminally ill building. The immigration officer is so sick that he cannot bring himself to smile and say Namaste. Incredible India, my left foot!                 
	Forgotten legacy        
	It is truly shameful that 61 years have rolled by and we have not got even the basics in order, oiled and functioning. Our leaders have anointed themselves as a reserved bunch of individuals blindly driven past the horrors of India: they get on their airplanes by jumping queues and on first-class railway compartments by bumping off legitimate passengers, using their special privilege. These policy-makers never confront the reality of this land and its people but choose to brutalize instead the civilization by their ineptitude. India is being severely punished.        
	Bali is intrinsically Hindu, people there live and breathe Hinduism. It is part of their being, it is the essence of their aesthetic sensibility. Its values permeate their everyday life and work, its ethos is alive in the shrines that are part of every homestead, where the many manifestations of gods and goddesses are revered and worshipped, where offerings made with love and care are a daily ritual.         
	The Balinese are content, hardworking, calm and happy. There is no tension in the air. There are no blaring horns, no uncouth male youth ogling women and making crude comments. Garbage is not littered on the roadsides. Filth does not prevail. Men are not peeing at every corner. Nobody begs. The temples are spotless. There is no caste or class discrimination. People greet you everywhere with a smile and a namaste.                 
	Beyond borders        
	This Hindu way of life went from our land across the seas and rests in Bali. Why have we, in the mother country, lost the plot? Why do we fervently dishonour the very root of our culture and age-old traditions, our faiths and strengths? Where has the pride gone? Why have we become so utterly shameless, so inappropriate?        
	Christians are being slaughtered in Orissa. Muslims are being attacked elsewhere. Dalits and tribal communities are being left out of the larger scheme. Peasants and the urban poor are being exploited and brutalized by both the Right and the Left.         
	Kashmir is burning. Naxalism is gaining strength in one third of the subcontinent. Criminality and corruption rule our lives. Governance is invisible. No failure is exposed and punished. Incompetence is rewarded with high office. We have nothing of quality to export to the world as we did once upon a time. What goes beyond our borders today is Bollywood. Balle Balle.

				       Though it promises to regulate the thriving industry in artificial reproduction and surrogacy, the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill does have some serious lapses, argues Manjula Sen                        Secure at last: The Japanese baby, Manji (left) , who was born of an Indian surrogate mother, was left in limbo after her parents divorced. Indian courts recently awarded custody of the child to her grandmother				                                 
	In his 1932 sci-fi novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presented the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, a factory for producing and conditioning babies. Forty-six years later, in 1978, Louise Brown, the worlds first test tube baby was born. Since then artificial reproductive technologies (ARTs) have gathered momentum the world over.        
	In India, we have had a thriving ARTs industry, which, in the absence of any serious regulations, has led to a host of dodgy practices such as unregulated surrogacy or the clandestine business of selling eggs and sperm to infertility clinics that are later passed off as the patients own.        
	Experts have been calling for suitable legislation to regulate the whole area of artificial reproductive technologies. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2008, formulated recently under the aegis of the Indian Council of Medical Research, addresses some of these issues and is to be presented in Parliament soon. However, some say it remains fuzzy in its wording and scope, leaving serious loopholes and raising questions about its efficacy.        
	The bill sets out the rules and procedures for the registration and administration of infertility and ART clinics. It calls for the establishment of a national advisory board to regulate ARTs and the setting up of independent semen banks which will collect, screen, store gametes (sperm and eggs) and will advertise for donors and surrogates. The sperm banks are to be an intermediary body that will take surrogates and donors to ART clinics. The bill also dwells at length on the issue of surrogacy and, among other things, makes commercial surrogacy (surrogacy in exchange for a fee) legal.        
	The bill is a good start. Someone needed to take care of the patients interests. They are currently at the mercy of the clinics, says Dr Jayant G. Mehta, an embryologist and a member of the committee that helped draft the bill.         
	But those who work in the area of ARTs are already crying foul over the draft bill. At a discussion hosted by the womens health group Sama in Delhi, Sandhya Srinivasan, a public health researcher, said, The draft committee was mainly made up of lawyers and medical professionals. Womens health and advocacy groups were hardly represented. Srinivasan points out that one of the main problems of the bill is that it positions surrogacy as the main issue in ART, leaving little room for finer details on matters such as medico-ethical concern.         
	Dr Gautam Allahabadia, a member of the draft committee, admits that surrogacy has been given a lot of importance in the bill. But it was the women NGOs themselves that raised the bogey of surrogates. Even the press only talked of surrogates, he points out.        
	However, even on the issue of surrogacy, there is concern that the bill contains serious lapses. For instance, critics feel that it was a mistake to make commercial surrogacy legal. Lawyers Collective, a Delhi-based legal advocacy outfit, has brought out a memorandum on the draft bill, contending that only non-commercial or voluntary surrogacy should be allowed to prevent the exploitation of poor women. Lakshmi Lingam, a professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, and one who has also been speaking out against the bills drawbacks, went a step further, saying that the bill would turn India into a hub for cheap surrogate tourism.        
	Another criticism is that the bill does not give surrogate mothers the option of deciding whether she wants to keep the baby. A surrogate mother should have at least six months to decide whether she wants to retain the child, says Lawyers Collective.        
	The bill has other contradictions as well. Chayanika, from the Forum Against Oppression of Women, who is a veteran campaigner on womens health issues, points out that though the bill makes it possible for same-sex couples from abroad to avail of surrogate services in India, Indian gays are denied the same right. The word couple is defined in the bill as two people having a sexual relationship that is legal in the country they live in. Since Article 377 continues to outlaw homosexuality in our country, that makes it impossible for same-sex Indian couples to avail of surrogacy services. Understandably, the gay rights lobby is up in arms over this.        
	Again, critics say that there are loopholes in the way the bill allows ART clinics and semen banks to donate reproductive material to research institutions. (Eggs can only be donated for research.) Activists like Srinivasan feel that the clause about the patients consent for donating leftover eggs to research institutions is too loosely worded. This, they fear, might lead to consent not being obtained legitimately. Also, the bill does not provide a comprehensive tracking mechanism for retrieved reproductive material, raising the spectre that patient As leftover eggs may be passed off as patient Bs to facilitate the latters artificial reproductive treatment.        
	This is one reason  the other is obviously the stamp of approval on commercial surrogacy  Srinivasan and others have put out a memorandum expressing concern that the bill seems to serve the interests of the private sector providers of ART.        
	Ownership of eggs and sperms should be clearly defined, says Chayanika. As of now, the semen banks seem to own the eggs. We feel that the eggs should be destroyed if the donor is not around.        
	Dr Mehta, though, is satisfied that there are enough safeguards in the bill. But he stresses that the patients informed consent must be taken. There should be an inspector who visits the clinics to ensure that donors eggs are not being inappropriately used. Also, ART clinics should have a licence for designated procedures like it happens in the UK. So there is a scope for improvement, he says, but that will follow only after the bill is implemented.        
	Some are actually saying that the bill errs in clubbing three things under one law ARTs like artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilisation, the storage and management of eggs and sperm, and surrogacy. But Dr Allahabadia counters, You cannot have separate laws for the same technology. However, it is an open-ended law and additional provisions can be added by the states.        
	Clearly, though the draft bill on ART is a welcome development, the debate over it is far from over.              
	Highlights        
	 Regulation and registration of ART treatment clinics        
	 Sets up semen banks that will store eggs and sperm from donors after medically certifying them. Will advertise for donors and surrogates        
	 ART clinics will not be allowed to advertise

	 Surrogates and donors shall have no parental rights over the child

	 Donors and surrogates will remain anonymous        
	 Gametes can be stored for up to 10 years. An embryo, for a prescribed fee, can be stored for up to five years

	The power of a workforce does not lie in numbers alone. India will have one of the largest young populations in the world around 2025, and optimistic predictions would project this as enviable. It could be so, if there were a way to ensure that the huge workforce of 15-59-year-olds, who are expected in 2025 to make up around 65 per cent of the countrys population now over a billion, would be healthy and capable. The third National Family Health Survey has raised doubts precisely on this score. Apart from better fertility indicators and falling infant mortality rates, it brings little good news. Instead, it shows some ominous declines. There are far more women and children with anaemia than shown in the earlier surveys, just as there are more children with stunted growth and wasted bodies. It is not just that government programmes for nutrition in the last few years have not worked. While nutrition is the key to health and mental capability, the issues of growth and health are situated within larger socio-economic trends and cultural practices, many of which seem to have remained unchanged.        
	Five million babies in India today have teenage mothers, of whom 32 per cent are uneducated. This group also records the highest maternal mortality rate. The falling rate of infant mortality is cruelly undercut by the fact that the children of uneducated, immature mothers neither eat nor learn as required  46 per cent of the children under three are underweight. The mothers themselves are poorly nourished, often unable to nurse the baby. The neglect of the woman  indicated by the lack of education, inadequate food, early marriage, early pregnancy, and mortality rate  weakens the child: its cognitive abilities, eyesight, height and strength are all affected by what it gets to eat. It is even more alarming that some regions are producing too many thin or short children  in Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar more than 58 per cent children are underweight. But the southern states, which are sending out skilled and highly skilled professionals, are producing fewer but healthier children. This augurs a volatile situation of internal migration and resentment. If India is to fulfil its promise of development and economic prosperity, it has to look after its babies and their mothers now.

	This years Union budget has been both hailed and criticized for being populist. The last epithet is used to mark a tendency to win popular support by providing largesse to sections of the population. The term is a euphemism for financial profligacy. The issue needs to be looked at from a different angle. Proposals aimed at winning votes have often been included in budgets. The finance minister, P. Chidambaram, is following a well-trodden path in Indian politics and fiscal policy-making. It has become a part of conventional wisdom that votes and popular support can indeed be won (read bought) by allocating massive direct or indirect subsidies to sections of voters. Among this years beneficiaries are farmers with debts to banks. This conventional wisdom is seldom, if ever, questioned, even though a rather crass assumption underlies it. The assumption is that if one offers people lollipops, they will automatically become ones supporters. In other words, Indian voters, especially the rural ones, have no consciousness, they only respond to sops that are offered them. This makes a complete mockery of the notion of democracy in India since people are seen not to be making deliberate political choices, but reacting like robots to the pressing of a particular button.
    
	The reality is not that simple. There is enough evidence to show that the Indian voter, even in the villages, does make political choices. Witness the post-Emergency upheaval. What is more important in the present context is that there are no data to suggest a direct correlation between the providing of sops and the winning of votes. If anything, the available data indicate that sops may help electoral triumphs, but can in no way guarantee them. There are other complex factors that determine the way people vote. It is difficult to imagine, for example, that the offer of financial benefits will override caste considerations in certain pockets of Uttar Pradesh where Mayavati holds sway. Or that the Congress will reap the benefits of populism in a state like West Bengal. The ambiguity of the evidence should make a finance minister do what he thinks is best for the countrys economy. Ideally, economic policy should not be dictated by electoral considerations. But in India it often does or is perceived as such. This should only strengthen the position that says that the realm of economic decision-making should be distinct from the political sphere.

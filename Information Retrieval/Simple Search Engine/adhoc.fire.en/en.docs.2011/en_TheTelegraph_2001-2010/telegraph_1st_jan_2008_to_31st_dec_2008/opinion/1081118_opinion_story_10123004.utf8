	Excellence, especially academic excellence, can never be a conferred status. At the institutional level, it can only be achieved and sustained organically from within a self-renewing system that must constantly guard against becoming too much of a rigid system. A university becomes an excellent university first, and only then can it be deemed one by a Central ministry  not the other way round. So, the latest game of bureaucratic name-giving that the human resource development ministry seems to be indulging in can only lead to confusion, discrimination and general waste of time and resources for institutions of higher education. It would enhance nothing but the ministrys self-importance. Creating another category of universities and exalting it to Navratna status is now to ensure world class quality of higher education in them. The whole scheme is patently a product of the mix of muddled thinking and officiousness that usually characterizes this ministrys deliberations and policies on higher education.         
	It was a doomed venture right from its inception. The prime minister wanted to create a few new universities and classify some existing ones and make both sets of institutions part of this world-class club. Such a top-down system of creating excellence, as if it were a matter of how the State wishes to classify universities that makes them good, would only hinder the autonomous maintenance of academic standards. Also, by imposing such hierarchies from outside and above, the State creates a graded and rather vilely politicized battle over resources and recognition that can also distract the pursuit of academic excellence. From the point of view of the ministry, all this amounts to one thing  greater control over institutions, and the perpetuation of a patronage system that keeps in place the paternalism of an interventionist State. The prime minister should break free from this history and encourage existing institutions to develop and strengthen their habits of autonomy. An institutions relationship with its peers, within the country and in the world, must not be mediated by the government. Learning constitutes its own republic, and it is the duty of the State to facilitate the universities access to this republic, and keep out of their way once that access has been secured.

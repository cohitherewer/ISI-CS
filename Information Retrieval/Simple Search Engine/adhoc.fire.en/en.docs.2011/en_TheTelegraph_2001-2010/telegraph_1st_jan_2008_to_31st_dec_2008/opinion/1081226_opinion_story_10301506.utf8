	A Mercy By Toni Morrison, 
  Chatto amp; Windus, 5.99        
	It could be a confession that Florens begins to make in the first unmarked chapter of Toni Morrisons A Mercy. But she cannot be sure. Her tale is too full of curiosities familiar only in dreams, as is much else in the world she inhabits. In that world, the glittering eyes of an elk could easily be a demon, just as the howls of tortured souls at night might be the call of happy wolves. Florens was a little girl when she was almost forced upon the Anglo-Dutch trader from the wild American North, Jacob Vaark, as part-payment for a failed debt from a Maryland planter. Exhilarated by the adventure of making a place out of no place, Vaark has a soft spot for the abandoned and the lost, for he is a ratty orphan become a landowner. Set in the late 17th century, before the slave trade was full-blown, A Mercy is as much the story of Vaarks growth from hard-working trader with a dislike for slavery to the owner of an ornate mansion built on slave labour in distant sugarcane fields as it is the story of each rootless individual he collects around him.        
	Like the rough, dangerous, often swampy, terrain that Vaark traverses when still a full-time trader, the chapters in the novel are unmarked. The reader is plunged without warning into the unpredictably broken flows of memory springing unheralded in apparently dispersed fragments of time from the minds of the individuals who make up, for a while, a family-like unit on Vaarks estate. There is Lina, the native American whose tribe has been destroyed by plague, there is the strange waif called Sorrow, disoriented and promiscuous, rescued from a shipwreck, whom Lina suspects to be the source of all ill in the family including the serial deaths of Vaarks children, and Rebekka, the Mistress, Vaarks bride from over the sea, sent away by an uncaring family at 16 to marry a man she has never seen. Every character has a say in some part of the narrative, not just Florens but Lina and Sorrow as well, and Rebekka, as she hallucinates in fever, and even, briefly, Scully and Willard, given as bondsmen to a neighbour and forever expecting to be freed. Morrisons sinewy yet uniquely cadenced prose creates for each individual a characteristic atmosphere of the mind, distinct and self-enclosed even when in warmest affinity with the others. Breathing the air of a world so new, almost alarming in its rawness and temptation, always invigorated Vaark, but that enigmatic world also demanded to be tamed and ordered, just as the men and women converging upon it searched ceaselessly for an anchor for their disparate memories and passions, grasping at words and work in the midst of unknown evils in an effort to hold together a humanness threatening to fall apart. Their different journeys and their common destination suggest the stirrings of a country beginning to take shape. Yet the hope of shelter, relief and enduring kinship is illusory, tenuously cohering like a promise before being defeated by the obduracy of death and the fierce contrariness of human change.        
	In this tale full of journeys, Florenss solitary trip through unimagined dangers to bring back the beautiful blacksmith, who had never been a slave, to cure the Mistress is the thread that binds the story together. She is also the core, the dark heart, of the restless tale, for its beginning lies in Vaarks visit to the estate of her mothers master. There Vaark sees a house where a court can be held, and begins to dream of building a similar one. And there Florenss mother chooses to give her away rather than her brother. It is a choice that haunts Florens, making her hungry for love and eager to please, searching for a sense of total belonging till the blacksmith comes to build Vaarks magnificent new gate. But it also gives birth to a feathery, sharp-toothed thing within, one that grows bigger when a little girl bursts out crying and hides behind her mothers skirts because she has never seen anything so black as Florens. The thing finally bursts forth when she is faced with the blacksmiths rejection of her slavelike devotion.         
	Florens arrives from the pre-history of slavery, as though Morrison wishes to uncover what lies beneath it. In a way, it is a late prelude to the Beloved, which is the story of the devastation wrought by slavery and subsequent freedom on men and women who have forgotten how to forge relationships and communities, or even how to recognize the self within. Sethe in Beloved kills her daughter so that she will never be a slave; Florenss mother gives her away to a kind-looking visitor for she herself was once a slave in chains. In Morrisons world, men are vulnerable too, but it is the slavery of women that is most destructive of mind and soul. The cruellest act seems to be a mercy, although its outcome is both unexpected and devastating. Florenss mother, speaking at last, wants to tell her absent daughter, in words different from those of the blacksmith, that to give dominion of yourself to another is a wicked thing. But it is already too late.        
	Own yourself, woman, says the blacksmith to Florens, who has no mind. But she has the last say, for she can read and write. So she writes her confession all over the walls and floor of a room in Vaarks locked-up mansion. She puts her story together, half-knowing it will be burnt down or just remain unread. The mythic force of this image captures the speaking silence of the enslaved black woman. In its incisive brevity and fragmented structure, A Mercy is a new and starling entry into that untold history.

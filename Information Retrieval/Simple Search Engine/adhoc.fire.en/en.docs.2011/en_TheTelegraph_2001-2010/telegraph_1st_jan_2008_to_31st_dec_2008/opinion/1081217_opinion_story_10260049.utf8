	There must be a headiness in being able to bring all human relationships under ever-new laws. If there are laws in and around marriage, why should unmarried relationships not be riddled with laws too? The tremulous excitement in the Rajya Sabha upon hearing that some state governments could be making live-in relationships legal stemmed from the absurd position that when two people live with each other without being married, that relationship too needs to be either legalized or else made illegal. Legalization, it is further assumed, would be a mark of approval from the State. So the legislators nervousness sprang from a completely extra-legal concern  a mythical culture uncovered from an even more mythical history was supposed to be against live-in relationships. Not then, not now. The people of the country did not accept such pairings even today and they were not prevalent. Although Bharatiya Janata Party legislators were most insistent in their questions and disapproval  no doubt live-in relationships cut them to the heart  the other elders did not show much enthusiasm for the concept either.        
	The niceties of such devoutly legislative reasoning lead to the conclusion that the moment a relationship has a law touching it, the relationship is legalized, whether the State wishes it or not. The domestic violence act had shown great percipience in being applicable to women in live-in relationships. Hence, worried the trembling legislators, live-in relationships were being legalized through the backdoor. The Union law ministers assurances may have quietened them, but a tax-payer might ask if the cost of the time wasted on precisely nothing should not be drawn from the pay of the legislators. What business does the State have to approve or disapprove, legalize or outlaw, two adults who wish to live together in a relationship with no name? Especially in a country where hundreds of laws can do nothing to check abuse in marriage, its daily violence and exploitation, or stop torture and death for dowry.

	In a list of Indian states ranked according to the number of children trafficked into, out of or through it, West Bengal is somewhere at the top with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. About six months ago, Save the Children released a report titled Missing Children in West Bengal, based on data received from police stations in two districts, which endorsed this claim through a more focused analysis. But reports to this effect, prepared mostly by NGOs, have made little difference to the way the government, courts, police and ordinary citizens perceive and act on the reality of trafficked children in the state. Why is this so? To the bulk of the people making up these institutions, and to the citizens whose voices matter to them, trafficking affects children from a section of society that remains largely invisible. The children of the desperately poor do not actually have to go missing in order not to be seen by those who constitute civil society. Poor children are generally not noticed. In a city like Calcutta, for instance, there are too many of them all over the place for anybody to take heed of the fact that they are there or, equally, that they are disappearing. Most people do not wonder where these children might have come from, why they beg, and what happens to the money they get from begging. And children who beg are only one example. This invisibility pertains not only to streetchildren, but also to children living in poor families or working as domestic helps or in other kinds of illegal labour.        
	The relationship between extreme poverty and the trafficking of children works at two levels. First, people sell children because they are poor and badly need the money. Second, very poor parents whose children have been kidnapped for trafficking and who want them back are too helplessly disempowered to be able to get their dues from the police. Nithari proved this only too well. Whether or not you can manage to get an FIR filed depends on your status as a citizen as perceived by the police station you have gone to for help. Being poor as well as illiterate, therefore utterly unaware of your entitlements from the justice system, is the surest way of getting ignored. Some crimes are ubiquitous, yet invisible, because their victims simply do not matter to those who think, plan and act to prevent crime. Some children go missing because they are not missed.

                                                                                                                                   Letters to Editor

        
	Wrong one
         
	Sir  The Indian cricket team has come under fire over its miserable performance in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, when it could not cross even the 200-run mark in either innings. The skipper, Anil Kumble has put the blame squarely on the batsmen. Of course, the Indian batsmen did nothing worth writing home about. But what about the team selection?
     
	The selectors got a little too carried away with Yuvraj Singhs performance at Bangalore against Pakistan. Statistics suggest that he has not scored above fifty in any of his last six innings abroad. No one disputes his batting prowess in one-day internationals, but he cannot be so indispensable in Tests that the settled opening pair of Wasim Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik need to be disturbed (that too against an opponent like Australia) and Rahul Dravid forced to open against his wishes. It is not surprising, under the circumstances, that Dravid scored only 21 runs in two innings after facing 160 balls. It was probably his way of registering his protest. 
     
	Think of the Aussie selectors when they were finding it difficult to include Andrew Symonds in the Test eleven. Neither Damien Martin nor Darren Lehman (or even Simon Katich at times) deserved to be dropped during the last couple of seasons. Symonds has finally made it to the squad only after Martins retirement. In the same way, Yuvraj should have been made to wait till one of the seniors retired.
     
	Yuvrajs inclusion has upset the entire batting line-up and affected the teams performance. It would be prudent to re-draft Karthik in the Sydney Test, even if it is at the expense of Yuvraj. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Australian bowling sure choked the Indian batsmen, but more suffocating was The Telegraphs analysis of the ups and downs in the cricketing world. First, while having the utmost regard for Sourav Ganguly and his batting and leadership qualities, one still feels miserable to wake up to articles and pictures thrusting greatness on Dada, and Dadas greatness on the readers. At every small pretext, one finds Dravid being blamed for one thing or another, and Sourav being glorified, as if the two play for rival sides. Second, it would appear from The Telegraphs coverage that Ganguly is first player to play 100 Tests. Surely Gangulys greatness is not so fragile that it will crumble if the slightest praise is showered on others. Sourav remains a great player, but he is one among quite a few.
          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  After the dismal performance by the Indians in Melbourne, Indian cricket fans cannot be blamed for feeling more than just a bit let down (An abrupt end to captain Kumbles honeymoon, Dec 30). In my opinion, the lack of match practice was perhaps the reason behind the poor show. We must not forget that Kumbles boys went to Australia after having played against a substandard Test side on placid home turfs, which have nothing in common with the fast and bouncy pitches in Australia. The rain-interrupted solitary warm-up match was not enough for the visitors to acclimatize themselves with the conditions Down Under. Kumble got very little chance of testing his young pace battery on the lively pitches so as to be able to judiciously select the final eleven. The decision to use Rahul Dravid as a makeshift opener, especially against the Aussies, is far worse than a bad idea. Team India must look for a fightback in the coming matches to live up to some of the adjectives that are used against their names.
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Hope floats
     
	Sir  West Bengal joins The Telegraph in its wishes to see Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee carry forward in the new year the glimmer of hope he has given the state by admitting his mistakes in trying to implement his grand plans for industrialization (Here endeth the year, Dec 30). Bhattacharjee has been lucky to have had the support of the Centre and the media from the time he took office as chief minister in 2000. But his achievements in office have been quite uninspiring in the last seven years. Leaving aside the poor levels of improvement in important areas such as education and health, his ambitious plans for industrialization too have only thrown the state in utter chaos. The chief ministers unwarranted partisan attitude over the past several months has shown him up as bearing greater allegiance to his party than to the state. His comrades, especially Biman Bose, Benoy Konar and Shyamal Chakraborty, have incurred the wrath of the people for their insensitive responses to the issue of Nandigram. It will be a tough challenge for Bhattacharjee to rise above his party and take charge of the democratic process. Will he be able to keep his promise of industrialization without tearing the state asunder? 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The editorial, Here endeth the year, makes some crucial observations about West Bengal and what lies ahead for it. However, it deviates from the truth in claiming that the silent protest on November 14, led by some of the citys prominent intellectuals, was bereft of all political slogans and banners. I had the opportunity to attend the rally and was dismayed to find that it bore a very clear anti-government agenda under the guise of apolitical protest. There were cries to convert the numbers present into votes and derogatory statements were made against the chief minister by some. If this is what the emergence of a civil society connotes, then we can surely do without one. The need of the hour is a cautious government interested in the well-being of the state, and a responsible Opposition. While signs of the former are emerging, the latter, sadly, remains a distant dream.
          
	Yours faithfully,

	The deportation of the Pakistani human rights activist, Ansar Burney, is by no means a simple gaffe. In fact, that would be too charitable a description for an event shrouded in unexplained lapses, flawed reasoning and official secrecy. Mr Burney, a former minister in the caretaker government of Pakistan, was denied entry after he flew into Delhi from Dubai on May 30. Apparently, his travel papers were not in order. Mr Burney has a Saarc visa  a privilege given only to ministers from nations belonging to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Since he has demitted office following the formation of the new government in Pakistan, the Indian officials were unsure about the validity of this document. Instead of referring this discrepancy to senior authorities, they decided to act on their own and packed Mr Burney off unceremoniously. There was also an obscure lookout notice, issued way back in 1992, which had labelled Mr Burney as a threat to security. Many such notices were slapped on Pakistani nationals by India when bilateral ties between the countries were strained. At present, most of these notices have been either revised or revoked, a procedure that was clearly not followed in Mr Burneys case.         
	It is this oversight that makes the situation acutely embarrassing for India, even worse than the slipshod way in which it deported Mr Burney. Ironically, in the 16 years that have elapsed since this notice, Mr Burney has made several high profile visits to India. He has fought for the humane treatment of Indian and Pakistani citizens held in each others prisons. Only a month ago, he had crossed border at Wagah without any breach of immigration protocol. That time, he had been invited by the chief minister of Punjab for his proactive role in freeing Kashmir Singh, an Indian citizen who was held in a Pakistani prison for 35 years. During that visit, Mr Burney also met the home minister, the foreign secretary, and the family of Sarabjit Singh, whose clemency he is fighting for now. This time, however, he had come on a personal visit. Immigration was no longer just a formality, not a routine affair summarily arranged by the State for its invited dignitaries. Mr Burney has refused, with good reason, the apology that the government has offered him. (He plans to seek compensation for harassment.) How is it that after so many visits to the country on the same visa, he was picked up this time? And if his papers were truly not in order, why bother to apologize?

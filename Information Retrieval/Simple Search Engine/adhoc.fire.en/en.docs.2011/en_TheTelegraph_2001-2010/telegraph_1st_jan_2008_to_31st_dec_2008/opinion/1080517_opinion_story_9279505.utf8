The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Ripples that create a vast turbulence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       RIPPLES THAT CREATE A VAST TURBULENCE                              Somak Ghoshal      VISUAL ARTS                                              
	In 1890, a French mathematician, Jacques Hadamard, coined the phrase, butterfly effect, to describe a phenomenon associated with chaos theory. A small change in the initial condition of certain dynamic systems sometimes has widespread repercussions in the same way as the beating of a butterflys wings is capable of setting off a storm. The recently concluded exhibition of works by nine artists at the Ganges Art Gallery (March 29-April 22), premised on this analogy of tiny ripples turning into tectonic shifts, shows how distinctly local ideas often give rise to global idioms.        
	How do traditions of representation in the visual arts travel? Why does one artists vision of things provide a template for other eyes looking at other realities? It is the coexistence of the personal and the universal that gives legitimacy to artistic styles. Picassos fractured, Cubist view of the world became a point of reference for other creative eyes  and thus, newer modes of looking and representation evolved subsequently.         
	In the same way, the dissonant clutter of Kandinsky lurks behind the dazzling images by Kishore Shinde, although Shinde does not stop at this allusion. He lends his own touch to this jumble by the deliberate piling up of colours. The impasto technique is deployed to open out depths and vistas within the luminous grids of yellow, orange, blue and pink. Shapeless contours blur and come into focus. An arrangement of furniture, flowing curtains and diffuse everyday objects come together. There is an unmistakable echo here of van Goghs painting of his own bedroom, but existing, as it were, in a heightened reality.                  
	Kalicharan Gupta, Pradip Rakshit and Sheetal Gattani are striking in their determined move away from the material into pure abstraction. Gupta uses crosshatching with a frenzy to create an inconsistent pattern of lines and textures. Bright colours are engaged in a dialogue with the blank spaces. Rakshits meditations in green, although modest in size, bring to mind the sublime panels of Rothko and Gaitonde. Faint traces of olive and ochre occur on a grey expanse in Ghattanis acrylic. She captures an immaculate moment, emptied of all significance, ready to shape itself into any of the infinite number of meanings that the viewers eye can conjure.         
	Sunil Das, Kazi Ghiyasuddin, Shambhavi Singh, Partha Shaw and Yusuf gesture towards figurative art. The series, Each drop of water is like an ocean, by Singh shows an urn with a watery centre gleaming like a pearl (bottom). The relationship between parts and whole  a single drop and a vast ocean, the container and the contained  is teased out through a delicate variation of the base colours. Broken planks, spectral creatures and an eerie sense of vertigo pervade Yusufs dream-like canvases (left). The use of gesso adds a third dimension to the labyrinths that Shaw depicts. A trellis is torn off to reveal an area of icy blueness, but these complex, interwined forms soon start looking like too much clutter. Dass mixed media works with their scarred edges and burnt surfaces are deceptively benign. The angry horses, for which Das is so well-known, though precisely executed, appear somewhat out of synch in this assembly.        
	The butterfly effect brings in its wake the possibility of an overtly derivative art, cloyed by the anxiety of influence. All the artists included in this exhibition must be given credit for keeping clear of that danger.

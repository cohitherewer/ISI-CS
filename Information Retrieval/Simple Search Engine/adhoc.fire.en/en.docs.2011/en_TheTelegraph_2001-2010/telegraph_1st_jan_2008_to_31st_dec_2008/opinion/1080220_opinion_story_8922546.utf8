	Identity politics can be risky business for both governments and politicians. Subash Ghisingh should know this only too well. Twenty years ago, he used violence and this brand of politics to claim the leadership of the people of Darjeeling. A new political formation in the hills has now used the same methods with the aim of opposing him. There should be no doubt whatsoever about what is really behind the latest unrest there. The controversy over the proposal to include Darjeeling in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution may have triggered the current movement. But the stage for it has been set by Mr Ghisinghs long and inept rule. The Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, of which he has remained the supreme leader since its formation in 1988, has done practically nothing to improve the condition of life in the hills. The Sixth Schedule will give the council much greater powers than it has now. It can also better fulfil the peoples aspirations for self-rule and free the council from interference by the state government. But the people of Darjeeling clearly have no hopes from more powers for Mr Ghisingh. His record as an administrator has been dismal and his popularity as a political leader the lowest since his rise through the Gorkhaland agitation of the mid-Eighties.         
	If Mr Ghisingh has failed his people, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee too erred in continuing to support the former. It is understandable why the chief minister did so. For him, peace and stability in the hills are of prior concern. But Mr Bhattacharjees anxiety to maintain peace in Darjeeling led him to turn a blind eye to Mr Ghisinghs administrative failures and to the mounting public frustration with him. This policy of appeasement of local politicians has been the bane even of New Delhis strategies about the politics of Darjeeling. For decades, the politics of the hills have revolved round the demand for a separate state in the area. But the Centres responses have mostly been ill-advised. The controversy over the recognition of the Nepali language under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution is a case in point. The Centres steps have often sent out wrong signals not only to the local politicians but also to other Nepali-speaking areas in the neighbourhood. Ill-defined government strategies can complicate matters in a politically sensitive area on an international border.

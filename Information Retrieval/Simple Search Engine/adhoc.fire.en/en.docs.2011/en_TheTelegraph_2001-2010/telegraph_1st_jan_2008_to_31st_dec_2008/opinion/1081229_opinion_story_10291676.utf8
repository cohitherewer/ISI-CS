	The other little master                  
	Sir  Mukul Kesavans Two little masters (Dec 18) was lucidly written and well-argued. But for Virender Sehwags blistering 83 of 68 balls, India wouldnt have been able to wrest the initiative from England and script a spectacular win in Chennai. The hard-hitting Sehwag made his detractors  who often allege that he has lost his lightening reflexes because of age  eat their own words after Chennai. Sehwag reminds many of us of the aggressive Sachin Tendulkar in his younger days. Sehwags performance, since his debut on the international stage, has been phenomenal. Unfortunately, he found himself out of the Test team for a while, thanks to the ineptitude of our selectors. It is pertinent here to point out that other talented cricketers in India have also fallen prey to the whims and fancies of selectors. Sehwag was once said to have been uncomfortable against short-pitched bowling, much like Sourav Ganguly who was vilified for his weak onside play. However, both players proved their critics wrong and have gone on to post huge scores. Ganguly may have retired, but Sehwag still has miles to go.           
	But Sehwags heroics shouldnt make us forget Sachin Tendulkars contribution during the game. It was uplifting to listen to Tendulkar speak during the post-match interview, in which he dedicated his magnificent hundred to the victims of the recent Mumbai attack.           
	Kesavan didnt miss out on reminding The Telegraphs readers that India have emerged winners against better teams in tighter contests on earlier occasions. But the victory in Chennai is special because it has shown that the Indian team under Mahendra Singh Dhoni is turning out to be a real contender for the top slot in Test cricket. Winning three Tests in a row, that too against two formidable teams, Australia and England, is no mean achievement.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Mukul Kesavan has waxed eloquent about Indias victory in Chennai where Virender Sehwag put up a scintillating show. But I would like to point out that the number of Test-playing nations is only 10. Out of them, the West Indies, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh cannot be considered quality opposition. So the Sehwags and Tendulkars actually compete against the players of only five other countries. Yet, the entire nation seems to bask in the glory of these cricketers. Not just cricket but other sporting activities must also be encouraged for the good of the nation. The media have a role to play in this: they must highlight key sporting achievements, other than those achieved by our cricketers. Otherwise, successes such as the bronze win in world boxing, will soon be forgotten.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Indias stupendous victory against England in Chepauk is a significant milestone in the countrys cricket history. The craftsmen of this triumph were none other than Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar. Sehwag, who deservingly won the MoM award, laid down the platform for victory, and Tendulkar completed the good work begun by the Delhi opener. Tendulkar, who scored his 41st Test century, was helped by Yuvraj Singh who batted brilliantly. The fantastic win helped lift the nations morale that had been sagging since the mayhem in Mumbai.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The report, Patient safety onus on hospital (Dec 27), piques our interests for many reasons. The Delhi High Court has held Batra Hospital responsible for its failure to provide a safe environment to a patient who jumped from the third floor. It also granted a Rs 7-lakh compensation to the man who was suffering from depression and had allegedly turned paraplegic due to the hospitals negligence.           
	A hospital is expected to keep an eye on its patients, especially on those suffering from mental illnesses. But the reality is very different, especially in Bengals health centres where dogs and cats are often seen roaming freely. There have also been reports of newborn babies being stolen from maternity wards. Hospitals, apart from providing a secured ward for patients, should also be vigilant to ensure that the mentally ill do not cause self-inflicted injuries. Patients in Bengal would hope that the judgment against Batra Hospital would open the eyes of hospital administrations across the state.           
	The other startling aspect about the incident is that it took the unfortunate patients family two decades to get justice. Of course, the hospital may appeal against the decision in the Supreme Court, and, in that case, the case is likely to drag on for several more years. Justice delayed is justice denied. The Indian judiciary must prioritize cases related to medical negligence and expedite the judicial process. Delays in prosecution of negligent hospitals can act as a catalyst for increased incidents of medical negligence in India.          
	Yours faithfully,

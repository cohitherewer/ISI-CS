	Disgruntled ministers and legislators taking up arms against the chief minister was part of life during the Congress regime in Bihar in the Eighties. Jagannath Mishra, Satyendra Narayan Sinha, Bhagwat Jha Azad  all had to face such revolt and leave. Now the disease has spread and the deputy chief minister, Sushil Modi, had to face similar ire from his colleagues in the Bharatiya Janata Party. For the time being, Modi has survived but things are far from being normal. Those angry with him include ministers whose ouster by Nitish Kumar he could not stop, or perhaps did not want to stop, and legislators who have not been made ministers, again because of Modis perceived inaction. They will continue to seethe in anger.        
	There is little point in wondering how BJP men can behave like those in the Congress. Over the last few years, it has been seen that when different parties in a coalition start bickering over their share in office, ideology takes a back seat. The Bihar dissidents, of course, are saying that their anger stems from Modis inability to project the BJP as a co-sharer in the good work that the coalition ministry is doing and that it is the chief minister, Nitish Kumar, who is running away with all the credit. Only they can say what good work they are referring to. Even if the performance of the government in the last two and a half years has been creditable, they should have known that in a coalition it is the senior partner who takes the cake, as also the curses. So Modi cannot really be blamed on this count.        
	Perhaps Modi could have been more assertive but then, he has always been a quiet man  committed, sincere but not aggressive. Also, he must have seen merit in the way the chief minister shuffled his cabinet. If he did not put saffron over everything else it was clearly because, in the ultimate analysis, it is performance that should count, particularly in a state such as Bihar where people are crying out for even a small drop of performance from those in power.                 
	Lick the wounds        
	While dealing with Bihar, the BJP top brass must also have kept Gujarat in mind. The revolt led by Keshubhai Patel and others against Narendra Modi was much larger in dimension than the one in Patna. Yet the central leaders had kept their faith in Modi and he delivered in a big way. This is where the BJP is still different from the Congress, which has always suffered from knee-jerk reactions whenever contrary noises are made in one state or the other. The latest instance is Karnataka, where after flowing in S.M. Krishna to be projected as the next chief minister, tha party did not give him a ticket because of opposition from within. The voters decided that there was no point in going with a weak and vacillating party.        
	Another state where the BJP has been in the grip of dissidence for some time is Rajasthan. Chief minister Vasundhara Raje has certainly not done justice to the faith that had been placed on her five years ago. Yet the party has kept her in office. The central leadership rightly decided that removing her might open up a Pandoras box. The scourge of dissidence has entered the party, but at the same time, there is determination at the top not to give the virus a free run.         
	So what will the rebels in Bihar do now? Break away and take on the party? Uma Bhartis experience should make them think twice. Seek to fight Modi from inside? They have been seen as power-brokers and Bihar has had enough of such politicians. So attacks against Modi may boomerang back on themselves. Also, the BJP bosses cannot be expected to take any decision that may antagonize Nitish Kumar. The Bihar dissidents may have mentors in New Delhi but the latter have also seen the folly of the dissenters. The Chandra Mohan Rais and Ashwini Choubeys perhaps have little option but to lick their wounds.

	Past imperfect                  
	Sir  The by-elections in Andhra Pradesh have shown quite clearly that the Telangana sentiment does not stir very many people in the state except some selfish politicians (Bypoll blow to TRS, June 2). Politicians like the Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, seek to remain in power by whipping up passions among gullible voters with their devious agenda and manipulated statistics. The Telengana movement had started with the slogan of development. But soon, its leaders realized that the region was as developed, or underdeveloped, as any other region of the state. So they quickly switched over to sentiment. But this too failed, as is evident in Raos slim margin of victory in the election to the Karimnagar parliamentary seat.           
	After his party managed to win only two of the four Lok Sabha seats and seven of the 18 assembly seats in the bypolls, KCR launched this great drama of resignation. But this was only another attempt at sentimentalizing the issue. In fact, this was his second resignation drama. The Election Commission should ensure that such farces are not enacted over election results. The Congress too should not have given in to the TRSs blackmailing ways. The expenditure incurred in holding bypolls on account of resignations  not to mention the freebies handed out to the voters by the parties each time there is an election  contribute in a big way to the rising inflation curve. All parties should be made aware of this.          
	Yours faithfully,       
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh 

                
	Sir  Whether the results of the assembly and Lok Sabha bye-elections in Andhra Pradesh and the shaky victory of the TRS chief, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, are a referendum on the Telangana issue or not, these have indeed questioned the verity of the much-trumpeted passion over Telangana. It is true that a bypoll verdict is often not the correct index of the peoples grievances over an issue, but would it be too far off the mark to say that the people of Andhra have refused to repose faith in Rao on the Telengana question? Maybe their sympathy for the TRS had worn thin after it had sprung an unnecessary by-election on them. It remains true, however, that the development, or the lack of it, of the Telengana region will not be affected by the bypoll results. The Centre and the Andhra government should heed the regions problems, else Telengana could well be another Chattisgarh in the making.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  West Bengal was the first state to slash sales tax and VAT on oil, and it is the first to ask the Centre to bear half of it (States skid on petro populism, June 18). Of course, it was seconded by a host of other states which too had jumped on the bandwagon of sales tax cuts. But is all this running helter-skelter really needed? Why cant the government review oil prices every two or three months, and make the necessary adjustments? That is an easier route to take than delaying the price-hike for months before finally opting for a steep raise. And, of course, if the transport systems in our cities are regularized, the wastage of an enormous amount of oil can be checked.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Blue kerosene is for household use and the transparent one is for commercial use. Red LPG cylinders are for domestic use and the heavier blue ones are for commercial establishments. There is no reason why the heavily-subsidized diesel should be sold for private vehicles. Specially coloured subsidized diesel may be sold only to buses, trucks, taxis and autorickshaws  in other words, vehicles that are used for public transport. Private cars-owners will have to buy normal diesel without subsidy. Stringent and random checks may be conducted at petrol pumps and on road, with the provision of penalty for offenders.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is alright for state governments to slash sales tax on petrol and diesel so as not to make the burden on the tax-payers too heavy. But why are diesel prices not raised to the level of petrol prices? If diesel prices are kept lower than petrol with the help of heavy subsidies, the preference for diesel cars will grow. This will result in huge losses to the oil companies and the government on account of heavy subsidies and falling demand for petrol. Diesel for public transport, agricultural pump sets and other essential services deserve to be made eligible for a subsidized, lower price, but the same cannot be said of privately-owned diesel cars. Excise duty on diesel cars should be reciprocally increased to dissuade people from buying them and to augment revenues. Similar differential prices may be created for cooking gas (full price for income-tax payers) and kerosene (subsidy for BPL families). The state and Central governments and the oil companies should discuss how to implement this.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Ever on the rise                  
	Sir  With the Sixth Pay Commission, the hike in the salaries of Central government employees has been phenomenal. Inflation is at a staggering high now, this increase will surely be an additional burden on the exchequer. But does a salary-hike increase the efficiency of the employees? During my 40 years in academics, I have never found any teacher giving up private tuition or correcting answerscripts more diligently after getting a raise. I feel that a periodic additional allowance based on performance is more conducive to better functioning than the regular bestowal of largesse.

	Disgraced          
	Sir  The case of L. Monika Devi spelt despair not only for Manipur but also for the rest of India (Where merit comes last, Aug 21). When a sportsperson like Monika Devi, who is quite popular in the Northeast, can be jettisoned from the Indian Olympics squad, one can easily imagine the plight of the underprivileged sporting talents who try to get sponsorship. Because all sports are heavily politicized in India, any sporting talent must catch the eyes of the rich-and-powerful. But the kingmakers are usually too busy promoting their chosen ones. Monika Devi was made to pay the price of living in a nation that sacrifices its best talents to nepotism. Perhaps the hurt suffered by her and others like her will one day cause them to rise in revolt against the system. The babus will not change themselves, they must be made to do so.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The way L. Monika Devi was treated showed the Indian Olympic Association in the poorest possible light. Thanks to the IOAs filthy politics, India lost an able athlete and a medal hope. However, such fiascos are only to be expected in a country where sportsmen need political connections to survive. During the inaugural parade in Beijing, officials and relatives of participants outnumbered the sportsmen in the Indian contingent. What were they doing there wasting the publics hard-earned money on a pleasure trip? It is unfortunate for a person with talent in any sport to be born in India.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Sumitra De, Agartala

                
	Sir  It is baffling that the authorities controlling sports in India played a dirty game with L. Monika Devis career and got away with it. Was Monika Devi a victim of the machinations of the Sports Authority of India? Did she test positive in the dope test at all or was the result fudged? Or was she sidelined for belonging to a part of India that has always been ignored by the mainland? Surprisingly, the media too ceased to report on Monika Devi after the initial stories on her rejection and humiliation. Has she sought reparation for the injustice she was subjected to? The media should come to the aid of anyone like Monika Devi who has been wronged by the politicians and bureaucrats.           
	Yours faithfully,        N. Sethuraman, Santiniketan 
              
	Road rage          
	Sir  The government of West Bengal may profess its support for industrialization but does it have the basic infrastructure for it? We hear of plans for new roads, like a proposed one from Barasat to Raichak, but what of the utter lack of maintenance once a road is made? NH 34, better known as Jessore Road, which is very close to the proposed roadway, is in a miserable condition, full of deep potholes. The PWD seems to be in no mood to take any corrective measures. Perhaps it will take a bigwig to get a taste of the road for it to be repaired. Commuters like me, who have no option but to take this road daily, hope that such a visit will happen soon.           
	Yours faithfully,      
J. Bose, Calcutta

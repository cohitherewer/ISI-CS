The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Theres a Price on the Head
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             THERES A PRICE ON THE HEAD                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	The newspaper was dated September 3rd, a day of meaning to any Briton my age: the one in 1939 when Britain (and thus its Indian empire) went to war with Germany. By chance or not, the papers lead headline was well calculated to appeal to British patriotism, and in some of us no doubt it did. Im as patriotic as anyone, but not in me.        
	This is how it ran: Secret convoy defies Taleban in epic bluff. It had all the elements that we British love to imagine, not always deludedly, in our armed forces. Secret: outwitting the stupid enemy. Convoy: getting supplies through, whatever the perils, as our merchant sailors did in 1939-45. Defies: brave little Britain, thumbing its nose at Napoleon or Hitler alike. Epic: something truly grand and memorable. Bluff: see secret.        
	Alas, one giveaway word brought the whole edifice tumbling down: Taleban. Good God, I thought. Here we are, allies of the mightiest nation on earth. Our two countries troops are in a miserable Asian land with a population  not all of it hostile, and its rulers officially on our side  not one tenth of our combined total, and vastly poorer even than that. Weve have been there for more than six years. And we have to use bluff and secrecy to push through a convoy of trucks, for fear of a few thousand ill-armed guerrillas!        
	Ill end the geopolitics there, though I could go on (and on). My point is different, the headline itself and its wording. A headline is the shortest story there is, or at least the shortest chapter. In maybe half-a-dozen words but it has to say whats happened, in what context. And, ideally, it has to grab the reader, one with a choice of umpteen rival headlines.                
	Note the context        
	Granted, the headline-writer has one thing going for him: hes not asked to grab just any reader but a particular group, those naturally interested already. No one expects his half-dozen words about Mamata Banerjee to sell newspapers in Brazil. Even so, the ideal is seldom reached. The legendary Small earthquake in Chile Not many dead never actually appeared; it was dreamed up for a dullest headline competition at the London Times, and it won. But Ive read many duller than that.        
	Gripping ones are easy to fake, provided you can invent the story too. The best Ive met was Archduke Franz Ferdinand found alive First World War a mistake. In the real world, the best Ive seen was the famous or infamous one-worder in the London Sun after a British submarine had sunk the Argentine cruiser, General Belgrano, during the Falklands war of 1982: GOTCHA!        
	Why best? Britains tabloids publish plenty of junk, but they employ some of the sharpest headline-writers in the world. Yet what was so special about GOT YOU! (as it translates)? The answer of course lay in the populist Suns readership: mainly redneck Britons, inflamed at the time by the humiliating Argentine seizure of the Falklands, and eager to see Britain hit back. The story was already clear: no need to put in CRUISER, ARGY or SUB. The one word precisely caught the readers mood.         
	And mine: unlike many people of my politics, I think the answer, if a man suddenly hits you in the face, is to hit him back, harder, first and talk peace afterwards. So why did I react differently to the headline about Afghanistan? Because my mood, and that of many other Britons, was different. We ought to care deeply about the issues there. We should be appalled that the ghastly Taliban may yet again run the place. But we dont and we arent.         
	As often, the impact of words, almost their very meaning, depended not on the words themselves, but on the context into which they were launched.

	It is difficult to say what attributes make a chief minister. The Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, and her advisors may have one notion, while Narayan Rane, recently suspended from the party for indiscipline, may have quite another. Ashok Chavan, the chief minister of Maharashtra in place of Vilasrao Deshmukh, who was persuaded to step down after the terrorists attack on Mumbai, was the industries minister in the Deshmukh government. But it was not his achievements in that post that were being rewarded; Mr Rane is excitably telling everybody that Mr Chavan had none. The Congress leadership, made uncomfortable by the United Progressive Alliances perceived failure to check terrorism, embarrassed by Mr Deshmukhs foolish behaviour at the sites of devastation, and hard put to choose a new chief minister quickly amid the aggressive personalities, intra-party rivalries and complicated histories of the Congress and Nationalist Congress party leaders jostling for attention in Maharashtra, plumped for the safe and as yet low-profile Mr Chavan. At least he is the son of a former Union minister and chief minister, and a Maratha to boot. He does not have the Shiv Sena background of the other Maratha, Mr Rane, especially important since the NCP wanted Chhagan Bhujbal, another Shiv Sena-turned Congress leader, as deputy chief.        
	For the Congress, it was a matter of choosing among many evils  because no party wants to proclaim to the world that its chief minister is unfit with assembly elections around the corner. But then, no party can want to have its voters feel that terrorists and killers are running loose among them. So choosing a chief minister for Maharashtra, while an urgent job, was also part of much larger changes and projects that the Congress must be seen to be taking on before the Lok Sabha elections. Mr Chavans term, for the time being, is not likely to be a long one. The state leadership of the party may perhaps be more taken up with dealing with the upheavals there that Mr Rane is threatening to cook up.

             - To know or not to know, to know and not to know
    Aveek Sen
                         
	Man meets woman. They are inevitably attracted to each other. They marry. They find out that they are twins separated at birth. They go to court. The judge annuls their marriage. 
    
	This is all we know of an incident that occurred recently in Britain. The high-court judge who annulled the marriage spoke about the case to a peer, who used it in the House of Lords to highlight deficiencies in the human embryology and tissues bill going through parliament. For Lord Alton, what is at stake here are the rights of donor-conceived or adopted children: they have a right to know about the circumstances of their birth and who their biological parents are. But he tells the papers nothing else about these two people, and the judge remains anonymous too. We do not know how old the man and woman are, or anything else about their lives. How did they meet? How did they find out? How long after their marriage did this happen?
    
	Lord Altons reticence is entirely right. But the questions in my mind wouldnt stop. Like a dream stirring up feelings and images that linger inexpressibly for days afterwards, the bare bones of this incident repeatedly compelled my imagination to flesh them out. How did the couple come to know? What made them go to court? What if they had children? How do they feel now? What has happened to the inevitable attraction  their own words, reported by the judge  they had felt for each other? And just as hauntingly, what did the judge feel when he annulled their marriage? 
       
	Reflections on this incident begin to unfold at many levels. There is, first, the compulsion to imagine, feel and think our way into the lives of these three people. This is the path of empathy, which isnt always as virtuous as it is usually made out to be. What exactly do we do when we empathize? Inextricable from imagining what it was like for them is the question of what we would have felt, and done, if we were the man, the woman or the judge. Ideally, there is nothing that could stop us from identifying with all three people, separately or all at once. But we might find our empathy stumbling, or simply stopping dead, at certain points along the track. And it is worth asking why. Are we setting ourselves these limits, or are they being set by others? Is it a mix of both? Empathizing also involves remembering; we empathize as much with the memory as with the lobes of the brain that imagine, feel and think. So the limits to how far we go along the path of identifying with others might depend, among other things, on what we allow ourselves to remember of our own lives, on how far back we want to go, or can go, in our memory. 
    
	In this case, I realized that my thinking and feeling focussed on the brother and sister, but my imagination kept going back to the judge. Every time I imagined myself in his position  why do I always imagine judges as male?  I found myself hopelessly failing to disentangle the legal, the moral and what I can only describe as the literary from one another in my fantasy judgments. In my own life, I am close to one pair of fraternally twinned brother and sister, and to one person who has always known that she is adopted without knowing who her real parents are. But unwitting-incest-followed-by-knowledge is entirely outside the pale of my direct or vicarious experience. So, in reliving the particulars of this incident in my imagination, I find myself going back repeatedly to literature, opera and cinema. I initially felt uncomfortable about this. Does it not aestheticize a set of experiences that are too painfully real? Then I decided not to feel bad. When it comes to situations of baffling extremity, we all try to do the best with whatever we can clutch at. Art is then as good, or as bad, as anything else. Besides, what is the point of reading Sophocles if we do not use him to deal with actual human situations? 
    
	It might even be crucial  for existential, rather than academic, reasons  to think about why we turn to art, and especially to literature, when confronted with a blind spot in law or everyday morality. Why is it that literature can accommodate  without having to settle issues of innocent or guilty, valid or null  what law has to close off with precisely such judgments? Why is it that law cant afford to be like literature in the real world, while morality, at its most intelligent and humane, is allowed to be a bit of both, depending on particular situations? And what does it say about being human that civilization, at its best, has always been a difficult muddle of legal closures, moral ambiguity and literary openness, and at its worst, a forcible simplification of this muddle?
    
	The question of knowledge and the mystery of human affinity: these are the two points  distinct, yet mutually affecting  at which the imagination must pause when reflecting on this incident. Both are central to law and to morality, to the discourse of human rights, for instance, that Lord Alton invokes: what can we rightfully demand to know about ourselves? Yet, what might happen to us once we know, especially when the knowledge takes us beyond the most deeply imbibed limits of what we can live with, privately and publicly, is also what this incident forces us to confront. But our response is further complicated by the nature of the incest here. If the man and woman were parent and child, or just siblings, it would have been one thing. But the fact of their being twins, of like desiring like (even when they are not identical twins), gives to the union a peculiar structural rightness, a sense of aesthetic justness, that may be unaccommodable now within conventional morality, law and genetics, but goes back to some of the earliest myths of the origin of sexual desire. In Platos Symposium, for instance, Aristophanes presents the idea of human beings being rounded wholes split by Zeus into halves  each half yearning for the half from which it had been severed  that would have a rich and enduring life in art and literature. When the two-egg twins in Arundhati Roys The God of Small Things break the Love Laws and move beyond the Edges, Borders, Boundaries, Brinks and Limits at the end of the novel, the image that Roy returns to is that of stacked spoons fitted together. And in Wagners Die Walkre, the attraction that the twins, Siegmund and Sieglinde, feel for each other is affirmed, and not destroyed, by their recognition of each other as twins. The profoundly beautiful and complex music that Wagner writes for them during this scene leads them not only physically out into the spring night, but also psychologically back to the recovered memories of their shared childhood.
       
	Yet Roys stacked spoons are also an image, not of happiness, but of hideous grief. And this brings us back to the tragedy of knowledge, the originary enactment of which in Western culture twins the mystery of affinity with the mystery of birth. I must pursue this trail to the end, Sophocles Oedipus tells his mother-wife, Till I have unravelled the mystery of my birth. Jocasta arrives at the truth a little before Oedipus does, and she is willing to stop the relentless questioning that he has initiated and give it a go, the possibility of a life together even after knowing who one is: Such things/ Must be forgotten, if life is to be endured. 
    
	Yet, Oedipus tragedy is founded, as all our lives are, on a primal forgetting. We have no memory of the most important thing to have happened to us. It is because we forget our own birth that the most primary elements of our conscious selves have to be recovered and put together from the stories that witnesses and messengers remember and tell. It is because we have to let our own memories disappear into other peoples memories that we cannot, as it were, produce our own identification papers. This makes us potentially helpless in relation to those who can: the family and the State, whom we have to take on trust in granting us the truth of our coming into being. This is where we come back to Lord Altons question of the rights that restore our access to, and control over, basic information about the origins, and hence the legitimacy, of our existence. 
    
	Twinned and separated in a forgotten time, and then united in ignorance to be severed again in knowledge, the utter facelessness of this brother and sister is an annulment of more than just a marriage. For Oedipus, the knowing mind can dwell beyond the reach of pain only when the body of shame has been prisoned up in total blankness. This is an empty place that empathy would fear to tread.

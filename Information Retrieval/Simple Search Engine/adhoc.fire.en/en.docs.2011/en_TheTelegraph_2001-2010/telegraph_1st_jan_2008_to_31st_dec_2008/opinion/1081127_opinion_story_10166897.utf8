	The two words that any self-respecting film festival likes to be linked with are independent and international. So it is doubly shameful that the screening of Maqbool Fida Husains documentary, Through the Eyes of a Painter, made in the Sixties and awarded a Golden Bear in Berlin, has been deferred indefinitely at the International Film Festival of India going on in Goa. This immediately makes the independence of such an event highly suspect, and in an arena that is rather embarrassingly international. A couple of right-wing Hindu outfits have reiterated their usual objections to Mr Husains paintings to Goas chief minister, and this seems to have had a trickle-down effect through the festival director to bring about such a deferral. The documentary, incidentally, has nothing to do with divinity.        
	The best way to give in to, without endorsing, such a bigoted position is to invoke, as the director has done, a law-and-order problem. In India, the secular State as guarantor of the artists freedom of expression seems to be entirely dependent on a police force that it has no control over, and a judiciary whose sentences and orders can be ignored with impunity by citizens organizing themselves into offended communities. Mr Husain is an exile from his own country because of the law-and-order problem around his paintings that the government and its law-keepers have not been able to protect him from for more than a decade. More than 1,250 police complaints have been lodged against him by outraged Indians. Most of them are on charges of obscenity and sectarian provocation. The measure of the irrationality that drives the protesters is in the fact that there are no goddesses in this documentary.

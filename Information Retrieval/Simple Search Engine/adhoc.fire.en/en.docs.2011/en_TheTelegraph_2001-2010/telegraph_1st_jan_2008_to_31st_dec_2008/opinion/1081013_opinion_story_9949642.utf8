	The main purpose of British generals, it sometimes seems, is to say aloud the things that American generals (and British diplomats) think privately but dare not say in public. Things like: Were not going to win this war. That was what Mark Carleton-Smith, the senior British commander in Afghanistan, said last week at the end of his six-month tour in command of 16 Air Assault Brigade. His force saw a great deal of combat and lost 32 members, but it didnt lose any battles. Regular troops rarely lose battles against guerrillas. But there were no lasting successes either  which is also typical of wars where foreign troops are fighting local guerrillas.        
	Carleton-Smith did not say that the foreign forces in Afghanistan will lose the war. He said that they could not deliver a decisive military victory. The best they might do, over a period of years, would be to reduce the Taliban insurgency to a manageable level... thats not a strategic threat and can be managed by the Afghan army.        
	If the Taliban were prepared to sit on the other side of the table and talk about a political settlement, he continued, then thats precisely the sort of progress that concludes insurgencies like this. That shouldnt make people uncomfortable. For the truth is that the foreign forces are backing one side in an Afghan civil war. If the war cannot end in a decisive victory for one side or the other, then it must end in a negotiated peace that is acceptable to both sides.        
	The reason neither side can win is that they are too evenly balanced, and each can hold its own territory indefinitely. The United States of America allied itself with the main northern ethnic groups  Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara  who together account for about 60 per cent of the population, in order to drive the Taliban from power in 2001. But the Taliban were and still are the major political vehicle for the Pashtuns, who are about 40 per cent of the population.                
	Sooner the better        
	The Pashtuns were traditionally the dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan, but in 2001 they were effectively driven from power. That is why they are in revolt: the area where Western troops are fighting the Taliban are all the areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan, where Pashtuns are in the majority, and nowhere else. In practice, the foreigners are fighting Pashtun nationalism. That is why they cannot win.        
	The Taliban cannot win a decisive victory either. They never established control over northern Afghanistan even when they ruled in Kabul in 1996-2001, mainly because the other ethnic minorities saw them as an exclusively Pashtun group. But a negotiated peace deal must give the Pashtuns a fair share of power at the centre, and that means giving the Taliban a share of the power. This is still unthinkable in most Western capitals, but it is a thoroughly traditional Afghan way of ending the periodic ethnic bust-ups that have always plagued the country. Does this mean that Afghanistan will re-emerge as a base for international terrorism? Unlikely, since it would not be to the advantage of any Afghan government, even one that included Taliban elements, to attract that kind of international opprobrium. Besides, international terrorists dont need bases to prepare their attacks; a few rooms will do.        
	In a recently leaked diplomatic cable, the deputy French ambassador in Kabul, Franois Fitou, reported that the British ambassador there, Sherard Cowper-Coles, told him that the strategy for Afghanistan was doomed to failure. The usual denials followed, but this is exactly what British officials there say in private.        
	So it would make sense to announce a deadline for pulling out the foreign troops and start negotiating for a final peace settlement in Afghanistan now. Waiting is unlikely to produce a better deal.

	The announcement that Joseph Biden will be Barack Obamas running mate in the presidential campaign is an indication of the latters priorities if he were to be elected. Mr Biden has won his spurs in the Senate in the field of foreign policy. The greatest challenge that will face Mr Obama if and when he becomes president will be the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq. This is a quagmire into which the United States of America was pushed by the adventurism of George W. Bush and his advisors. The task is bound to be messy and thankless. The other is the situation in Afghanistan, where the chase to get Osama bin Laden has proven to be long and elusive. Mr Obama will require the best possible advice and expertise to handle these two situations  both having domestic repercussions  and he obviously expects Mr Bidens experience in foreign affairs to be crucial here. It is important to remember here that the vice-presidency is no longer the ornamental position that it once was.        
	It will be simple-minded to expect that the success of Mr Obamas campaign will depend only on what he or Mr Biden have to say on foreign policy. The US economy remains in a worse state than it has ever been in recent memory. Mr Obama will have to tell his supporters and the nation exactly how he proposes to address this problem. This will mean that he will have to give content to his rallying cry to change the country. There can be no doubt that Mr Obama, through his oratory and his persona, has inspired more hope and expectations than any other presidential candidate since John F. Kennedy. This has made him a leader of promise. To make the transition to a president of substance, Mr Obama has to tell the nation of his plans to rejuvenate it. This is the challenge before Mr Obama as he goes into the Democratic convention in Denver. His supporters will be disappointed if he has peaked too early.

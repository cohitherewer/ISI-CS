	A good act is exemplary. It deserves to be emulated. The speaker of the Lok Sabha, Somnath Chatterjee, should take a leaf out of the book of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh. There was a choice before the prime minister: he could decide to do what he thought was the right thing to do or succumb to political pressure and continue in office. He chose to do the right thing notwithstanding the inevitable political uncertainty. Mr Chatterjee also has to make a choice: whether to tamely follow the party line dictated to him by the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Prakash Karat, or to uphold the dignity of his office by remaining true to the spirit and the letter of the Constitution. To most people who believe in the value of democratic norms and practice, this is no choice at all. But Mr Chatterjee has been a lifelong communist, so he has been taught that loyalty to the party stands above everything else, even perhaps above the Constitution. Mr Chatterjee thus stands at a crossroads: he can remain a party loyalist or be a holder of a high office, critical to the functioning of a democracy, who upholds constitutional propriety.        
	The constitutional position of the speaker of the Lok Sabha, both in theory and in practice, is somewhat self-evident. The speaker stands above the fray of political parties: this enables him to preside over the debates in parliament without bias or prejudice. This means that Mr Chatterjee, as soon as he was elected speaker by the members of the Lok Sabha, ceased to be a member of the CPI(M). That part of his identity was erased. His new identity was that of speaker, non-partisan and impartial. But Mr Karat, perhaps because as a communist he does not believe in the sanctity of democratic institutions, wants Mr Chatterjee to resign as speaker and revert back to his position of a CPI(M) member of the Lok Sabha. In other words, Mr Karat wants to undermine the office of the speaker for one extra vote in the trust vote that is due to take place next week.        
	Mr Chatterjee should do his duty, not his duty by his party, but his duty as a holder of an important constitutional office. Mr Chatterjee has been an extraordinarily successful speaker and before that he has been an eminent parliamentarian and lawyer, he needs nobody to tell him the importance of the Constitution. If he resigns as speaker he will set a very bad precedent; if he refuses to resign he will be remembered as a speaker who stood firm by the Constitution. The choice is between being a party loyalist and being a public figure. The fact that Mr Chatterjee did not immediately accede to Mr Karats request to resign is a positive sign. Mr Chatterjee holds in his hands a crucial issue of Indian democracy. It might by far be the best thing he ever did if he does not resign.

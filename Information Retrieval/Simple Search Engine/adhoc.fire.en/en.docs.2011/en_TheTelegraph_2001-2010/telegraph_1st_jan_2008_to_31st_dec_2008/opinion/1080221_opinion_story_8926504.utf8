The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Lost along the way
                                                                                                                 LOST ALONG THE WAY                                  Prince Anwar Shah Road has followed the markets rules to change. For better or for worse? asks Sreyashi Dastidar                          The Usha factory: sepia tint                                  
	Between the Tipu Sultan mosque in the west and the Jadavpur police station in the east, a world lies utterly changed. An aerial view of Prince Anwar Shah Road captured ten years ago would be quite a different picture from one taken today. The face of the street has been under a cosmetic surgeons scalpel, it seems  a plight similar to that of Elgin Road. But after such transformation, roads change their character more than human beings do.        
	There was a time not so long ago when, at the sound of the 9 am siren, hundreds of workers would walk down from all directions and troop into Joy Engineering Works, the manufacturers of Usha sewing machines and fans. Anwar Shah Road was very much an industrial stretch till about the early Eighties, with makeshift shops near the factory gates selling saris, childrenswear and household items. These would do brisk business in the first week of the month, which was also when the tea-stall owners went after the familiar creditors.        
	What used to be Joy Engineering Works is now the gigantic project called South City  an ensemble of sky-high residential towers, a school, a club and a shopping mall. The 9 am siren has long ceased to be a familiar sound of the city  perhaps in collusion with the vanishing industries. The labourers who raised South City did not need the siren, they worked days as well as nights.               
	Moving east from the sewing machine factory, there were three main landmarks (also stops for public buses): the Lords Bakery (whose products have not seen the insides of shops in a long time), Dhaka Kalibari (like most religious sites, it shows no signs of losing popular appeal) and Navina cinema (once showing B-grade Hindi films, it only brings the top releases these days). There was also Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri College. But without star-studded fests or student-body elections marred by headline-making violence, it never became a presence.         
	This stretch now has at least three highrise apartment complexes, and the Princeton Club which has become the new address for rocking young people. Dibyaroop Ghosh remembers being sent by his father to pay bills at the corporation office, where Princeton Club stands today. The swankier, more compact office is now cosily tucked inside the ground floor of the highrise that has come up in the former corporation premises. Ghosh also recalls a Charlie Chaplin festival at Navina cinema sometime in the mid-Eighties. It is because of all the new complexes coming up in the area that the night show has been revived at Navina, and this cant be a bad thing, he says.         
	The Navina night show, the dense shrubbery beside the cinema, which doubled up as an illicit liquor den, and the tiny shops that always had a group of rowdies hanging around them were the unmentionables of Anwar Shah Road. But this was when the princes of Prince Anwar Shah Road were Sheikh Binod and Sheikh Shahzada and their friends. Girls studying in Jadavpur University in the early Nineties would feel scared of taking the badly-lit Anwar Shah Road to go back to their homes in New Alipore or Behala after dark.         
	A little over ten years later, even the wild and rebellious sections of the road have faithfully followed the script of the market. A market culture, it is said, considers wealth-creation to be sacred, so the State must stand back and permit individuals to follow their self-interests. The State has been faithful to this dictum too. It has not let principles of protection and benevolence come in the way of allowing individuals  a euphemism, no doubt, for cash-rich developers  to realize their self-interests. So a jheel may have to be sacrificed here, and a playground there, but only in the assumption that the market has its own mechanism to smooth out frayed edges.               
	Apologists for the market argue that over a thousand unemployed youth from the colonies around Gobindapur, Bijoygarh and Poddarnagar have found jobs in the South City mall and the other residential projects. Unemployment, after all, is the root of several evils, particularly crime. Santanu Ganguly, who has lived on Anwar Shah Road since 1985, says that law and order here have improved by leaps and bounds ever since the developments began. Besides, the Anwar Shah Road-Southern Avenue flyover has nearly halved his travelling time.        
	But some of the older residents remain unconvinced. They fear that soon their paras will disintegrate, since these are entities that rest on fragile arrangements of domestic and professional relationships, with their own social-moral structures and divisions of labour. Aurobindo Ghosh, who taught geology at Jadavpur University and has seen Anwar Shah Road when it was unmetalled, single-lane and unfit for buses, is seriously worried about the lack of long-term thinking involved in the developments along the road. Traffic is one of them. But is anybody worried about the waste that will be generated by this road once all the residential complexes are full? he asks. The developers are happy to leave worries of sewerage and sanitation to the civic authorites. But as more water bodies are choked, without any waste treatment plants planned, the problem slowly gets out of hand.        
	Figures show that in its power, reach and size, WalMart is bigger than Indonesia. The Sunday crowd at Spencers Hyper at the South City mall seems to boast that the global reach of Spencers will soon override the local identity of Prince Anwar Shah Road. Has a terrible beauty been born? The answer may only be found ten years later.

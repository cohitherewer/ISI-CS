	Debesh Chattopadhyay, director of one of the best Bengali productions at present  Sansritis Surya Pora Chhai  acknowledges inspiration from Primo Levis autobiography, Paul Jindels (sic) plays and Joy Goswamis poetry in its making. Curiously, he suppresses the name of Zindels specific work from which he has borrowed so much that his self-written drama should, in all honesty, be called an adaptation, and the source credited.        
	Zindels The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds justifiably won the triple crown of Pulitzer Prize, Obie and New York Drama Critics Circle Award when it reached Off-Broadway in 1971. Based partially on the life of the author  a high-school chemistry teacher and novelist for young adults  its cast of four women has given actresses a beautifully touching platform ever since. Two adolescents strive to form their individual lives under the shadow of their disturbed, impoverished, single mother. The elder sister is confused, whereas the younger one is quietly determined, a good student preparing a science project (the subject of the long title). The family also shelters an old boarder, who does not speak.        
	True, Chattopadhyay alters bits and pieces. The Bengali mother does not take drugs, but retains her sources controlling nature, depressing cynicism, refusal to praise her daughters, and mental (occasionally physical) abuse of them. He switches the sisters parts, so that the older conducts the scientific experiments while the younger teases and irritates. The former has a guinea pig, instead of a rabbit in Zindel that her mother vindictively kills. Her sister likes the pet, but not to the extent that (in the original) she vows to kill their mother if she hurts it. The boarder becomes their invalid grandmother here. Zindels references to the dead grandfather change to their dead father here. The rival girl at the science fair clinches the similarities, because in both versions she presents a cats skeleton from which she dissolved the flesh, and plans to repeat this on a dog the next time. Even the set and opening starlight recall the brilliant Josef Svobodas design for the Czech revival in 1972.        
	However, Chattopadhyay makes it more lyrical, without the slight bitterness that tinges Zindel. He draws all the characters sympathetically, in a painting that enshrines human fragility. The older sisters uncertainty but inner strength, and her kid sisters joie de vivre, sensitively expressed by Anandi Basu and Daminee Mukherjee respectively, encapsulate in contrasting ways the will to live. Startlingly, mother and daughters sing very well, which in itself testifies to the life force. Humour occurs too, in the mothers loud recriminations about her dead husband to her hard-of-hearing mother-in-law (Bhadra Basu). Kasturi Chattopadhyay has the toughest acting job as the unlikeable mother, but carries it off excellently. On stage, Surya Pora Chhai is guaranteed to uplift viewers.

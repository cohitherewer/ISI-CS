	It is not often that J. Jayalalithaa speaks from the mount. Even the trust vote in parliament has failed to elicit much response from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief, whose withdrawal to a hill resort continues to frustrate partymen. Ms Jayalalithaa, not unexpectedly, has backed the demand of her political rival, the chief minister, M. Karunanidhi, for the restitution of Tamil fishermens traditional rights to the island of Katchatheevu. She has also threatened to move the Supreme Court and coerce the Centre into a review of the pact by which the island was ceded to Sri Lanka in 1974.         
	The clamour in Tamil Nadu for the Centres intervention in the protection of fishermens rights and lives has not reached a peak yet. But the pressure on the Centre, following a slew of Sri Lankan assaults on Tamil fishermen last month, has been sufficient to make the prime minister make a special mention of the issue to his Sri Lankan counterpart at the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. However, several factors may step up the war of words both within India and between India and Sri Lanka. The crux of the problem lies in Sri Lankas efforts at taming the Tamil Tigers and breaking their support system, in which many Tamil fishermen, willingly or unwillingly, play a part. Recent arrests in Tamil Nadu of procurement agents of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have shown this up. But a more humanitarian concern for the fishermen, their dependence on the waters around the Katchatheevu island and the fate of those caught between the Sri Lankan navy and the Tigers are swiftly turning the emotional tide in Tamil Nadu. If Sri Lanka continues to ignore the civilian casualties of its war on terrorists, southern India, which bears the brunt of that war, may increasingly push for a more pro-active role for the Centre in ending that war. In an election year, no major party, at the Centre or in Tamil Nadu, can ignore that change of the mood in the electorate.

	The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme has completed two years of operation. It has been subjected to an evaluation by the Planning Commission, which, while it would not go out of its way to find corruption or misappropriation, has nevertheless attempted an honest report. It is a pity it is not in the public domain, but there are ways of peeking behind the governments veil.         
	The United Progressive Alliance government had claimed that the NREGS was a great innovation. It was nothing of that sort. It replaced the Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana started by the previous government in 2002, and the National Food-for-Work Programme that supplemented it in 150 districts from 2004 onwards. The two paid for 1.11 billion person-days of work in 2005-06; the NREGS paid for 1.44 billion in 2007-08. An average worker worked for 42 days; so the number of people who should have got employment was roughly 3.3 crore. The ministry of rural development estimates only 2.3 crore; the difference must remain a mystery for now. Only 17 lakh households got employment in West Bengal; they worked 2.5 crore working days  15 days work per household, against the assured 100 days work. Either the people of Bengal are busy doing better things, or the NREGS was confined to the select few. West Bengals expenditure on the NREGS was Rs 277 crore, or Rs 1.08 per working day. Either the workers in West Bengal are extremely patriotic and did most of the work free, or some figure has been invented. Since it is unlikely that the expenditure is much more than reported, it must be the number of working days that is fictitious.        
	The NREGS pays extremely high wages, compared to the prevailing market wages. A blinkered mind will immediately go into a spin about how the NREGS is for removing rural poverty and how deserving the poor are of higher wages. But the high wages create an additional route to corruption. A politician, civil servant or contractor who wants to misappropriate money would invent fictitious workers on payroll registers and pay himself their wages. An easy way of detecting this is to look at the work done: if there were no workers employed, there would also be no roads or contour bunds as claimed. But if the scheme requires higher-than-market wages, the corrupt functionary can employ people, get their thumb impressions against entries showing they were paid the prescribed wages, pay them market wages and pocket the difference. If Bengals figures are anything to go by, bureaucrats may report fictitious figures, secure in the knowledge that no one would know how to analyse them. For now at least, a sceptical stance in respect of the NREGS would not be unjustified, as would be a suspicion that the Planning Commissions figures are exaggerated.

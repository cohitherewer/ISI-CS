	How many mothers in India had reasons for cheer on Mothers Day? Overworked, afraid to produce daughters, neglectful of their own health, insecure about their futures, the Indian mother is no ones envy. So it is all the more laudable that Kerala, Manipur and Goa have achieved conditions that make motherhood a good experience. A study by a group of organizations shows that these three states rank the highest in India in terms of three indicators: infant mortality rate, antenatal care and institutional delivery. Not surprisingly, Kerala shows the best results in antenatal care and in institutional delivery  99.3 per cent of mothers deliver their children in institutional care. And Kerala shares its political inclinations with West Bengal, which is particularly poor in institutional delivery.         
	What is striking is that the IMR is lowest in Manipur, one of the three best-performing states. Nagaland and Mizoram too are very good performers in terms of IMR, although Manipur scores far better in terms of the other two markers. While a greater spread of literacy is a significant factor in the better performance of the Northeastern states, it is also true that, traditionally, women enjoy both status and substance in the communities of these regions. Far away from the Northeast, Goa too, has a unique culture and tradition that allow women and mothers their natural, healthy place. Kerala, Manipur and Goa throw up, through their variety, the conditions necessary for the care of mothers and children. Literacy that does not limit itself to an ability to sign, awareness, a culture that gives proper weight to the welfare of a child and its mother, respect for women and girls, who too have a voice and a will, and the existence of an accessible healthcare system, all these are important. Respect cannot be taught, and being educated, ultimately, is a mindset. For that, the other states still have a long way to go.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             SAME SHOW, DIFFERENT STAGE                                                                  
	There is a price on parliamentarian Govindas head. Some people in North Mumbai have declared a prize of one crore rupees for anyone who can spot the elusive Congress MP within his constituency that runs from Jogeshwari to Palghar. Govinda has been near-invisible in the lower House as well. Having attended 12 per cent of parliamentary proceedings, spoken twice (for a minute each), and not having asked a single question of any significance on the floor, he certainly is less boisterous as a politician than he is in his films.        
	Further northwards, in Bikaner in Rajasthan, a pall of anger hangs heavy on peoples minds. Dharmendra, their elected representative from the Bharatiya Janata Party, is famously inaccessible. The actor, however, claims that his Bikaner office sends him regular updates about the peoples demands and grievances.        
	Not every actor-turned-politician is a bad egg in the basket of our parliamentary democracy. The late Sunil Dutt and Vinod Khanna were exceptions in that they succeeded in public life. But they are rare beings. So why do Indians elect actors as their representatives? Is it a conscious attempt, as the satirist and former MP, Cho S. Ramaswamy, says, to opt for an alternative to the existing political set-up?         
	That may not be the only reason. In a democracy, politics and popular culture are not exclusive categories. In a democracy, men and women can make a seamless transition from cinema to politics still bearing the screen promise of hope and redemption in real life.         
	Indias love for actor-politicians cannot be explained away either by the illiteracy of its poor or the hypocritical practice of political parties fielding glamorous film stars to hide their own warts. The margin of Amitabh Bachchans victory in Allahabad, in 1984, over H.N. Bahuguna, is the highest in Indian political history  a staggering 68.2 per cent of the votes cast were in Bachchans favour. It is difficult to believe that every single voter failed to see through the Congresss strategy to ride piggy-back on Bachchans cinematic popularity to victory. Neither can it be argued that the entire electorate was unlettered.        
	So why do actors win polls, despite the fact that they are an imprudent choice? People are not unaware that the infallible hero fails them once he steps out of the screen. They are also aware of the power of the ballot: they would invariably turn their backs on the fallen hero and, inexplicably, give his place to another, a new star who comes to them with the same promises.         
	Mired in a life of poverty, corruption, floods, bombs, joblessness, the hopelessness of it all, we as a nation have little time for politics and its deviousness. But we certainly cant do without cinema and its improbable people.                    UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

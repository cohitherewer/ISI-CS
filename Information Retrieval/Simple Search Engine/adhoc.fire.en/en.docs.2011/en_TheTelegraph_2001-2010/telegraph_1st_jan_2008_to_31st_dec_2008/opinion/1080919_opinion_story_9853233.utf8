	On his first visit to India as the Nepalese prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal did not have an easy brief. His difficulty can be gauged by the rapidity with which he changed his tactic with changing audiences  promising a win-win situation for both countries while inviting Indian investors to the new democracy, talking of fundamental freedoms and capitalist enterprises with Indias help in elite gatherings, reverently referring to the Hindu essence of Nepali society to Bharatiya Janata Party bigwigs, and speaking of the revolutionary society yet to come in the Nepalese embassy. The political history and ideology of his party, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), place the former armed revolutionary in a rather unusual position as the prime minister of a democracy. But more than that, he is burdened with the many expectations of his own government. While Nepal needs a cooperative India, it is suspicious of any agreement that might help India expand its area of influence. Before he left Nepal, Mr Dahal was exhorted by his party to plunge into a discussion of the thorny issues. So Mr Dahal was juggling the past and the present, both of his party as well as of his country, while also being the smiling visiting dignitary who meant to discuss thorny things.        
	One of Nepals goals is on the way to being reached. India has agreed to a review of the 58-year-old Indo-Nepal friendship treaty, one that the new Nepalese government, with all its parties, wants scrapped. The Kosi floods have made an understanding about short- and long-term plans about the river barrage, embankments, de-silting and maintenance a priority. India has offered an immediate relief of Rs 20 crore for the flood-affected in Nepal, while ways of strengthening the Gandak river embankment have also been discussed. The joint statement also announces, among other things, that Nepal would encourage Indian investment, there would be a review of trade and transit arrangements and India would undertake infrastructure development in Nepal. This could also be part of Mr Dahals problem. India seems very willing to help, while many Maoists in Nepal are acutely uneasy about their countrys economic dependence on India. But another announcement  joint steps to prevent cross-border crime  if ever it can be implemented, can do nothing but good to India. That, however, is going to be far easier said than done.

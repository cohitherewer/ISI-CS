                                                                                                                                    AGE NO BAR
                          
	Aged joints are too stiff to change position with grace. It is not clear whether leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had this in mind when they spoke of the need for young leaders for the party at the state conference in West Bengal, but it is certainly true that youth is the least common of attributes among leaders of any Indian political party. Silver-haired wisdom and respectability have always been prized in a society that is most comfortable with paternalistic hierarchies; older men are the best leaders, it believes  and let the adrenalin take care of declining health. Rigidly structured parties like the CPI(M) or the Bharatiya Janata Party reflect this in an absolute way, for to rise through all the necessary stages from the bottom to the top takes years. To claim a position of leadership or the right to voice and act on new ideas in these structures is an act of rebellion; to persist in it would mean breaking away and forming a new party. So the call for younger leaders in the CPI(M) may be in keeping with its need for fresh faces to represent its fresh thrust towards industrialization, a kind of symbolic change of attitude.
    
	There are comparatively young leaders in the Congress, though, but then the Congress has its own rationale and its own mechanism to project particular young leaders. The rationale is neither democratic nor meritocratic, but quasi-feudal. Loyalty and charisma are believed to be inherited in the Congress: genealogy and kinship are the determining factors. But no Indian party, whether it be the Congress, the BJP or the CPI(M) or any other, has ever taken the logic of market economics to its heart, that is, in terms of party structure, even as the nation the parties variously lead absorbs the principles of merit, competition and excellence. But these principles influence mindsets too, and expectations. The new generation is unlikely to remain comfortable with paternalism, and old men heading political parties may have to rise to other tests than the sole one of revered age. Social attitudes will change inevitably: if market economics is the mantra politicians are happy to chant, they will have to live by it. It is interesting that the CPI(M) should want younger leaders at this point. But the real test would lie in the criteria by which such leaders come to the forefront  a senior leaders preference or competition and merit. If they ever do, that is.

	Dialogue has become another name for dawdling. This is the only way to describe the meaningless talks between the Left leaders and Pranab Mukherjee on the nuclear deal between India and the United States of America. The comrades have not moved an inch from their position; even appeals to national interests have not fetched any positive response from them. Mr Mukherjee, on his part, has done little more than try and buy more time for the deal. As a result, the deal has been in limbo for an inordinately long time, causing nothing but embarrassment to the government of India and the prime minister, Manmohan Singh. That time is long past when this ridiculous situation should have been brought to an end by a government willing to align its intentions with its actions. It has been abundantly clear that Mr Singh personally and his government are committed to the deal. The opposition has come from the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which, because it is not a part of the government, enjoys that rather dubious privilege of having power without responsibility. Mr Singh should call a halt to the Left-Mukherjee parleys, and go forward and sign the deal. If this leads to the fall of the government, Mr Singh should go to the people. At the moment, the Left has more to fear from the peoples verdict.        
	Mr Singh must be acutely aware of the fact that time is running out on the deal. The deal has to go through the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the US Senate. Given the fact that the US presidency will first become a lame-duck one and then change, there can be no guarantee that the new government will be as enthusiastic about the deal as the present administration. The absence of US support will reduce Indias bargaining position in the relevant international fora. There is too much at stake on this deal. One is the fate of Indias energy programme, which is starved of vital supplies. The other is Indias credibility in world affairs. If India, under pressure from the communists, fails to honour its agreement with the US, its image and credibility as a responsible nation will be completely tarnished. Mr Singh cannot allow this to happen. He cannot allow history to see him as a weak prime minister who put political allies before principles. He should tell Comrade Prakash Karat that enough is enough  and, if necessary, show him the stick.

	Italian voters have not lost their sense of humour. Unamused by the antics of the two-year-old centre-left government of Romani Prodi, which raised taxes and bickered constantly without providing any comic relief, they have brought back to the helm Silvio Berlusconi, two-time prime minister and the source of much laughter. The problem is that Mr Berlusconi, who is back with an unprecedented majority, has also been a source of much misery. It was during his two previous premierships that the Italian economy took a nosedive, and, since then, has not had a chance to look up. Even Mr Prodis sincere attempts failed to turn it around. Italy now has one of the worst growth rates in Europe and may be overtaken by Romania in a few decades if it is not careful. Mr Berlusconi, of course, is extremely careful. He has been careful enough to safeguard his business interests by capturing power and, once in power, to save his own skin through statutes that have kept him miraculously immune to corruption charges. To a large section of Italians, Mr Berlusconi, a billionaire media mogul and maverick politician, epitomizes success. His charisma is difficult to resist. For many, it is also difficult not to hope that with his business and political acumen, Mr Berlusconi will continue to remain Italys best bet against a further downslide.        
	Mr Berlusconi, who captivated the Italian electorate with his near-monopolistic hold over the media during the campaign, is not unaware of his responsibility. He and Umberto Bossi, the leader of Northern League, the ruling alliances main partner, have their own formula for setting things right. One of the first steps taken by the new government was to shut down Italys borders and open camps for the identification of unemployed foreigners in Italy. Given the anti-immigrant and protectionist stance of Mr Berlusconis government, chances are Italy will grow more inward-looking in the pursuit of success. This economic nationalism may even work in Italys favour, provided Mr Berlusconi remains focused on and committed to reform and progress. But in the absence of a substantial Opposition to keep him at the job, Mr Berlusconis frivolity may soon get the better of him.

	It is bitterly ironic that eight-year-old Iftesham Chowdhury died after she was hit by her yoga teacher, Anita Das, for being inattentive. As a yoga instructor, Ms Das was expected to instil a sense of physical and psychological well-being in her students. But she behaved unpardonably, slapping the little girl so hard that her head slammed against the wall. Although Ms Chowdhury got urgent medical help, the doctors could not save this Class II student of Vidya Bharati School, Mominpur. The teacher has been charged with death due to negligence  a bailable offence and punishable with a maximum of two years in prison. And predictably, she has fled. The principal of the school, Anjana Mullick, has condemned Ms Dass behaviour as unfortunate and regrettable, though not deliberate. It is difficult to allow Ms Das even the slightest benefit of doubt, much as Ms Mullicks mild disclaimer would like to. Ms Das may not have deliberately killed a child, but surely she must have been aware of the law against any form of punishment, physical or verbal, of students.        
	Given the brutality with which children continue to be treated by teachers, it is bleakly ironic that the law makes provision for addressing both the bodily and the mental effects of punishment. Earlier this month, the principal of a Calcutta school was arrested after he hit a 12-year-old boy with a ruler and left a deep wound below his eye. It is important to end such atrocities first before the finer aspects of verbal punishment are broached. Only in a society where children are routinely and unthinkingly shamed or beaten up for failing to comply with the orders of the adults, it is possible to reason whether a teacher deliberately (or mistakenly) killed an errant student. Earlier this year, Idukki, a district in Kerala, took a pledge to wipe out corporal punishment. The seriousness of this goal was evident in the united front that the State and the civil society put up against the practice  parents, teachers, the child welfare board, even the district collector came together to realize this end. Something similar has to happen in West Bengal. Until then students would continue to be tortured and reprimanded brazenly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Across the divide                  
	Sir  One does not know whether to feel reassured or disappointed with the fact that Indian intelligence agencies have at long last decided to conduct a discreet survey to find out the nature of the change in the demographic profile of areas bordering Nepal and the Northeast (Demography survey on eastern border, Feb 13). The statistical data showing the percentage growth of population between the 1991 and the 2001 census in the districts of West Bengal bordering Bangladesh revealed an alarming influx of people from across the borders into India in the last few years. Large tracts of Indian territory have been lost irretrievably to de facto occupants who, having crossed the borders to India in the search of shelter and livelihood, never leave the country.           
	Such infiltration is not a recent phenomenon. It has been taking place steadily over the years, helped by local leaders and political bigwigs. A look at the map appended to the report shows clearly that as a result of infiltration, the eastern border of West Bengal in particular has been pushed inside significantly. The area of West Bengal will further shrink as the westward march from Bangladesh continues. Despite being cautioned time and again by the media and by some whistle-blowers in the government, the political leadership at the Centre and the states has remained in denial of the issue for its short-term electoral benefits. Although West Bengal has been one of the states worst affected by migration, the state government has repeatedly denied the existence of infiltrators within its borders. If the border remains so porous and outsiders can turn so easily into citizens, why did the country undergo Partition, causing untold misery to millions? Would the politicians, with their lack of foresight and misplaced generosity, make the common people suffer anew?           
	After sixty years of indifference, intelligence agencies have been asked by our leaders to come up with a discreet survey of the reality surrounding infiltration. Nothing can be more farcical at a time when the situation is already spinning out of control. It is regrettable that our leaders would rather jeopardize the security of the country than take action against the infiltrators.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Large-scale demographic change carries the threat of an increase in fundamentalist activities by people who wish to manipulate religious identities to serve their own interests. On December 6, 2006, The Telegraph had published a report about a fatwa issued by a maulana against playing music at home or in the public place in a village in Murshidabad (Music fatwa at home or out). A rapidly burgeoning immigrant Muslim population will ensure that such regressive and repressive tendencies are consolidated. And the dangers of terrorism in such a scenario cannot be overstressed. As it is, there have been repeated bombings in recent times all over the country. They will increase in frequency and devastate India if politicians allow more immigrants to settle within its borders.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is disconcerting to know that NGOs apparently working for the uplift of the Muslim community might actually be working for Pakistan to promote ill-will towards India. Those in Calcutta are also suspect since they are often heard criticizing Indias attitude towards its minority communities. The government should impose strict regulations on them before it is too late.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Saboo, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The chart accompanying the report, Demography survey on eastern border, proved that the Muslim population in the border areas of West Bengal, Assam and Bihar has increased abnormally in comparison with that of non-Muslims. But I know of constituencies in which Muslims were the majority once but have now become minorities. Silchar and Karimganj are two such, as is the Golokganj assembly constituency in the Dhubri district of Assam.           
	Yours faithfully,      
A. Hamid, Guwahati 

                
	Sir  The editorial, Border lines (Feb 15), rightly suggests the necessity of securing our porous borders. And this applies not only to the eastern but also to the western borders of the country. The constant flow of immigrants into India leads to social tensions in the areas where the infiltrators come to settle. If they continue to be welcomed because of their value as vote banks, legal citizens have every right to feel disgruntled. And then there is the threat of terrorism. The Centre should extend all help to the states so that this menace can be checked.           
	Yours faithfully,      
H.N. Ramakrishna, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  I found the editorial, Border lines, baffling. It talks about the demographic changes brought about in West Bengal and Assam as a result of infiltration but leaves out Tripura. In Tripura, the local tribal population had been reduced to a minority long ago due to large-scale migration from Bangladesh. Besides, to classify migrants on the basis of religion is to be biased. The government has no right to act in alarm because the Muslim population along the borders has increased, especially since it has pampered the migrants till now to gain their votes. As an already overpopulated nation, India cannot afford to have more people crowding its borders. Terrorism is only an additional hazard.           
	Yours faithfully,

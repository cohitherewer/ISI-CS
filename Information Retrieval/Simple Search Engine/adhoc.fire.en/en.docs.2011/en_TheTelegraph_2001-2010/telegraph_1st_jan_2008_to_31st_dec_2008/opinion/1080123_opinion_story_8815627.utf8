               The state is on shaky legal grounds in seeking cancellation of SEZs, reports Seetha

	It was a grand populist gesture. Buffeted by protests against special economic zones (SEZ) in the state, the Goa government decided on December 31 to cancel all SEZs in the state. Goa has three notified SEZs and several others in the pipeline. 
    
	That may have brought peace on New Years Eve (agitators had asked tourists to leave Goa by December 28, warning them of violence) and avoided a replay of the protests in West Bengal which claimed over 30 lives. But the move can well land the state and central government in a legal soup. Two days later, the Union commerce secretary said notified SEZs could not be scrapped and that the state could only cancel those in the pipeline. 
    
	Cipla, the company affected by the Goa imbroglio, is exploring legal options. Other developers have still to assess the implications if the Goa governments decision becomes a precedent and sparks off similar demands from the anti-SEZ lobby elsewhere in the country. The matter is to come up before the Board of Approvals shortly. 
    
	SEZs can start functioning only after they are notified under the SEZ Act, 2005, a central government law. That is why the Goa government can only seek denotification by the Centre. The notification follows formal approval by the Board of Approvals for SEZs and that, in turn, comes only after the state government gives its approval and commits itself to providing land, infrastructure and various sops and clearances. 
    
	The board, say commerce ministry officials, would be well within its right to ask the Goa government why it recommended the SEZs, gave them land and promised various concessions. Arguments that the permissions were given when another party was in power wont wash. A government is a legal entity; it cant flip-flop on legal commitments, say officials. 
    
	Contradicting his secretary, Union commerce minister Kamal Nath said the SEZ Act allows for notified SEZs to be reviewed in consultation with state governments. The minister, however, may be on very shaky legal ground. 
    
	There is no explicit provision under the SEZ Act for denotification of an SEZ or the exit of a developer, says Hitender Mehta of Vaish Associates who has studied laws relating to SEZs closely. Developers of denotified SEZs could take the central government to court since the notification is issued under a central legislation and demand compensation, he points out. Commerce ministry officials agree. 
    
	Indeed, all that can be done under Section 10 of the Act is to suspend the letter of approval given to a developer. But the ground on which this can be done have been clearly specified  the inability of the developer to function in accordance with the Act, or violation of the terms and conditions of the letter of approval, or non-compliance with directions given by the Board of Approvals, or the developers financial inability to carry out its tasks. Even then, the suspension of the letter of approval can be done only if it is in the public interest to do so and the developer must be given three months notice as well as reasons for the action. 
    
	Whats more, the suspension cannot last more than a year, during which time an administrator has to be appointed to carry out the tasks of the developer. After that, another developer will have to be appointed. An SEZ, commerce ministry officials point out, is thus in perpetuity. Agrees Mehta, There is an exit provision only for units located in an SEZ. 
    
	In taking the matter up in court, developers can, says Mehta, rely on the principle of estoppel, where a person has taken certain decisions based on promises given and would suffer a loss if those promises are withdrawn. 
    
	Since SEZs are notified only after land has been acquired and the state government makes a formal commitment to them, developers would have invested huge sums of money in them. The minimum investment is Rs 250 crore for a sector-specific SEZ (dedicated to one particular industry, like information technology or textiles) and Rs 1,000 crore for a multi-product SEZ (where different industries can locate units). In the case of Goa, pharmaceutical major Ciplas Meditab Specialities is reported to have invested Rs 500 crore in the SEZ. Developers cannot be expected to bear this loss, just because of political reasons, says Mehta. 
    
	Denotification brings a host of other problems in its wake. Developers typically lease out space to companies to set up units, which also invest large sums to set up shop there. What will happen to those units and whom will they hold responsible for the losses they will suffer? 
    
	Thats not all. SEZs get a slew of benefits. They are exempted from various taxes, including customs and excise duties, service tax and the securities transaction tax levied under various Acts. Banks set up in SEZs are treated as offshore banking units. State governments are required, under Rule 5(5) of the SEZ Rules, to exempt them from state and local taxes, electricity duty and declare them a public utility service under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (which effectively bars strikes), among other things. What will happen to the various notifications on these issues if denotification is pushed through, asks Mehta. 
    
	And what will happen to fiscal concessions that have already been availed of by developers and units? Once a SEZ is denotified, commerce ministry officials worry, customs authorities may expect units to pay import duty on goods they imported duty-free. Ditto for the exemptions from various other levies. This will just open up litigation from all sides, says a Confederation of Indian Industry official. 
    
	That should serve as a warning to populist moves by other state governments.

	Birthdays do not always bring unshadowed happiness. The celebrations for Jharkhands eighth statehood day were toned down in mourning for the five schoolboys who died in a Bero school after drinking milk for their afternoon snack. The incident has raised questions afresh about the safety measures, monitoring and accountability built into the system of meals supplied by schools, including those at midday. For the Jharkhand chief minister, Shibu Soren, and all other leaders who claim to be struggling for the education and development of the tribal people of the state, this blow is especially painful. Parents, who had been persuaded to send their children to this residential school meant chiefly for tribal students, are withdrawing them hurriedly rather than have them risk their lives for education.        
	In a new state still wobbly on its feet and embattled by acrimonious political rivalries  the rapid changes of government and chief minister since 2000 are an indicator  such an incident can be really discouraging. Jharkhands potential is yet to be tapped for the benefit of its population. Mr Soren has promised 1,00,000 government jobs to the young people of the state, and also jobs to one member each of the families of those who died in the statehood struggle. This would be an immediate salve to the hurt and anger of joblessness. But without the spread of education, the development of industry, infrastructure, the sustainable use of forest wealth and the exploration of the enormous possibilities of tourism, future birthdays are unlikely to look brighter. None of this will be easy. The administrations running battle with Naxalites and the consequent heavy police presence, the constant bloodshed and the atmosphere of fear and tension, all drain Jharkhand of much of its constructive energies. Whether Mr Soren and his government can instil in the people resilience and determination while at the same time focussing on building up the states potential remains to be seen.

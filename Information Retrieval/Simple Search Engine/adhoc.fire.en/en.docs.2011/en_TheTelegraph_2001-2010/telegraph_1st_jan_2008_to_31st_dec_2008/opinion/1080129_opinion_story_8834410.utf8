The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Very fair
                                                                                                              VERY FAIR                                                    
	It seems increasingly possible to hope for a better Calcutta. That, perhaps, would be the first response of most citizens to Calcutta high courts ban on the book fair at Park Circus. The arguments against the fair were irrefutable when they were first raised by environmentalists two years ago. No civilized society would allow a city to be choked for ten days in order to facilitate a particular trade. Such an extravaganza can have devastating effects on the life of a city that has as pathetic an urban infrastructure as Calcuttas. Common sense would have been enough to foresee how this years fair would have disrupted normal life not just at Park Circus but in many other parts of the city. It is deplorable that the organizers of the fair thought nothing of the hardships that it would have forced the citizens to face. But the traders motive is easy to understand. What is truly baffling is the argument that the fair, for all its potential for nuisance, is a symbol of the citys cultural heritage and hence should be held at all costs. The argument is too banal to merit a rebuttal. Those who put it forward seem to have a ridiculous notion of culture. If they still have a following in the city, that is because Calcutta has long been a home of bogus causes.         
	It is possible to see the controversy over the fair as a battle between the old and the new. It reflects new ideas about the role of the government, the civil society and other institutions. When the fair was shifted out of the Maidan at the intervention of the high court, it clearly was a victory for the civil society. It was also a vindication of a new public campaign on what the government should or should not do. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has otherwise signalled refreshing changes, betrayed an old mindset in his support for the Maidan as the venue of the fair. The larger question was, however, not of his personal preferences. The controversy over the fair brought to light the absurdity of the state government patronizing a particular trade. The citizens have a right to know why the Calcutta municipal corporation had offered to jointly organize the fair this time. The CMCs hands should be full with the citys daunting civic problems. That it connived with the organizers of the fair to add to the citys chaos shows how brazenly irresponsible the mayor and his team can be. The positive signal is that saner voices are speaking up at last.

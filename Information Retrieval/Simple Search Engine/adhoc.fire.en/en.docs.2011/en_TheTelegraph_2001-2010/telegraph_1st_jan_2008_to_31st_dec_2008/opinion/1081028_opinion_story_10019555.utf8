	Passed, with flying colours                  
	Sir  India did well to beat Australia in the second Test in Mohali (A mere 91 minutes is all it took, Oct 22). Had the team chosen to enforce a follow-on, probably an innings victory could have been achieved. This giant killing act of India needs to be followed up by more wins in a variety of conditions against other teams too, before we can call ourselves world-beaters.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Mohali has proved to be a Waterloo for the Indian team. It is not a matter of joke to defeat the formidable Aussies by a margin of 320 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the four-match series. For Indian cricket-lovers, this is the best Diwali gift possible. It was a fine show of teamwork. The Mohali Test will be remembered for all times to come as the one in which Sachin Tendulkar went past Brian Lara as the highest run scorer in Tests and became the first batsman to reach 12,000 runs in Test cricket. It was in the same match that Sourav Ganguly became the fourth Indian to score 7,000 Test runs before notching up his 16th Test century. Amit Mishra became the sixth Indian to take five wickets on Test debut. M.S. Dhoni became only the third wicketkeeper-batsman and captain to make half-centuries in both innings of a Test. Gautam Gambhir got his first Test century in India. And of course, India registered their biggest Test victory ever in terms of runs. No doubt it tastes sweeter coming against Australia.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Finally India played as a team and won against Australia. The Mohali Test has exposed all the weaknesses of the Australian team. But there is no room for complacence for India. A defeated Aussie side is like a wounded tiger looking for an opportunity to bounce back. The next two tests will be crucial. Anil Kumbles injury turned out to be a blessing in disguise in Mohali. The selectors should now seriously think about dropping a senior each Test and trying out a newcomer. Let us not forget that by 2011 the seniors will be a spent force and it will be too late to look for new talent for the World Cup.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Deep inside ones heart, one may have a preference for somebody that may not be governed entirely by logic or reason. But an open display of such preference in public is ugly. On the first day of the ongoing Mohali Test, when Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly were batting, it appeared from the words of the television commentators as if there was only one batsman on the field  Sachin Tendulkar. I am not a great fan of Ganguly and did not support his outburst against Greg Chappell after he scored a century against Zimbabwe. Even so, I think it is unfair to give the impression that a cricket match can be played with only one batsman on the field.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Why is India afraid to enforce a follow-on? Although India put the Aussies in dire straits (Oct 21) and went on to win the second Test by 320 runs, it squandered a rare chance to inflict an innings defeat on the worlds most arrogant team. It was proof of the lack of confidence and maturity of the stand-in captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Agreed, Dhoni is young, but what were the senior players and coaches doing in the dressing room? Last year at the Oval, Rahul Dravid too refused to impose a follow-on against England, after establishing a first-innings lead of 219 runs. The excuse then was: Our boys need rest. If Indian cricketers are such delicate darlings who cannot bowl or field for two or three days at a stretch, they have no business taking the field.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Indias victory in Mohali will go down in history as one of the finest matches of all time. The second match of the Border-Gavaskar series also probably signalled the beginning of the end of Aussie domination in world cricket. As the Australian captain, Ricky Ponting, observed himself, the Aussies were on the backfoot right from the first day, and never quite got a chance to recover. The Indian battling looks solid, Amit Mishras bowling gives new hope, and with Zaheer Khan, Bhajji and Ishant Sharma all maturing, Team India finally looks set to dismantle the Aussies from the No. 1 position.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I do not understand why Bangalore gets a Test match every season. Isnt there supposed to be a rotation policy in allotting matches? Bangalore is an unlucky venue as far as India is concerned. Not only do we get pitches there that suit the opponents, but Bangalore also is associated with bad umpiring decisions. In the first Test of this series, Ricky Ponting was given not out from a caught-and-bowled, just as last time Michael Clarke had got a century on debut after getting the benefit of doubt on 93. The Australians produce pitches that help their style of play when we tour that country. Why do we try to appease them when they come down to India?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Biswadeep Sinha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Greg Chappell had been appointed assistant coach to the Australian team for the first two Tests in this series. It is believed that the equations among the Aussies and their team spirit have not been the best, very similar to the atmosphere in the Indian dressing room when Chappell was the coach. The net result has been that the Australians could not win the first Test and lost the second one miserably. Pity Cricket Australia did not extend Chappells contract for the remaining two Tests.           
	Yours faithfully,

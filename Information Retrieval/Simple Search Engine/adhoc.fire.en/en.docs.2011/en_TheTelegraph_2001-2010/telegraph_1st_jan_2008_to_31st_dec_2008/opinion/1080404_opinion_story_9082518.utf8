                                                                                                                 GARDEN OF WHITE FLOWERS                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	The exciting and vibrant boom in India is not limited to the area of technology alone, but, more importantly, is active in all the larger, extended cultural spaces where creative pursuits are getting an encouragement they have not received in decades. There is freedom in the air, a freedom of expression  whether on canvas, in the pages of a book, in sculpting, or in making films and innovative music. With that freedom there is also celebration of a new India that is not carrying the baggage of the past six decades. As the State dilutes its interference in private creative endeavours, and with increasing public participation in these activities, creative pursuits are becoming respectable and financially viable once again. This is a purely urban phenomenon with a marginal impact on the cottage industries of India. Indian architecture, however, lags behind in this flowering, if I may use the clich.        
	In Delhi there are more art exhibitions than is possible to visit. Music and dance shows, with a bit of theatre, happen throughout the year and the season, once limited to autumn and winter, now stretches across the year. This year, photography has dominated the Delhi art scene. Photoink, a gallery dedicated to photography, unveils young, new photographers, showcases their work and produces beautiful, high quality books that go with each exhibition. Dayanita Singh, the diva of photography in India, has had two shows in the last six months and the Raghu Rai retrospective is being shown at the National Gallery of Modern Arts. Ram Rahman exhibited his eclectic body of work at the Lalit Kala Akademi, and the early photographs of Umrao Singh Shergill, father of Amrita Shergill, were on display earlier this year. There is action in the art scene. Despite the babu and his suffocating administration, we have to put that art on display!                
	New life        
	Every time I drive past the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, I mourn the fact that our institutions of art and culture have become sleepy, dull, cumbersome giants, stymied by stupid rules and kept alive, but gasping for breath, by retired babus who could not make it to the more lucrative ministries. I have a recurring dream, a dream that could become a reality with ease if there is a real will to resuscitate these near-dead institutions. Publicprivate partnership is the immediate solution.        
	A joint venture, with representatives of the government on the executive board as ex-officio members, would remove the suffocation. The prime locations in which these institutions stand are all owned by the State. Therefore, the only clean way to restore and rejuvenate them is to ask the State to bring in the best and brightest talent from across our subcontinent and the world, people who will fit the job at hand, who are passionate about their profession and who do not simply wait for the next posting! To bring about this overhaul, the government would have to rewrite the existing acts of relevance, put together a comprehensive, intelligent and non-restrictive management plan, get it endorsed by the cabinet and put it to the Parliament. This single, albeit Herculean task, will conserve our past with dignity and ensure freedom of expression for our future.        
	The IGNCA sits on Rajpath, its insides resounding with scary silence. A lone mali tends its unkempt, unpatterned garden. This is unacceptable in a country where the design and nurture of open spaces and gardens were high art once. Imagine the same outer space  lit up every evening, with a char bagh, a fragrant garden of white flowers, with a platform for the performance of music and dance, a restaurant for fine cuisine and a coffee shop, open to all. The insides of the building could hold an exhibition that would be a tribute to a changing, creative and vibrant India.

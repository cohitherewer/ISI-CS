The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | For the love of lost sounds
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FOR THE LOVE OF LOST SOUNDS                                  ARCHIVE FEVER      Are the efforts to digitize and catalogue the Akashvani archives too little and too late?                                                  
	Of all the useful, meaningful and beautiful things that human beings make, sound is the most perishable. The spoken word, song and music enact their dying fall even as they come into being. They are produced by flesh and blood, and are recorded or transmitted by complex machines. Yet human sound is disembodied and ethereal, invisible tremors in the air. This ghostly, and almost tragic, quality of sound struck me most keenly a few days ago when I visited the recording studios, library and archives of Akashvani Bhavan in Calcutta.        
	The most wonderfully maintained archives are a strange mix of beauty and sadness, for they are monuments to how people value the pastness of the past. Think of the Duke Humphreys library at the Bodleian, or Teen Murti Bhavan in Delhi. But Calcuttas great archives  Asiatic Society, National Library, the Calcutta University or Presidency College libraries  often make us feel something sharper and larger than sadness. The neglect, ignorance, red tape and corruption they enshrine provoke shame and rage, rather than wistfulness.        
	The treasures in Akashvani Bhavan make it, beyond doubt, a comparable archive. But the feelings it aroused in me were more complicated. There were the riches on the shelves, mingled with the infectious charm and enthusiasm of some of the people who still work with them. But there is also the feeling, sad in its own way, that the charm goes largely unrecognized and unvalued, and the enthusiasm has to keep itself alive against a world of odds and against a sense of its own irrelevance. This makes the charm and the enthusiasm seem quaint and archaic, the poignant stuff of nostalgia rather than vital elements in a live tradition of entertainment and education. During the two afternoons that I spent in those rooms, I met and talked to two senior announcers and two library information assistants. And as I began to place them, in my own impression of the place, within the hierarchy of the institution, I realized how the vision, experience and skills they embodied had to struggle to make themselves seen, heard and understood by those who make the decisions and policies in higher places. There has to be, above everything else, an informing vision of what an archive means, and of its carefully regulated openness to those who want to access it. This vision must be driven as much by the love of what might irretrievably be lost, the archive fever, as by the practical skills of the archivist in preserving and cataloguing. Such a vision must work against the grain of the notion of a government archive as a restricted place, guarding materials that have to be kept out of the reach of an acquisitive, and therefore untrustworthy, public.         
	Amidst the disorder and dilapidation of Akashvani Bhavans library of books, lie the back issues, going back to the Thirties, of Betaar Jagat  invaluable documents for the history of not only the radio in Bengal, but also of life and culture in India until the mid-Eighties, when the magazine died a sudden death. Flipping randomly through a 1937 issue, I found the transcription of a debate between Sajanikanta Das and Buddhadeva Bose on modern Bengali literature rubbing shoulders with a talk given by Nirad C. Chaudhuri (picture, by Parimal Goswami). In a March 1964 issue, a conversation between Satyajit Ray and Nirmal Chandra Ghosh was followed by a short story by Ashapurna Devi, at the end of which was advertised Uttam Kumars film, Jatugriha. The reading room I was sitting in had a complete set of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. Looking down was a huge, framed immortal century calendar in Bengali, designed by Murari Mohan Manna. This one calendar will last as long as human beings live on earth, it declared.        
	Downstairs among the hushed recording rooms, in which the sweet cacophony of live music being recorded mingled with a deathly, air-conditioned silence, I was shown endless rows of shelves full of taped sound. There was an entire shelf of complete soundtracks of films (my eyes fell on Nayak, Harano Sur, Saptapadi), opposite which sat Satyajit Rays Music I Live By. In one of several Godrej almirahs kept out in the corridor, I saw tapes of other instalments of this programme, with Bishnu De, Lolita and Azim Lewis Mayadas, and Gerald Neil Craig. Then a roomful of Bengali radio plays, Rabindrasangeet, Hindustani classical music listed by artists and ragas, interspersed with interviews of Kumar Prasad Mukherji. And in those almirahs outside, were unplayable lacquer discs made in the Fifties (mostly of British choirs singing in St Pauls Cathedral), illustrated talks on the Sublime in music and on Western music compositions inspired by Tagore. These were presented by the pioneering producer, Bulbul Sarkar, who, with her legendary knowledge of Western classical music, and her equally legendary forgetfulness, must herself be the most brittle of living archives. According to government rules, the Western music collection  rarest of records, tapes, CDs  does not deserve a librarian because there are less than the required 10,000 items in it.        
	Sitting amidst these stores of sound, in a little cell, surrounded by tapes, many of which are inaccessible now because of vanished technology, are two quietly dedicated library information assistants. They have been given carte blanche to choose from more than 10,000 tapes that make up the Akashvani archives, and then to digitize and catalogue them according to their discretion. But they will have to make do with what they have picked up from their decades-old librarianship degrees (which did not cover non-book materials at all). They have not been given any specialized training in archiving sound.        
	As they played me bits from a 1992 interview of Rabi Ghosh that they were working on, they regaled me with a fascinating miscellany of little stories they had picked up from listening to old interviews. But one phrase used by them comes back to me as I write this. They think of their work, as teachers often do, as a noble profession  a labour of love kept up in the face of not only the enormousness of the work itself, but also of the fact that they have begun doing it a little too late.                    AVEEK SEN

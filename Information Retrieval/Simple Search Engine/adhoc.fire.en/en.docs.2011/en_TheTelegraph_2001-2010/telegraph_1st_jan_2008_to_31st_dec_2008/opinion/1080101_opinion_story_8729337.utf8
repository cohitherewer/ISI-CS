	The beginning of a new year is traditionally supposed to mark hope. In a country like India, with its stark polarities, it is always easy to muster hope and its opposite, depending on the perspective that is adopted. There can be no denying that there is a section of the population, varying in number from state to state, which is unaware of the meaning of the word, hope. Their lives and living conditions do not alter with the passing of one year to another. Fatalism has become embedded in their lives. At the other extreme is a section of the population that is buoyant with hope and a sense of achievement. There can be the hope that the sense of well-being and prosperity enjoyed by the second group will begin to trickle down to those who are not so privileged. The point is not without broader implications. Under the impact of the economic reforms that were inaugurated when the present prime minister, Manmohan Singh, was the finance minister, the Indian economy has been booming. There has been the expectation that the effects of this boom will be felt by increasingly larger sections of the people. This has only been partly fulfilled. With forecasts saying that the Indian economy in 2008 may not do as well as it did this year, there is the fear that the economic inequalities will worsen.
    
	In the realm of politics, at least in the beginning of 2008, attention will be focussed on how the present government handles the nuclear deal with the United States of America. The fear is that, given the compulsion of domestic and coalition politics, the government may be forced to renege on the deal. Such an eventuality could easily lead to a plummeting of Indias international prestige as well as of the personal standing of the prime minister. The handling of the deal will be the knotty issue that will demand the best negotiating skills from the governments side both in the relevant international fora and with coalition partners. The outcome could very well determine the future of the government led by Mr Singh. There is thus an element of immediate political uncertainty that does not warrant the rise of too much hope. The year 2008 could turn out to be one of surprises rather than of hope. But predictions in Indian politics have a propensity to go awry. On that tendency rests the hope that events could actually be smoother than are being anticipated here. Uncertainty is the mother of hope.

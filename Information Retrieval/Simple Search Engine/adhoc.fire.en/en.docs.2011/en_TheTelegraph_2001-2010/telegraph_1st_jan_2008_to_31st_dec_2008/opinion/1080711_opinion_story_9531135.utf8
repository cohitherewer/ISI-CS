The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | On The Wrong Foot
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ON THE WRONG FOOT                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The Left finally withdrew its support from the United Progressive Alliance government. The government has insulted us, says Prakash Karat, who suddenly found that a hitherto silent, patient Manmohan Singh, who has absorbed all the bullying and political blackmailing for four long years with a slight smile on his face, had put his foot down finally and played prime minister. Caught on the wrong foot, the leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) loses his cool and composure and lunges out in fury. Karats tantrums and anger at having finally had his bluff called are coming to us all too clearly from across the small screen. His behaviour reflects the abysmal reality of coalition politics in India. The partners are self-serving opportunists who can never reach out to the diverse demands of a many-layered polity with aspirations that go far beyond what the static Left can ever imagine.         
	To compel people to think in your line, which may well be contrary to their personal need and quest, to force them to do your bidding alone, to fit them into an ideological straightjacket are anathema to a people who believe in freedom and democracy, and in a dignity they had struggled for by fighting and ousting a dominant colonial power that had suppressed their spirit. High-handed inflexibility is not something that works in India despite the poverty of the masses and the lack of true empowerment among them. People abhor dictatorial stances. Neither the Left nor the Right has ensured social justice through governance over the last six decades. The State, whether red, saffron, or white, has failed to lay down the foundations of an infrastructure that can deliver the basic dignities of life to the people of this land, rich and poor alike. The privileged classes took the faulty legal system into their own hands, found ways to overcome the obstacles laid on their course by the State, and bettered their lot. The vast majority of the people, neglected and exploited by the politicians and administrators, wallowed in their fate, waiting for whatever trickled down their way from the upper echelons of power.                
	Good politics        
	The Left and the Right, the CPI(M) and the Bharatiya Janata Party, are being seen by the public at large as two faces of the same coin, brothers in arms, as they declare in unison that signing the nuclear deal will be an anti-national act. However, we all know that if the deal is not signed today, it will be kept alive to be signed by the National Democratic Alliance, which will not have the Left stalling its every move and decision. The deal will not die  it will be there regardless of the dispensation that begins in America after the presidential elections. Rather than support the UPA on the deal, the BJP-led NDA, traditional supporters of the United States of America, would want the kudos of signing the nuclear treaty so as to be able to sit at the high table as equals of the Big Brother.         
	What vicarious joy we experience to witness two sharply different political parties voting in tandem on a no-confidence motion against the Congress-led UPA! The veils and masks of the political leaders are being cast aside. Yes, the CPI(M) and the BJP have a common enemy  the Congress  and therefore, it makes sense for them to join forces in the political fight to win over all other democratic groups. A regrouping of this nature is required to revamp the unreal political alignments and make them more honest. This will change the nature of coalitions and hopefully make them more committed towards policies geared to help the people.        
	To sit in Delhi and cry hoarse about wanting to keep communal forces at bay is meaningless. The people of India have to be convinced about what is right and what is wrong. That is what good politics is all about.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SECURE IN DANGER                                                          
	According to Calcuttas women, it is easier to get home safe in the dark after work in their city than anywhere else in India. A recent survey of working women by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry Social Development Foundation found that only 19 per cent of the women questioned felt it was unsafe in Calcutta after dark, whereas a whopping 65 per cent of women in Delhi and 56 per cent in Bangalore suffered from this insecurity. Even Mumbai, once considered one of the safest cities, registered 26 per cent. The result may seem puzzling, given the particularly ugly behaviour that women in Calcutta routinely face in the public space. That includes verbal and physical harassment and forms of violence that may culminate in the murder of an outraged passer-by, as happened, for example, in the death of Bapi Sen. But the survey is really about perceptions of insecurity, rather than a comparative analysis of the statistics of crimes against women in the different cities.        
	An unplanned, over-populated city obviously has its uses. Often, there are just too many people sleeping on the pavement of a major road, or little boys doing the last cleaning up around the small tea-stalls and eating-houses close to midnight for a woman to feel unsafe. Stations, buses and local trains are crowded until late at night, and although women can be victimized easily even then  they have been, repeatedly, many times during the day  perhaps it is possible to feel safe whatever the reality may be. The survey questioned women workers in business process outsourcing and information technology firms, hospitals, airlines and the media. Since there is no indication of income levels or designations, it is not possible to make out how many classes of women workers were questioned. Nurses and ayahs in hospitals travel by bus and train, while stewardesses travel to their night-stop hotel by car. Their experiences cannot possibly be the same. And a micro-survey of perceptions of insecurity among women working in the new, far-flung areas of a spreading Calcutta may yield interesting answers.         
	Whatever the survey may have thrown up, the reality is that Calcutta treats its women badly. It is the institutionalized attitude to crimes against women  it is perfectly normal for the police to turn away victims from their doors  that is perhaps the most alarming. It is only when a woman is without recourse, or is angered or insulted or injured beyond measure that she will go to the police. Her citys attitude to her breeds her avoidance strategies, raises her tolerance levels and lowers her expectations. Thrown upon her own devices, she cultivates her own defences, part of which is smothering fear, so that she can go out to work. No wonder the working woman in Calcutta feels she is comparatively safe; it is better than feeling sorry.

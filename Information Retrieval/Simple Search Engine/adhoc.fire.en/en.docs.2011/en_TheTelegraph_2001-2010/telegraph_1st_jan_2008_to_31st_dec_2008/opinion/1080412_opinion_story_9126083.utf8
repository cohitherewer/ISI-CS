	The righting of historical wrongs can be a long process, especially when the politicians of a country use it as a pretext to create vote banks and heavy pockets. The Supreme Court, by upholding the constitutionality of Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 has now allowed the government to ensure that 27 per cent of seats in higher educational institutions, including the Indian institutes of management and technology, are granted to other backward classes. This is in addition to the reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes already in place. The principle at basis is equality of opportunity. But classrooms are suddenly that much smaller for students of the general category. So, to correct that, all the institutions affected by this judgment will increase their seats by 54 per cent.         
	That may help. But only in terms of space, that is, of numbers. Where excellence is the goal and merit the criterion for admission, will larger classes be able to ensure that students get the same quality of instruction and attention as before? Besides, lowering admission criteria for one half of the class would tend to lower standards anyway. The focus should be on broadening the base and heightening the quality of education in school, so that merit is the sole requirement of entry into the portals of higher education. Incentives and benefits for students from backward groups can be used fruitfully after admission, for education at that level does not come cheap. To balance different and conflicting considerations, the court has made clear that the creamy layer among OBCs is not to benefit from the new law; the qualifications for the creamy layer have also been enumerated. That may help too. Excluding the creamy layer could target the legislation more towards those who really need it. Time-bound monitoring, too, could make the law more meaningful, more inclusive.        
	All this could happen, but given the history of reservations in this country, the courts conditions are likely to open up the way for deliberately created confusions. The idea of affirmative action has been skewed at its fundamentals by making caste the basis of quotas. To bring in socially and educationally backward classes now in an effort to modify the definition of OBCs is a bit like closing the door after the event. If India is to build on and improve its human resources, there should be strict parameters of qualification for the benefits of affirmative action, and caste should not be one of them, certainly not the only one. And in higher education, questions of excellence and merit have to be addressed first. Equal opportunity for backward sections can only be ensured by high-quality education during school years. That all energies are concentrated on special benefits in higher education is itself a signal of the slipperiness inherent in the governments promises of affirmative action.

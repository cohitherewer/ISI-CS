                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             LADY IN THE WINGS                                                    
	The future of Mayavati, the mercurial chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, probably lies in the details of the election results of the states of Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. In none of these states was she or her party, the Bahujan Samaj Party, the star performer. No one expected the BSP to be a contender to form a government in any of the four states. Yet, the performance of the BSP cannot be ignored. In Delhi, to take a remarkable illustration, the BSP did not have a single representative in the outgoing legislative assembly. But in the new one, it will have two. What is even more significant is that the BSP has not only registered an increase in its vote share in Delhi but has also secured 20 to 24 per cent votes in four constituencies. In sheer numerical terms, the BSP has made both its presence and its potential felt in Delhi. Given the specific appeal of the BSP to the Dalits, no political party or political analyst can afford to scoff at the tally of the BSP whose driving force is the chief minister of UP.        
	The success of the BSP extends to Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan as well. In both the states, in terms of vote share and in terms of the number of seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party has improved its position from the previous results. In Chhattisgarh, the number of seats remain at two for the BSP but its vote share has gone up. It is clear that under Ms Mayavati, the support for the BSP is experiencing an expansion. This can be for two reasons. More and more Dalits are coming out to vote; the presence of the BSP and a leader like Ms Mayavati is empowering them to exercise their franchise fearlessly. Some political scientists have described this process as the deepening of Indian democracy. Given the nature of Indian society, this deepening can only lead to more and more Dalits entering political society and sending Ms Mayavati laughing to her vote bank. The other reason is that BSP is slowly but surely eroding the vote banks of both the Congress and the BJP. Many Dalits, who had previously voted in favour of these two national parties, now find the BSP a more sincere representative of their interests and aspirations. It is too early to suggest that Ms Mayavati will be an immediate contender for the prime ministership. But what appears logical is that she will be a crucial player in the near future in the game of coalition politics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Wrinkle wrinkle, little star
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WRINKLE WRINKLE, LITTLE STAR                                  Mick Jagger, just turned 65, is now an old-age pensioner. Time and the youth icon make bizarre bedfellows                                            
	We all know the boy who refuses to grow up. We love his cocky impishness, his talent for practical jokes, that lan with which he says and does all the wrong things. And how, over the years, his cuteness-factor rises higher and higher        
	Apart from the last bit, this brief sketch would have fitted the life and times of Michael Philip Jagger a.k.a. Mick Jagger, recently christened Sir Mick, born 1943, and turned 65 last Saturday. Only, in his case, one would have to make an imaginative pole-vault to conjure up the C-factor. Sir J, the fresh old-age pensioner, is not a pretty sight. Those luscious lips  bullies called him the N-word at school, while fans drooled over them later on  have shrunk, but the shaggy hair remains. His waist-size is an anorexics dream, while the stick-like frame completes the transformation of the Rolling Stones into the Strolling Bones. In real life, this ageing and irascible Peter Pan could bellow mightily, Time is on my side. But Time and rockstars do the strangest bedfellows make. Think of the other MJ, once the undisputed King of Pop, who later turned out to be as much of a hit with the children as with the media. After radical skin treatment and incessant cosmetic surgery, a new school of grotesque was born.        
	Bill Wyman, the former bass player with the Stones, had once called Sir Mick a nice bunch of blokes. Apart from the usual blokes that peep out of Jagger  who prefer to communicate in double entendres, are fiendishly carnal and cruel  there are some new avatars who have become more popular these days: you can see them at a polo match, at the cricket ground, or hobnobbing with the rich and the famous. The music is still quite powerful, but the myth has submerged it. What remains unforgettable is the early and middle-period Stones, not the plangent abjection of Laugh, I nearly died of A Bigger Bang (2005).        
	Speaking of Peter Pan again, has anyone ever heard of a girl who refused to grow up? Such wishes appear to be the exclusive privilege of men. Showbiz has no use for women who behave like spoilt little brats: they better have the girl-next-door charm, as in the pre-boob-job Mariah Carey, or else be sexual enchantresses in the Fallen Barbie Doll mode, like Madonna. Jazz and the Blues offer a different form of divahood, but something like Ella Fitzgerald at 74 in the Carnegie Hall or Billy Holidays last recordings are unlikely to happen again. And Amy Winehouse, with her Billyesque huskiness, sells for reasons that go beyond vocal prowess. The Material Girls either burn out, like Janis Joplin, or turn into Mama Madonna with her tottering marriage, three kids, and music that sounds all synthetic.

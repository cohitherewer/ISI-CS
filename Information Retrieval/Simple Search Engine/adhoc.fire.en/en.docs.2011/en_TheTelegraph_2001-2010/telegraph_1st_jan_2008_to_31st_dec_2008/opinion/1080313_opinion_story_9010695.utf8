The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | What computer classes dont teach
                                                                                                                 WHAT COMPUTER CLASSES DONT TEACH                                  The internet and the mobile phone raise issues of access and connectivity that trouble the State, and exclude as much as they enable                                            
	When I pointed to my computer and asked our cooks little son, Raju, to tell me what it is, he gave me the correct answer. He then explained to me that a computer is actually a TV with real people in it who write back if you write to them. Raju is eight and goes to a government school in our neighbourhood. His sister is twelve, goes to the same school, tops her class, attends computer classes in school, but could not tell me if her school computer was connected to the internet. Their mother, who does not go out to work, has stopped studying after clearing her Uchcha Madhyamik, and has never used a computer. Their father is a cyber-literate arts graduate. Apart from cooking for us, he works in a college of commerce and business administration, processing student records on the computer. They all live in the outhouse to our home. The children often watch films with my parents on my computer, and Raju loves to watch me as I write.        
	Their original home is Dubda in the East Midnapore district. It is a village that has a number of good schools. (One student from the village made it to America, and has set up the rest of his family with their own shops in the village.) But few paras in this large village have electricity, and that too fitfully. And until recently, the roads were bad, virtually cutting the village off from everywhere else. The district towns  Tamluk, Kanthi, Egra  are the only places where the people of Dubda can find, and teach themselves to use, computers. Many of the villagers have mobile phones though. Those who have phones but no electricity take their phones to electrified shops or neighbours to get them charged.         
	Even this rudimentary sketch of an upwardly-mobile, rural Indian family makes us think about access and connectivity in concrete, yet complex ways. The links between computers and development are grounded in the most material aspects of existence, inseparable from the basic questions of schools, employment, electricity and roads. Yet, the less tangible fundamentals of life are also integral to access and connectivity, and to the ordinary  and less than ordinary  Indians experience of these things. Computers, and what they stand for, are tied up with questions of imagination and desire, a persons sense of what may be visualized as possible in life, and hence with notions of agency, change and freedom, in solitude and in society.         
	What is it, therefore, that the internet gives us access to? What are we connected to when we have connectivity? And how do we make sense of what might happen to our lives, in themselves and in relation to other lives, if we have this access and this connectivity? Equally, how do we, once we have imagined or known this, experience the actuality of not having this access and connectivity? In all this, what is at stake is not only a privately experienced personhood, but also the extent to which a person has the material and intellectual resources to imagine and intuit a public sphere.        
	This sphere is a whole universe of information, knowledge and practice, relationships and hierarchies, obligations and entitlements, rights and responsibilities, from the most personal to the most political, that both controls, and is controlled by, our individual and collective agencies. It is only when that leap is made  from technical training to a systematic education into the public sphere  that computers and the internet become part of the living infrastructure of democracy. Cyber-literacy, like any other form of literacy, does not magically lead to the reflexes and habits of democracy. It is only through a complete rethinking of pedagogy  of how and what we teach when we teach computers, of who we (the teachers) and they (the students) are  that forms of technology become vehicles of conscious human agency.         
	For a while, at least, there can be no uniformity in this enhanced and supplementary pedagogy. The rural poor and the urban middle-class will have to be taught computers very differently. What HIV/AIDS has done for social attitudes to sexuality, and therefore to the teaching of life-skills education, the cyber-revolution has done for technical education in India: open up the question of hygiene or skills to the values and realities that make up the politics of everyday life, shaking up the very foundations of society and the polity. Life-skills and computer classes work with, and upon, the same diversity of human material, inflected by the same inequalities, exclusions, prejudices and faultlines. So, in the larger vision of things, they cannot afford to be separate pedagogies, and would lead, through the hard practicalities of education, to very similar engagements with social justice.        
	Raju was right. Somewhere behind every bit of text, image and sound that make up our virtual worlds is a real human body and mind. Yet, as a medium, the internet gives us the capacity to become disembodied agents, freeing ourselves, for a while, from the common markers and constraints of human identity to become everything and nothing. This is a peculiar kind of freedom  virtual, in that it allows, even feeds on and sharpens, the real worlds abiding unfreedoms.                    AVEEK SEN

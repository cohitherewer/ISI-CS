The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A New Future waits 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             A NEW FUTURE WAITS                                   Malvika Singh                              
	A severe winter has descended on Kashmir but this year the biting cold has brought a sense of warmth and a fresh zing of hope to the troubled, tortured and traumatized valley. Enough is enough is writ on the faces of men and women, old and young, who form the endless, snaking lines to the polling booths across the most stunning and extraordinary paradise on earth. People are out there in large numbers to exercise their right to vote and elect individuals whom they trust to rule them. There is a lurking truth in the speculation that Kashmiris are sick of the Hurriyat, the separatists, the para military and armed forces, as well as the local police. They are equally clear that they do not want to be governed under the fiat of the presidents rule imposed by New Delhi. Becoming part of Pakistan has ceased to be an option for most. Kashmir appears to be asserting its status as a state of the Indian Union, looking forward to electing its own democratic government within the federal structure.         
	In recent years, there had been some dialogue and movement towards peace till the governor of Jammu and Kashmir, S.K. Sinha, lit a cracker that produced much angst and discord. Weary of boycott calls and the lack of initiative for restoring normal life, annoyed and exhausted with the internal, militant struggle for power within the Hurriyat, betrayed by the fact that a new generation of young men and women looking forward to a productive future is being denied the human freedom to dream, aspire and make a full and happy life for itself, Kashmiris have decided to determine their own future through the ballot box. And, three cheers for that. The process for change has started. Now it is for the government of India in Delhi to ensure that dignity is restored and faith is renewed.                
	Silver lining        
	In a very heartening way, the ruthless assault on Mumbai has resulted in an immediate coming together of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and all the other communities and sects which are an intrinsic part of the whole that is India. The ghastly act united us all, and alienated the political parties and dispensations that have polarized the polity. Because of our firmly entrenched pluralism, India and its people rally when the chips are truly down and can be a strong, united detterent to the forces of extremism operating illegitimately across the world, particularly in the extended region of our own country. It is becoming increasingly clear that Kashmir has ceased to be a critical issue for Pakistan. For the Pakistanis, their ravaged frontier with Afghanistan is the immediate priority  an issue that merits full attention. India needs to comprehend the changed reality and reach a decision on the Kashmir-Pakistan conflict. The moment has come to solve this nagging problem with the aid of some sharp, clear, out-of-the-box thinking. Old and archaic strategic perceptions must be abandoned for creative solutions.        
	Often, when you hit the rock bottom, and all kinds of insurmountable horrors seem to overwhelm the public and private spaces, there appears a silver lining on the distant horizon, a neon light that signals a new beginning. Looking back into the recent past, one realizes that it was the demolition of the Babri Masjid which ushered in the terrible period of divisive politics that may well have ended with the attack on Mumbai. This is an opportune moment for a liberal political party to reassert its mandate and establish new ethics of governance. India is crying out desperately for the cleansing of a corrupt system that exploited the people for the benefit of the few in power. An emphatic call to rise out of the quagmire of vote bank politics will enable the people to lift their heads high once again and to aspire for a better future. We need to liberate India and Bharat from the clutches of those who have failed us.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DEALING WITH SUBSIDIES                              Commentarao      S.L. Rao                        Results first				                                       
	Subsidies have been the albatross around the necks of finance ministers, from Manmohan Singh in 1991 to P. Chidambaram today. These have constrained the freedom to invest in agriculture and in infrastructure, both physical and social. This has resulted in increased inequalities in sectoral growth in the economy. Chidambaram produced a paper to show the insidious effects of subsidies. Yet he, like his prime minister, has been unable to take any corrective action.        
	First, some definitions. Between public and private goods, the consumption of public goods by individuals does not reduce their availability for others, and consumption by different people cannot be identified (for instance, defence or law and order). With private goods, the consumer is identifiable and the extent of consumption is measurable. Subsidies are unrecovered costs of public provision of private goods. They could be on merit and non-merit goods and services, given to consumers, or producers of inputs, and on production and sales by public enterprises. Merit goods are those that must be available to all, whether rich or poor. Water is an example. Non-merit goods are those that are used by all classes of consumers, those who can afford to pay at cost or well above cost and those who cannot (cloth, fuels, fertilizers, and so on).        
	How may paid-subsidies be reimbursed from government revenues, or cross-subsidized? Cross-subsidies require some consumers to pay higher prices so that others can be supplied these things below cost or even free.                    
	State governments also give subsidies  on electricity, drinking water, irrigation waters, groundwater and so on. They do so by selling well below cost to serve, and allow rampant theft, leakage and wastage.         
	Low prices stimulate consumption. For example, cheap or free electricity to farmers, used to draw groundwater, makes farmers use more water on unsuitable soil, grow water-intensive crops, leading to land degradation. But no Central or state government or Union finance minister has acted to moderate subsidies.         
	None of the poverty schemes has been able to target beneficiaries of subsidized products and services. These are procured, stored and physically given to beneficiaries. There is considerable diversion and waste of subsidized products. Bureaucratic procedures result in poor quality and inefficient delivery. Last year, the finance minister introduced a pilot project as alternative and this year, it has been forgotten.        
	Physical procurement, handling and distribution of foodgrains, edible oils and kerosene and the consequent corruption have led to millions of bogus ration cards. Yet, millions of the very poor do not get the cheap rations meant for them. Subsidized goods are diverted to the market. For example, 40 per cent of rationed kerosene is estimated to be used by transporters for the adulterating of diesel.        
	Subsidies add to inflationary pressures by increasing government deficits. They divert government revenues. Thus, writing off farmer loans takes money away from capital investment for agriculture. Public health and education lose out when revenues are spent on subsidies. Yet, Chidambaram has proceeded with a massive write-off of bank loans to farmers. This will jeopardize future bank loans. Being a purely short-term action, it is of no help in improving agricultural production or productivity.         
	Economic services like supporting distressed people during calamities are not subsidies. Nor are merit economic services like soil and water conservation, environmental protection, forestry and wildlife, agricultural research and education, flood control and drainage, roads and bridges, space research, oceanographic and other scientific research, ecology, environment and meteorology and so on. Similarly, merit services like elementary education, public health, sewerage and sanitation, information and publicity, welfare of scheduled castes and tribes and other backward classes, labour, special food for pregnant and lactating mothers, social welfare and nutrition are not subsidies.        
	Subsidized non-merit goods require those who can afford to pay to be excluded from subsidized supplies. These include foodgrains, edible oils, cloth, electricity, kerosene. Subsidies on non-merit goods are over five times the value of those on merit goods. Merit goods deserve subsidies; not non-merit goods. No finance minister has had the courage to change it.        
	We also subsidize public enterprises but know only about government grants to meet their deficits. Subsidies like price preference (buyers paying a higher price on purchases), subsidized loans, poor or nil dividends on capital given by government from borrowed funds, are not disclosed.        
	Subsidies can help introduce new technologies by enabling a build-up of demand, or help the poor. Even such subsidies must be designed for easy administration and collection, given to producers and not to consumers. Subsidies should be related to production of the desired product or service, not mere installation of plant and machinery. Solar panels, fuel cells, wind power turbines and windmills deserve subsidies at the outset to generate volume and create viable markets. But they must, after some capacity is built, be given on generation of electricity. Windmills continue to be incentivized on investment and not electricity generation.                    
	Expenditure on major subsidies has been rising at both Central and state levels. Subsidy reforms demand the minimum on non-merit goods, and investment instead of subsidies so that production and productivity increase. Stamps to the beneficiaries instead of physical supplies of goods like electricity are a better way. Minimizing cross-subsidies, subsidizing producers instead of consumers, and targeting the deserving while eliminating the undeserving from benefits, will make subsidies more effective and efficient. Whichever the method, subsidies will always be subject to abuse since they go against the usual supply-demand-price relationships.         
	None of this is new. The finance minister knows it. Yet he has been unable to act decisively to reform subsidies.

	After seven years of bargaining and discussions, often heated, negotiators from over 30 countries finally confessed that they were unable to come to an agreement on a global trade pact. This should not come as a surprise to anyone. Indeed, ever since the talks started in Doha in 2001, the negotiations have been very fractious and contentious. Developing countries have accused the developed countries of being completely insensitive about the welfare of the poor, while developed countries have accused the rest of the world of being greedy.        
	The Doha Development Round was initiated by the World Trade Organisation and its objective was to lower trade barriers around the world. Is this a worthwhile goal? If it is, should we be unhappy that the talks have ground to a halt?        
	The lowering of trade barriers is, of course, only a means to an end  that of promoting free trade. A basic proposition of economic theory is that free trade enhances the welfare of the world as a whole. A somewhat nave interpretation of this proposition would seem to suggest that all countries must now regret the latest developments  the failure of the negotiators to come to an agreement. Like all nave interpretations, this one too is a trifle simplistic.        
	Perhaps a simple analogy will help to clarify the situation. Think of the developed bloc as one giant country  the North, and the developing bloc as another single country  the South. In the initial or status quo situation, the two giant countries set high tariffs (or give high rates of subsidy to domestic industries) and the sum of the national incomes in the two countries is small.               
	The status quo can be changed in different ways. In Scenario I, the North can effect relatively high rates of reduction in their tariffs while the South cuts tariffs by a much smaller rate. Scenario II involves the South taking the lead in tariff reduction. In both scenarios, it is very likely that the volume of trade between the two countries will go up because protective barriers have been lowered. Suppose also that consistent with the thesis, Free trade maximizes world welfare, both scenarios result in an increase in the sum of national income in the two countries. But does this mean that national income in the South must go up in Scenario II? This is not necessarily true. If industries in the South are relatively inefficient, then the reduction in tariffs may result in a flood of imports. Sales, and hence profits of industries in the South, may well go down, leaving the country poorer. Of course, the Souths loss in national income is more than compensated by the increase in incomes in the North.        
	Similarly, the North may suffer in Scenario I. The moral of the analogy is that a movement towards free trade is not necessarily beneficial to all countries  some countries may have to suffer losses if they have to depart too far from the status quo level of tariffs. Often, the losses may be restricted to specific sectors in a country with other groups profiting from the move. For instance, a lowering of protective barriers in agriculture may hurt the interests of domestic farmers, but improve the welfare of domestic consumers who gain through lower food prices.        
	On the other hand, it is also true that all countries can gain from a movement towards free trade if tariff reductions and other departures from the status quo situation are spread evenly across all countries. However, perceptions in individual countries become important  each country must feel that it is not making unilateral concessions or sacrifices, which are much larger than those made by other countries. If this happens, then the only outcome is the failure to reach agreement.        
	There were essentially three main issues on which negotiations were taking place in the current round of talks  liberalization of trade in services, agriculture and industrial goods. The United States of America and the European Union had agreed to reduce the subsidies they give to their farmers in order to reduce trade distortions. In return, they wanted greater access to markets for manufactured products in the developing countries. The developing countries, apparently led by Brazil, agreed to a formula that would have meant average cuts of roughly 50 per cent in industrial tariffs.        
	But there was a catch. The agreement drafted by the WTO director general contained a clause under which countries could identify some special products that would not be subject to cuts in the level of protection. The special safeguards mechanism, which was a demand made by the developing countries, would allow countries to raise tariffs in the event of a sudden surge in imports of key agricultural crops such as rice, sugar and cotton. Apparently, the terms for the operation of this mechanism demanded by Kamal Nath were unacceptable to the US. This precipitated the breakdown of the talks.         
	There is no doubt that Kamal Nath has scored a significant political victory. He has demonstrated  and on a giant global scale  that the United Progressive Alliance government can follow independent policies; that it can stand up to the US. This blunts one of the main accusations of the Left parties against the nuclear deal  that it would force the Indian government to become subservient to the US. But what has been the price of this victory? Was his hard stance influenced by domestic political compulsions? Certainly, the opposition parties would have flayed him if he had made any concessions. The economic costs and benefits are less clear.              
	Multilateral bargaining under the auspices of the WTO has some undeniable advantages, particularly for the smaller developing countries. It allows the small countries to form groups and so improve their bargaining power. Under bilateralism, the small countries are at the mercy of the large, developed countries, which have substantial bargaining power. There is firm evidence from the past that the richer countries have profited from bilateralism in the form of favourable terms of trade vis--vis the poorer countries. But, of course, the Chinese and Indian economies are now very large in terms of absolute size. So, they can now flex their muscles just as effectively as the US or the European Union. In other words, countries like India, China and Brazil need not fear the consequences of bilateralism any longer. Perhaps, Kamal Nath and his advisers took this into account when they adopted a tough bargaining posture. This suggests that India may be guilty of leaving the smaller developing countries to face the consequences of bilateralism. To the extent that virtually all countries act to protect their own narrow interests, the Indian action is consistent with this norm. We may be guilty, however, of double standards when we accuse the developed countries of being insensitive to the needs of the poor.

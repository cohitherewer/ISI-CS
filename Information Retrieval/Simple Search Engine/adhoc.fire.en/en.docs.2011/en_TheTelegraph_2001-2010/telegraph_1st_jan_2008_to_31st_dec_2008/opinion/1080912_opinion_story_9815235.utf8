	A divide that isnt            
	Savage Humans And Stray Dogs: A Study in Aggression (Sage, Rs 295) by Hiranmay Karlekar starts off with the mass killing of stray dogs in Bangalore and elsewhere in Karnataka in 2007. The Bangalore Mahanagara Palike or Bangalore Municipal Corporation launched its Operation Dog Hunt after two children in separate incidents were reportedly mauled to death by stray dogs. Hundreds of dogs were culled in a matter of days, with the authorities sometimes picking up pet dogs as well. Nobody bothered to make sure whether the dogs being killed were really dangerous or not. As non-humans, dogs obviously did not deserve a second thought and they could be butchered with impunity. Karlekar shows how much of the mass slaughter went against the directives of the World Health Organization. In the second part of the book, Karlekar examines the grounds for assuming the superiority of human beings over animals. Citing instances from ancient and modern literature, he shows how the divide between the two species is one that isnt. He also analyzes the psychological dimensions of the human tendency to find cruelty funny or to damn the Other by demonizing it. Karlekar comes to the conclusion that the line between Nazis exterminating Jews and men murdering dogs is thin. This is an intense and sincere work, evidently inspired by Karlekars deep love for dogs and the resultant indignation at their slaughter.                        
	Doctors From Hell: The Horrific Account of Nazi Experiments on Humans (Jaico, Rs 395) by Vivien Spitz is, as evident from the title, Auschwitz revisited. If you think that the horrific history should better be left buried, Elie Wiesel in the Foreword reminds you of the impossibility of forgetting it, since it keeps repeating itself  in Communist Russia or in Guantnamo. Nazi doctors had the best of reasons for carrying out the most inhuman experiments on the inmates of the concentration camps. They were helping the Third Reich get rid of the useless mouths while creating a better future for the worthy lot. And so they removed parts from bodies for experiments in transplantation or defleshed the inmates to collect their skeletons. The book ends with the Nuremberg Trials and a warning to remember the lessons of history.                                   
	Freedoms Child: Growing Up During Satyagraha (Puffin, Rs 199) by Chandralekha Mehta is like listening to the stories of Indias freedom struggle right from the horses mouth. Chandralekha Mehta is the daughter of Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit and the niece of Indias first prime minister. Her childhood was spent in Anand Bhawan in Allahabad  the hub of the momentous events shaping the future of the Indian republic. By virtue of their birth, Mehta, her siblings and her cousins were privileged, and yet they were like any other kid in the loneliness they suffered when their loved ones went away  to prison, in their case. There are some beautiful photographs accompanying the account of times long over, seen through the eyes of a young girl.                
	Are you Your Own Worst Enemy?: The Nine Inner Strengths You Need To Overcome Self-defeating Tendencies at Work (Macmillan, Rs 295) by Charles E. Watson and Thomas A. Idinopulos includes such invaluable instructions as the one to remove your hat when you are inside a building, or, If you are a man and you are talking with a woman, look her in the eye. Dont stare at her chest. The book guarantees that if you can turn your Inner Caveman  who is passive, lazy, needy, tending to blame others for his faults  towards useful ends then the foe inside will be vanquished and you will go whistling to work.

                 Dance - Aveek Sen
                         
	In Fellinis E la nave va (And The Ship Sails On, 1983), Pina Bausch, then in her early forties, is the blind Principessa Lherimia. Fellinis great burlesque of Italian opera unfolds on board a luxury liner, where a motley crowd of brilliant, mad Europeans gathers to scatter the ashes of their friend, a legendary diva, in the sea. As the tense, fine, birdlike principessa sits down at the banquet in the ships dining hall, and the exquisite dishes succeed one another, their aroma mixing with the music of the orchestra, she closes her unseeing eyes and breaks out into ecstatic mutterings: Ultramarine, blue, red Taste, smell, music and emotions mingle in her rhapsodic vision of pure colours. 
    
	This is a banquet of the senses, made tragicomic by blindness, death and opera. And while the guests feast, reminisce and rhapsodize, a seagull gets trapped in the dining-hall and flaps about everywhere, frantic with terror. The guests learn soon after that they are sharing the ship with a mob of Serbian refugees and a lovesick rhino. Fellini recalls serving an actual gourmet meal to his actors while shooting the scene, because he wanted to capture the truth of how the rich eat: The rich eat very slowly. They never have to worry about shortages. They are more concerned about how they look while chewing.
    
	The colours, the franticness and the chewing were all there in Bamboo Blues, choreographed by Bausch for the Tanztheater Wuppertal-Pina Bausch (Rabindra Sadan, January 18 and 19). What Bausch gave her Indian audiences was a banquet as well  of dancing, beauty and shapeliness that was of an order of physical perfection seldom encountered here. Yet, in spite of the exquisitely confected lyricism and melancholy of this piece, something seemed, quite as beautifully, to be missing. 
    
	Perhaps what was missing was the presence of Bausch herself on stage. Her fragile, yet whip-like frame, together with her gaunt, inwardly-lit face, embodies a fusion of motion and emotion that goes straight to the viewers deepest reserves of feeling and memory. Her expressiveness is always a struggle rather than an achievement, giving her performances an inexpressibly moving edge of difficulty and of pain. This is what makes Caf Mller a theatre of endlessly rehearsed collapse and rescue: men and women in a wilderness of chairs, performing their compulsion to repeat to Didos pristinely sorrowing aria in Purcells Fairy Queen. 
    
	Bamboo Blues uses this language of obsessive-compulsive repetition, particularly in exploring relationships between, and within, the sexes. But the apparent effortlessness with which these young dancers carry the perfection of their looks, clothes, hair and movements, the fluid range and pleasurableness of the accompanying music, and the minimal elegance and lightness of the visual design inform the piece with a weightless and flawless loveliness, which is unfailingly delightful, occasionally wistful, startling or moving, yet leaves one with a curious feeling of anti-climax. It is a bit like preparing oneself to see Peter Brooks Mahabharata (also created, like Bamboo Blues, after travelling extensively in India), and being treated to Nol Coward instead.
    
	I often found myself wanting to forget that this piece is about  a response to  India. This happened especially while being asked to savour the fragrance of cinnamon, or during the Bollywood (or Tollywood) number, which has become an obligatory element in any Western representation of India. Yet, when the cow-women gather for their stately chewing, when the men come in an endless line folding up their veshtis, when a woman keeps running desperately up to a man to be left behind by him, over and over again, in his self-absorbed indifference, when two men spin around together in a tense, awkward and fitful show of tenderness, when a woman slowly washes herself on the street in the early-morning mist, when a line of tiny European dancers crawl slowly beneath the feet of giant Chhou dancers, or when a petite goddess dances with little bulbs around her limbs, then the mirror Bausch holds up to a familiar world catches something in it that is suddenly beautiful, strange or disquieting.
    
	The structure of Bamboo Blues allows the eye, teased or tormented with repetition, to move towards a final vision of formal circularity. This is like a series of musical variations returning, Bach-like, to the original melody from which it started out, but the melody is now irreversibly altered and deepened. The girl in pink, dancing alone in front of an immense, white expanse of billowing cloth, like a child in a field of kaash, is such an image of original simplicity. A figure of pure dance, it is with her that the piece begins and ends: O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,/ How can we know the dancer from the dance?

	There were some that hoped, but in the end, they were not surprised. The governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Y.V. Reddy, did the expected: he did not reduce the policy interest rates, maintaining the central banks current monetary policy stance and making no changes to the present regime in the third quarter review of the monetary policy for 2007-08. The day before, the RBI released a report on macroeconomic and monetary developments for the third quarter that set the stage for this policy review. That report was also along expectations: slightly slower economic growth, some concern about the widening trade deficit  in fact, non-oil imports have grown faster than oil imports, suggesting that investment demand is on the rise  and capital flows, but with a fair degree of certainty that there was no bad economic news. As in the review of the second quarter, the RBIs stance is broadly in line with those of most central banks around the world, except of course the United States of America. While the US Federal Reserve Board cut rates last week  and is widely expected to do so again tomorrow  the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and those of the major emerging markets have all stayed firm on not cutting rates. The rationale for that action is the same for all of them: worries about inflation.
    
	In Mr Reddys statement, there was a change evident in two things: the tone and emphasis of this policy review. The review was particularly hawkish-sounding on inflation. Allowing that the inflationary situation was comfortable, he was at pains to point out that inflationary expectations are still oriented towards higher prices. Energy and food prices have been high  but the consumer has largely been protected because of the higher costs not being passed on. But food, metal and other commodity prices, along with oil prices have been rising, both here and in the rest of the world: in other words, the spectre of global inflation lurks on the horizon. Given the RBIs conservatism and caution on inflation, this hawkish tone is not out of place. That said, the policy statement also emphasizes the RBIs willingness to act quickly and change its stance if circumstances so warrant.
    
	For perhaps the first time in years, the central bank has talked about the impact of recent events on employment, particularly in labour-intensive industries; rupee appreciation and the decline in exports, both of merchandise and services may have an impact on employment in some of these industries. The policy statement suggests that given how well the banks have been doing on profitability, delivering credit where it is needed should perhaps become a priority for them. Arthur Burns, former chairman of the Fed, was fond of saying that his job was to take the punch bowl away when the party got going. Mr Reddy is not putting his back on the table  not just yet.

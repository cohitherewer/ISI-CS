	Right practice   
	 An individual who took the examination for recruitment as sub-inspector wanted to scrutinise his answer script later as he smelt corruption in the procedure. The Gauhati High Court upheld his right to see the script. The Manipur Police Department challenged the order saying that it would entitle all applicants to this right. The Gauhati High Court disagreed, saying that the right to know was a part of the right to freedom of speech and expression. The applicant did not have to give a reason for his request under the provisions of the Right to Information Act. The court also observed that this would ensure greater transparency and fairness. (State of Manipur vs Chief Information Commissioner)   
	Equality rules        
	 Four employees of a municipal corporation were seen trying to open a drain. They, along with two abettors, had a criminal case filed against them. Though they were acquitted, during a departmental enquiry, five of them were suspended. And the corporation commissioner dropped charges against one of them. At the Industrial Tribunal the commissioner argued that the charges were dropped because the person happened to be the president of the corporations employees union and therefore deserved special treatment. The tribunal held that all of them ought to have been treated equally. The Bombay High Court too said that any discrimination would amount to unfair labour practice.

	Absolute loss        
	 After an accident, the driver of a tanker had to have a leg amputated from the knee joint. Determining that there had been a 100 per cent loss in his earning capacity, the commissioner for Workmens Compen-sation awarded compensation to him accordingly. When the insurance company appealed, the Karnataka High Court upheld the medical evidence that had estimated the loss at 65 per cent. The Supreme Court, however, held that the amputation made the workman incapable of work and disqualified him from getting a driving licence under the Motor Vehicles Act. It said that the commissioner had rightly assessed the loss as 100 per cent. (K. Janardhan vs United India Insurance Co. Ltd. and Another)

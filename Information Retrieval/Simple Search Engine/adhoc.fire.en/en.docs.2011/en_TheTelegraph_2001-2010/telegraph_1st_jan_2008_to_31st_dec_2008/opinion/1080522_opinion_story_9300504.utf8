The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Between trips and leaks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       BETWEEN TRIPS AND LEAKS                                  The dark days of the Eighties are past, but the power scene in Bengal is still ruled by politics and conflicting voices, writes Sreyashi Dastidar                                            
	Some pictures which had acquired a sepia tint in the collective memory of West Bengal came back to us this summer. These pictures were of young boys and girls preparing for, and some of them later taking, their board exams in candlelight. Two new frames got added to the album. The first was of the Raj Bhavan standing like a haunted house against the backdrop of blinking city lights. The second one had the Eden Gardens at the centre, looking like an expensive film set struck by an anti-climactic spell of darkness. But to say that West Bengal is facing a serious power problem is both premature and incorrect. Or so say the representatives of the power establishments of the state.         
	One of the first arguments in defence is the Central Electricity Authoritys figures for the period between April 2007 and March 2008 which show West Bengal to be one of the lowest-deficit states in terms of electricity. States like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have fared far worse than Bengal, though a smaller state like Orissa has gained an edge over it. Another favoured exercise is to point at the gulf between the Central governments projected and actual capacity additions in the power sector under the five-year plans. Statistics from 8th, 9th and 10th plans reveal that new generation units have never managed to produce more than 54 per cent (8th plan) of the amount of electricity projected. Needless to say, West Bengal, along with the other states, has had to share the power that was never generated.              
	Both the above arguments make sense. As does the analogy with the United States of America, which can afford to build power-plants capable of generating almost double the amount of electricity than the estimated national demand. To do something similar in our considerably poorer country would not only be difficult  with the dwindling and expensive resources of coal and water  but would also mean transferring the added cost of production to the consumers. One is even willing to buy the Big-Brother-is-unfair argument that since government policy does not encourage foreign players in the power sector, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, the monopoly supplier, can get away with failing to meet its supply targets.         
	But all this would still not explain the retro fashion in which long power cuts, associated with the Hopeless Eighties in Bengal, have come back with a vengeance to the state, as if to mock at the governments rhetoric of industrial resurgence. From March, most parts of the state, including Calcutta, have suffered power-outages of varying durations almost every day. Some colleges in Calcutta have even installed solar power panels to reduce their dependence on state-supplied power. And yet, it took a power cut at the Eden Gardens and the governors decision to go without electricity for two hours every day for the alarming state of affairs to hit the headlines. Changing priorities of the public domain, perhaps? Or is the weapon of protest losing its popularity among the people of Bengal?        
	Of course, there are the usual glib arguments doing the rounds  globalization leads to increase in disposable income among the middle classes which leads to a huge rise in the sale of air-conditioners, which leads to power demand beyond expectations, and so on. Is it fair to ask a man to forego air-conditioned comfort if he can afford it? If moderation is the key, then whose responsibility is it to carry out public interest campaigns? There are the essential misconceptions  for instance, that power cuts do not always happen because of power shortage, some are the result of tripped lines, boiler tube leaks, and other such technical snags.         
	To talk about power cuts in Calcutta and its surrounding areas is also to get into the murky details of the never-ending game of one-upmanship between the privatized CESC Ltd and the state-owned West Bengal State Electricity Board (now the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Corporation Limited). The RPG-owned CESC, which supplies electricity to Greater Calcutta and has over two million domestic and commercial consumers, is able to generate about 975 MW of its average daily demand of 1,500 MW through its own power stations. The remainder is imported  mainly from the WBSEDCL. While claiming to meet the CESCs requirements almost always, the WBSEDCL grudges CESCs defaulting ways and suspects the latter of selling power even at the cost of keeping parts of the city in darkness. Even the state power minister, Mrinal Bandyopadhyay, did not let go of a chance to take a dig at CESC, blaming its poor infrastructure for the recent spate of power cuts in Calcutta.        
	If the CESC does not care to spend on infrastructure, then there is no reason to think that the state electricity board does. Take the case of the Sagardighi power plant in Murshidabad. The newly-commissioned 300 MW plant ran into technical problems and stopped functioning soon after it started operation in March this year. The regularity with which units in Kolaghat, Bakreswar, Santaldih go out of order, and the perennially low stocks of coal to run the plants cannot be the markers of a well-maintained system. Whether the state body or the private player is a bigger delinquent is one of the great unresolvables of Bengals public life.        
	It is true, nonetheless, that West Bengal is well-off enough on the power front to sell electricity to other states. On May 9, The Telegraph reported that the state is a net exporter (meaning that the quantum of power sold is greater than what is bought) of power even as it languishes near the bottom of the table in rural electrification. Just how irrelevant is a discussion on power cuts to people in a state where electricity has not reached more than 20.3 per cent of the villages (when the national average is 43.5 per cent)? In response to the report, the additional chief secretary, department of power, wrote in to say that the export of power and rural electrification are not necessarily connected. He was right insofar as he argued that selling the surplus power generated during the off-peak hours of the day is a prudent option, for it is not possible to store the surplus away for leaner periods. It was the additional chief secretarys claim to reach a position of no unelectrified rural mouzas in the state within June this year that rang patently untrue.               
	I checked with the lady who comes to clean and wash at my house. Her village is in South 24 Parganas, an hours distance from Calcutta. Her family has a TV and a DVD player, as do many others in her village, but their evening entertainment is battery-powered. It has been nearly 20 years since electric poles were planted, and every year the village waits to get lucky. The wires have all been stolen, and many of the poles destroyed by the forces of nature, so the lucky day might still be some years away. A resident of the nearby Arunnagar village has an interesting theory to offer. The panchayat pradhan and upa-pradhan in her village belong to rival parties, and that is why, she claims, the coming of electricity to the village keeps getting stalled. She hopes that this years panchayat elections will throw up office-bearers from the ruling party, so that she can finally light an electric bulb in her home. A young man from an East Midnapore village, which got electricity only last year, says, If you want power in your village, vote CPI(M). Otherwise the connection will stop at your neighbourhood haat and progress no further. The formula has evidently worked in his village.        
	One wonders whether power department bureaucrats have the power to deal with the power-politics in Bengals villages. But many of them can see the shape of things to come, and the picture is not terribly hope-inspiring. Heres why. The power-supply projections for the coming years have factored in industrial investors like Jindal, who will be building power-generation units for their own use. Most of them have promised to give (read sell) the surplus power from their plants  anything between 300 and 500 MW  to the state to meet the rising demand for electricity. What if the private units cannot, or do not, deliver? Does the states power development corporation have a Plan B ready if, or when, that happens?

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             LAGGING BEHIND                                                    
	It does not require a great deal of number-crunching to establish that higher education in most of West Bengals districts is in a sorry state. But the statistics endorse this fact as well. The chairman of the University Grants Commission has announced, at an event in Malda, that as many as 15 out of the 19 districts in Bengal have been lagging behind in their gross enrolment ratio, compared to the rest of the country. The GER measures the number of people who have enrolled in higher education after passing their higher secondary examinations, and in these backward districts this ratio is less than the national average of 11 per cent. (The UGC wants to bring the national average up to 15 per cent by the end of the 11th five-year plan.) The chairman has suggested that in each of these districts at least one new college should be built, and has promised financial support towards this, with special incentives for female students.        
	Bengals minister for higher education has, of course, immediately questioned the validity of such a judgment, pointing out that the UGC refuses to take into account all those who enrol for diploma courses when computing this ratio. By keeping the argument at a quantitative level, the minister is trying not to confront the problem at a qualitative one  a tendency that the UGCs statistical approach reinforces. Added to this is the usual state-versus-Centre conflict  of a purely political nature  colouring the ministers response to the chairmans warning. Both in college or university and in the diploma courses, what is the quality of education on offer in these allegedly backward districts? And would students coming out of this system be able to compete with their metropolitan counterparts? The moment one poses the questions in these terms, the problem becomes more difficult to quibble with. Every aspect of higher education in the districts, from the most basic to the superstructural, is usually woefully inadequate, relative to what is available in the cities  methods and quality of teaching, the standard of written and spoken English achieved by students at the end of their courses, course options, libraries, internet connectivity, career opportunities, hostel arrangements, and so on. It is not enough to get more people to enrol in colleges, old and new. What is on offer after that happens is the more important criterion.

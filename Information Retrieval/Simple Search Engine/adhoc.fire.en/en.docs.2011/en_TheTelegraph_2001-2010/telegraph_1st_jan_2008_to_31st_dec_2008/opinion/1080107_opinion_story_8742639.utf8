	Criminal intent
         
	Sir  If there is any truth in the claim made by the elders of the Ville Parle Siddhivinayak Society that the 14 young men arrested, and later released on bail, from the building are innocent, and that their pictures were clicked only because they were trying to rescue the victims, it puts the Mumbai police in very poor light (One building, nine faces to defend, Jan 5). However, it would also be in the interest of the parents and elders of the apartment building to defend their wards. Thus their claim that the boys are innocent need not be taken at face value either. Efforts should be made to identify as many of the criminals as possible by making field investigations and using the social grapevine of information and gossip.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Sweta Pathak, New Delhi 

        
	Sir  First the Mumbai police commissioner, D.N. Jadhav, disgraced himself and his force by making an outrageous statement to the media. Then the politicians stepped in and made him recant his words and announce a plan of action. Subsequently, 14 alleged criminals responsible for the Juhu molestation were arrested. Since then, they have been released on bail. Is this not an oft-repeated pattern in India? Legal experts have already argued that the case is weak and that it would never be possible to put behind bars every member of the mob that assaulted the two girls. As a concerned and outraged citizen, may one ask how one can put ones trust in this countrys legal system?
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
V.K. Saxena, Mumbai

        
	Sir  It is strange that there was no policeman at a prominent and crowded place like the Juhu beach in Mumbai on New Years Eve even after elaborate police arrangements had been announced for the occasion. The earliest hours of the morning are always the most dangerous during festivities. Hence, the Mumbai police chiefs statement that he could not keep policemen behind every man is not acceptable. Instead of investigating where the arrangements went wrong, D.N. Jadhav arrogantly trivialized the horrific incident. If two young girls being brutally molested by a mob were indeed a molehill, what then is a mountain in the police lexicon? What kind of message did Jadhav convey to the women in his family?
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

        
	Sir  D.N. Jadhav should resign immediately since he is a dangerous and irresponsible man in a very powerful office. His definition of the molestation of two women by a mob (with the clothes ripped off one of the victims) as a minor incident is indefensible. It is true that the police cannot keep an eye on every individual. However, police pickets are necessary outside important venues for New Years Eve celebrations. Therefore, the Juhu incident is proof of the inefficient and callous management by the Mumbai police. By not taking action against those policemen who failed to register the complaint and by scolding the media, Jadhav not only added insult to the victims injury but also encouraged potential rapists. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

        
	Sir  It was only under political compulsion and public outrage that the police arrested 14 of the alleged culprits of the Juhu molestation case. A senior police officer like D.N. Jadhav has demonstrated extreme insensitivity in handling the matter. He should have promised to investigate the case even if no complaint has been registered by the victims. If the state home minister has had to express regret over Jadhavs comments, then the next logical step would be to remove Jadhav from his post. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Goa

        
	Sir  D.N. Jadhav should be immediately sacked for urging the public to look at molestation as a way of life. A total lack of responsibility on the part of the lawkeepers is making women all the more insecure on our streets. The electronic media have done the right thing in exposing the crime and the callousness of the police chief. Sometimes sensational presentations have their uses.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

   
	Sir  It is good that the print media keeps training the spotlight on the ever-increasing menace of eve-teasing and molestation in India. But this spirit of the media goes missing when they publish photographs of discotheques where one sees frenzied young men gluing themselves on to unknown young women. Of course, if the girls do not mind, no one has anything to say. But sometimes, when they register their protest, things have already gone too far. It must be remembered that molestation is not a pre-conceived crime, it is a sudden revolt of the body against inhibitions. Guy de Maupassants The Vagabond tells us about an innocent and hungry young man, who, after an unexpected meal, could not control the sudden awakening of his carnal desire when a young milkmaid responded favourably by mistake. The French law did not forgive the young man although he, half-starved for days, did not begin the day with such an intent. In the same way, Indian law too will not approve of such aberrations as in Mumbai. However, raising awareness about crimes against women and publishing pictures which put the wrong ideas in peoples heads work at cross-purposes. Which is why the media, too, must share the blame when incidents like the Juhu molestation happen.
     
	Yours faithfully,

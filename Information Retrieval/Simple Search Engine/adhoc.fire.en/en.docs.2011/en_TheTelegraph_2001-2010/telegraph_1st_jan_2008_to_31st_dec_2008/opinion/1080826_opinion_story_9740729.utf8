	Out of the labyrinth                  
	Sir  Pervez Musharrafs exit does not mean much for India, neither does it matter if the civilian government chooses the next president in Pakistan (Clenched-fist exit, Aug 19). Although the president of Pakistan appoints the army chief and the latter controls the Inter-Services Intelligence, in reality, the United States of America has an enormous say in military affairs in Pakistan, following the alliance it struck during the so-called war on terror. There is every chance that Musharraf had to go because he had outlived his usefulness to the Bush regime.           
	Until the Pakistani army is not effectively controlled by the civilian government, there is not going to be much change in the ground realities. It is an open secret that terrorists trained in Pakistan, who create trouble in Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere, enjoy the patronage of the army and the ISI. Even under the civilian rule, there will be no let-up in terrorist activities in India, since these are orchestrated by the army-ISI combine, and not by the civilian rulers.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Asif Ali Zardari of the Pakistan Peoples Party and Nawaz Sharif of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) may well have engineered the exit of Pervez Musharraf, but developments after that made it clear that they find it impossible to function together. Cracks have been visible for some time and now, Sharifs party has pulled out of the ruling coalition. But then, it is unfair to expect perfect harmony between individuals who are bitter rivals with their own agenda to fulfil. What had brought them together was their common hatred for the former president and the temptation of power. Now that Musharraf has been got rid off, they naturally found it difficult to find a common platform for working together. The result, as always, would be an indefinite period of instability. This would eventually lead to yet another ambitious army bigwig wresting power from the civilian government, as has happened so many times in the history of Pakistan. We should not delude ourselves into believing that with Musharrafs exit, normalcy will be restored in Pakistan.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  At long last, the self-styled president of Pakistan has chosen to step down. He had begun to show clear signs of caving in even before his political adversaries  the PPP, the PML(N) and the Talibanized sections of the country  had bared their fangs. After double-crossing the Bush administration for a pretty long time in its war against terror, President Musharraf finds himself cruelly jettisoned by the Bush dispensation itself. For the former general, running with the hare and hunting with the hound became too dangerous a game. Moreover, the relationship with the US came under pressure from the snowballing resentment at home against Musharraf.           
	Fortunately, Musharraf departs in a bloodless political coup, much in the same way as he had usurped power back in 1999, only this time, the army is not putting its candidate in the top job. With Musharrafs exit, it has been proved once again that the political stooges put up by the US anywhere in the world either turn into its nemesis or fall victim to their creators designs.           
	It is being speculated that only a tactical move or the promise of a safe passage to the US could have ensured such acquiescence from Musharraf and also save his family and property from being harmed. But it can be said that the progressive regime offered by Musharraf, which elicited the best political support from the Bush administration for the increasingly Talibanized country, seems to have been defeated. The coming days may have more tumult in store for the whole of south Asia.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Another chapter has been added to Pakistans volatile political scenario with the dramatic resignation of President Pervez Musharraf. The embattled dictator finally decided to blink first in the war of attrition with his political foes, Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif  the latter he had ingloriously toppled. Even though Musharraf has resigned, it would be wrong to assume that this saga has reached its end. Rather, the impeachment proceeding, resulting in the resignation, should be seen as a new twist in Pakistans forever changing political tale. Both Sharif and Zardari have many scores to settle with the former army commander. Sharif has, for the first time since his humiliating ouster, gained an upper hand and would be itching for a payback. Zardari, on the other hand, has found it politically expedient to hold Musharraf responsible for the assassination of his wife, Benazir Bhutto.           
	Will Musharraf stay in Pakistan or seek asylum in another country? Once the answer to this question is available, a clearer picture will emerge regarding the direction in which Pakistani politics is headed.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  A democratic regime is in power in Pakistan. The countrys military dictator, Pervez Musharraf, after being powerless since the election results, has finally made an exit. But has anyone noticed that during the last month, the ceasefire on the line of control in Kashmir has been violated by Pakistani forces as many as seven times, resulting in a few Indian deaths? Does this mean that Pakistani democracy bites India harder than Pakistani dictatorship?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Its pretentious title, Metareal, notwithstanding, the exhibition of watercolours by Sekhar Baran Karmakar at the Gandhara Art Gallery (April 12-19) made interesting use of the beauty of the undraped, well-muscled male body, often with a hint of the erotic. In a way, despite their similarities, it is this trait that set these watercolours apart from the apocalyptic paintings of Blake in which there is no space for sex. Unlike desexed angels, even fallen ones, the prominently-displayed members of Karmakars figures leave no doubt about their gender.         
	These men, occasionally in shirts with psychedelic prints, seem to be larger-than-life figures, engaged in life-and-death tussles with other men. They are ambivalent figures for they wont look out of place in a fashion magazine or in designs of Elizabethan masque costumes. On other occasions, they are seen greedily drinking their own blood, chhinnamasta fashion, tongue sticking out obscenely. The figures either play with their innards, wear them like gorgonic tresses or dream of these lying on the ground. There is a sense of mystery in Karmakars paintings but the accompanying text in the catalogue could be best described as drivel.

	Fashion fusion        
	It was an event marked by the confluence of art, dance and fashion. The two-year-old Mrittika Foundation, an institution that works towards the betterment of Bengals artisans, held its annual programme on the lush lawns of the German consulate on April 2. The show was called Leela Showcase 2008, and it featured a performance by the Mamata Shankar Ballet troupe, as well as a fashion show by Sunipa Samaddar. The programme began with a laser show, and included a dance performance that was choreographed by Mamata Shankar. The stage space was used adroitly by the dancers who moved gracefully. Keeping in mind that the theme of the evening was the evolution of Bengal handloom creations, Mamata Shankar choreographed the number using long, colourful pieces of cloth. The suppleness of the performers blended beautifully with the props, thereby creating a magnificent visual dimension. The synchronized movements, aesthetically done costumes and a flawless presentation made it a memorable evening. Madhumanti Maitra compred the show, and Malini Mandal deserves special mention for her contribution.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Questions of knowledge
                                                                                                                 QUESTIONS OF KNOWLEDGE                                  JOB DESCRIPTION      How much do the villages of South 24 Parganas know about the NREGA?                                                  
	Gouri Das knows what a job card is. She has also heard about the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. TV te boleche, anchaleo shunechi, she says, when I ask her about the source of her information. Anchal, she adds, is what the panchayat is called in these parts. Das lives in Naubad, a village in the South 24 Parganas. She sells puffed rice for a living, travelling to Calcutta every day. Naubad, she tells me, has the airs of a city. It has roads, electricity, as well as a school. The men and women of her village keep themselves acquainted with news, about life and the world. Only yesterday, peopled died in a blast in Pakistan, she says. Several women (neighbours as well as family) and a boy surround this frail, old woman. Most of them are in a chatty mood. We talk as the morning outside rolls into a hot afternoon. And, in the course of the conversation, I begin to realize that knowledge is a special privilege that need not be the same as knowing.        
	The NREGA, launched in February 2006, promises 100 days of wage employment every year to each rural household whose adult members are willing to work as unskilled labour. Two hundred districts have been brought under its ambit in the first phase, and the act is set to cover all of the country in the next five years. Government policies and programmes make many promises. But only on paper. Even the historic NREGA may not be an exception. In the last two years, the local panchayat, regulating matters in Naubad, had provided people there with nine days of work: seven days in 2006; this year, Das and the other women have found work for two days so far. Their dues have been settled though. The villagers, men and women, visited the anchal office demanding work on three occasions. Every time, they were told that there were no jobs.        
	What about the men? Whats the point of going? It is the boy who speaks, at last. I ask him whether he knows that the NREGA has given him the right to demand work from the panchayat. He looks away, bored. There is tittering from the women. The men, they say, are no longer willing to visit the anchal office. It seems they also disapprove of the womens determination and heightened awareness. Clearly, there is resistance, in and out of home. But the women have not called a truce yet. The NREGA may not have given Das her hundred days of labour, but it has provided her with a job card, a document which, inexplicably, is a source of great pride. It is my ticket to sustenance, she says. I cant quite figure out whether Das speaks in jest. She looks as if she means every word. Is the panchayat accepting applications for new job cards? No, says another woman, hidden behind a clothesline.        
	I ask Das about unemployment allowance. There is silence. What about childcare and medical facilities for the wage-earners, two other provisions under the act? This time, there is laughter. For a moment, I am baffled, and then humbled. A young woman lifts the edge of her sari, revealing, deep, purple lesions across her ankle. This happened when I was clearing the pond of water hyacinth  the government has not paid as yet. Cleaning water bodies is one of the NREGAs popular schemes, under which jobs are doled out by panchayats. The distribution of jobs is on stringent political lines. Das is eager to tell me more, but not her daughter-in-law. Your name will come out in the paper, watch out, she tells her.         
	I ask the women whether the panchayat has provided them with the details of the NREGA. For the first time, I hear a discordant note. Some of them, including Das, declare that the panchayat has told them precious little about the acts provisions. Others, however, mention a meeting where the NREGA was discussed in some detail. Dass memory, considering her age and lack of education, might not be sharp. How much knowledge do these women have about the NREGA, and about their rights and entitlements under it? How much do they remember of what they have been told by the panchayat, if at all? And how much of it are they willing to share?         
	Later, I meet Bagbul Hossain Jamadar, or Tokon, at the Paschim Bishnupur panchayat office. He asks me where I am from. I tell him I just visited Naubad. That, he says, falls under a different panchayat. I am being told, I think, that Ive come to the wrong place. Much of what the NREGA promises has not been delivered, admits Tokon. But it is not his panchayats fault. The act permits the creation of employment under many heads  water conservation, irrigation, dredging, afforestation, land development, and so on, none of which can be implemented in these parts. Lack of raw material, he says. The people are also unwilling to take on menial tasks; the city promises better jobs.         
	Tokon also shows that he has a head for figures. Last year, the panchayat had spent nearly Rs 2 lakh on various schemes under the NREGA. This year, the figure is approximately Rs 60,000 so far. His voice is calm, confident. Has he ensured enough job cards and first-aid kits for the wage-earners? How about the bekar bhata (unemployment maintenance)?         
	Tokon is unruffled. He says that panchayat officials have followed the act to the letter. What about the peoples grievances then? They dont want these jobs. People in West Bengal have forgotten to work during the last 30 years, he says. There is a pause. I realize that he has slipped, giving me a momentary glimpse of how development is a political, and not a social, issue. Tokon gets up and leaves hurriedly, muttering that I had taken up his time. On my way back, on a bus, I think about Das. A part of me wants to believe her and not Tokon. But I cannot be sure. The truth is layered and complex, and strangely binds together the old woman and young man.                     UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

	Now that world prices of crude oil have come down, government oil companies are making good profits on petrol and diesel oil. They are unlikely to increase the prices of these products even if they have a chance. So the government is considering decontrol. It would continue to control the prices of kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas, the two household fuels. The history of oil price controls is a fraught one. Reliance Industries and Essar were given licences to set up refineries in the Eighties. But as long as prices of oil products were controlled, they could see no way of competing against public sector oil companies, which could make unlimited losses and pass them on to the exchequer. Price control made private investment made in oil refineries infructuous. Vijay Kelkar, when he was petroleum secretary, saw the point and persuaded the government to promise the abandonment of the administrative price mechanism by 2002. When the time came, Ram Naik dismantled most of the price controls. That led Essar to complete its refinery and Reliance to double the size of its own. By 2006, both were opening petrol pumps; by early 2007, Reliance pumps were registering thrice the sales of the pumps of public sector companies, and were rapidly gaining market share.        
	Meanwhile, as international oil prices rose, the government forced its own oil companies not to raise their product prices. The private oil companies could not face the unfair competition. Both closed down their petrol pumps. Essar sold its products partly to Reliance and partly to public enterprises. Reliance took the status of an export-oriented unit, and began to export most of its products. It was ironic that while South India went through a shortage of petrol and diesel last summer, Reliance continued to export both. It could not have relieved that shortage since it had no petrol pumps by then. Even if it had had any, its EOU status made it illegal to sell more than a small proportion of its output within the country. Government refineries could have bought the products from Reliance and sold them through their pumps. But if they had bought the products from Reliance at international prices and sold them at prices permitted by the government, they would have made losses. They were bleeding anyway, so they preferred to let the Tamils suffer.        
	Such are the travails that the government has forced on the country with its oil-price controls. Its current policies are quite indefensible, and it should do one of two things. It should stop distorting competition with its subsidies; it should give subsidies on products of its choice out of its own budget, and not out of its own oil companies profits. An even better alternative, however, would be to cease all subsidies and consequent price controls, and to let fair competition reign.

	Sixteen-year-old Shinjini Sengupta, now under treatment at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in Bangalore, probably has no idea that her illness has sparked a nationwide debate on reality shows involving children. Her parents have alleged that she was struck with a debilitating neurological disorder after the judges of a reality show on a Bengali television channel rebuked her for her poor performance. The organizers of the show were quick to counter that it was her parents who were responsible for the tragedy as they had made her take part in the dance competition even though they knew about her incipient illness. Since then there has been an ugly blame game, stoked by the talking heads on television, on who or what felled Shinjini.        
	Last week, the Union minister for women and child development, Renuka Chowdhury, announced that the government would bring in guidelines to regulate reality shows for children. It would also introduce a code of conduct for the judges who are sometimes shockingly harsh on the participants. This is heartening news, for it is indeed time that the government stepped in to monitor this modern-day gladiatorial combat with children as the combatants.        
	Reality shows are really a form of spectator sport. And like all spectator sport, they thrive on the ferocity of the contest. The bloodier, the more outrageously dramatic it is, the better the audience likes it. And the better perhaps are the TRP  the key to the big bucks that make the whole thing go round.              
	So you have judges raining caustic comments, dissing one, damning another, lavishing praise on a third. Everyday there is a thumbs up and a thumbs down, contestants who live to fight another day and those who must leave the arena forever. There are tears and jeers, hope and heartbreak, joy and despair. Money and fame are just a short ride from here, wrecked dreams an even shorter step away. Its a potent mix, and the audience laps it up. There is that talent hunt, the quest for the song or dance champion, but what seems to sell more is the thrill of seeing who survives and who falls by the wayside.        
	The problem is that this winning formula for a television show is terrifyingly inappropriate when children are its dramatis personae. Not all children  or even adolescents, for that matter  are tough enough to withstand the emotional roller coaster that these shows take them on. Not all of them can deal with euphoria one day and public humiliation the next. Shinjini may or may not have been struck down with illness the very next moment that a judge trashed her dance performance. But it is not hard to imagine the burning humiliation she must have felt at the time.         
	Of course, heartbreak is just one top-selling ingredient of these reality shows for children. The other is the way the children are primped and presented. Indeed it is strange that a government that frequently gets into a fit of apoplexy over myriad indecencies on the electronic media has so far blithely ignored the undeniable indecency of children doing bump and grind routines in dance shows. Their faces thick with make-up, their spangled costumes all aglitter, these children, especially pubescent and pre-pubescent girls, do Bollywood style jhatkas and matkas with their childish, unformed bodies, or sing raunchy numbers with suitably suggestive moves.        
	Its all supposed to be drenchingly cute  which is probably why their parent sit there grinning proudly. In truth, though, this is nothing but a flagrant attempt to sexualize the children. Presenting young girls as knowing little nubile nypmhets is one more way of feeding the voyeurism that these shows are built on.        
	Its one thing if adults choose to be exploited as sex objects. Its one thing for them to play the game and agree to let it all hang out  anger, grief, pettiness or envy  as the contestants in a Celebrity Big Brother or its Indian clone, Bigg Boss, so famously did. But its quite another thing when children are sexualized or their emotions held up for public display. Children do not always choose to be presented thus. Their parents usually make that choice for them when they bring them along to participate in these shows. And that is why the exploitative element in childrens reality shows seems to be doubly egregious.         
	In the wake of the Shinjini incident a lot has been said about greedy parents who push their kids into these shows, subjecting them to the public gaze and to gruelling 12-hour schedules in the hope of turning them overnight into stars. So, if children are unable to handle rejection and leave the show weeping and traumatized, some say its the parents who are to blame for thrusting them into this fiercely competitive set-up.              
	Perhaps that is so. But in a country where opportunities remain relatively scarce and unequally fought for, can we really blame parents for seizing on an abundance of reality shows for projecting their childrens talent? The shows do seem to promise a quick and apparently painless route to undreamt-of money and fame, cutting out years of pounding the pavement and knocking on doors for that one big break. Perhaps parents look at the phenomenal success of singers like Sunidhi Chauhan or Shreya Ghoshal  both products of television talent-hunt shows  and wonder if, given a chance, their child too may not hit the reality-show jackpot. In any case, it is not unnatural for parents to want their child to shine, or to spur them on to excel in whatever they are good at. But they need to realize that urging children to do well in studies or sports is not quite the same thing as urging them to run the gauntlet of reality shows and come out the winner. Studies and sports are generally governed by the rules of fair play. If you perform better than your competitors, you are usually the topper.        
	Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of reality shows. Not only are the judges astonishingly whimsical at times, but the final knockout rounds are also determined by that mystifying thing called SMS voting. In contest after contest, a child who has not necessarily performed worse than its rivals is voted out apparently because the audience would have it that way. So excellence is judged not by the yardstick of a clearly defined marking system, but by the vagaries of an unseen, unheard and often perverse audience. The brutal unfairness of it all could well leave a sensitive child scarred for life.        
	The proposed guidelines need to address  and stamp out  all these damaging aspects of reality shows for children. If they truly do so, they will end up transforming these shows from exploitative, sensation-peddling entertainment to real talent-hunt contests where the best children win.        
	Will that happen? The ball, clearly, is in the governments court.

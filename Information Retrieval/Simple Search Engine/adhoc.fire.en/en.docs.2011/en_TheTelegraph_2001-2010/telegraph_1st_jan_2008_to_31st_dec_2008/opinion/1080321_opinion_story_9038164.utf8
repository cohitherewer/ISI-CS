	Little soldiers in a big war              
	Gorilla (Random House, Rs 195) by Shobasakthi is the fictionalized true story of a former Tamil liberation fighter. Set in a village in Jaffna, it tells the story of Rocky Raj, who, in trying to escape the clutches of his maverick but brutal father, joins the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as a child soldier. Soon, he is on the run again, this time from the Movement, which accuses him of insubordination. Rocky Raj is finally caught, and tortured, and his life seems to hang by a thread. Gorilla is a compelling and dark work, which, in a way, is an account of two different kinds of conflict  one is between the State and a people and another that makes a son want to tear himself away from his father. The plot brings a strange mix of characters  suicide bombers, delinquent boys, bootleggers, policemen and prostitutes  who try and survive with the help of cunning and savagery. Shobasakthi adopts an engaging style, using a circular narrative along with footnotes and dictionary definitions. Anushiya Sivanarayanans translation is masterly as well.                         
	Inventing millions: Creating wealth Changing Lives (Orient, Rs 225) by Simon Torok and Paul Holper could be mistaken for an investment guide at first glance. However, a closer look reveals that Torok and Holper present the stories of ideas, accidents and even failures of 21 scientists and entrepreneurs who changed our world with their inventions. Some of the anecdotes are quite funny. The credit card, for example, came into being because its creator had forgotten to carry his wallet for a meal of steaks and martinis at a posh New York restaurant. Other successful products, such as cellphones and iPods, share such curious histories too, that have been documented in these pages.                      
	Delhi Metropolitan: The making of an unlikely city (Penguin, Rs 250) by Ranjana Sengupta is born out of the authors love for a city that she cannot quite comprehend. Sengupta does not strive to investigate Delhis history, polity or economy. Instead, she embarks on a journey to discover the spaces between these grand interstices raising intriguing questions about a citys relationship with notions such as identity, loyalty and pride. Sengupta addresses complex issues no doubt. But the reader would have no problems in following her detailed and rich prose.

	Give a little, take a lot                  
	Sir  I was shocked to hear that Ricky Ponting has pocketed Rs 57 lakh after scoring a total of 39 runs in four IPL matches. After all, Punter seemed to have worked harder off, and not on, the field. He gave tips to the young knights, and helped the skipper plan for the games. But Pontings labours have come a cropper. The Knight Riders are not leading the league, their batsmen are struggling despite Pontings advice and the captain himself has been fined. Is there then a case for fining Ponting too for getting more than he deserves?

	Sir  Yet another Earth Day was celebrated with fanfare a few weeks back. The day saw the usual quota of debates and discussions on a number of relevant issues such as global warming and climate change (Call for green earth, April 23). The world is now faced with another problem in addition to these two  the global food crisis. While the rich reap the fruits of a globalized economy, soaring prices and spiralling inflation are pushing millions of poor people to the brink of despair. The World Bank has predicted that as many as 33 countries would face social unrest as a result of rising food prices. Consumption of foodgrains has outpaced production. Worse, buffer stocks are shrinking with every passing day.           
	The conversion of arable land for industry and the unplanned construction of residential complexes have affected the agrarian sector adversely, aggravating the current crisis especially in countries such as China and India. As a result, farmers continue to suffer here, the farm-loan waiver notwithstanding. All this underscores the importance of a new national plan to combat hunger, which, along with environmental pollution, is now a serious cause of concern. A change in development priorities and overhauling the agrarian sector would help reverse the deteriorating situation.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Global warming is a serious issue for both the developed and developing world. Unfortunately, a lot remains to be done to lessen the threat to our environment. Citizens should be made aware of the dangers and educated on how each one of them can contribute towards improving the environment. While conferences and symposiums are welcome, what is needed, in equal measure, is affirmative action. This can help us in tackling problems, such as the overuse of plastic. Plastic goods, despite their many uses, contribute to pollution. Therefore, the ban against this substance needs to be implemented more effectively. Then there is the other problem of depleting green cover. Parks and other open spaces have given way to housing complexes. This needs to be checked. The challenges to the planets environment can be met. No fancy projects or sums of money can do what awareness can achieve. Hopefully, people will realize this and do their bit to save the planet.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The other day, I heard an interesting comment while I was on the road. Someone said that there was a lot of talk about Earth Day and the need to protect the environment. But all this is being said by people ensconced in the air-conditioned comfort of their homes or offices. The person also pointed out that the numbers of cars on the roads is on the rise, and that most of them have airconditioners. This has increased the consumption of energy and fossil fuels. The same man then asked whether people should not practise what they preach. He has a point there, and I think all of us would agree.           
	Yours faithfully,

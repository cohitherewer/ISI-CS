	Sob story                  
	Sir  What happened at the Mohali match between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab reflects the extent to which cricket has fallen from grace (Bhajji slaps, Sree sobs, April 26). The Indian Premier League, with its pomp and splendour, has brought glamour to Indian cricket, but unseemly scenes on the ground are surely not a part of the bargain. Old-timers find it incredible that a captain of a losing side should hit a player of the winning team, and that too a team-mate with whom he plays in the national side. India had accused the Aussies of sledging on the field during a recent tour. Both S. Sreesanth and Harbhajan Singh had then been most forthcoming in picking up quarrels with the Australians. That trick seems to have rebounded on them in a rather sorry manner.          
	Cricket should rid itself of such nuisance. As the game keeps changing, the need to re-instil a sporting spirit becomes more pertinent. Professionalism has been fading away from the game ever since corporate sponsorships started flowing in. The players are becoming increasingly paranoid about a win or a loss in order to justify the worth of their outstanding bidding price.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
P.B. Saha, Arlington, Texas

                
	Sir  Harbhajan Singh deserves strict punishment for publicly humiliating S. Sreesanth. This ugly episode could have been avoided had the players shown more self-restraint. After the hounding of the Aussies in the Indian media last year for their allegations against Indian cricketers, the table has turned. The Australian media have got the perfect opportunity to revive the earlier controversy around Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds. After slapping a member of the national team, Harbhajan Singh has proved that he has a short temper and is therefore given to outbursts. It is entirely possible that he may have called Symonds names.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                
	Sir  S. Sreesanths antics on the field are insufferable, and it is possible that the resounding slap from Harbhajan Singh had something to do with it. The reaction from Harbhajan Singh, unfortunate thought it is, will hopefully put Sreesanth in his place. Luckily, the incident took place between players of the same country. Otherwise, the media would have loved to put a racial colour to it. It is the laxity of the International Cricket Council and the Board of Control for Cricket in India that has encouraged such outrageous behaviour from cricketers. The governing bodies should have been more firm on erring players. It is time a strict penalty was imposed on them.           
	Yours faithfully,      
A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

      
	Sir  Whatever the provocation, Harbhajan Singh should not have slapped a junior. As it is, both the players are known for their fiery temperaments in the home team. That fire could do some good so long as the two played on the same side. Once in opposite camps, their impetuosity and impatience are bound to boil over. That is what happened that day in Mohali. Enthusiasts of the IPL should be happy that the very purpose of its creation has been achieved so early on. Cricket based on a model of the European Premier League would obviously promote tension and unease among players of same national teams playing against each other. The Bollywood masala element has also been reinforced by the dramatic encounter between Bhajji and Sreesanth.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sarat Pattanayak, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  The BCCI and the media had backed Harbhajan Singh unconditionally during the Andrew Symonds mischief last year. He was allowed to believe that whatever he did was fine and that others would bail him out every time he got into trouble. Thanks to that leniency, Indians have been shamed before the world by what happened in Mohali. The media must also share a part of the responsibility for their mindless praise for aggression in the players. That rhetoric itself has fostered the likes of S. Sreesanth, Harbhajan Singh and Yuvraj Singh.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

                
	Parting shot           
	Sir  The stretch of Chowringhee Road between S.N. Banerjee Road and Lenin Sarani remains congested most of the time because of rallies, dharnas and the like. Since most of such events take place on the road opposite Metro cinema adjoining the tram depot, vehicles coming from the south stand still at this point for hours. The vehicles taking a left turn from S.N. Banerjee Road towards the Raj Bhavan also get stalled whenever politicians take over this spot of Calcutta. Since the traffic department or the police are unlikely to solve the problem, politicians must be made to give up this place for political campaigning.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

	Britains giant supermarket group, Tesco, is planning to move, as a wholesaler, into India. If Indian rivals think theyve nothing to fear, or learn, from this interloper, they should think again. And Tesco has a way with words as with groceries. Its pet line these days is an old one: Hundreds of price cuts. True enough, though the words that would make it truer still and thousands of price rises  are strangely missing. The result, a recent 10 per cent profit rise, proves the truth of Tescos long-term slogan, Every little helps, if not quite in the sense that customers are meant to take that phrase.         
	Yet even mighty Tesco was beaten by a mixture of language and numbers the other day. You can take only a few items, not a whole trolley-load, to one of its special quick-service check-outs. The sign saying so read Less than ten items. Wrong, said a shopper: that should be Fewer than ten items. Alas, no one  at least not from Tesco  could decide which was right, so the supermarket evaded the issue by changing the sign to Up to ten items (which should of course be Up to nine items, but thats another matter).        
	Tescos customer was right: less than for quantity (less than a handful), but fewer than for whole  numbers (fewer than ten readers). The error is widespread today. But it is not brand-new, nor confined to the ill-educated: in Arthur Bryants history of the Napoleonic wars Ive just read that British disarmament in 1802 reduced the line-of-battle ships from over a hundred to less than forty. Bryant was a highly educated man writing over 60 years ago (and the further rule that over 60 years ought to read more than is mere pedantry).        
	Nor is the rule clear-cut. When the number is part of a measurement, use less. To say less than ten readers is flatly wrong; these readers, like Tescos items of grocery, are individual things. But a load of less than ten tonnes is as flatly right, and fewer than would be wrong in such a phrase.                 
	Number game        
	Likewise, youre right to say ten tonnes is a heavy load for a small truck, and wrong to say are a heavy load. Youre thinking of ten tonnes as one burden, not as a number of tonnes. This may be why we talk of a ten-tonne load or a five-foot woman, not a ten-tonnes load or a five-feet woman. But such singular-plural oddities go beyond measures of weight or size or what have you. Youd be dead wrong to say nine children is waiting to be fed. Yet youre as right in grammar as in fact to say nine children is a lot for a mother to cook for. True, you could say are a lot, but is is fine: youre thinking of nine children as a state of affairs, not a count of heads.        
	Numbers figure in many other oddities of language. Why do we find in English fox-huntin talk five (say) couple of hounds  or indeed in Jane Austen of dancers  rather than couples? Why can an American talk of a couple months  perhaps from the German ein Paar?  where Britons say a couple of months? Yet both nations say a couple more months. Why, in pre-Tesco days, did the British grocer refer to a dozen eggs, yet a gross (144) of eggs? Is myriad a noun or an adjective? (Answer: it can be both.) Why indeed do we pronounce 330, for instance, as three hundred and thirty not three hundreds and thirty?         
	At the bottom of the numbers scale, why can we find both naught  archaic for nothing, preserved in a few phrases like came to naught and also the modern nought, meaning zero? Though the two spellings have diverse early-English roots, in speech theyre indistinguishable: both rhyme with thought. Yet the only time most modern Britons meet the archaic naught is in the much-quoted north-English phrase theres nowt as queer as folk  in which the word is so spelled, and pronounced to rhyme with trout.        
	Truly, theres naught as queer as the English language.                           THEWORDCAGEYAHOO.CO.UK

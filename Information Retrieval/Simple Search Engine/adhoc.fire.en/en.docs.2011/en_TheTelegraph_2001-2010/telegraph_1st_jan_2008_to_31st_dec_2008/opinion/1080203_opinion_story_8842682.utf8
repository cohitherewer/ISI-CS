	Too little, too late
         
	Sir  Diego Maradonas apology for his infamous goal against England during the World Cup in Mexico will not melt English hearts (Maradona sorry for Hand of God goal, Feb 1). Indeed, English fans will not be amused by the Argentines act of repentance because nothing, least of all remorse, can change the course of history. One wonders why Maradona had remained silent about his crime for all these years. He may be one of the worlds greatest footballers, but he cannot be called a true sportsman. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Turn a deaf ear
     
	Sir  This is certainly not the first time that the Union health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, has appealed to film stars to quit smoking on screen. Unfortunately, there are few takers for Ramadosss suggestion. This time too, Shah Rukh Khan, responding to Ramadosss plea, said that while he is ready to stop smoking in real life, he would not do the same on screen (Shah Rukh stubs out Ramadoss appeal, Jan 29). Such a ministerial directive, the actor argued, encroached upon creative freedom. A statement of this nature from a leading actor and youth icon is disappointing. Film-lovers should boycott Shah Rukhs movies because he has little concern for public health.
     
	Moreover, Shah Rukhs contention that a ban on smoking goes against artistic freedom is pure drivel. If all kinds of freedom are allowed on screen, what is the need for a censor board? The censor board should remove scenes that depict smoking from all films henceforth. The government should declare an outright ban on the sale of tobacco products as well. Only then would the people of India breathe easy.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
K.A. Solaman,

	Sir Anbumani Ramadoss cited political pressure behind the shooting down of a proposal to put graphic pictorial warnings on cigarette packets. But why blame our netas alone when even some celebrities are unwilling to kick the habit? Shah Rukh Khan, for example, rebuffed Ramadosss proposal to quit smoking on screen. The government should initiate contempt proceedings in the courts against the actor for his comments. Not just that, it should also penalize those who are against printing pictorial warnings on cigarette packs. Ramadoss should also think of forcing tobacco companies to follow the rules. Bhutan and Ireland have banned smoking in public. India too should strive to follow their examples. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot
     
	Sir  It requires tremendous courage for a cricketer of Adam Gilchrists stature to hang up his cricketing boots. Gilchrist, incidentally, was just four matches away from a hundredth Test appearance when he decided to retire. Gilchrist has said that he started contemplating retirement after dropping Laxmans catch in Adelaide. Not many cricketers would have decided to quit the game after a rare miss. Perhaps his sketchy form with the bat in Tests prompted him to quit Test cricket. The decision to appoint Michael Clarke as Pontings deputy in his place must have hurt Gilchrist as well. Gilchrist would always be remembered as someone who introduced the concept of keeper-batsman into the game. He was a great player on field, and a gentleman off it. 
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Ganesh Sovani, Thane

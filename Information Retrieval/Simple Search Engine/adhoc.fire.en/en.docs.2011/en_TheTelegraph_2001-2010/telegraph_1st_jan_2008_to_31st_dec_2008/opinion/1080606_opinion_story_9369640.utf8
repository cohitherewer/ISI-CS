	Barack Obama has won the Democratic Party nomination, but what has triumphed is democracy in the United States of America. Mr Obama is the first coloured person to secure a presidential nomination for a major party in a country where discrimination against blacks is a recent and alive memory. Looking from this point of view only, Mr Obamas achievement borders on the incredible. In his campaign he has promised change. Nothing could be more apposite since Mr Obama himself epitomizes the change that the US has experienced in the last two-three decades. The challenge before him is to carry forward that change. To meet that challenge, Mr Obama will have to first unify his party after a long and rather acrimonious campaign. This may not be an easy task since his rival, Hillary Clinton, has still not accepted defeat with grace. The further she delays announcing her withdrawal, the greater will be the divisions within the Democratic Party. There is the fear that many of Ms Clintons 18 million voters will, from sheer disappointment, abstain from voting or vote for the Republican candidate, Mr John McCain. Both Ms Clinton and Mr Obama will have to ensure that this does not happen by making the disappointment evaporate with the promise of a new and vibrant presidency.        
	This can happen only through a clarification of what Mr Obama really stands for. This has been conspicuous by its absence in a campaign that has witnessed more rancour than substance. Mr Obama has to tell Americans how he plans to get out of Iraq and his plans for the rejuvenation of the economy, which is spinning into recession. When he talks about the economy  perhaps the most vital issue  he will have to spell out how he proposes to handle the mortgage crisis and impose accountability on the money managers and bankers who are responsible for it. For Mr Obama, the real task has only just begun. What he says and does between now and November will determine whether he, the first coloured person, or Mr McCain, the oldest, will enter the portals of the White House. The other contrast between the two presidential candidates is that Mr Obama carries little or no baggage from the past. Mr McCain is a Vietnam war veteran carrying on him the scars of that bloody war. How the people of the US choose between the two will make their future, perhaps that of the world as well.

	Peoples power, the basis of communist rule, ideology and rhetoric, can sometimes turn against those who profess to live by it. The minister for municipal affairs, Asok Bhattacharya, belonging to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), discovered this on Thursday, much to his embarrassment. His fellow passengers on the Darjeeling Mail stopped him from continuing his journey by car when the train was stopped by CPI(M) workers because of the bandh. Mr Bhattacharya had to endure some of the sufferings of the other passengers on the train to New Jalpaiguri. Ordinary people stopped Mr Bhattacharya from taking advantage of his ministerial privileges to break a bandh called by his own party that had brought the state of West Bengal to a standstill. The people were justified in their show of anger, which was directed as much against Mr Bhattacharya personally as against politicians who in the name of the people take them for granted.        
	A bandh is a classic instance of how the people are taken for granted. Political parties never take the consent of the people in whose name they call bandhs. Yet it is the people who suffer most in a bandh  no section of the population escapes this suffering. In the villages, the day-labourer and the sharecropper, at the very bottom of the socio-economic hierarchy, are the worst affected. In the city, the unorganized labourers lose a days wages; the professionals cannot attend their offices, surgeries, courts and so on. Businessmen and traders fail to carry out their commerce. It is thus difficult to substantiate who actually gains from a bandh. The politicians rhetoric resorts to the concept of the people whose protest a bandh is supposed to articulate. Yet it is the people who suffer. There is an obvious gap between the rhetoric and the reality.        
	It is a sign of the times that ordinary people, who ride on trains, buses and trams and earn a living through their work, are picking out this gap, and protesting against the hypocrisy of politicians. (It is significant that a few days before the bandh a group of angry people egged on a police sergeant to charge the driver of the car of a CPI(M) member of parliament who had blatantly violated traffic rules. The concerned MP could do no more than sit in the car and fume.) This is a show of peoples power to which politicians are utterly unaccustomed. For the future of West Bengal, it is not enough that people should protest against the hypocrisy and high-handedness of politicians. They must use their power to completely destroy the culture of bandhs. They can do this by choosing to go to work whenever a bandh is called. The example is already there. Traders and labourers in the New Market in Bongaon do not stop their trade and work even during a bandh. The way to stop bandhs lies through the New Market in a small border town of West Bengal.

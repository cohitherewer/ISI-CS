                        Nightmare house      
	 In the media glare in Mumbai, while the carnage in CST and Cama hospital got completely lost, the drama in Nariman House got second priority to that in the Taj. There was also little follow-up of the tragic events at the Jewish Centre, where two terrorists had stormed in sometime after 9 pm on November 26. The rabbi, it seems, had immediately called up the Israeli consulate in Mumbai. While he was on the phone, an Israeli diamond merchant staying at the centre sneaked out of the fifth floor. Minutes after he came down the drainpipe, two Israeli diplomats, including a security expert, reached the Centre. Local residents, agitated that both the police and the navy had not reached on time, dragged the men to the Colaba police station, where their entreaties about their bona-fide identities fell on deaf ears. When the Israeli ambassador learnt about the detention, he contacted a joint secretary in the MEA, who, after much dawdling, reached a senior official at the Maharashtra Sadan. The latter promptly suggested that the matter be taken care of the next morning when the office opened. Upon being pressed further, senior Mumbai police officers were contacted. By that time, the Israelis, including the Mumbai consulates professionally-trained security expert, had spent more than two hours in illegal detention in the Colaba police station  time enough for the Nariman House residents to be sent to their fate.                        
	 If the nation saw heads rolling after the Mumbai carnage, it was not because the top Congress leadership used the sword ruthlessly. The blade was actually in the hands of younger leaders who had less qualms about slaying failed ministers than the veterans. The CWC is said to have been powerfully swayed by Priyanka Gandhis argument that her grandmother would have shown more guts in dealing with terror. Priyanka, naturally, had support from Rahul, who lashed out at both Shivraj Patil and Vilasrao Deshmukh. It was Rahuls opposition that saw Deshmukh go. Patil, however, seems to have been prompted into action only at the offer of resignation by no less than the PM.                             
	 A few years ago, when Admiral Sureesh Mehta, the present navy chief, was director-general of the Coast Guard, he met a very senior official of the Gujarat government to discuss patrolling of the sea waters. Mehta told him that if his state wanted the Coast Guard to patrol the sea, it would have to arrange for high-speed, well-equipped ships and boats. The official argued that if the BSF did not ask for vehicles and camels to patrol the borders, why should the navy ask for boats? Perhaps Mumbai has given him the answer.                            
	 Many years ago in Delhi, a chief executive councillor was in the habit of sleeping during meetings with senior officials. At one such meeting with senior coal department officials, he dozed off. A bureaucrat was then elaborating on the supply and demand of coal in the city. He fell silent, but resumed from where he had left off when his chief opened his eyes. Soon he had to stop again. It was routine for meetings to be convened and re-convened. The Tamil Nadu chief minister, M. Karunanidhi,is 80-plus and can hardly be blamed for stealing a few winks. The other day, when he had to meet the minister of state for power, Karunanidhi is said to have snoozed as the meeting got underway. That brought matters to an instantaneous closure. But to be fair, he got up in time for the meeting to start again.                             
	 Another chapter is about to be added to LK Advanis autobiography, My Country, My Life, as it goes in for its Urdu translation. It has already been launched in Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Marathi. While the BJP leader has had an image makeover of sorts since the Jinnah-controversy days, it would be interesting to see how the minority community reacts to his literary talent. Of special consequence in shaping this reaction, particularly prior to the Lok Sabha polls and after Mumbai, would be the chapters on Jinnah and Pakistan. Interestingly, Advanis own Urdu is quite good, given that he was born in Karachi and spent most of his growing-up years there.                             
	 Barack Obama would insist and Indians, post-Mumbai, would acquiesce willingly, that SMS is a major propaganda tool. Here are two popular ones doing the rounds ever since P Chidambaram was moved from finance to home. The first: Now trust Chidambaram to bring down the terror attacks just as he had brought down the Sensex and the growth rate. And the second  PCs report card after six months: Police to people ratio increased from 14 per lakh to 14.0012 per lakh due to increased crime rate...; service tax imposed on illegal Bangladeshis, visa entry tax on all Nepalis, duty reduced on import of useless bulletproof vests, duties of all director-generals of police outsourced to private parties, 25 per cent tax on import of AK 47s and all types of grenades....

	 Raosaheb Ramachandra Patil is a dejected man, although one would still have to try hard to make him eat his words about small things like terror happening in big places like Mumbai. One does not know if his perceptions about big-city vices has made him retire to Tasgaon, but Patil, the man who singlehandedly rendered thousands of bar girls jobless, is alone and sulking in his hometown. Known for his simple ways, RR is said to have left for Sangli district in a state transport bus and has been refusing to take any calls on his mobile. His colleagues in the NCP, such as Arun Gujarathi, are desperately trying to woo him, for the man still retains his iron grip over voters in western Maharashtra. But nothing seems to be helping. Not even the suggestion from a party colleague that Patil be taken to a local bar in Tasgaon just so he cheers up.

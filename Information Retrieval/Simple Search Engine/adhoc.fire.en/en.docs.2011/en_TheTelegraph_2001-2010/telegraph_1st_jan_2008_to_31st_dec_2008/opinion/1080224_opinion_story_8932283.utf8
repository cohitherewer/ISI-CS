	Pampered no more    
	 Sir  Muslim members of parliament have caused a revolution of sorts by asking for the abolition of the Haj subsidy (Drive to shed Haj subsidy, Feb 23). They probably fear that self-proclaimed leaders like Raj Thackeray might next pounce on the Haj-subsidy-as-appeasement idea. Besides, what the Indian Muslims  revealed to be appallingly backward by the Sachar committee  need is not a religious grant but State support for education and employment. They could be offered the benefits given to the backward communities. One wishes success to the MPs in the face of expected resistance from the clerics.          
	Yours faithfully,        G.C. Biswas, Barasat
        
	Market watch    
	Sir  As the famous investor, Warren Buffet, said, Its only when the tide goes out that you discover who has been swimming naked. Most of us have been caught in an alarming state of undress as Reliance Power, touted as Indias biggest initial public offering, fell as much as 17 per cent on its debut because it was overpriced. Indian market operators had become used to making easy money in IPOs. The government and the Securities and Exchange Board of India should learn a lesson from this debacle. Investors in the Reliance IPO have had their hopes and dreams shattered. It has especially hurt those who gambled on a high listing price and even borrowed money to buy the shares.           
	Reliance Power, a company which does not have any operating assets, nor any meaningful earnings, was surprisingly allowed by Sebi to go ahead and raise money for its future benefit. The typical retail investor, who had just started returning to the market, received a huge jolt to his confidence. The Sebi and other regulatory bodies need to get their act together. Was it because Anil Ambani was afraid to risk his own money that he passed on the risk of his power projects to the investors?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Reverberations of the massive fall at the stock markets of the United States of America and heightened fears of recession in the American economy have sent waves of panic among the young brigade of investors. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it will lower interest rates. President George W. Bush has also proposed an economic stimulus package that includes $145 billion in tax cuts, but investors around the world are apprehensive about how much it would help the economic meltdown. The package is expected to have a positive impact on consumer spending, as a result of which there ought to be fewer foreclosures.           
	The American economy has been affected by a slump in the housing market and a credit crisis that has led to losses running into billions of dollars among major US banks. The sub-prime crisis has also hit financial institutions. US household debt is now more than 100 per cent of the GDP, up from approximately 80 per cent in 2003. Not unexpectedly, global stock markets suffered a collective loss of $5.2 trillion in January alone. The single bright spot in the generally glum picture is that the economic uncertainty could be seen as a buying opportunity, as there is a rise after every fall .           
	Yours faithfully,      
Garima Dasgupta, Colorado, US                          
	Parting shot    
	Sir  The Indian commerce ministers initiative to attract foreign direct investment from Pakistan is a step in the right direction (Try a carrot, Feb 11). Bilateral trade with Pakistan and Bangladesh on a permanent basis would help to generate jobs which in turn would hit the market of militancy. A transit through Bangladesh to the Northeast would also be of much help.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

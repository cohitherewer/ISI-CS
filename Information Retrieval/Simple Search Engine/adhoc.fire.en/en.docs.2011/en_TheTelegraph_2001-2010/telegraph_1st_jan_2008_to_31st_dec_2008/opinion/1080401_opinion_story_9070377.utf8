	Wrong connection                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitra made an astute guess in Trickling out (March 28). Indeed, Thomas Robert Malthus would have been at sea trying to wade through the riddles of our liberalized economy. However, Mitras conjecture may also be applied to contemporary columnists. The correlation that Mitra tries to establish between the booming IT sector and the import of petroleum and petro-products is highly tenuous. It is ridiculous to suggest that highly-paid IT employees are guzzling petrol by driving around in their flashy cars, thereby bringing on an oil crisis. Such a conclusion would be as absurd as the claim that the rise in aviation fuel consumption is an indication of ministers travelling too frequently by air.

	Sir  I will readily concede that a steady rate of economic growth does not necessarily mean that all sections of the society are being benefited equally. As the saying goes, feeding a lot of oats to the horses does not help feed the birds. It is true that in the last 15 years, the import cost of petroleum and petroleum products has gone up by $75 billion but it is not solely owing to the increase in demand. To a large measure, this is because of the increase in oil prices in the international market, a phenomenon which is well beyond Indias control. Oil prices have gone up from around $20 per barrel in the early Nineties to over $100 per barrel today.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ajit K. Kundu, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra surprises us with his rather ill-considered claim that cars and luxury items bought with the astronomical incomes generated in the IT-related units have been responsible for increasing the demand for petroleum products. Is Mitra then suggesting that our economy would have been better off without the IT industry? Besides, why blame only those employed in the IT sector? Any flourishing industrialist society is bound to be affected by consumerism. If people earn more, their demand for luxury items would increase proportionately. And this would inevitably give a fillip to industry, and thereby to the economy. Mitra should notice that most of the luxury items he is unhappy with  cars, air conditioners, refrigerators, televisions  are now manufactured within India, creating employment opportunities for many non-consumers of these products.           
	The other inevitable fallout of economic growth is the increase in the consumption of oil and other petroleum products. It is not without reason that China is today one of the top importers of oil in the world, importing over 125 million tons of oil annually, while its per capita oil consumption is 4.96 barrel per day compared to 2.18 in India. If this trend in consumption does not hinder the Chinese economy, why should it adversely affect Indias?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  According to Ashok Mitra, the income boom brought on by the burgeoning IT sector has, to a large extent, led to a higher import bill for petroleum products and other goods. It is worth pointing out that while the growth in ownership of automobiles has led to an increased demand for fuel, this has, at the same time, contributed to a corresponding growth in the automobile industry and its ancillary sectors, which includes servicing and repair facilities. Auto-body steel, which was so long imported, is now being manufactured in the country and has reduced imports. Cheaper air travel, and not so much the use of cars, is responsible for the increased demand for oil. However, there is need for some solid research to find out the reason behind the trickling effect of the economic boom. At the end of the day, it is the poverty index which will be the true marker of our national growth.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The lopsided features of Indias economic growth have been brilliantly explained by Ashok Mitra. However, it would be wrong to assume that globalization is leading to growth at the expense of jobs. In fact, it was mass demand of goods that stimulated production in European nations since the Industrial Revolution, particularly after World War II. Like Indians now, wealthy Europeans, too, have been drawn to stock and bullion trading and investing in real estate. And the money has always percolated down. Where Europe differed from present India was in the absence of corruption, and the presence of an efficient bureaucracy and competent governance.           
	As the domestic markets in India embrace globalization, industries will be under immense pressure to perform. Fierce competition and increasing production will create employment and give rise to an equitable society. However, the problem of access will be there to complicate economic growth. Only a handful of the educated can now benefit from globalization, while the uneducated and the impoverished continue to live in darkness.

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The Supreme Court has reinforced the democratic ethos of the Indian Constitution by ordering further investigations into the Gujarat riot cases (Outsiders to probe riots, March 26). So far only a handful among the fanatics who incited the Godhra carnage has been brought to book. The administration in Gujarat, headed by Narendra Modi, has tried to stall justice in several ways. Most of the cases suffer from the fact that the police did not cooperate with victims in registering cases or in preserving the evidence of crime. A majority of the guilty have thus got away. Hopefully, the Supreme Courts decision will goad the administration into action. However, the judiciary also needs to be proactive and must ensure that victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and the Babri-Masjid killings get justice without further delay.          
	Yours faithfully,

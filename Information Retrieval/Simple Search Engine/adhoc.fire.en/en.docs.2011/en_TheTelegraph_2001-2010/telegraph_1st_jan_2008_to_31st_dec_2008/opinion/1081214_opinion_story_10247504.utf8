	In 1948, when the British writer, Evelyn Waugh, published a novel set in an American cemetery for pets, his acknowledgements thanked a friend for correcting his English, and another for correcting his American. In the six decades that have passed since then, decolonization and globalization have ensured the return to a Babel that could be more upsetting for some than the one described in the Bible. Most young people in Britain now say anyways instead of anyway or like instead of as, while lathi and gherao have made it to the Oxford English Dictionary. Yet, the globalization of English has hardly done away with linguistic difference and value judgments. With the reordering of the worlds wealth and politics, old snootinesses (like Waughs) have given way to new ones in a new hierarchy of tongues.        
	So, it should come as no surprise that Dell offers, for a price, a special service for its American customers who prefer to have people based in North America answering their calls for technical support. This has been outdone, in the American market, by a cellphone company that targets an elderly clientele by offering a US-based customer service free of charge. Of course, one does not exactly call up customer service for exchanging pleasantries, and having to deal with something as banal as a crashed hard-disk or mysteriously high phone-bill is not conducive to mutual enrichment through cultural difference. So, it is perhaps sensible to deal with these things at a practical and commercial level without going into higher questions of race relations. Fliers frequently put themselves at risk when foreign pilots and Indian air traffic control personnel fail to understand each others accents in the skies  and this is a practical, rather than a political, problem.        
	Yet, it would be nave to assume that unsavoury racial or cultural attitudes are not played out, and should not be reckoned with, at the level of the practical or banal. It might be precisely those levels at which discriminations or hostilities are most minutely negotiated, and subtle inequalities experienced. And globalization makes things more simple as well as more complicated. At one level, the logic of consumerism is absolute. If Dell identifies a certain kind of customer requirement, then it will try to make a little more money through it. At the other end, if a North American customer has paid a few extra dollars for intelligibility, then he would naturally expect to find it the next time he calls for technical support. Yet, the Arundhati Roys of this world as well as Western neo-Nazis hold up outsourcing as the most potent emblem of the inequities of globalization. A Gurgaon girl struggling with her American in a call-centre, and a guest-worker facing blonde and blue-eyed abuse in Berlin are two sides of the same coin.

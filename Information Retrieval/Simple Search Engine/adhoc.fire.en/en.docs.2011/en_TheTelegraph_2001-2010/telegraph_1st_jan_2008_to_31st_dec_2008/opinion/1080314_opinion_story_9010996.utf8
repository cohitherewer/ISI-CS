	Why are so many books by celebrities published these days? Given the fact that most are nothing more than self-advertisements, do they last long enough to make money for publishers and for the retail trade which ensures their distribution? Importantly, who are celebrities in the first place?        
	A working definition would be that a celebrity is one who is well known for his/her well-knownness. All celebrities are spawned by the mass media to sell magazines, newspapers, films and the like but they are different from those who achieve fame irrespective of the mass media. In his book, The Image, the American historian Daniel Boorstin had defined the difference between well-knownness for its sake (modern celebrity or page three characters) and fame as the product of greatness (old-fashioned heroism). The hero was distinguished by his achievement, the celebrity by his image or trademark. Put another way, fame rooted in achievement was enduring, the image withered away.        
	Yet, books by celebrities are churned out every month because, in the public eye, their names carry a guarantee of reliability which implies the guarantee of a well-thought out, well-made, well-advertised product. It may turn out to be nothing of the sort on closer scrutiny after the first flush of publicity but the hype ensures that a substantial portion of the print run is moved out quickly, if only to keep the gossip wheels churning.        
	Given the hype that accompanies the release of every celebrity book, plus the reviews and juicy extracts that are published, the retail trade does its bit to move the book. Their reasons are simple: all celebrity books carry a hefty discount (publishers know within themselves that these books have a short shelf-life), plus there is the assurance that unsold copies would be taken back by the publishers and full credit given for them. The trade, in other words, is covered against all risks; all that needs to be done is to see to it that all stocks are carried and copies displayed prominently. The publicity and gossip columns do the rest. For the trade, it is a win-win situation, whichever way you look at it.        
	For publishers, there is an upside and a downside. The upside is that they get a great deal of pre-release publicity irrespective of the editorial quality of the book. Besides, all publishers know that no book by a celebrity would be critically commented on; there is too much goodwill to be lost by the media if they go out and trash it. At best, they would keep quiet or overlook factual errors and sloppiness of style.        
	The downside is that celebrity books dont sell beyond 1000 copies  and thats an overestimate. There are two reasons for this. First, a great deal of what they have to say has been covered either in the news columns or in the extracts which are selectively given out by the publishers to the media and are taken from different sections of the book. Why buy the book when the contents are already familiar to those who are interested in it?        
	Secondly, celebrities are difficult customers to handle: they demand too much by way of royalties and advances, as also post-publication publicity which includes lavish release functions. Probably these celebrities take their cue from publishers in the west  even these dont splurge the way some of us do  but most Indian publishers dont have the same scale of resources. Some top-end Indian publishers have therefore decided to keep celebrity books at arms length. They are essentially parables of perishability.

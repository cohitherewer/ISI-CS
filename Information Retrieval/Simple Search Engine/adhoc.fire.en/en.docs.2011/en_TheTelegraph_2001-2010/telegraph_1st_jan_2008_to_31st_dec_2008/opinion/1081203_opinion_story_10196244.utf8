                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             PRESIDENTS TEAM                                                    
	Barack Obama, the president designate of the United States of America, in choosing his team to lead the country, has demonstrated that he prefers talent and expertise to ideology. It will not be invalid to read this as a sign of the manner in which he intends to run the presidency. The national security team is bipartisan in character. The defence secretary of the previous presidency, Robert Gates, will continue with the same portfolio under Mr Obama. His secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, was his bitterest rival within the Democratic party. Mr Obama will obviously not be constrained by past squabbles, and will make a sincere effort to run the country not through his cronies, but with the best available team. His intentions were clear when he said, I assembled this team because Im a strong believer in strong personalities and strong opinions. I think thats how the best decisions are made. He wants, he declared, a vigorous debate inside the White House. The faith in strong personalities and debate means that Mr Obama is willing to be told by members of his team when they feel that he is wrong. Only a truly self-confident president has the courage to make himself genuinely primus inter pares, and yet carry the can.        
	What will be most heartening for Mr Obamas critics is his choice of economic advisors who are all people of the centre. Larry Summers, about whom Henry Kissinger reputedly said that every president should have an office for him in the White House, will be the chairman of the National Economic Council, and thus be in charge of co-ordinating economic policymaking. Tim Geithner, who becomes the treasury secretary, was previously the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. He is also known for his pragmatic and centrist views. There appears to be little chance of Mr Obamas ship of state acquiring any leftward tilt. This should not be taken to mean that he will renege on his promise to pull out US combat troops from Iraq within 16 months. He remains committed to that promise. The bigger promise was that of change, which obviously has no time-line. What is clear, however, from Mr Obamas quick announcement of his core team is that the change will be led by some of the best and brightest minds that the US has to offer. A young and dynamic president with an experienced team seems a combination almost too good to be true.

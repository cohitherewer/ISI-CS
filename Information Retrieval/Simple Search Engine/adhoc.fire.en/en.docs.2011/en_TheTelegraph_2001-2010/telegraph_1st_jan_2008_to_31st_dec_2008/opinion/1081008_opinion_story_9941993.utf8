The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Polls apart
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       POLLS APART                              Exit polls may or may not influence voting patterns.   But the government will probably amend the Representation of the People Act to lay down certain guidelines for these surveys, reports   V. Kumara Swamy                                                FREE AND FAIR: Voting is about independent, individual choice		      
	In 1998 the Election Commission of India (EC) issued a set of guidelines that included a proposal to ban the publication of opinion polls 48 hours before the start of voting, and exit polls until the end of the election process. But during the general elections in 1999, the media chose to simply ignore the guidelines, forcing the EC to approach the Supreme Court.        
	At that time, the apex court dismissed the ECs petition, saying that the commission was overstepping its jurisdiction. But this time around, with the law ministry considering an amendment to the Representation of the People Act, 1951, pre and post poll surveys could well become subject to some stringent restrictions. Although the Union Cabinet is yet to discuss the ministrys proposal, some changes to the law are likely before the general elections next year.        
	Sub-section 1(b), Section 126 of the Representation of the People Act states: No person shall display to the public any election matter by means of cinematograph, television or other similar apparatus during the 48-hour period ending with the conclusion of the voting. Election matter is defined as any matter intended or calculated to influence or affect the result of an election. Any violation of this section is punishable with imprisonment for a maximum of two years.        
	The government is likely to include opinion polls and exit polls in this particular section.        
	I feel this is unacceptable government interference in the freedom of the press, says Sonia Singh, senior managing editor, NDTV 24/7. Even if the polls are not always accurate, they are unbiased, unmotivated data that political parties often dont like  hence the knee jerk reaction to ban all polls, she says. NDTV is also contesting a public interest litigation (PIL) filed in the Supreme Court against the publication of opinion and exit polls.        
	Of course, any move to ban or restrict these polls is likely to be challenged in the courts and will be termed a violation of the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 (1)(a) of the Constitution.        
	However, Supreme Court advocate P.S.V.L. Narasimha, who is arguing the PIL case on behalf of one D.K. Thakur, says that the freedom of the press (which is part of freedom of speech and expression) is not absolute. The freedoms we enjoy come with certain restrictions. In a way, these surveys distort the democratic process by influencing the decision making process of voters. That is reason enough for these polls to be banned, he says.        
	Political parties too are unanimous in their opinion that there should be some restrictions on publishing these surveys. Prior to the last general elections in 2004, an all-party delegation to the EC had called for a ban on opinion polls from the first day of the notification of elections (which varies between three weeks and a fortnight before the polls) and a ban on exit polls until the end of voting in the last phase of the elections.        
	I am fiercely in favour of an independent media, but some sections have virtually resorted to blackmail by publishing motivated opinion polls based on their own political leanings. We need some form of legislation to put an end to this unethical practice, says BJP member of Parliament Yashwant Sinha.        
	But doesnt the dissemination of the results of opinion and exit polls come under ones right to information? The EC begs to differ. Past experience shows that in many cases, the result of elections have been vastly different from the results predicted by exit polls. Thus, the information claimed to be disseminated turned out to be disinformation in many cases, the EC notes in its Proposed Electoral Reforms document issued in 2004.        
	Many psephologists are also not against some broad guidelines for opinion and exit polls. There should be no opinion or exit polls until the end of all phases of voting. The legislation should also lay stress on the transparency and accountability of the organisations and media houses that commission these polls, says Rajeev Karandi-kar, a psephologist.        
	Adds P.N. Vasanti, director, Centre for Media Studies (CMS), Delhi, We support the governments move as too many unscrupulous people have given a bad name to opinion polls. Most of these polls are neither credible nor scientific. In fact, CMS stopped conducting opinion polls during elections around five years ago.        
	There is, of course, no consensus on whether or not pre-poll surveys actually do influence voting. There is no research or any evidence to suggest that opinion polls affect voting behaviour, asserts NDTVs Singh.        
	But C.M. Lyngdoh, former chief election commissioner, points out that though opinion polls have been remarkably inaccurate, there is a case against the publication of these surveys, especially during assembly elections when some states go for polls in phases. In such cases, one regions voting pattern could have some influence on others. Vasanti of CMS agrees. We have conducted extensive surveys and found that these polls do influence the voting pattern, she says.        
	The Press Council of India (PCI) reveals that the media are not following its guidelines on opinion polls during elections. One of these guidelines states: No newspaper shall publish exit poll surveys, however genuine they may be, till the last of the polls is over.        
	If the media are not following the guidelines of its own watchdog, there is no other way but to wait for a clear-cut direction either from the courts or the government, says Vibha Bhargava, secretary, PCI.        
	Currently, India is part of an elite club of democracies like the UK and the US where there are no restrictions on the conduct of surveys during elections. But countries like Canada, France and Italy have introduced some restrictions on pre-poll surveys. In France the publication of opinion polls on the day before the vote is banned, while in Italy the ban extends to a fortnight.        
	Though the government is mulling changes to the Representation of the People Act, senior Supreme Court lawyer and constitutional expert K.K. Venugopal cautions against taking any hasty step. He refers to a Canadian Supreme Court ruling of 1998 that struck down a government order on a ban on the publication of opinion polls 72 hours prior to elections because it was deemed a violation of the freedom of expression. The court had observed that such a ban sends the message that the media can be constrained by the government not to publish factual information. But the court also gave certain guidelines that the government adopted, says Venugopal.        
	Having some guidelines in place will be for our own good as the credibility of opinion and exit polls has nose-dived in recent years, says Karandikar. Naturally, media houses want none of that. As Singh stresses, Let the freedom of the press and the right to conduct pre-poll surveys stay as an important part of our democracy.        
	Clearly, the law ministry has a delicate task at hand.

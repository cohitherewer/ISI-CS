                 The Ajanta caves make Somak Ghoshal wonder what it means for them to be in the World Heritage list
                      
	My first-ever trip to the Ajanta caves could not have been more ill-timed. When I finally reached there from Aurangabad, my heart leapt at the sight of the caves  sublime, enchanting, mysterious, even from a distance. But the very next moment my heart sank. It was Christmas Day, 2007, and the vacationers were all over the place. 
    
	The shimmering winter sun had put the crowd in a hearty mood. Wild children had to be restrained, students lectured at, family members summoned. Inside the dimly-lit caves, it seemed as if the baser instincts had been let loose. Flash photography  now strictly prohibited  went on surreptitiously, hands swept over the pillars, motifs and sculptures. (The figurines, smoothened by these endless caresses, tellingly reveal which parts of the female anatomy have delighted the male visitors most.)
    
	Despite the mayhem, the art remained unshakeably great. Densely populated murals, teeming with indescribably beautiful faces, grotesqueries and animals  all looked up to the Buddha, the Pristinely Beautiful One. The colours had fallen off here and there: what had been painted on stone seemed to be morphing into stone again. While members of the Archaeological Survey of India were absorbed in restoration, the visitors continued to be blas. In the absence of any formal introduction, conducted tours or accessible literature, how are the people supposed to make sense of all this art anyway? What is the point of historical conservation if it fails to bring the public into the fold of history? 
    
	But art has its inner workings, its remarkable ability to accommodate and authenticate even starkly disparate reactions. Even as I felt piqued by the people enjoying their homemade lunch or taking a siesta on the premises, I could not help noting the odd naturalness of their reactions. These caves, after all, were home to a community of monks centuries ago; no wonder people still found these places homely. Yet this same place  with its ineffable resonances, and memories  had made me feel distinctly uncanny. Suddenly both these reactions appeared to be opposed but equally valid at the same time. 
    
	Admittedly, the difference in reactions arose from differing levels of awareness. With our liberal education, some of us could locate this experience in an art-historical context. The place made sense to us, we were aware of its aesthetics, and our awareness could not be shared by many others. But, consciously or not, what all of us did share was another kind of awareness  that, as citizens of the country, we are equally entitled to access this place. Depending on their ways of seeing, some people might think the caves to be natural formations, painted, years ago, by people as talented as any village craftsman. But the others knew, with intense self-consciousness, the unique historical value of the caves. And this knowledge instinctively told them how to behave.
    
	What we had entered, therefore, was a peculiarly ambivalent space. Even as Ajanta continues to be a historical fantasy, a repository of timeless beauty, contemporary realities have caught on with it. For years, the place was hidden away until discovered by some officers of the Madras Army in the early years of the 19th century. Since then, it had been safeguarded by various institutions  the colonial State, the ASI, voluntary organizations across the world, and finally, by the post-colonial State. Principles of democracy have made this place travel: what had been revealed to a few officers has spread the whole world over. The caves now constitute a World Heritage Site, and the global resonance of World Heritage proves how irredeemably public these sites have become.
    
	This publicness is richly problematic: while democracy facilitates access to art (through historical conservations, museums, art galleries), it also homogenizes the enjoyment of art. By conferring a necessarily public character on the site of art, democratic systems fail to account for the essential privateness of viewing art. When we  the public  go to see the Ajanta caves, each of us carries our own privacies there, leading to different responses, conflicting and valid all at once. The State gives us the right to express awe, boredom, irritation, mirth or disdain. Thus in a democracy, Art has to exist on the interface between the Self and the State, as inescapably both public and private, and suffer the the risk of a clash of sensibilities.
    
	Thus the caves become as much of a private, as a public, property. Although the idea holds true as a general principle of art conservation, it is susceptible to different interpretations and uses. The ownership of great art is not an easy gift. Britain learnt this with the legal battles over the possession of the Elgin Marbles, and the world saw a more perverse claim of proprietorship with the talibans destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas. I did not want to destroy the Bamiyan Buddha, the taliban leader, Mullah Omar, confessed in 2004, some foreigners said they would like to conduct the repair work of the Bamiyan Buddha that had been slightly damaged due to rains... This shocked methese callous people have no regard for thousands of living human beings  the Afghans who are dying of hunger, but they are so concerned about non-living objects like the Buddha. This was extremely deplorable. That is why I ordered its destruction. Had they come for humanitarian work, I would have never ordered the Buddhas destruction. 
       
	This cannot be a justification. But it does not take away from the human reality that Omar invokes, particularly in relation to India. Here, too, the abundance of non-living objects matches up to the living, the plenitude of what needs to be protected and preserved is as daunting as the masses that have to be provided for. The conservation of heritage sites, therefore, might have been happening in the letter, but the spirit of it would continue to remain elusive until its underlying principles learn to reckon with the burden of our modernity. To do this, principles of conservation have to evolve  and that promise is already in evidence in the restoration of the gardens of Humayuns Tomb in Delhi, done jointly by the Aga Khan Foundation and the ASI. Both the conservation activity and the funding of it have to make difficult negotiations with the social realities of modern India. Who owns the nations past, and hence the heritage from that past, will be determined by how we choose to be responsible for our modernity.

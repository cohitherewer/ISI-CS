	Those Eighties shows                  
	Sir  An entire generation of Indians grew up in the Eighties watching brilliant television shows such as Darpan, Kathasagar, Ek Kahani (based on the worlds best short stories); Kacchi Dhoop, Indradhanush (for children); Humlog, Buniyaad (for the family); Rajni (on subjects of public interest). Be it in concept, content or presentation, these shows were of a far superior quality than the fare dished out these days. I appeal to Doordarshan to re-telecast them for todays generation. Private channels can, in fact, buy the rights to some of these shows and air them.          
	Yours faithfully,        Dipak Mantri, Kalimpong 
                  
	Whither kindness?          
	Sir  It was extremely distressing to read about the predicament of the octogenarian Hiranprabha Bhowmick in Jalpaiguri (Six sons, but none to call Ma, May 28). The report and the poignant photograph accompanying it are bound to remind us that some sons and daughters living among us have ceased to be human beings. The Indian legislators should immediately promulgate strict laws against such errant individuals.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Pinaki Roy, Balurghat

                
	Sir  Six sons, but none to call Ma is an effective tearjerker. But how could it be that all six sons of Hiranprabha Bhowmik, and their spouses, are pictures of unrelieved evil? And if they indeed are, what does it say about the upbringing of the sons and the values that their mother trained them in?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Pal, Batanagar 

                
	Sir  It is shocking to hear that a cent-per-cent disabled woman, Chaitali Bairagya, was rudely displaced from her seat in a state-owned long-distance bus by the conductor (Sightless woman yanked off seat, May 28). This shameful incident is yet another evidence of the declining human values and deepening cultural void in Bengal. Instances of unscrupulous behaviour towards passengers by bus drivers and conductors are a-dime-a-dozen nowadays, but such hard-heartedness towards a disabled lady has very little precedence. Bairagya has done the right thing by filing a complaint with the police against the conductor. We expect proper action to be taken soon against the errant conductor. It must also be investigated how a government bus could be allowed to run without the mandatory reservation of seats for the disabled. The conductors act has left me quite speechless.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Proma Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Why is proper communication still eluding New Town, Rajarhat? First the people were lured by promises of Metro Railway. Then, shockingly, New Town was bypassed in the proposed East-West Metro project. Enough bus routes have not been introduced in this area. Builders are being provided land for joint venture housing projects in remote corners of New Town, as is the case with the completed Greenfield Heights housing complex in Action Area-ID (DJ-5). Here, about 70-odd families in around 550 flats have already moved in. This project is a good two kilometres away from the nearest point on the Rajarhat Megacity Road and without any means of communication whatsoever. Even at this point, only one bus (AS-4) is available. There are no street lights on this stretch. How are the inhabitants of Greenfield to cross it after dark without personal conveyance? And most MIG/ LIG families here do not own cars. There is no security beyond the boundaries of the complex. Before any untoward incident happens, the government departments concerned should erect lamp posts and introduce as many bus routes as possible.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Rajesh Bhattacharyya, Calcutta

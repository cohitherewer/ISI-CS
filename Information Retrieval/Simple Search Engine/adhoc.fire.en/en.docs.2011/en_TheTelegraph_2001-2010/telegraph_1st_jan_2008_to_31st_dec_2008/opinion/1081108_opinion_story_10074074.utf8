The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Time has taken its toll
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Time has taken its toll                              This Above All      Khushwant Singh                                                    Those were the days      
	Loss of youth is a popular theme in Urdu poetry. The picture of an old man crippled with age, walking with his head bent low as if searching for something he lost, is thematic  Javanee jaatee rahee, aur hamein pataa bhee na chalaa  I lost my youth and I didnt even know  issee ko dhoond raha hoon kamar jhukaye huey  it is this I am looking for with my waist bent low. Another poet compared the world to a serai where people come to stay for a while and then go their way; so, youth comes and departs, never to return, but once old age comes, it stays to the end of ones days.        
	Mirza Ghalib was most eloquent on the subject, recalling nightly drunken orgies of his youthful days that have now became memories of the past:        
	Voh baad-e-shabaana kee sar mastiyaan kahaan?
  Utthiya kay ab lazzat-i-khwaab-i-seher gayee        
	Those night-long orgies of drinking,where have they gone?
  Get up, far gone are sweet dreams of dawn.
    
	And    
	Maara zamaaney nay Asadullah  Khan tumhein
  Voh valvaley kahaan, voh jaavanee kidhar gayee?                
	Asadullah Khan, the times had taken their toll and left you dead.
  Where have the frivolities gone? Where has your youth fled?          
	Singing sensation                
	He is a sardar, but not the stereotype that sardars are for many people. He certainly looks one with his turban and beard. He is of sturdy built. Although 58, sporting a greying beard, he looks a good ten years younger. First, his name: Dya (instead of Daya) Singh; then, his speech: he speaks both Punjabi and English fluently without the slightest trace of a local accent. He is highly educated: a chartered accountant with a degree from England and is in the consultancy business in Australia. But he is best known as a raagi, a singer of gurbani. Unlike other raagis, who sing ragas of Hindustani music with harmoniums and tablas, he has evolved a style of singing, which is a mix of Eastern and Western styles of music. He sings with guitars and banjos. He is accompanied by his troupe composed of white Australians. Gurdwaras do not admit them and yet they draw large audiences of Sikhs and non-Sikhs to their performances wherever they go. I have records of Dya Singh singing the Sikhs five daily prayers (nit neym) and the morning hymn, Asa di vaar. Everyone who has heard him acknowledges the fact that although at first it sounds strange to the ear used to hearing gurbani in conventional form, where the music often blurs the message, with Dya Singh it is the other way round  the divine message came through clearer than in the keertans we heard.        
	Dya Singh was in Delhi recently for a few days. He dropped in to see me and I got some details of his life and career.         
	He is the son of Giani Harchand Singh, who was a regimental granthi-cum-preacher, attached to a Sikh regiment in the British Indian army. He gave up his job to become a granthi teacher and a raagi in a gurdwara in Malaysia. Dya Singh was born in Raub in Malaysia on Baisakhi day (April 13) in 1950, and is a Malaysian citizen (the family originally came from Rai Kot Basiyan near Ludhiana and the members are Dualiwal Jats). He first went to a Muslim primary school, and before he learnt Sikh prayers, he was taught how to perform namaaz. It reminded me of Guru Nanaks first disciple, the Muslim rhubarb player, Bhai Mardana, whose descendants remained the chief keertaniyas of the Harimandir in Amritsar till 1947.         
	Dya Singh then joined an English medium school in Kuala Lumpur. At the age of 12, he began to sing ghazals and gurbani in Indian programmes for Radio Malaysia. His inspiration were Mohammed Rafi, Jagjit Singh, Bhai Avatar Singh and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. But he evolved a style of singing of his own. He earned enough to go to England for higher studies. In the mean time, he had also fallen in love with a local girl, married her, and had the eldest of their three daughters.        
	Dya Singh completed his course for chartered accountancy and decided to settle in Australia. The family now lives in Adelaide. He gives public performances of his style of keertan in different parts of the world. He has not had as much exposure as he deserves in the land of his ancestors. He is a unique phenomenon.                
	Indian on the moon  
	It will be a jolly good idea
  To have an Indian on the moon!
  We, the pavement-dwellers, will look up, up
  And expand our skinny, shrinking chests
  With justified glory and pride.
  With bated breath shall we wait
  For manna and honey-dew
  To fall from heaven,
  While our national dustmen (pardon, Dickens)
  Play their dirty games
  In the national dustyard
  To capture or retain the throne,
  By hook, crook, or by bribe.
  Well wait and wait till eternity,
  For patience is the badge of ourtribe.

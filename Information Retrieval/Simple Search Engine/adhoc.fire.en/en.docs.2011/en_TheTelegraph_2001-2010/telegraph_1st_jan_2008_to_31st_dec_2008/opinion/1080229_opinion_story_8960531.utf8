	Blood continues to flow as easily in Sri Lanka as in Pakistan  both sites of routine suicide attacks and bombings. But it is doubtful if the people of the island country can look forward to the cessation of violence with as much hope as post-election Pakistan. Sri Lanka is about to hold its local council elections in the highly-volatile east in accordance with the recently-announced devolution plan of the All Party Representative Committee, which the president has agreed to. Apprehensions of unceasing hostilities should sound false at a time when the government is taking the first political steps towards peace after decades of violence. Unfortunately, the circumstances do not warrant much optimism. The plan to fully implement the 13th amendment of the constitution that would allow the maximum devolution of powers to the north and east revives the ghost of the Indo-Lankan accord of 1987 along with its unpleasant memories. It grants limited autonomy to the areas without their merger, which was assured by the accord and then struck down by the countrys supreme court last year. The devolution plan has incited as much political furore as it did about four decades ago. Tamil groups, both moderate and hardcore, have already rejected it to a body and the Sinhala nationalist parties like the Janatha Vimukti Perumana are once again raising the political pitch by decrying it as a sellout to separatists.        
	The show of competitive chauvinism that determines the dynamics of Sinhala politics is unlikely to allow for the success of even the most limited of devolution packages in the Tamil-dominated areas of the country. And the hypocrisy of a government that continues to promote a militarist strategy at the cost of a composite political plan cannot help matters much. The Mahinda Rajapakse government might be trying its best to appear to be promoting a political solution. But its half-heartedness is bound to kill the initiative.

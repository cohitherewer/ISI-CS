                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FROM SHADOW TO SUBSTANCE                                                                  
	The Dance of Death By Vandana Kumari Jena, Har-Anand, Rs 295        
	Vandana Jena had hitherto limited her output to writing middles and short stories. In her first novel, she writes about a small-town girl and her small dreams. Life gives the girl a raw deal. Circumstances and fate are against her, but she refuses to go under and finally breaks free.        
	This is a dark novel, almost veering towards an Indian gothic. Chhaya, the protagonist, gets married to an IPS officer and goes off to the moss-green, perfectly sculpted mountains of Manipur. The idyll is shattered when the husband tries to take on the drug menace in the state head-on. He suffers an injury and is metamorphosed into a jealous wife-beater. Paradise turns into purgatory, and divorce is the inevitable fallout.        
	There follows a second marriage for Chhaya, but soon, the second husband is killed in an accident. It transpires later that the accident was actually a murder committed by the first husband. Chhaya loses her first-born in its infancy. She also carries within her the guilt of being responsible for her brothers death. There are whispers of parental infidelity.        
	The beginning is Solomon Grundy-ish: I was married at twenty-two, divorced at twenty-six, married again at twenty-nine and widowed barely a year later. Chhaya, however, draws sustenance from the fact that others have fared worse. There is her cousin, Shakti, who is dying from AIDS contracted from her husband. It is as if a man without a shoe meets a man without a leg.        
	Unhappiness can also be lessened through sharing or by attaching oneself to a cause which gives a view of the world below. The novel takes us to HIV support groups and to literacy camps in trans-Yamuna colonies. There are conversations with cousins Shakti and Surabhi. The first is trying to come to terms with a gay husband, AIDS and a tryst with death, while the second tries to cope with burn scars and a husband with a roving eye. Every life has its quota of pain.        
	The novel is refreshingly unhypocritical. Chhaya thinks of food as she opens the fridge immediately after the death of her second husband. Two months into widowhood, she succumbs to the demands of her body and sleeps with her first husband who had once battered her. Chhaya straddles an internal world that is part Waiting to Exhale and part Of Human Bondage.        
	In the end, Jenas protagonist breaks free and goes off to Cambridge. She tells herself, You are no longer an appendage or a shadow of someone. You are a woman of substance. You no longer need a tag. You are. Jenas novel is a tribute to those who are known to hold up half the sky.                           CHAMPAK CHATTERJI

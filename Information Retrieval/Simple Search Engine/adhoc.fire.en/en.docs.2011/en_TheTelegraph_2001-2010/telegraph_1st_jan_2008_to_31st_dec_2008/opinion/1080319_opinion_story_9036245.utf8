The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Out of fashion   Eye-opener   In good faith
                                                                                                                 STREET LEGAL                       Out of fashion
    A fashion show was organised in Gorakhpur in UP. The proceeds from the show was to go towards setting up an institute of fashion designing. When the tax department asked for entertainment tax, the organisers refused to pay up contending that it was a charity show, there was no entry fee and no element of entertainment involved. The Supreme Court, however, was not convinced. The court believed the invitation card indicated that the objective of the organisers was to invite people to see an exotic fashion show. If the fashion show did not have tickets and entry was by invitation only, it was to evade taxes, the court held and asked the organisers to pay up (Amit Kumar vs State of UP).    Eye-opener
    The UP government has reserved two per cent of all government posts for physically handicapped persons. A blind man who was not selected for a Class III post for Bulandshahr judgeship filed a writ petition. As there were altogether 30 posts, two per cent of them was 0.6 per cent. As that was more than half, the court rounded it off to one and held that since there were no other candidates in the reserved category, the applicant was entitled to the post (Bhudev Sharma vs District Judge, Bulandshahr and another).     In good faith
    A home guard and an excise sub-inspector were both convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act for taking bribe. The bribe had actually been demanded by the sub-inspector for returning the stock register which was ceased when the wineshop of the complainant was raided. He had asked the complainant to pay the money to the home guard if he was not there. As there was no sub-treasury in the area, it was prevalent practice to hand over money to the staff if anybody wanted to remit money to the government so the home guard did not suspect anything when the money was handed over to him. As it was established that the home guard had no knowledge that the money was a bribe and had acted in good faith, the Supreme Court held that he had no role in returning the stock register and set aside the order of conviction against him (K. Subba Reddy vs State of Andhra Pradesh).

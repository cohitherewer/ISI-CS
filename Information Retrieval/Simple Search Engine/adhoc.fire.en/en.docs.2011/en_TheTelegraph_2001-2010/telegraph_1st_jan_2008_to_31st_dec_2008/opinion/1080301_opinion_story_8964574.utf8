The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A legend rendered beautifully
                                                                                                                 A LEGEND RENDERED BEAUTIFULLY                              Ananda Lal      Theatre                                                
	The return of senior director, Shyamanand Jalan, to the Hindi stage after a prolonged retirement due to ill health calls for celebration  not so much for sentimental reasons as for the concrete results demonstrating that his innovative eye remains undiminished. Last year, his production of H.S. Shiva Prakashs Madhavi, based on the classical Tamil Silappadikaram, heralded his comeback typically with something new  the first local interpretation in any language of this leading contemporary Kannada dramatist. Understandably it seemed somewhat tentative, almost a warm-up exercise, taking just about an hour. Before the year was out though, he began work on the full-length Lahron ke Rajhans, Mohan Rakeshs retelling of Asvaghoshas Sanskrit Saundarananda. Some cynics did not regard this with much interest, pointing out that Jalan had collaborated with Rakesh to produce the revised Lahron in 1966, so it is, at best, a revival.        
	However, Jalan has proved them wrong with a finely conceptualized production. Before entering the small Padatik Buildwell Theatre, one has to remove footwear, placing one in a ceremonial, if not spiritual, frame of mind. One treads the white-sheeted floor softly and gazes appreciatively, if not in awe, at Sanchayan Ghoshs beautiful installation of the heroine Sundaris chamber in sixth-century BC Kapilavastu. Burning incense and, later, earthen lamps add to the sensory impression of a ritualistic performance, also recalling similar effects in Madhavi. From early days, Jalan has experimented with the possibilities of theatre space (Chhapte Chhapte used arena staging in 1963); in Lahron, he makes us literally intruders into the private world of Sundari and her husband Nand which, gradually, turns into our public domain.        
	Ghoshs tactile design makes no attempt at historical accuracy, but is imaginatively opulent, manifesting Sundaris luxuriance in the physical  drapes, both thick and fine, hang on all sides, as well as different ropes suspending a seat (harking back to the swing in Madhavi), hammock and make-up counter. Sensual cushions and bolsters lie strewn on the ground, a sunken level from which Nand wants to rise away. The russet and suede colours of the textiles and leather, complemented by Swarup Duttas elegant costumes, reinforce Sundaris connection to the earth. I would go so far as to suggest that the set becomes a main character, as changeable as any human, when Sudip Sanyals layered lighting falls on it, bright in daytime, shredded through gobos at night.        
	Ancient epics and lush decor alone do not link Lahron and Madhavi. Both legendary stories centre on a woman in love who sees nothing beyond the object of her admittedly genuine and flawless passion; who, like Tagores Sudarshana, lives and believes in romance. But unlike Sudarshana, these two remain unredeemed. The courtesan Madhavis lover never appears because he has died; in Lahron, the author moves Sundari to one side so that Nand can symbolize existential humanity trapped between two equal desires, of the flesh and of the spirit. Both women suffer under erotic spells waiting to be broken. Either way, since Anubha Fatehpuria plays both heroines, considerable overlap occurs in her portrayals. This is not to say that her powerfully emotional acting is weak, but that viewers may notice repetitions in her characterization.        
	Unusually, Rakesh paints the unseen Buddha, in his insistence on converting his stepbrother Nand to his faith, as extreme in his demand for absolute allegiance as that of Sundari, the unforgiving votary of romantic love. Vinay Sharma (Nand), caught in the middle, expresses the universal dilemma in a role unlike any he has done so far. True, near the end, he shouts uncharacteristically when most other actors may have retreated into stoic calm, but he follows Rakeshs instructions to become more aggressive at that point.        
	As director, Jalan could edit speeches in the first half to make it tighter. Among the supporting cast, Nandini Panjiyara as the maid must correct her habit of attending to her mistress with her left hand. For instrumental support, one must mention Kunal Padhy in his new avatar as soundtrack composer of, appropriately, an all-acoustic Indian musical accompaniment.        
	Jalan omits Rakeshs very last sequence, where Nand leaves his home after Sundari tells him to go. In this less decisive but more (laudably) uncertain and anguished version, husband and wife keep looking at each other as the lights fade out.

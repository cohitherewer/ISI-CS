	The parliament is the citadel of democracy. Any reduction or deterioration in the functioning of parliament is an erosion of democracy. India, despite its pride at being the worlds largest democracy, is witnessing the diminution of parliament. The most recent example of this is the proposal that the present session of the Lok Sabha should be clipped by at least four weeks. If this proposal becomes reality then the Lok Sabha, in this second phase of its monsoon session, would have sat for six days. This means that the current session is no more than a token one since nothing of any consequence can be deliberated upon in six days. The ostensible reason for curtailing the session is that elections have been announced in six states, and members of parliament would have to be away from the capital to campaign in these states. There are at least two reasons why this line of reasoning is spurious. One is that at no point of time will all MPs have to be away. Political parties should ensure that all their MPs are not away. Attending parliament is as important  if not more important  in a democracy as electioneering. The other reason is the fact, seldom mentioned, that in 2008 parliament has met for only 32 days. This suggests that generally, and not only during elections, parliament has been ignored.        
	This decline in the number of sittings is, in fact, part of a trend: in 2003, parliament sat for only 74 days. This is in sharp contrast to the early days of the Lok Sabha when it met for 151 days in 1956 and 137 days in 1953. The decision to have fewer sittings is an ominous sign for parliament and, therefore, also for democracy. One important factor should not be ignored in this discussion. This is the unruliness and disruption that are on display on the floor of the House. This makes impossible any meaningful discussion and hinders the entire process of democratic governance. These disruptions mean that forms of street politics are being allowed to encroach into the halls of democracy. The government, instead of taking adequate steps to counter this tendency, is taking the easy escape route. New entrants into the culture of democracy must be educated, and it is the responsibility of the senior MPs to institute procedures of such training. Otherwise, the future of democratic politics is bleak. The best tonic for democracy is more democracy, not fewer sittings of parliament  which seems to be the conventional wisdom.

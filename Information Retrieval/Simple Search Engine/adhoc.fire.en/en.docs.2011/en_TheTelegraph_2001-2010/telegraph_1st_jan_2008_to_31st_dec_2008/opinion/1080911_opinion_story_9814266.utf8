	This could be the end of the world as we know it. Quite literally so. Sceptics quaked in apprehension as the Large Hadron Collider was switched on yesterday at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (called Cern after its French acronym) in Geneva. Two decades of relentless research by scientists from across 111 nations and a staggering investment of 4.4 billion have finally triggered off the most ambitious experiment ever conceived by modern science  bringing human beings close to absolute knowledge; or perhaps to total extinction. So far, chances of the former are higher, although scientists continue to be sharply divided over the outcome. Optimists see this 27-km-long tunnel, running between Switzerland and France, as the key to unravel the deepest mysteries of the universe and finally figure out the ever-elusive theory of everything. Until this historic breakthrough at Cern, fundamental physics was immersed in the knotty problems of string theory, offering, at best, a few exciting, although unverifiable, theories. The LHC is the long-awaited missing link between theoretical and experimental physics  a device that finally gives abstract ideas a concrete reality. In the LHC, two beams of subatomic particles called hadrons  either protons or lead ions  are allowed to travel in opposite directions inside a circular accelerator. Optimal conditions are needed: an exceptionally strong magnetic field, generated by an enormously high voltage electric current passed through wires cooled to 271C by liquid helium and nitrogen.        
	Such high-speed collisions  close to the speed of light  would produce a tremendous energy, close to what the Big Bang had generated. In this way, a baby universe will be born in a gigantic test-tube, and along with it some of the primal worries of science would be resolved: are there more than three dimensions? What is anti-matter? What are dark matter and dark energy? And, most crucially, what is the god particle or Higgs-Boson, that repository of the ultimate secrets of particle physics? The LHC not only bridges the gulf between physics and philosophy, but also pushes science into the frontiers of poetry. Such deadly games can only be inspired either by a poetic madness or boundless curiosity  the sort that makes a child smash a clock to see what makes it tick. What else would make sane minds risk the world being sucked into a black hole ?

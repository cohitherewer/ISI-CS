The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Patent law offers   rich pickings
                                                                                                                 Patent law offers   rich pickings                              Law schools are beginning to teach intellectual property rights, as   Rahul Jayaram finds out                                                      Signature-tune: An artist should take that little step when he feels his rights are being infringed        
	When Bollywood music director Bappi Lahiri won a famous lawsuit against the US hip hop artist Dr Dre and music band Truth Hurts for lifting portions of music from yesteryear hit Thoda Resham Lagta Hai in 2002, many commentators in India thought it was a watershed in the history of ownership rights in the country. The case not only proved that Indian musicians had the pluck to take on the might of American music companies, but also that they were aware of their rights; over property, their arts, their technology, their ideas. In the event, it also brought into focus a much-neglected legal arena: Intellectual property rights (IPR). Bappi Lahiris case, said experts, was the tip of the iceberg.         
	Well, that iceberg seems to be now thawing. Recently, Microsoft announced a Rs 2.6-million-worth scholarship programme in 11 law schools in India to train students in IPR. The scholarship was first established in 2006 when NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad, in collaboration with Microsoft India, set up a scheme for its students interested in the subject. The Microsoft IPR Scholar Programme, soon to be extended to law students in India, also has a website, legaladda.com, for law buffs and legal eagles to network and learn.         
	Moves are on to prop up the IPR infrastructure and generate a pool of experts in a field that was once virgin territory and is now just waiting to be ploughed. There are roughly only 60 patent lawyers in India, says Ankhi Das, head, corporate citizenship, Microsoft India. Given that situation and the rate at which Indias growing, there is a big need for IPR specialists.         
	The requirement reflects a changing India. Understanding IPR is a way of insulation against abuse of copyright. The number and quality of patents filed have gone up and both indicate the growing level of rights awareness, says Dr V.C. Vivekanandan, head, centre for IP law studies, NALSAR, specialising in patents in the pharmaceuticals industry.         
	Agrees lawyer Neel Mason of Mason amp; Associates, Delhi, who deals with copyright work for the rock band Indian Ocean. There used to be a time when companies thought if you went to court to claim ownership youd never know when the case would come up for hearing. That way of thinking is vanishing.               
	Bappi Lahiris run-in with corporate America wasnt the first instance of its kind. In 2000, a Texas-based firm, RiceTec Inc, had obtained a US patent for basmati rice lines and grains. The government of India challenged the claim through the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority and won the case. In 1997, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research successfully challenged the patent for turmeric obtained by another US firm.         
	Patents are an instrument of power. America, like Britain during the colonial era, attempts to monopolise the idea store of the globe. And if Indian firms have won hands down, its because of recognising their intellectual right and capital, says K.K. Rai, a senior advocate and ex-Supreme Court lawyer, who has fought pharmaceutical patent cases. We will soon, or already do, have a situation when companies will need a set of monitors  like stockbrokers watching scrip rates 24/7 on TV  who track what is happening to their products, how they are being used, and wherever necessary, credited.        
	Be it pharmaceuticals, music or the arts, automobile technology, software or publishing, patent-related horror tales abound. Musicians, for instance, are often taken to or move court on complaints of plagiarism or royalties not being paid. Hindustani classical singer Shubha Mudgal says she can write a book on the subject.         
	Leave out the experts, she says, people themselves need to know about what is theirs. Barring a few celebrity musicians, artistes in India do not have professionals managing their careers. I believe that artistes today must educate themselves about IPR as no one else will help them.         
	Piling on this ignorance is the fact that music companies have standard contracts that they thrust at you and ask you to sign. To compound matters, most of the contract is written in obscure legal jargon. When it comes to the media (both audio and visual), most artistes will never know when their song will be played, whether the channel or station had asked for permission or credited the singer, composer or lyricist.         
	When I receive royalties from overseas I also receive a log sheet which tells me which of my tracks were played on radio, for instance. But for domestic royalties there are no log sheets and no details, so I have no idea what I am receiving money for and I cannot challenge the calculation, she says. Mudgal argues that even if the laws in the country on IPR may be artiste-friendly, the system for ensuring fair play doesnt exist. Whats worse, she adds, is that none of the artists objects or protests.         
	However, Neel Mason feels the scenario in the music realm may be changing. Remember, bodies like the Indian Performing Rights Society and Phonographic Performance Ltd have been around for decades. They work to ensure copyright protection for musical works. Very often, an artist or musician just has to take that little step when he feels his rights are being infringed.         
	Vivekanandan says the existing Indian legal structure can ensure IPR protection. To institute proceedings against a person or company for IP infringement, most complainants invoke the Copyright Act under Indian laws. It has two sub sections  civil remedies and criminal remedies, for civil and criminal complaints respectively. It is, he argues, up to the affected parties to take up their grievances, do their homework about whom or where to go to, and fight for their IP rights. The quality of the suit filed influences the result in a big way, he says.         
	That seems to have hit home somewhere. Shubha Mudgal is now so knowledgeable about her IP rights that shes been branded a difficult artist to deal with by music companies. But on the flip side, shes also getting invitations to speak on IPR at seminars and conferences. Howzzat, she exclaims.

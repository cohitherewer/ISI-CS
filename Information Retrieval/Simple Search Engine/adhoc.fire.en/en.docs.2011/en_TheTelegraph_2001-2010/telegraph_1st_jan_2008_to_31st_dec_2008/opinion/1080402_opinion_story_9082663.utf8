                                                                                                                 RED LIGHTS                                                    
	The wholesale price index on March 15 was 223.6; on March 17, 2007, it was 209.6. It thus rose by 6.68 per cent in a year. The figures in the previous five weeks were 4.4, 4.9, 5.0, 5.1 and 5.9 per cent. A metric that looked almost benign only six weeks ago has begun to look menacing. The major component of the wholesale price index behind this precipitate rise is food articles. Their inflation has climbed from 3 per cent to 5.6 per cent. Still, inflation in food prices is consistently lower than overall. There is something else whose prices have risen even faster. It is fuel and power. Their inflation climbed from 4.2 to 6.6 per cent in the same period. Prices of oil products were increased in the second week of February. Since there was no increase in the previous February, there was a step-up in oil product inflation, which is feeding into the wholesale price index. The rise in the cost of living has been running in excess of wholesale price inflation. Between January and February, inflation in the cost of living rose from 5.6 to 6.4 per cent for agricultural labourers, from 5.9 to 6.1 per cent for rural labourers. Both months figure for industrial workers is lower  5.5 per cent. It was running higher through most of 2007.        
	The rumpus on inflation thus has two sources. One is oil companies decision to raise some product prices in February. The other is the creeping up of food prices. However, food price inflation is unlikely to continue. Food prices remained virtually unchanged in the first quarter of 2007, but increased by 3.3 per cent in the second quarter. That is an annualized rate of 14 per cent; unless there is equally rapid inflation in the second quarter of 2008, point-to-point inflation is bound to fall.         
	Indias exalted ministers are, however, innocent of such simple arithmetic. The prime minister herded them together on Monday night, and they let themselves go. They eliminated the import duty on unrefined vegetable oils and reduced it on refined oils, banned export of ordinary rice and raised the minimum export price of Basmati rice. That is just the entre. They will come up with even crazier measures, such as activation of the Essential Commodities Act, which enables the police to have a feast at the expense of traders. If ministers have a party, can the Reserve Bank of India be left behind? It has given itself an exclusive licence to slay the dragon of inflation. So, soon it will start raising interest rates, cash reserve requirements and what not. Rubbing his hands in glee, the governor of the RBI has declared that he has plenty of ammunition and is only waiting to start the fireworks. Whether he will bring down inflation thereby is doubtful; but he will certainly throttle growth further.

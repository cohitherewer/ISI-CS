				       This Above All      Khushwant Singh                      Never hesitate                                      
	Sad news from Pakistan: Ahmed Faraz is dying or dead. He was, or is, the leading Urdu poet of his time and drew large crowds of poetry lovers in Pakistan and India in mushairas. I had the privilege of spending many evenings with him when I was in Islamabad the last time. When in Delhi, which was often, he made it a point to come to my home and join me for drinks.        
	Faraz was a tall, well-built, handsome, Pushto-speaking Pathan. He was born in Nowshera in 1931 and studied Persian and Urdu in the University of Peshawar. He took to composing Urdu poetry early in life. His role-model was the revolutionary poet, Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Like Faiz, he fell foul with the authorities and was put in jail. Like Faiz, he had to flee his country and lived in Europe and Canada for some years. And like Faiz and many other Urdu poets from Ghalib down to Majaz, he became a hard drinker. I recall that while in Islamabad, our high commissioner took care that I was never short of Scotch and had a bottle or two sent to my room in the hotel every day. Faraz joined me in the evenings. I am a moderate drinker. Faraz kept me company. He had a curious habit of dunking his cigarettes in whisky before lighting them. Like Faiz, he was also a chain smoker. Invariably, after the sessions were over, he took the bottle still three-quarters full to finish at home.        
	The pattern was somewhat the same when he visited me in Delhi. He was welcomed in many Indian homes and won over a great many hearts. On earlier visits, he stayed with Zainab Chauhan. Later, because of his many admirers dropping in to see him at odd hours, he stayed at the India International Centre. Amongst his devotees was the late Pushpa Dogra who danced to his compositions, Ritu Singh of Air India whom he described as the Koh-i-noor, and Sadia Dehlvi who had to foot his bill at the Centre. He was the star performer at Kamna Prasads annual mushairas. Farazs visits became less frequent when he sensed the growing religious intolerance in India. He never minced his words in criticizing governments or societies  Indian or Pakistani.        
	At home in Pakistan, one dictator followed another. General Zia-ul-Haq had put Faraz behind bars. It did not silence Faraz. General Pervez Musharraf thought it wiser to flatter him with a title and perks. In 2004, he conferred the title of Hilal-e-Imtiaz on him and made him the chairman of the Pakistan Book Foundation, with a bungalow, office and a car thrown in. For a while, Faraz mellowed. When his term ended, he refused to vacate his office or bungalow. He was ordered to do so. He returned the honour conferred upon him and censored the governments authoritarian ways. He was at his best as the Pushtoon warrior fighting against odds.        
	Although he said he only wrote when inspired, Faraz left a sizeable corpus of poetry, prose and drama now available in four volumes. In India and Pakistan his fame rests on the soulful rendering of his poems by Mehdi Hassan. Perhaps the most popular of all is his Ranjish hee sahee, dil hee dukhaaney ke liye aa  Let it be a grievance but come if only to hurt me more.         
	Another equally popular verse is:         
	Ab key hum bichhrey to shayad kabhee khwabon mein milein/Jis tarah sookhey phool kitabon mein milein.                 
	If we part now we may only  meet in our dreams
  As we find pressed flowers kept between the pages of books.    
	Prayer for victory          
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ended his speech in favour of the confidence motion for his government with the stirring lines of Guru Govind Singh: Dey Shiva bar Mohe hai, Shubh karman kay kabhen na taron  Lord Shiva, grant me the boon that I never hesitate to perform righteous deeds.         
	For the benefit of readers not familiar with the original, which is found in the Gurus Chandi Charitr (Ode to Goddess Chandi) of his Dasam Granth, I give my translation in English:        
	O Lord, these boons of Thee I ask
  Let me never shun a righteous task,
  Let me be fearless when I go to battle,
  Give me faith that victory will be mine,
  Give me the power to sing Thy praise,
  And when comes time to end my life,
  Let me fall in mighty strife.    
	House on fire                
	What should a woman do when she finds out that her husband is cheating on her? Most would say, Kick him out, leave him, sue him for adultery and demand a huge alimony. Not so, writes Sonam Kalra. In her lavishly illustrated book, How to Make Your Husbands Mistress Cry: The New Rules of Revenge, she lays out a set of commandments in Biblical language on how to ruin the illicit liaison by resorting to mischief and enticing the husband back to matrimonial fidelity. Suggestions include ringing up the fire brigade or the ambulance from a public telephone booth, asking the men to come immediately to the place where the husband and his mistress are up to no good. That will put a damper on their illicit passion and the husband will come home with his tail between his legs. Sonam has a wicked sense of humour. So has Prabhjyot, her illustrator who portrays her scantily clad men and women in positions as compromising as censors of public morality will tolerate. In addition, the two ladies have produced The Naughty Girls Book of Secrets: Over 50 Tips to Make Him Pant for You. Both are amusing, readable, permissible light porn that will keep the reader smiling all the way.

	Decision pending                  
	Sir  In our parliamentary system of governance, the prime minister occupies his office only on the condition that he commands a majority in the Lok Sabha (PM and the Lower House, July 20). He should, therefore, be required to belong to the Lower House. Indira Gandhi first broke the convention when, in 1966-67, she was prime minister but a member of the Rajya Sabha. Later, after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, P.V. Narasimha Rao was catapulted to the prime ministers chair when he was not a member of either house. The 11th prime minister, H.D. Deve Gowda, was also a member of the Rajya Sabha, as was I.K. Gujral.           
	The classical doctrines that the cabinet is accountable to the parliament and the prime minister is the first among equals are breached so frequently in our system that India can be described as having a prime ministerial government rather than a parliamentary or cabinet government. This became clear during the tenure of the very first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. There was never any doubt about his pre-eminence. Under Indira Gandhis regime, the prime ministerial government came dangerously close to becoming a constitutional dictatorship. Rajiv Gandhis style of functioning was no different. Morarji Desai was the first to ensure a genuine cabinet government. Narasimha Rao believed in consultations and consensus. V.P. Singh, Chandra Shekhar, Deve Gowda and Gujral headed coalition governments whose existence was heavily dependant upon the support of the coalition partners. This effectively, if involuntarily, curbed prime ministerial dominance. The same factor worked to some extent for the governments of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh.           
	The Indian constitution-framers, while introducing some flexibility in the prime ministers post, probably did not foresee a situation like the one Manmohan Singh is facing today. In our present coalition culture, it is not easy to find a consensus candidate from among the elected members of the coalition partners in the Lower House. And the person chosen from outside, as it turns out, is not always keen on facing a direct election. True, Singh will not be present when the Lok Sabha votes on whether to trust his government or not. But at least, the fact that he is seeking a trust vote on the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal proves that the essence of parliamentary democracy is still alive here.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Debaki Nandan Mandal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Whether or not the United Progressive Alliance government survives the no-confidence motion in the Lok Sabha today, two personalities will have emerged out of it with more dignity and eminence than ever. They are Sonia Gandhi and Somnath Chatterjee. Sonia Gandhi handled the withdrawal of the Left with great composure  and even remembered to thank the very parties who were throwing brickbats at her partys government. It will certainly win her a lot of friends in the pro-Congress and anti-BJP faction within the Left, and may also ensure a post-poll alliance in case of early elections.           
	The seasoned leftist parliamentarian, Somnath Chatterjee, has earned accolades for his principled stand of distancing himself from party politics in his capacity as the speaker of the Lok Sabha. A staunch communist challenging the leadership of his party is surprising enough. By manfully doing so, he has demonstrated that all is not lost for Indias parliamentary system. This also underscores the fact that the entire Left establishment is not endorsing the hard line of Prakash Karat.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bichu Muttathara, Pune 

                
	Sir  The test of majority marks one of the worst times in a parliamentary democracy, particularly when the party or coalition in power has either suddenly lost its majority or is poised on a razors edge. Faceless members of parliament suddenly come to the forefront and begin to wield enormous power and demand favours.           
	As far as Manmohan Singh is concerned, he has freed his government of the clutches of the leftist monster. Whatever the outcome of the trust vote, one will have to give Manmohan Singh the credit for shaking the countrys decades-old fascination with a decadent socialist idea and an obsolete development model. Even if he fails to make the numbers, the prime minister will have left a trailblazers footprint on the political terrain of the nation.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sarat Pattanayak, Bhubaneswar

      
	Sir  The confidence vote today will not merely decide whether India will go in for the nuclear deal with the US, but it will also represent a paradigm shift in the countrys foreign, defence and economic policies. This is probably the real reason behind the Lefts paranoia about the deal. It seeks to alter six decades of Indias lockstep ties with the socialist block, represented by the erstwhile Soviet Union. It will also shut the door effectively on the face of the Chinese who are insinuating to replace the Soviet Union as our countrys big daddy on the world stage. The communist parties, never inspired by nationalistic ideals, are making a last-ditch bid to scuttle the deal so that a window of opportunity is kept open for their Chinese masters. Manmohan Singh saw through the sinister gameplan of Prakash Karat and Co. Thankfully, Singh is not a conventional politician, or he would have preferred to tread the path of political expediency to the one of national interests.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Biswajit Parija, Bhubaneswar

                
	Sir  Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi have thrown the country in political doldrums. Even if they win the trust vote with the help of sundry pound-of-flesh hunters, the blackmailing bunch would pull down the government in no time. To stick with the nuclear deal, therefore, is to put the countrys future in jeopardy. The costs of pushing through the deal may be quite disproportionate to its expected benefits. The idea should be to save the present, and let the future take care of itself.           
	Yours faithfully,      
R.N. Bhattacherjee, Durgapur

	Fire power                  
	Sir  By putting ten satellites into orbits on April 28, G. Madhavan Nair and his team at the Indian Space Research Organization have conquered the space frontier for India (Force 10 from ISRO storms into space bazaar, April 29). Nair should be awarded the Bharat Ratna for having transformed ISRO into an organization that is on a par with the best space research centres across the world. After the Chandraayan mission to the moon, which is scheduled to take place some time this year, the ISRO must aim to send an unmanned satellite to Mars as well. The reliable launch vehicle, PSLV-C9, is expected to make satellite services commercially viable in India. The launch will certainly put India at the same level as most developed countries in terms of space research. Indian universities should also include a basic course in space sciences to generate interest in space, which may become an accessible destination for all in future.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Raghubir Singh, Pune

                
	Sir  After the glorious conquest of the North Pole by the Indian naval expedition team in early April, the simultaneous launching of ten satellites into space from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota came as a piece of exhilarating news. India has proved again that it can compete with the most advanced countries in the world in research infrastructure. Away from the din and bustle of city life, scientists at ISRO pursue their target of making India become a global power in space research and services. Even in the midst of starvation deaths, farmers suicides, and the like, these scientists have given us a reason to celebrate.           
	Yours faithfully,      
N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta

      
	Sir  Of the three things that have been clubbed under the headline, Fired (April 29), only the launch of PSLV-C9 is something to make Indians feel proud. Maybe India should give up trying in sports and concentrate on science and technology.          
	Yours faithfully,      
C.K. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Darkness visible          
	Sir  The total unprofessionalism of the Cricket Association of Bengal during the Indian Premier League match between the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Hyderabad Deccan Chargers has reduced Calcuttas image as a viable cricketing venue to nought (Light shed on match fiasco, April 22). The disruption in power supply during the match, the operational failure of the electronic scoreboard, acute water scarcity in the gruelling conditions and above all, the underprepared pitch, were all significant gaffes in organization. It was the patience of the crowd and their passion for the game that saved the day. The chief ministers blue-eyed boy and CAB president, Prasun Mukherjee, should have take responsibility for the fiasco and removed himself, and the curator, Kalyan Mitra, from the cricketing scene. And if Tuesdays match against the Mumbai Indians went off without any major glitches, this should not make the authorities complacent again.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapash Chatterjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It took 72 hours for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to intervene in the probe into the Eden Gardens debacle of April 20 (CM plays Eden chief selector, April 22). There was a perception that the transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, would not conduct a fair inquiry because of his strained relations with the CAB president. But wouldnt that jeopardize the ministers chances of making it to the party politburo? The media appear to have blown the incident of the power failure out of proportion. Power-cuts during summer are not new to West Bengal. Rise in food prices is a problem that needs more urgent attention.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Sir  I am a regular visitor to the Eden Gardens, and was there for the match between the Knight Riders and the Deccan Chargers. Stadiums in all major cricketing centres in India have been upgraded to international standards, but Eden appears to be languishing still. Spectator amenities are completely disregarded. Some blocks still have concrete benches, something quite unthinkable elsewhere. The lower tiers of some blocks have no shaded areas. The public announcement system did not work properly on Sunday. It is within the rights of a spectator who shells out hundreds of rupees to buy match tickets to expect the basic facilities. The CAB is one of the richest state cricket associations in India, thanks to the sports-loving people of the state. Is it wrong for the people to expect that a part of the proceeds would go towards improving the infrastructure at the Eden? One successful game after the public disgrace of April 20 should not make CAB feel that all is well again.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kushal Roy, Calcutta

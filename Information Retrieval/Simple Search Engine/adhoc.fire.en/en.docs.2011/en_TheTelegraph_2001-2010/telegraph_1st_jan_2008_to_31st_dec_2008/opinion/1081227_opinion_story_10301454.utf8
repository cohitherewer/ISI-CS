The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Listing the great expectations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             LISTING THE GREAT EXPECTATIONS                                  The USs India policy is likely to undergo some changes after Barack Obama becomes president, writes Ashok Ganguly                        Friendly ties				                                 
	India and the United States of America have had a reasonably friendly, if not warm, relationship during the past 20 years. The tilt towards Pakistan is of longer standing and the hyphenation of India and Pakistan was at the core of the USs foreign policy in central Asia. A slow reordering of relations between the US and India first appeared during President Bill Clintons second term, when Indias economic progress was becoming visible and the prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had extended a hand of friendship to the US as well as to Pakistan. Although Indias nuclear test was neither forgotten nor forgiven by the US, the rancour slowly shifted from the front burner of its relations with India.        
	The succeeding Bush presidency put relations with India on a more prominent plane of American foreign policy and that reached its apogee during the visit of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to Washington in June, 2006. The eventual success of the nuclear deal in 2008 is more recent and fresh in our memory. We are, for the time being, witnessing the best years in the India-US relationship since Indias independence.        
	It is against this background that there is growing speculation on how these relations will emerge with the ascendancy of Barack Obama as the next president of the US in January, 2009. One got a glimpse of what may be the thinking and aspiration of the new dispensation in Washington in a recent private gathering in Mumbai that was addressed by the head of a major and influential foreign policy think tank operating in Washington. The speaker, who served in the first two years of the Bush administration, is a very prominent American and hugely respected amongst Washingtons policy crowd.         
	His basic message was that there is a very high likelihood of a major shift in the USs policy priorities vis--vis India, under the president-elect, Obama. While the dominant Democratic dispensation in the US will wish to build on the solid foundation laid down by Bush and the Indian prime minister, in going forward the American priorities will change in terms of what was described as expectations from India. Not surprisingly, India will be expected to play a more proactive role in the G-20 and the Doha Round, not as a member of the BRIC group, but on its own. India will be expected to commit itself to deliver on internationally agreed emission standards, rather than expect exemptions as an emerging economy. India will be strongly urged to endorse the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as well as to specifically contribute to the global climate-change objectives. India is unlikely to get US support for a permanent seat in the United Nations security council as there are several other contenders of merit, such as Japan, Germany, South Africa and Brazil. According to the speaker, it will not matter because the effectiveness of the UN is likely to erode further and there will be moves for its modernization, similar to what is expected at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The US will expect India to share a greater burden and play a role in the sphere of Asian geopolitics, in the global fight against terrorism and, in order to do so more effectively, the US will expect India to be the lead player in seeking a lasting solution to Kashmir.        
	While these views were delivered by a very prominent American foreign policy expert, they, however, reflect the thinking of a fairly large section of American foreign policy pundits, especially of the Democratic variety.        
	The speaker delivered his views with such a sense of confidence and finality as to convey an element of inevitability in the emerging India policy of the new Democratic dispensation in Washington. The speaker also mentioned that while China will continue to remain the principal economic partner of the US, apprehension of its military and territorial ambitions will cast a moderating influence on Washington. Countries such as Russia and Venezuela will moderate their views regarding their relations with the US as long as oil prices remain modest, and which is forecast to remain so for a while, given the global economic situation.        
	The only silver lining in the emerging foreign policy picture painted by the speaker was that the US will remain preoccupied with its and the worlds economic meltdown for at least the first two to three years of Obamas presidency as well as with extricating America from Iraq, with seeking a longer term solution for Afghanistan and with normalizing relations with Iran and North Korea. These urgent issues may moderate the USs expectations from the rest of the world at least for a while. What remains to be seen is how much of the above account, and especially the India relations, will coincide with what Obama and the new secretary of state designate, Hillary Clinton, conjure up in 2009 and beyond as part of the USs international policy.         
	Incidentally, the discussions described took place on November 25, 2008. What we have witnessed since November 26 is likely to radically change the way India looks at the rest of the world and how the rest of the world looks at India.

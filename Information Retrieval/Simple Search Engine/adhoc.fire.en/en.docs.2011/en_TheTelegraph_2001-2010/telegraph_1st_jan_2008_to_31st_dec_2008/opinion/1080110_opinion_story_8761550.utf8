                 CHINA DIARY - Neha Sahay
               
	What kind of restaurant encourages its staff to take tips, but pockets the tips for itself, giving them not even a share? 
    
	Welcome to a new kind of rapaciousness in China, the world of Western food restaurants. Catering almost wholly to the Westerners flooding the country, these cafs and bars have a preponderance of Western dishes on their menu. They stock the latest albums, have chic or plush interiors, English-speaking waitresses, sometimes even free internet surfing. Open till 1 am, these are the hangouts recommended by expats to newcomers in the city. 
    
	Naturally, prices here are double those in Chinese restaurants, but given the exchange rate of the yuan with Western currencies, who cares? After all, where in this country can you get an authentic coq au vin and lobster bisque? Aware that Westerners are used to tipping, some of them include a 10 per ent service charge in their bills.
    
	Such restaurants are highly sought after by young unskilled Chinese job-seekers. Waiting in a Chinese restaurant is tough. For one, these restaurants are always crowded. The Chinese often go out to eat in large groups, and choose an array of dishes. An hour-long meal would need a constant replenishment of Chinese tea, rice, and the tiny saucers and bowls in which they eat. Cleaning up is an unpleasant task, what with the variety of bones and soiled tissues spilt all over the place. 
    
	Western restaurants, on the other hand, are barely half-full during the day, and diners are easy to cater to. Sometimes just a coffee and a sandwich is enough for them. Even a meal requires just a couple of plates per person. Very little mess and afterwards, who knows, may be even a generous tip. 
        
	Tipped off
    
	Tipping in China is not the norm  it was discouraged under the Mao regime and even today, the Chinese dont tip. Sometimes, the waitress in Chinese restaurants even returns the tip . However, the practice has slowly become acceptable over the last 15 years, thanks to the Westerners here. There are no norms; often just the change of 5 to 10 yuan is left behind by a huge group. But conscientious tippers can leave behind 10 per cent. 
    
	A few bars share the tips equally among the staff at the end of the month. But some dont. Among them is the latest happening place in a small city starved of good Western dining options. Run by a New York-based designer clothing brand, this huge bar-cum-boutique has an international ambience: a tabla-player from Nepal, Latin-dancing, signature cocktails and the elusive draft beer...Its normally chosen as the venue for many exclusive parties, including one hosted by Ferrari.
    
	With business running into thousands of yuan, this restaurant extracts a ten-hour working day from its staff but gives not even a minutes grace for being late. It advises them never to refuse tips, but to deposit them with the cashier. Tiny cameras all over the place record the actions of those who feel that the tip has been earned by them, and pocket it. Any such lapse is reason enough for dismissal. At the end of the month, the staff gets no share of the tips theyve earned, nor of the 10 per cent service charge included in the bill. Their salaries arent enough compensation: 1,000 yuan with a 500 yuan lunch allowance and free dormitory accommodation. That would be about the amount a family of three would spend on their Xmas lunch here.
    
	When the expats who had hailed the launch of this restaurant in the city got to know that the 30-40 yuan they were leaving behind was filling the cash registers of the owners, they debated whether to just stop tipping, or stop patronizing it. The jurys still out. After all, as one of them put it, Life with this caf is so much better than life without it. The chocolate cheese cake beckons.

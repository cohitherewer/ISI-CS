	Summits: Six Meetings That Shaped The Twentieth Century by David Reynolds, Allen Lane, pound;9.99  
	The word summit was originally used for mountains. David Reynolds tells us that it was Winston Churchill who first used the word in the context of international relations. In February 1950, during the Cold War, Churchill, while calling for another round of talks at the highest level with the Soviet Union, said that it was not easy to see how matters could be worsened by a parley at the summit. It is no coincidence that the usage of the word became popular in the early Fifties when mountaineers were conquering the highest peaks of the world. By 1955, the State Department of the US had accepted it as an official term for a meeting of world leaders. Today, the use of the word, outside the context of mountaineering, doesnt even raise an eyebrow.  
	It is not as if leaders had not met before to resolve issues. Think of the meeting between Napoleon and Tsar Alexander I on a raft on the Niemen river in June 1807. But the word summit was never used to describe such meetings. After the Fifties, the term caught on and became common currency.        
	David Reynolds looks at the human drama behind six summits, which he believes have been critical in the making of the modern world. The summits he has chosen are: Munich 1938 (Chamberlain and Hitler), Yalta 1945 (Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin), Vienna 1961 (Kennedy and Khrushchev), Moscow 1972 (Brezhnev and Nixon), Camp David 1978 (Begin, Carter and Sadat, picture), and Geneva 1985 (Gorbachev and Reagan). There is very little to dispute here except that the meetings that broke the ice in Sino-US relations in the Nixon-Mao era also deserve a place.        
	The problem in recreating the human drama behind summits is one of approach and sources. There is always the temptation to adopt the fly-on-the-wall approach, by which the historian creates the make-believe of actually being present during the parleys. This is attractive but entirely ahistorical. Most of the summits discussed here were held in camera with only the leaders, note-takers and interpreters present. Sometimes, meetings were held one-to-one with no officials present. Thus the only way the historian can access the proceedings of these summits is through the official minutes (which were always written up later), the memoirs of the persons present and other kinds of recollections. None of these can quite provide the immediacy of a fly-on-the-wall account.        
	Reynolds, the accomplished historian that he is, does not take the easy way out. He has mined the existing records, crosschecked various versions and then arrived at a plausible version of what actually transpired in these summits. This is not to suggest that the book is a dull one. On the contrary, it is lucidly written with no recourse to any kind of jargon or abstract theorization. Every summit is provided with the contextual background, and Reynolds excels in this. The accounts of the summits come alive because of the authors unerring eye for the telling anecdote.         
	To give one example of such an anecdote. In late September 1938 when Hitler, Mussolini, Chamberlain and Daladier met in Munich to try and avert war, the agreement was ready for signing at 2 a.m. on the 30th. The four delegations trooped into Hitlers office where an enormous desk was mounted with a massive inkpot. Hitler dipped his pen into the inkpot, only to discover that it was empty.        
	It is the appositeness of such seemingly trivial incidents that makes Reynolds book an absolute delight.

                           Danger zone
              
	Heights of Madness 

 By Myra MacDonald, Rupa, Rs 395
    
	Siachen, the worlds highest battlefield at 18,000 feet, gets its name from the wild Sia roses that grow at the snout of the glacier. That desolate land of rock and ice, where the wildest of adventurers rarely ventured, is now famous as historys most frightening  and most absurd  theatre of armed conflict. 
    
	For 23 years, this surreal, unwinnable battle between two nuclear-powered nations has become something of a parable of the dark, fretful relations between India and Pakistan. The irony is that only a small number of people in these overpopulated nations knows even the bare essentials of the Siachen story. 
    
	Myra MacDonald, a Reuters correspondent based in New Delhi until recently, travels as close to the battle zone as an outsider possibly can to try and capture the reality of this secret war. Of course, she picks up her story also from conversations with army officers in New Delhi and Islamabad, who arrange and guide her visits to the camps close to Siachen. 
    
	To the popular mind in India and Pakistan, the Siachen saga is the ultimate in patriotism tests. It is not easy to get accounts of the battle that are not prejudiced by nationalist perceptions. MacDonalds access to both sides, her journalistic skills and, above all, her neutrality about contrary claims and complaints by either side give her narrative its strength. 
    
	But this is not military history. Nor is it meant to be a romance of a Himalayan adventure, although the beautiful and terrifying locale, with its many legends and myths, colours the narrative. In fact, the politics of the Kashmir conflict and contemporary relations between India and Pakistan support the narrative much more than any analysis of military strategies or fairy-tale descriptions of mountain adventures. 
    
	MacDonalds principal aim is to explore the minds of men who have been up and down those heights of madness. Both in India and in Pakistan, she moves far away from the political and military headquarters, in search of men who fought at Siachen and live to tell the tale. 
    
	Like Vikram Singh in an obscure Haryana village, most of these former soldiers tell her that a stint at Siachen is the ultimate badge of honour  in life, as in death. She finds no reason to doubt the honesty of their statements. It is simply impossible to put up a pretence at a place where men can live, if they at all do, only as beasts completely at the mercy of an unforgiving nature. Everyone knows that of the many thousand soldiers killed at Siachen on both sides, more have died of exhaustion and high- altitude sickness than in actual battle. 
    
	The narrative develops into a moving account of the colossal waste of resources for two of the worlds poorest countries, and of a great human tragedy. By official estimates, it costs India 30 million rupees a day to run the operation at Siachen! 
    
	Yet MacDonald has no sentimental epilogue offering a make-believe end to the grim conflict. One jarring note is the patronizing tone in which she often discusses situations and affairs in India and Pakistan. But this is a remarkable book about a difficult subject. It does not pretend to give the whole story about Siachen, but what it gives will surely prompt sensitive readers to know more about this strange war.

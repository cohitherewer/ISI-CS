The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the future or the past
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             THE FUTURE OR THE PAST                                                          
	If investment is, as John Maynard Keynes said, an act of faith, then peace, or the absence of violence and the prevalence of the rule of law, induces that faith. Investors looking at West Bengal as a possible site for their investment might begin to wonder, looking at current events in the state, if the necessary conditions of faith are present. Violence seems to have returned with a vengeance to a state that in the Sixties had lived  or some would say died  under the dark shadow of bombs, gunpowder smoke and political strife. Then capital and business had fled West Bengal, many thought never to return. The entrenchment of communist rule did nothing to create conditions that would make capital return. It took the efforts of the present chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, to make investors look at West Bengal in a less negative light. Even a few months ago, most observers would have said that West Bengal was poised for a great leap forward which would result in the industrial transformation of the state: a red desert would become a field of blooming flowers.        
	A question mark now hovers over such a vision. A climate of violence has descended on the state. It began in Nandigram where terror still reigns, but has now spread to other parts as well. The immediate context of this strife is the panchayat elections, but it is evident that the violence is the manifestation of a much deeper malaise. The sheer muscle power of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its utter inability to deal with dissent and opposition through any other means save terror have created an atmosphere of intimidation. Attempts to break the stranglehold of the CPI(M) is resulting in strife even with parties belonging to the Left Front. There has been no attempt by the state administration to intervene to stop this vicious cycle of violence by taking action against all those involved in murder and mayhem irrespective of their political affiliations. This failure of the state administration is giving licence to other political forces to use violence to achieve their aims. Witness the killing of a manager in a jute mill by a mob belonging to a trade union. Such incidents evoke terrible memories of West Bengals murky past.        
	To stop West Bengals descent into its own past, Mr Bhattacharjee will have to act fast and with decisiveness. First and foremost, he must separate the interests of the state and of his government from those of his party. The administration must work for the state and not at the behest of the ruling party. The chief minister must see himself  and be seen  as the chief minister of West Bengal and not as a CPI(M) chief minister. On his ability to make these changes depends the future of West Bengal: whether it changes for the better and reaches for economic development or remains a place where nothing but the red flag flutters.

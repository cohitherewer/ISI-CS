	Code of misconduct                  
	Sir  The assault on Subrata Bhattacharjee, the former footballer and current coach of Chirag United, has tarnished the sporting ethos of the Calcutta Maidan (Rival fans heckle Bhattacharjee, Aug 18). It is even more shameful that a Mohun Bagan fan attacked Bhattacharjee, who had served the club selflessly for nearly two decades. Unlike cricket, a game of the genteel classes, soccer has been associated with the rough working classes. But the Calcutta football fan is known for his fierce loyalty. Not any more, it would appear.          
	Yours faithfully,        Gautam Dhar, Calcutta
        
	In weak hands          
	Sir  The office of the president of Pakistan has always been plagued by controversies. But possibly no other president, not even Pervez Musharraf, was as notorious as Asif Ali Zardari (Zardari in good neighbour vow Sept 10). From being nicknamed Mr Ten Per Cent to assuming the high chair, Zardari has come a long way, though his popularity has not increased by much. The list of allegations against him has grown further, and since his bid for the presidency, more sordid details about his personal life have been raked up.           
	It is unfortunate that not a single civilian president in Pakistan has been allowed to complete a full term. But it is also true that each of them left office in infamy. Given Zardaris record, he is likely to go the same way. Until he stops making tall promises and proves himself to be a man of action, India has no reason to feel hopeful about him.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.S. Acharya,

	Sir  Now that democracy has been restored and a new president has assumed office in Pakistan, there can be an informed public debate on al Qaida and the Taliban insurgency. It has been long evident that al Qaida, comprising of foreign elements like the Saudis, Uzbeks, Chechens and so on, has found refuge on Pakistani soil. This group has violated Pakistans sovereignty by carrying out a jihad in the name of Islam from that country. Pakistan has expressed its unhappiness with cross-border action by Nato and American troops, but these incursions cannot be helped. No military commander would stand by helplessly watching his troops die, and allow the enemy to go unpunished. So Pakistan can continue to expect more cross-border violations until all al Qaida has been decimated. Pakistan can only preserve its sovereignty by ridding itself of terrorist activities. This task, unfortunately, is beyond the capacity of a dubious individual like Asif Ali Zardari.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Gods and mortals          
	Sir  It was a delight to read Mukul Kesavan talk about his tennis heroes in Choose the Baddie (Sept 10). I happen to be an avid fan of Rafael Nadal, and this is not because I find Roger Federer lacking in skill. Some of us support the underdog always, which was why I found Nadals Wimbledon triumph against Federer, earlier this year, especially satisfying.           
	Years ago, I took immense pleasure in the raging debates with a friend over our favourite batsmen. My friend happened to like Sachin Tendulkar, while I chose good old Dada. Once again, I supported Sourav Ganguly not because he was a fellow Bengali but because he was the one batsman who took the fight to Tendulkar  just as Nadal gives Federer a run for his money these days! Some people, and Kesavan is surely one of them, will continue to venerate the gods in the sporting arena. Others like me, however, will keep on rooting for the villains.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
J. Chakravarti, Calcutta

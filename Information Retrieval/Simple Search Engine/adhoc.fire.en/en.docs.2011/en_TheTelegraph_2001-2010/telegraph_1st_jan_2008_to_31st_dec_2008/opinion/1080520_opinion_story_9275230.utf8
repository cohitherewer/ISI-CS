	Same old story                  
	Sir  The serial bomb blasts in Jaipur, so far considered to be one of the safer cities in India, came as a shock (Jaipur bombed, May 14). What did not surprise, however, was the knee-jerk reaction of the government. The high alert that follows every terror attack, accompanied by belated words of wisdom, remains familiar as ever. There were the usual contradictions. While politicians stated that Jaipur had been an obvious target for a while now, intelligence officials denied having the city on their surveillance radar. The platitudes that come from our national leaders, post facto, were offered as salve, but empty words are not going to stop terror outfits from carrying out their nefarious activities.           
	Not only do such incidents expose the complete failure of intelligence, but they also reflect the total absence of any planned initiative on the part of the government to deal with terrorism. Terrorists have realized by now that in India they are safe if they can lie low during the first few days of investigations. Even if a few are caught, the trials will go on for ages and death sentences will be deferred eternally. The terrorist camps across the borders are never raided, though noble talks are always on between the neighbours.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  At this hour of crisis, the people of Jaipur should stand united. That would be the only way to prove to the terrorists that the spirit of the city cannot be broken by cowardly bombers.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kshama Agarwal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The government needs to put in place more advanced security measures if it is serious about combating terrorism. Beyond this, it also needs to resume the dialogue with extremist groups behind these attacks, and try to get to the root of their discontent.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Farzana Nigar, Ranchi 

                
	Sir  It is imperative that our politicians pull up their socks and take stock of the terror situation. So far their strategies to curb terrorism have not paid off. There is also too much bureaucratic and procedural delay over the carrying out of justice. The endless dithering over the Afzal Guru case, for instance, does not send out a firm enough message to those who are planning to destroy the unity of our country.          
	Yours faithfully,      
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  The editorial, Little too late (May 15), makes the governments inaction, in the face of decades of terrorist insurgence, glaringly evident. Intelligence agencies have failed, diplomatic missions have not stopped cross-border violence, and the administration has also failed to deliver justice. Instead of trying to appease the vote banks, the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre should tackle the merchants of death by cracking down on terrorism in a determined way. Only this would win the UPA the heart of the nation and give it a better chance to make a victorious comeback with the 2009 Lok Sabha polls.          
	Yours faithfully,       
N.K. Saikia, Guwahati

                
	Sir  The government should carry out a thorough investigation into the Jaipur blasts and present the United Nations with irrefutable proof of the involvement of Pakistan in these attacks. The United States of America is coming round to accepting our neighbouring country as a terrorists haven. This is the right time for India to team up with the US and work towards destroying taliban outfits and thwarting the sinister activities of the Inter-Services Intelligence across the Indo-Pak border.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  Our government seems to sit up only after a terror attack has struck. After that its only success is in finding out the name of the outfit behind the attack. Then the usual course is followed. Ministers announce aid to the people, express their sympathy for the families of the deceased and the injured. A red alert is sounded in other sensitive states and then the hullabaloo dies down after a few weeks. It is important that the high and mighty are made to realize that what they try to pass of as restoration of normalcy is only a semblance of normal life. It is not possible for the shattered people to go back to their old ways. If, within days of a tragedy, politicians go about behaving as if nothing much has happened, it would only foment anger and hurt among the citizens.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Ranchi

                
	Sir  Unless India is more vigilant over its border security, terror attacks are not going to stop. Surely this is not the time for running train and bus services to inimical neighbouring countries. Closed-circuit cameras should be placed at every important public location to keep watch on the goings-on. Railway stations, airports, shopping malls, street junctions, religious places, even buses and local trains should be monitored to forestall yet another attack. Better intelligence inputs and more foolproof identity cards  instead of the easily duplicable, shoddy voter cards  would help too.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune

      
	Sir  Except for condemning terror attacks and announcing compensation for the victims, no sincere effort has been made by the Centre to stop such incidents. A ritual statement is issued by the authorities saying that such activities will not be tolerated and that the guilty would be brought to justice. But the government keeps on tolerating, while punishments take too long to be imposed. This is why the country cowers constantly under the threat of different kinds of terrorism  Islamic, Naxalite or Maoist. In a democracy, the protection of a citizens life is of supreme importance. The government has failed on this count.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There should be an enquiry to find the lapses of intelligence at both the Central and state levels, leading to the Jaipur blasts. The services of retired intelligence and civil defence officials should be enlisted for the sake of the security of the country.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Anil K. Bhandari, Kharagpur 

                
	Sir  Most Indians have got desensitized to terror attacks, just as they have become used to the blame game that follows. After the Jaipur blasts, the aam admi does not know who should be held accountable: the Bharatiya Janata Party, which rules Rajasthan, or the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre. But one thing he is fairly certain about. As the political leaders bicker among themselves, his life will continue to be put at stake for years to come.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

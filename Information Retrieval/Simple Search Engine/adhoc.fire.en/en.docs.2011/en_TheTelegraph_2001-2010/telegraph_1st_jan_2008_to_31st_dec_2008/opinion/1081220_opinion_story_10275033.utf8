                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       NEITHER STRANGE NOR BEAUTIFUL                                  VISUAL ARTS : Somak Ghoshal                                                  
	The Kerala-born Roy Thomas conveys the essence of his recent works in the title of his exhibition at The Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre: From the vanishing point (December 8-15). It is evident from the title, as from the pictures themselves, that Thomas is fascinated by perspective, and how ordinary things look fantastic from different points of view. Employed suitably, the concept of the vanishing point has the potential to turn real into surreal, the mundane into the mysterious. But Thomas, much as he labours to make the most of this idea, ends up merely producing a set of pretty pictures  easy, elegant and entirely forgettable.         
	Thomas is a skilled painter and, presumably, the size of his canvases matters to him a lot, though the reason for his extravagance may elude viewers. The smaller works are 48x48 inches, growing progressively larger to 60x60 inches, 72x60 inches, even 69x92 inches. Thomas depicts everyday reality with photographic fidelity, but gives a quaint touch to these vignettes. The idea is to make us see the ordinary through a secret eye that turns simple objects into something rich and strange. Sadly, what Thomas makes us see is neither strange nor rich, but insipid, half-baked and largely unrealized.        
	The most interesting picture is that of a boy, his face contorted and screaming, grabbing a wire mesh as a cluster of tiny birds flutters all over him. There is a menacing edge to this composition, as if the winged creatures have come out of the nightmarish universe of Hitchcocks Birds (picture). This image might give viewers a pause. The shock of it, though carefully contrived, has an impact on the eye. But as one moves on, one is confronted with more of the same  and this sameness dulls the senses.         
	Thomas has only one trick in his bag, the repeated use of which begins to numb the viewer. A pair of hands holds on to the hands of a boy, stretched across what looks like a globe. This time, there are tiny fish swimming in the foreground. Someone peers from behind a half-open shutter, miniature helicopters buzzing all over like a swarm of bees. In a variation of this theme, grasshoppers hover over a goat, interspersed with a fleet of aeroplanes no bigger than the insects. Perhaps the idea is to show the modern in relation to the natural. So, men and machine, dreams and nightmares, the sylvan and the sinister converge. Thomas tries to add strangeness to beauty. Only, his works are neither strange nor beautiful enough.

	The power of failure                  
	Sir  The power failure at the Eden Gardens on April 20 is still being talked about. How many people suffered because of it? About 60,000-odd spectators and a handful of players. But what about the two lakh board examinees, who languished because of endless hours of power cut every day in the weeks before their exams? Some of us even had to carry candles to the exam centres, because the government could not ensure power supply for three hours. But are the ministers bothered? No. Because we are not cricketers or celebrities. But it should be no surprise that a state that cannot provide electricity to its board examinees will also fail to supply power to a cricket stadium.          
	Yours faithfully,        Snehasish Dutta, Calcutta
        
	Girl trouble          
	Sir  The prime ministers message of saving the girl child will not be taken seriously unless our society changes radically (Save the girl child, says proud father PM, April 29). Even in 21st-century Indian society, boys are in greater demand than girls. Parents still prefer sex determination tests, so that they can destroy a female foetus at an early stage. Needless to say, medical practitioners benefit out of this social malaise.          
	Those girls who survive are mostly deprived of the facilities and freedoms that boys enjoy, and even face torture. That is because we are still in favour of boys, with all their bullying. We fear to protest their misdeeds. Even if a small section of women try to protest, the larger part of the society comes in their way.           
	So, to save girl children, can the prime minister change the entire society and stop crimes like female foeticide?           
	Yours faithfully.       
Moumita Sengupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Those who kill female foetuses and little girls are not only guilty of homicide, but also of disturbing natures way of balancing the sex-ratio in every caste, religion, state, country and even in animals. The more the ratio is skewed in favour of men, the higher the incidence of sexual crimes. And crimes of this nature occur across class barriers. Raising awareness is the only solution.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Flight fright          
	Sir  I had been booked on flight IC 202 from New Delhi to Calcutta on April 25, 2008. The scheduled time of departure was 8 pm. On arriving at the airport, we were informed that the flight would leave at 8.40 pm. As it turned out, it finally left at 10.20 pm, a time when we would, under normal circumstances, have arrived in Calcutta. The passengers were, understandably, a bit rattled. Distances and traffic in Delhi being what they are, most had had to leave for the airport three to four hours before the scheduled time of departure.           
	The problem arose when we boarded the flight. The airlines had, inexplicably, decided to have free seating as a result of the delay. A number of passengers were travelling in groups, and had great problems settling down. Moreover, owing to some oversight, some of the economy class passengers had to be accommodated in the J Class, which led to a further delay. The cabin crew were trying their best to set the house in order.           
	At a time like this, it was uncharitable of the pilot to declare that he would deplane and leave the passengers to do as they wished, if they did not settle down immediately. He did not spare the cabin crew either.           
	Every airline should brief its crew so that they are better equipped to deal with situations like this. The behaviour of the pilot that day left a lot to be desired, especially by the hapless passengers who had already spent anything between five to seven hours waiting for the delayed flight.           
	Yours faithfully,

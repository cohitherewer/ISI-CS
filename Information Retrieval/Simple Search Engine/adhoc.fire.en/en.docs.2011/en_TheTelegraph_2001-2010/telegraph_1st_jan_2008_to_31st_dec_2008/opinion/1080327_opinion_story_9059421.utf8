The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The agrarian crisis
                                                                                                                 THE AGRARIAN CRISIS                          - Why are the living standards of Indian rural households falling?

	It is debatable whether any countrys annual budget receives even a fraction of the attention that the Indian media gives to the Union budget in our country. The intensive coverage starts almost a fortnight before the finance minister reveals his carefully preserved secrets, and continues for at least a week afterwards. Only cricket, and that too the one-day variety, can compete with the budget these days insofar as newspaper headlines are concerned.        
	Even by these standards, this year has been an exception. As I write this, the budget was presented almost a month ago. But discussions about the budget simply refuse to fade away in the newspapers, although the attention has now more or less narrowed down to just one aspect of the budget  the gigantic loan-waiver scheme for small and marginal farmers. Not surprisingly, opinion is sharply divided on whether this is simply a populist gesture designed solely to garner extra votes for the Congress or whether it has been adopted by a caring government to provide solace to distressed farmers.        
	However, both sides agree that an agrarian crisis is looming large, although there is still a lot of disagreement on both the nature of the crisis as well as its causes. An extreme manifestation of the crisis has been the spate of suicides by farmers in several parts of the country. A less painful symptom has been the rising incidence of indebtedness of rural households since 1981  it was around 20 per cent in 1981 and is currently about 27 per cent. Perhaps more disquieting than the mere fact of a rise in rural indebtedness is that debt incurred to finance household expenditure is also exhibiting an upward trend. This suggests that farmers incomes are no longer sufficient to finance even routine expenditure.               
	What are the factors which have contributed to the fall in living standards of large numbers of rural households? The answers depend almost entirely on who is providing them. Of course, a favourite whipping horse of many is the package of economic reforms initiated since 1991, which inevitably also involved the opening up of the Indian economy to external competition.         
	Others, including regrettably even an expert group constituted by the Government of India to study the causes of rural indebtedness, contend that there has been a deceleration in the growth of agricultural output, caused by stagnation in yields per hectare since the Nineties. There is some convergence of beliefs between these groups because it is also tempting to argue that the stagnation in yields has been caused by the decline in public investment in agriculture, which, in turn, was the consequence of attempts to practise fiscal discipline as part of the package of economic reforms. Unfortunately, most of these theories do not stand closer scrutiny of the available evidence. They seem to be based on preconceived notions, phobias or casual eyeballing of the data.        
	Consider, for instance, the issue of whether there has been a deceleration in the growth of agricultural output since the Nineties. Careful examination of long-term agricultural statistics on gross cropped area, output and yields during the period 1950 to 2004 does not reveal any structural break in 1991. There may be some case to split the period after the Green Revolution into two  1970 to 1987 and 1987 to 2004. The trend annual growth rates then turn out to be 2.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent. The inevitable conclusion is that if there has been a switch in regimes, the break predates the Nineties.        
	Much has also been written about the plight of Indian farmers who have supposedly wilted under the intense competition from multinational conglomerates after the opening up of the Indian economy. Nothing could be farther from the ground realities. It is true that a consequence of the post-reform trade liberalization has been the elimination of quantitative restrictions on agricultural imports. But, the Uruguay-round agreement on agriculture allowed countries to set up relatively high tariff walls in place of quantitative restrictions.         
	And India has certainly taken advantage of this provision. In effect, there has been no flood of agricultural imports into the economy. What successive governments have done is to allow large volumes of imports only after domestic prices have risen beyond tolerable limits. In other words, foreign competition has not caused any sharp fall in agricultural prices (as every housewife knows) and so cannot be held responsible for the plight of farmers. Incidentally, it is ironic that the same set of people who believe that foreign imports are responsible for farmers distress also rail against exports of agricultural products, although this would increase farm incomes.        
	Of course, there is need for some policy initiatives to correct the situation. The loan-waiver scheme is, at best, a temporary palliative, and does not really address the root causes. An appropriate set of policies must comprise both short-term measures as well as those designed for the longer term. In the former set must belong steps to provide better access to credit and seeds. It is also important to ensure that small farmers are able to get better prices for their produce, perhaps by reducing the power of intermediary traders.               
	Over the longer run, there has to be a surge in agricultural productivity. This is important not just for the sake of farmers but also for the economy as a whole. The supposed deceleration in agricultural productivity in the Nineties is actually a red herring. Even the post-Green-Revolution annual growth rate of 2.7 per cent is low against the background of an ever-increasing population and growing demands caused by rising incomes in other sectors of the economy. The technological breakthroughs leading up to the Green Revolution occurred more than three decades ago. Our current levels of agricultural productivity do not compare very well with international levels. It is time that agricultural scientists engineered another revolution in agricultural practices.         
	But, even dramatic improvements in productivity will not suffice to provide livelihood to the numbers of people who are currently dependent on agriculture. It is almost an iron law of development that people migrate out of agriculture in large numbers to the manufacturing and services sectors. Despite 60 years of planned development, the Indian economy has still not achieved this demographic transition, and rural households still constitute a majority of the population. This failure is largely owing to the development path adopted in the second five-year plan and subsequently. An overwhelming priority was given to capital-intensive heavy industry. While heavy industries were important in building up the backbone of the economy, they were unable to generate large-scale employment. So the emphasis on heavy industry meant that the non-agricultural sectors were not in a position to draw away large masses of people from the rural sector.         
	The clock cannot be turned back. But, even today, the government can restore some balance in the development strategy by promoting the development of labour-intensive industries in general and agro-based industries in particular.

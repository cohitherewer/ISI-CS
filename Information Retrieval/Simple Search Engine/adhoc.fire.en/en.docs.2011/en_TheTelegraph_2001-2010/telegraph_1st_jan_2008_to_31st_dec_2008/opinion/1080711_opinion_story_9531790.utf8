	Politics is nothing without power play. Either Manmohan Singh took his time to realize this or he deliberately played touch tennis, instead of the power variety, assuming that being gentle would help. The display of prime ministerial authority by Mr Singh has transformed many of his foes into admirers. The people of India do not want their prime minister to be someone who can be dictated to or bullied. They want their prime minister to lead, to give to the nation a direction. By deciding to stand firm on the Indo-US nuclear deal, despite threats from the Left, the prime minister made it clear that he would not compromise on an issue that he thought was vital to Indias development. He did not allow any kind of ideological bombardment or petty electoral calculations to dislodge him from what he thought was good for India. This is exactly how India expects its prime minister to behave. The stature that Mr Singh has gained is reflected in the manner world leaders talk to him on critical matters. The cloud of political uncertainty that had enveloped New Delhi when Mr Singh had left for Japan did not stop world leaders from talking to him as the leader of India.        
	Mr Singh has not only donned the mantle of leadership, but he has adopted its vocabulary as well. On his way to Japan, Mr Singh remarked, The world system is not a morality play; it is a power game. This was apparently a throwaway comment about the G8 meeting, but its resonances for the Indian situation and the prime ministers determination about the nuclear deal cannot be missed. Those who are opposed to the nuclear deal are claiming to look at it through the prism of morality and ideology. The prime minister is looking at the deal and related issues in terms of Indias interests and what will help to make India more powerful. The difference between the two approaches is fundamental. What is even more important, however, is that Mr Singh is unabashedly talking the language of power. Mr Singh had previously been reluctant to use this language. Now he is not only using it, but also matching his deeds to his words. This, perhaps, is what has caught the comrades on the wrong foot. They did not expect the gentle Mr Singh to turn around and tell them enough was enough. The Telegraph welcomes Mr Singh to the world of power play and hopes he serves many more aces.

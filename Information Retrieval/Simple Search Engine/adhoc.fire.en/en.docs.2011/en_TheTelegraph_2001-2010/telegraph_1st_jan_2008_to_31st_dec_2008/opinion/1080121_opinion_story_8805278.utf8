	It is difficult to imagine why someone would want to be a full-time life model for art students. To have to strike a difficult pose for hours without any clothes on sounds like nobodys idea of fun. Perhaps being looked at, on a daily basis, by worshippers of beauty is its own reward. But beauty is supposed to have gone out of fashion, and dead cows pickled in formaldehyde have taken its place. Italian life models, at any rate, have refused to take any more the traditional neglect meted out to their profession in art academies. Very few of them have fixed annual contracts, and end up getting paid a pittance. They do have a trade union, but this earned them little professional recognition and prestige. So they have staged a public protest and launched an appeal, which has attracted the attention of art teachers and bureaucrats.
    
	The situation is the same, or perhaps worse, in India. What an Italian life model earns in euros comes to Rs 1450 an hour; those with a full-time job contract earn around Rs 52,000 per month. A model at the Government Art College in Calcutta, if she is lucky, will get about Rs 150 per sitting, and she is usually out of work during the vacation. Besides, there is more than a whiff of ill-repute in the public perception of what they do. Taking ones clothes off in Italy is not the same as doing so in India, particularly for a woman. The plight of life models is a barely noticed example of how certain unorganized professions, practised mostly by women, often suffer because of a combination of gendered neglect and moral prejudice. Theirs is an invisibility that is all the more ironic given the role they play in the visual arts. It is also significant that the medias interest in the protest in Italy has a great deal to do with their posing in the nude, rather than the injustice of their plight. The academic life model lives on as a rather sad time-warp in the world of contemporary art.

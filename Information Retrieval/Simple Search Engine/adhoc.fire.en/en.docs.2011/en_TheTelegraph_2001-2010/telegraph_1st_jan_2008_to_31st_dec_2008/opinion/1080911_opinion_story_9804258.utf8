	Suffering in private                  
	Sir  It is shocking to learn that 88 per cent of students studying up to the eighth standard in West Bengal have to be privately tutored (Tuition topper, Aug 25). The figure may be disturbing but is not unexpected altogether. It is a well-known fact that the modern education system does not teach our children to think independently. As a result, they have to be supported by as many props as possible  private coaching being the chief among them. Children do not bother to be attentive in class since they know that private tutors are ever ready to help them with notes and model answers. This dependency has created a category of students who not only lack basic skills but also cannot interact freely with friends or family.           
	But who is to be blamed for this situation? Undoubtedly, a part of the blame must go to the education system, which claims to make students proficient in every field but ends up failing in this task miserably. Parents, who think tuition is the key to success, are also at fault.           
	When we are talking of childrens education, we have to remember that these boys and girls are not even in their teens. Hence, it is the responsibility of teachers and parents alike to look after their welfare. Private coaching stunts their mental abilities, and eats up much of their time. Shuttling from schools to coaching centres with little respite in between, students end up missing the simple joys of childhood. Parents would do well to stop children from attending tuition classes. The time thus saved can be used to get them involved in some recreational activity. This would help the children to relax and sharpen their minds.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kavitha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The fact that an overwhelming number of students in West Bengal receive private tuition is a comment on the standards of teaching in schools. School teachers receive handsome salaries but they seem to be only interested in other perks and incentives. They have no time to spare for even needy students who cannot afford to have private tutors. It is a pity to see the practitioners of this noble profession sacrificing their lofty ideals for the sake of material comfort.           
	Yours faithfully,

	On the road          
	Sir  One can feel the approach of the Pujas nowadays not so much by the changes in weather as by the increasing audacity of our auto-wallahs. The autorickshaws running in south Calcutta have suddenly started charging more in spite of the fact that they had increased the fare only a few days back. The Pujas also seem to give autorickshaws the licence to take every by-lane while commuting to and fro. As a result, it is not difficult to find an autorickshaw squeezing itself into a lane through which barely two men can walk side by side. Such a dangerous practice imperils the lives of both the passengers as well as the hapless pedestrian.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The favoured mode of transportation of citizens of Shillong is not the three-wheeler but taxis. But lately, residents of Shillong have been having a bad time in the hands of unscrupulous taxi drivers who literally take them for a ride, and a bumpy one too, each time they board the vehicles. The drivers have got into the habit of extracting a few extra bucks from the passengers on each ride. A trip from Laban to Police Bazaar costs Rs 7. But if a passenger gives the driver Rs 10, the latter refuses to return the change on the pretext that he does not have Rs 3 in his pocket. The drivers who stand in queue in Last Stop are also very ill-mannered. They bad-mouth the passengers if the latter happen to cross their paths. And unless the taxi at the head of the line gets its full quota of passengers, they would not allow the taxis coming second or third in the line to leave. This creates a problem for passengers who are in a hurry.           
	If a passenger wants to go to any place that does not fall within the stipulated taxi-routes, the drivers would demand a minimum for Rs 100. That is not all. The cabbies park their taxis anywhere, flouting traffic rules with impunity. Some of them do not even have a driving licence but they always get away by bribing the police. Traffic jams and road accidents would increase in Shillong if steps are not taken to curb the danger posed by the local cabs. For the convenience of passengers, rate charts must be drawn up and pasted on the taxis.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Rittika Deb, Shillong

                
	Sir  Not just spiralling fares but the practice of keeping a vehicles engine running at traffic signals compounds the Calcuttans woes. Often, it is the passengers sitting in autorickshaws who suffer the blast of noxious fumes. Bus and auto fares are bound to rise considering the shifts in global petrol prices. But car drivers can at least spare passengers from their woes by switching off their engines at the lights.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Nowadays, we get to hear about Mukesh Ambanis anniversary plans, Sachin Tendulkars new villa or about Bollywood stars gifting each other expensive cars. Presumably, these men and women are in a position to fritter away their riches. But why cant the Ambanis, Mittals or Tendulkars use their money to help the flood victims of Bihar? The miserliness of our crorepatis, when it comes to helping others, does not do India proud. Indian millionaires can take a leaf out of the books of Bill and Melinda Gates who have had the heart to donate a large part of their wealth to alleviate the suffering of the needy.           
	Yours faithfully,

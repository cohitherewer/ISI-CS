The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Bailed out
                                                                                                                 BAILED OUT                              An appeal for anticipatory bail need not necessarily be followed by a court appearance, says the Law Commission. Shabina Akhtar reports                        On the hunt: Both Saif Ali Khan and his father Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi had applied for anticipatory bail in separate incidents of black buck shooting				                                 
	Aftab Alam (name changed on request), a relative of one of the accused in the recent Ripon Street violence in Calcutta, appealed for anticipatory bail because he feared he would be arrested. To do so, he had to make a court appearance when the final verdict was being passed, while his ailing mother was in hospital.         
	But people in a situation like this may no longer need to worry. The Law Commission of India has asked the central government to abolish a criminal law provision that requires a person seeking anticipatory bail to appear before the court. According to this provision, the person can also be arrested on the spot if his or her plea is rejected.         
	Anticipatory bail, which comes under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), is nothing but a courts direction to release a person on bail, issued even before the person is arrested. Two years ago, an amendment to this law was sought through the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2005. With lawyers protesting against its implementation, for they felt their clients could be unnecessarily harassed, the government kept its enforcement in abeyance and sought the expert opinion of the Law Commission of India.         
	The statement submitted by the government said that the Law Commission was asked to suggest a modified version to make the provision workable with suitable safeguards to protect the rights and liberty of citizens. The amendment requires the applicants presence at the final hearing if the public prosecutor has made an application to the court to consider his or her presence necessary in the interest of justice.         
	After two years of research and detailed analysis, the Law Commission in its report in December-end last year reminded the government of the Supreme Courts decision in the M.C. Abraham vs Government of Maharashtra case where the rejection of anticipatory bail was considered no ground for directing the immediate arrest of the accused. The commission, headed by Justice A.R. Lakshmanan, observes, There may be cases where an application may be rejected and yet the applicant is not put up for trial as, after investigation, no material is found against him.         
	Seeking the deletion of sub-section 1(B) of Section 438 of CrPC, the commission held that the relatively new provision was erroneous as it empowered the police to arrest the accused in the court without a warrant on yet-to-be established accusations. This decision of the commission has definitely acted as a balm for the protesting lawyers.         
	An applicant framed on false charges could have been forced by the prosecutor to be present at the time of the final verdict. This could have been a ploy to ensure the applicants arrest once the court rejected his plea. So from the defence point of view, it (the amendment of 2005) was definitely unacceptable, explains Sardar Amjad Ali, senior advocate, Calcutta High Court. At the same time, the deletion of the provision would result in the curtailment of the power of the court to freely consider a case of anticipatory bail because it would take away the right of the court to restrain the police from arresting the applicant during the period of consideration of the application.         
	However, he maintains that the commission tried its best to strike a balance between the prosecution and the defence, but also felt that it should have suggested appropriate measures relating to the custody of the accused before the final judgment.         
	Taj Mohammad, deputy director, public prosecution, South 24-Parganas, seems to have a similar opinion. The report submitted by the commission doesnt affect the spirit of the prosecution. The report seems fine. However, from a prosecutors point of view, the presence of the accused would definitely benefit the investigating officers, he says.               
	Not everybody agrees. The amendment of 2005 isnt reasonable as the applicant at that point of time has no interim order. So its easy for the police to arrest him on rejection of bail, says Sekhar Basu, senior criminal lawyer, Calcutta High Court. Prosecutors are the mouthpiece of the investigating officer and will always want the appellants to be present. But if their presence is required at all, let the judge decide on it.         
	On being asked about his reaction to the deletion of the sub-section of Section 148 of CrPC, he says, First, the law shouldnt have been amended in 2005. Now that they have realised the error and taken appropriate steps to check it, Id say its better late than never. He, however, points out that once anticipatory bail is rejected, the police are free to arrest. This is perhaps wishful thinking on the part of the commission which is seeking to strike a balance between the needs of the investigation team and the personal liberty of the appellant. Needless to say, its always the former who gets an upper hand.         
	Amidst all the debate of whether the decision is a valid one or not, Amitava Ganguly, special prosecutor, Government of India, says, This amendment isnt going to affect the administration of justice. One needs to keep in mind that the arrest of the accused is only a minor part of the investigation. In many countries, the accused arent arrested till the final charge sheet has been drafted. Its a good decision that has to be welcomed.         
	The commission also noted that the co-existent jurisdiction of the Court of Session (where the case is on) and the high court under Section 438 had generated avoidable litigation. The code does not prescribe any specific order in which the two alternative co-existent forums are to be approached for the grant of anticipatory bail  the choice having been left to the applicant. It recommended streamlining the procedure by suggesting that if an application under Section 438 is made by a person either to the high court or the Court of Session, no further application by the same person shall be entertained by the other court.         
	In a nutshell, all the recommendations made by the Law Commission are bound to bar the accused from buying more time to make a fresh appeal at a higher court. So despite deleting the clause it seems like the commission has chosen to let the power reside with the investigative officers, sums up Sardar.

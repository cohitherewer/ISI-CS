                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DOWN THE SLOPE                                                    
	A genie once let out of a bottle is difficult to control. This is exactly what is happening in Darjeeling and the hills of North Bengal. The genie is called Gorkhaland agitation. Once upon a time, Subash Ghisingh released this genie and married it to the politics of violence. Today, after the dethroning of Mr Ghisingh from the position of the supremo of the Gorkhaland agitation, similar forms of politics continue to be used by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. The indefinite strike called suddenly on Monday is going to cause immense hardship to the tourists who have gone up to Darjeeling and the neighbouring areas as well as to the people of the region. That apart, tourism will suffer a major setback. There is nothing that travellers fear more than disruption and insecurity. The indefinite bandh will successfully instil these fears in those who want to escape the heat and get a glimpse of the Kanchenjungha.        
	At the heart of the agitation now holding North Bengal to ransom is the question of identity. The problem is that such a profound issue was reduced to being a political ploy. Now it has come home to roost. The present demand is that the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha should be invited by the Centre for talks on Gorkhaland. The Morcha is not willing to discuss any other issue. The operative part of this demand is the phrase by the Centre. The champions of Gorkhaland are no longer willing to accept initiatives taken by the West Bengal government. They want to do business directly with the government in New Delhi. The West Bengal government may or may not be a party to such negotiations. This can be read as a statement of the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas seriousness regarding the separate statehood demand. There is one reason for welcoming the claim for a separate discussion only on Gorkhaland. There is an urgent need to separate the question of identity from that of local politics. It is significant that the trigger for the current bandh call was the fact that some supporters of the Morcha who had put up a blockade on the road near Bagdogra airport were stoned. This suggests that there is a substantial body of opinion not quite in tune with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. The bigger question of the identity of the Gorkhas in Darjeeling has become embedded in such quarrels. It needs to be taken out of the quagmire of endless bandhs and debated on a different level.

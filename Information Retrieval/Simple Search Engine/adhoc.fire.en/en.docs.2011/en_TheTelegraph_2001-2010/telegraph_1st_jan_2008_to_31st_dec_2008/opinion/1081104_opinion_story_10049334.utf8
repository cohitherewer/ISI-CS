	After the flight                  
	Sir  I have been surprised to read the various comments on the open letter written by Ratan Tata (Oct 17). The negative comments made by some of the political parties only betray their complete lack of understanding of the reality. The comments amount to diversionary tactics to confuse the situation. I further regret that some of my business brethren  all of them remain unnamed  should have joined this misguided chorus.           
	What Tata has expressed several times is in essence entirely correct, in that no one can be expected to work smoothly in such a hostile environment as was created in Singur, even though the government has been consistently supportive of the efforts to establish a new, large and prospective industry in the state. Ratan Tata is one of the finest and most sincere industrialists in the country and has no reason to stand for elections to prove his bona fides, as some have suggested.          
	Today Singur, tomorrow who knows where!          
	All of us must have the commitment to take the state and its people forward to prosperity without indulging in petty politics. I therefore sincerely hope that reason will win the day and things will be seen in proper perspective.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.K. Birla, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I was really moved by Ratan Tatas open letter addressed to the people of West Bengal. It was indeed kind of him to take out time from his busy schedule and think about the current situation of our state and give us a realistic picture of the times that lie ahead of us. We should be ashamed that instead of lauding him, many of us are dumping blame on him, unfairly.           
	I find that many people have misunderstood the letter, and even branded Tata a spokesperson of the ruling party in the state. I feel that the industrialist has been almost guardian-like in urging the youth of Bengal to carefully choose how they want to develop their future. The way things are today, I have a despairing feeling that West Bengal would not be a better place to live in thirty years hence.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Deadly encounter          
	Sir  With several terror attacks behind them, the Mumbai police should have shown more maturity in dealing with Rahul Raj (Police shoot backlash boy in hazy Mumbai bus hijack, Oct 28). Rahul Raj was not a criminal as we perceive this class of people; he was a young man driven to desperation by the anti-Bihari agenda of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. Admittedly, his way of protesting against the MNS chief, Raj Thackeray, was somewhat extreme. But the police had no reason to be influenced by mass hysteria and shoot him dead, when all that would have taken to overpower him is a bullet through his hand or leg. This kind of slipshod approach is also typical of the police in India, where encounter killings are a routine affair. The Centre should take strong action against the MNS chief for inciting violence. It is equally important that the police are made to justify their action.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashwani Sharma, Ghaziabad

                
	Sir  A young man had to lose his life because of what Raj Thackeray and his hoodlums have been up to for the past few months. India is already mired in divisive politics. People can hardly seek redress from party leaders, who are only interested in preserving their vote banks. But now, even the police, the custodians of law and order, have to be dreaded because one cannot expect understanding or sensible behaviour from them.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Cajetan Peter Dsouza, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  The killing of the young man from Patna, Rahul Raj, by the Mumbai police defies understanding. The MNS has carried out organized attacks on North Indians, including Biharis, seeking jobs in Mumbai. The Maharashtra administration acted only after popular discontent rose to incendiary levels. Rahul Raj had no criminal record. It was obvious to most (except the police) that he had come not with an intention to cause harm but because he had been blinded by rage. Instead of being shot and killed, he could have been restrained in a humane way.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Desh Deepak, Patna

                
	Sir  There was real danger to the public from Rahul Raj, so the police were not entirely unjustified in taking the action that they did. He hijacked a bus, causing widespread alarm. Apparently, he had not meant to kill anyone, but it was natural for people to panic at the sight of a gun-wielding young man, and the police had to act promptly. One only wishes that the latter had shown a similar urgency in dealing with the violence unleashed by the MNS cadre.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  In India, policemen take pride in becoming encounter specialists. Veteran encounter killers are honoured by the State. Rahul Raj let all the passengers of the bus free, and he did not seem serious about killing any of the policemen. But the police, it seems, were not so sure of his motives. What harm could have come from a vulnerable young man remains a mystery. Rahul Raj raised his voice against injustice. His way of doing so may not have been right. But then, the administrations indifference to the plight of Biharis in Mumbai left him with no choice but a highly perilous one.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Papreeka Kasher, Mumbai

                
	Sir  Rahul Raj had asked for a mobile phone to speak to Raj Thackeray. The police could have overpowered him on the excuse of giving him a phone. There were no hostages involved. Rahul Raj could have been deranged or a criminal, but the police had no right to summarily execute him. The deputy chief minister of Maharastra, R.R. Patil, supported the police action, as if there could be no two ways of looking at the incident. One hopes that the Centre will think about the dangerous fallout of regionalism after this unfortunate episode.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

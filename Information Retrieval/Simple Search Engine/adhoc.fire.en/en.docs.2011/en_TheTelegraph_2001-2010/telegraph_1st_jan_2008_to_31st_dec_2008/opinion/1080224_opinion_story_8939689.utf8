The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the retiring comrade
                                                                                                                 THE RETIRING COMRADE                                                          
	Jyoti Basu has done the party some service and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) knows it. He not only served as the chief minister of West Bengal for over two decades, but he also dedicated his entire life to the party and its work. Even after stepping down as chief minister, he has served as the CPI(M)s elder statesman, offering advice and guidance whenever the occasion demanded his intervention. The party has also accorded this nonagerian leader the status and respect he deserves. He has not been deprived of his membership in the most important decision-making bodies of the party, and his presence and participation has always been welcome. Mr Basus position in the CPI(M) can be compared to that of a professor emeritus in a university. The association is more important than the actual nature of the participation. Mr Basus announcement about his intention to retire from the politburo of the party would suggest that he considers his active participation in the running of the party to be important if he is to remain a member of the politburo. There is obviously a mismatch between the partys perception of Mr Basus role and the latters own sense of responsibility.        
	Such an incongruence is not without parallels in other spheres of activity in India. The commonest manifestation of this can be found among certain holders of honorary doctorates. The honoris causa doctor of philosophy is conferred on eminent individuals by universities across the world to recognize significant contributions made in various fields outside of academics. It is different from the normal doctorate, which is conferred on the basis of a written dissertation. The unwritten convention is that the honoris causa degree will not be used by the recipient. In India, it is not uncommon to see individuals describing themselves as doctor so-and-so because they have received an honoris causa PhD. (Similarly, it is not uncommon in India to see military officers using their rank even after they have retired from service.) The breach of the convention is a sign that the universitys intention in conferring the degree, and the recipients use of the degree are at odds with each other.        
	Mr Basu should not see his continuing membership of the politburo of the CPI(M) to be a demand on him to attend meetings and to take part in the august bodys activities. He should see his membership as the partys recognition of the enormous contribution he has made to the party and its cause. This should enable him to free his conscience from an illusory sense of responsibility. It will also free the party from appearing like a cruel institution that makes unnecessary demands on a ninety-year-old. The importance of being Jyotibabu should allow Mr Basu not to be too earnest.

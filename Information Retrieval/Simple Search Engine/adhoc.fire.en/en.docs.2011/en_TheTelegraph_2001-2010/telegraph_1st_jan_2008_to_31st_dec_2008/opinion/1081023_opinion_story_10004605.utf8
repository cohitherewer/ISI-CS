	In about a couple of weeks time, India will reach the moon. Centuries ago, the moon was venerated as a divinity (in India it still is), the epics abounded with legends about this celestial neighbour. Forty years ago, when man stepped on the moon for the first time, ordinary Indians were filled with disbelief. Their response has changed into one of informed triumph in contemporary India. Flushed with the success of the Indo-US nuclear deal, India touched another milestone yesterday, as the unmanned Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft blasted off from Sriharikota. With the former Soviet Union and the United States of America having made a headway in space research since the Sixties, the first expedition to the moon has been a long wait for India, and for just reasons too. Indian scientists should be lauded for their exemplary prudence before they decided to undertake a project of this scale. For decades, the Indian Space Research Organization had focused mainly on information technology, telecommunication and remote-sensing satellites. Only now, with the benefit of years of research in the applied sciences, Isro has ventured into more adventurous terrain.        
	For India, the significance of Chandrayaan-1 goes beyond national pride. This mission not only gives a measure of what scientists in India are capable of achieving, but also places their work in a global context. It is a matter of no less pride that other than the four indigenous instruments, the Chandrayaan-1 is carrying three made by the European Space Agency, two from Nasa and one from Bulgaria. This goes to show the faith that the international community has put in this project. Other countries may have been on the moon and done all this years ago, but that does not belittle Indias effort or make it look like self-indulgence. After being propelled into the moons orbit by a polar satellite launch vehicle, Chandrayaan-1 will spend the next two years studying surface or sub-surface water-ice on the moon. A 30-kg Moon Impact Probe is going to be released into the lunar surface, which is going to send back data on the mineralogy of the moon  this could provide clues to the origins of the moon and the earth.        
	For many, including scientists, these are information not worth spending millions for. India has spent about Rs 3.8 crore on its maiden expedition to the moon, which, as detractors have pointed out, could have been better invested in enhanced satellite communication technology. (This is less than the price of a Boeing 737-800 and about half the budget needed to set up a new IIT.) Although it is impossible to predict the outcome, the journey to the moon might change peoples lives radically. For one, it could unlock the mysteries of Helium-3, a rare source of nuclear energy. Now that the frenzy over the Large Hadron Collider has subsided, it is Indias turn to leap in the dark. And who else but Luna could best inspire this lunacy?

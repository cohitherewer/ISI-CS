	It was not expected that Nepal would change smoothly into a multi-party democracy. But in spite of worries about the many parties working together in the constituent assembly, there was hope that Nepals great turn from a Hindu kingdom into a secular republic would inspire a unity sufficient for nation-building work to take place. It is not that such a hope has disappeared. But it is undeniable that the nation has just had its first big political hiccough. The presidential candidate supported by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), the biggest single party in the assembly although not in a majority, has been rejected in favour of Ram Baran Yadav from the Nepali Congress. This came on top of the earlier election of Paramananda Jha of the Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum as vice president against the CPN(M)s Shanta Shrestha. The CPN(M) has not taken the two defeats well, especially since the coldness between it and the other parties had begun first over the election of the prime minister. The most articulate Maoist leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal or Prachanda, had spoken of unity and unanimity during the Maoists most upbeat moments after the election of the constituent assembly. Possibly, he and his colleagues had not expected to be done out of the key posts of the assembly, the job of which is to write a constitution and establish the structure for the democratic republic. They had certainly not expected that the Nepali Congress, the MPRF and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) would band together and block their smooth ascent to power.        
	So the CPN(M) does not want to play any more. It will sit in opposition, since it has lost the moral right to form the government after the three parties together have demonstrated that they are in a majority. Questions of unity and nation-building are obviously less important than the CPN(M)s presumption of ascendancy. But a multi-party democracy does not mean just the rhetoric of cooperation; it means real accommodation and balance in practice. The exit of royalty was seen as the precursor to a modern polity, not to one-party rule. This may be difficult for the Maoists to swallow, and they are not pretending it is not a bitter pill. It is possible that this division at the core of the assembly may create further instability. But Nepal cannot escape the hurdles on its way to a new society and a new governmental structure.

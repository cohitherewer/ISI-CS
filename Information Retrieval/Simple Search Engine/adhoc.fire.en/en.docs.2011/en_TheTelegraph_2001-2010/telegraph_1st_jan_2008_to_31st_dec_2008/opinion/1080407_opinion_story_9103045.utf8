	To call Fridays bus tragedy an accident is to let off too many criminally dangerous people from being held responsible for the death of twenty men, women and children. The most dangerous must be the transport minister, who, alone among most of his party colleagues, was the first to force the accident label on the incident, thus freeing himself from any accountability. Subhas Chakraborty is now focusing on how to pass off incompetence and nonchalance as magnanimity, through working out compensation packages for the families of the dead. Mr Chakraborty was supposed to have woken up recently to Calcuttas air-pollution crisis. His strident, public shamelessness after this disaster should leave Calcuttans with little hope of surviving their own city and its keepers. The home secretary has also made an astonishing statement. Accidents cannot be predicted, according to Asok Mohan Chakraborty, so it is quite natural for the emergency services to take some time to arrange things and reach the spot. It was thus all right for the police disaster management team to reach the site almost three hours after the bus plunged into the canal. It was also perfectly natural for the first police crane to not work, and for the second one, also arriving late, to take twice the normal time to lift the bus because one of its chains had snapped. Calcutta is also the only Indian metropolis to not have an emergency ambulance medical service trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.        
	There is, of course, another chain of explanations that puts the bus-drivers rash driving in context. It directly implicates the political leadership of the state (the transport minister and the chief minister) for not yet being able to replace the current commissioning system of paying bus drivers and conductors with one that would guarantee less inhuman competition for passengers. Here the traffic police department and the government keep blaming each other for self-interested delay. The bus owners and drivers unions are obviously too important electorally for the government to think something up quickly. And the police need their bribes. Hence the endless, deadly mulling. The police, too, are yet to show any signs of having sat up to what this tragedy means in terms of traffic management on roads like the VIP Road. The only hope comes from the humanity, courage and readiness of mind of those ordinary Calcuttans who, almost entirely by themselves, conducted the rescue operations.

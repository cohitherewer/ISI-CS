	Underground hell                   
	Sir  It was a harebrained idea from the beginning to reserve the front and rear coaches of Metro Railway trains for women between 9 am and 7 pm everyday. For the brief period that it was in operation, the reservation caused more problems for women travellers than it solved. Now that the decision has been rolled back, one hopes that the authorities will pay more attention to providing public amenities like toilets, fire-safety and medical emergency services, as suggested in the editorial, Safety for all (Sept 2). However, there is only a slim chance that the suggestion for the introduction of proper facilities for the elderly and disabled on [the] trains and stations will ever be taken seriously. Metro rail has never spared a thought for these groups of people right from its inception. There are very few stations that have escalators right from the level of the platform to the exit. One wonders what purpose the escalators going halfway serve. If an elderly person has to negotiate around 200 steps up and down for every journey, it will no longer matter whether he has a reserved seat on the platform or in the compartment waiting for him. When the underground railways were being constructed, the engineers must have had a look at similar facilities in the developed countries, and surely they did not encounter such absurdities there. Since the situation cannot be improved at this stage, it may be a good idea to put up boards warning that a metro journey is not recommended for elderly and handicapped people.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The decision of the Metro Railway authorities to reserve two compartments for ladies was welcome, particularly at the onset of the Puja rush. But it was destined to fail, for the officials could not ensure that no male passengers got into these compartments. Besides, if the Metro Railway really wants to show an eagerness to ensure the passengers comfort, it should do more than just reserve seats for women. There are several reasons for passengers to feel uncomfortable inside the coaches. The fans inside the compartments, for instance, have not been oiled or repaired since the beginning of the Metro services. Moreover, they are fitted in a line along the middle of the train ceilings. As a result, passengers standing in the aisle get some air from them, while those seated keep sweating.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  If there is to be gender equality in our society, then men ought also to have compartments reserved for them in the Metro. It is unfair to think of having special seats for women only. Since more men than women go to work on an average, invariably the first and last compartments of the trains, if kept reserved for women, will remain scarcely populated while men, along with some women, will be packed to suffocation in the remaining compartments.           
	If one is late for a train, one often rushes down the stairs and jumps into the last or the first compartment. A great many would have to miss the train if they are barred from boarding the terminal compartments. It is good that the idea of reservation did not take off. The proposal was a silly, populist one, with no real intention of helping women who take the Metro everyday.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It was strange to wake up one morning to discover that Metro Railway had decided to segregate men and women. What about the basic amenities that would benefit both sexes alike? Metro stations and trains in most countries are air-conditioned. The Metro authorities in Calcutta can easily follow suit by marginally increasing the fare. Given the humid weather in Calcutta, I am sure passengers would be more pleased than irked to pay the extra penny to get cooler stations and trains.           
	During the time that the special compartments for women were in existence, I observed that male commuters invariably got into the reserved compartments and refused to get up from their seats unless asked to. In the general compartments, there used to be a few rows meant for ladies only. These got abolished during the reservation period. This gave a lot of ill-intentioned men to grope and annoy the women sitting next to them. There is no security for ladies inside the Metro trains, no assistance for the physically challenged, no execution of the regulations. And these things were not going to change by earmarking compartments for women. The security guards at the stations are often found dozing, and are least interested in carrying out their duties. I filed a complaint with the station-master at the Maidan station, stating my grievances. To my surprise, he took it very lightly, and asked me to write an application addressed to the chief minister.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  During my recent visit to Turkey, I observed with interest the social tradition of respecting elders. Be it in the Istanbul Metro, or in a bus in rural Yalova or Kaimakle, young men and women always offer their seats to the elderly, no question asked. There are no reserved seats for anyone, and they are not needed. If Calcuttans could emulate the manners of the Turkish, there would no need for reservations in trains.

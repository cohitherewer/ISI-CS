	Late on a chilly, moonlit night in a village in Bengals South 24 Parganas just after Kali Puja this year, I found myself in a large room full of men dressing up as women. It occurs to me as I write this that none of these men had heard, or is likely to hear, of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. They were just as clueless about the hideously comic public drama being played out in Delhi around this terrible old law, and equally oblivious of the battle being fought against it in some pockets of urban India. The keywords of that battle  lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered, safe/unsafe sex, rights, Constitution, democracy  would probably never figure in the linguistic or existential horizons of these men. And in spite of being familiar with Bollywood (largely filtered through Tollywood), most of them would never watch Dostana. Even if they did, they would be shut out from much of the films delicious, globalized, bilingual fun.        
	Yet, that night, the atmosphere in the room was electric with erotic possibilities, although there were no women around. The men in it were dressing up for the night-long gajon  a medley of playing, dancing and singing  that was going to start soon in the middle of the bajaar, fantastically lit up and already packed with people, just outside the room. Bizarrely, because I am a man, I had been allowed inside what was being called the ladies-der ghar. Here, two men in their early twenties, and two veteran male actors in their thirties and forties (the oldest being the gajonlakshmi, the diva of the local gajon and jatra-pala circuit) were briskly getting ready for their opening appearances on stage as women. I could hear continual announcements outside, heralding the younger actors as the hot heroines of the Adi Joy Ma Kali company. I had already realized they were household names in the village, where men, women and children were all eager to share with me their awe of the actors cross-dressing talents: Dada-go, ki shundor meye-chhele shaje ora tomay bolte parbo ni!        
	In the room, the men had sat down in a circle on the mud floor in the glare of a naked bulb, each with his own little box of make-up (the sort of tin box that children take to school). After a deep drag of their bidis and a quick thakur-pranam, they started making up their faces and necks with astonishing deftness, while a young wardrobe-boy ran around handing them things and combed out their flowing black wigs. It was obvious they didnt want to be disturbed. So I shrank into a corner of the room with my camera, which they had readily allowed me to use, although they showed nothing but indifference to it.        
	Suddenly, from where I was crouching, I realized that the room was surrounded by boys and men peering in through the holes and rents in the plastic sheets and chatai that formed its walls, and some of them had started moving into the room through the door. From now on, at every new stage of the actors spectacular metamorphosis into women, there was a stepping up of the tension in the room. This reached a peak when the wardrobe-boy started handing around the bras and falsies. The children were quickly shooed out, and the adults came in and shut the door, their eyes shining as they lurked in the shadows. In the hushed silence, I could hear that unmistakable, intimate sound of gulping made by throats dried up with breathless excitement. And somehow, it felt improper, or awkward, to continue taking photographs.        
	Then, all of a sudden in that hush, someone jeered, O bhai Brihannala!  invoking Arjuns cross-dressed alter-ego in the Mahabharat. And the gajonlakshmi, now almost fully transformed into a resplendent Durga, looked sharply up at this man, held him in what felt like an endless, icy stare, and then, with studied casualness, asked the wardrobe-boy to throw everyone out of the room: Shobkotake bar kore de! Out I went too.        
	For the Adi Joy Ma Kali meye-chheles, the nights performances were a rollercoaster ride from the Wagnerian heights of sacred love to the profanest pits of bawdry, with every register of melodrama, abjection and slapstick in between. There were adulteries, murders, rapes, miscarriages, bed-tricks and someone called Balloon-baba going round with a very sharp pin threatening to jab every well-endowed woman with it. I learnt later that there were objections from most villagers, and from within the company, to women being employed as actors. But this was not for the usual moralistic reasons. Most people felt that with the entry of women, the performances would have to be chastened, for the male actors would not feel free enough to let themselves go in the explicit or ribald scenes. So, men playing women remained the more appealing and liberating option for the actors as well as the audience.        
	After the nights revels were over, and the marketplace was almost empty at dawn, I saw the two young actors standing against the green-room door. They had changed into mens clothes, but had kept their wigs and make-up on. Around them was an uncertain gathering of men who seemed unable to tear themselves away from their heroines. After a while, most of them cleared off, with frequent backward glances as they walked away. The two who remained went up to the actors, spoke to them briefly, and then they all disappeared into the bamboo grove behind the green-room. Later, when I had got to know the gajonlakshmi a little more, he told me how they would have sex  unprotected sex  with men from the audience. But this happened only while the actors were still made up, he added with a touch of virtue in his voice, and never after they had changed back into men again.

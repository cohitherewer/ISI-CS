	Powerless in Gaza
         
	Sir  The glimpse of Gaza City in candle-lit darkness is pitiable (Back to the wall, Jan 25). There is no fuel to run the power plant servicing the 1.5 million people, since Israel has shut Gaza off from the world. People cannot move in and out of the Gaza Strip nor can food, fuel and medicine be supplied to the trapped people. Gaza is being subjected to a slow death. In the battle for survival, desperation will lead people into mass riots, anarchy and absolute despair. Israel does not seem to realize that its actions are sinking the peace process that Ehud Olmert, Mahmoud Abbas and George W. Bush were so hopeful about only a few weeks ago. Freedom and the right to self-determination for Palestinians would be the best means of ensuring a peaceful resolution of the west Asia conflict. But any solution that includes only the West Bank, and not the Gaza Strip, will fail. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Md. Ziyaullah Khan, Pune 

        
	Sir  By blowing up the wall separating the Gaza Strip from Egypt, Palestinians of Gaza tried to break a heartless siege imposed on them by Israel. Palestinians continue not only to resist but also to confound the Israelis at every turn. Despite its monopoly over the armed forces and its infamous Shin Beit, Israel could not stop Palestinians from voting the Hamas to power. But the regular bombings and political assassinations were not on the minds of those who surged into Egypt. They deserve admiration from everybody who believes in human rights and self-respect. As a Jew, I am sad to see that my own people, after all that they have experienced, cannot see the misery they are causing others. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  There are two images, often juxtaposed, that define life for the people of Gaza in the eyes of the world media. One is that of idle workers, hungry kids, and hospitals that are broken and dysfunctional as a result of the embargo on fuel and electricity. The other, more recent, image is that of gleeful and relieved Palestinians of Gaza streaming into Rafa, Egypt, buying everything from goats to television sets, and ferrying them back using every conceivable mode of transportation. 
     
	Indeed, much of the world is happy that the Egyptian authorities are reluctant to use force against the Palestinians who are coming in. But the political dynamics of the situation are more complex. The Israeli authorities are now openly discussing cutting off Gaza totally in the north. This would, in effect, economically devastate more than a million people. It is unfortunate that the United States of America, which voiced its disapproval of Egypts tolerance, has said nothing about Israels responsibility in causing and perpetuating the present situation. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Farzana Z. Khan and Santosh Niwas, Pune

        
	Fast track
     
	Sir  S.L. Raos article, Nano and after (Jan 28), is both enlightening and lucid. Once the Nano is ready for sale, there will be a mad scramble to own one. Unfortunately, the roads in Indian metros, not to mention smaller towns, are not even able to bear the present load of traffic. Given that frequent traffic snarls are a common feature of our cities, one shudders to think of the state of affairs once the Nanos hit the roads big time. The Union and state governments should immediately devise a strategy to counter the impending traffic chaos by widening roads wherever possible. Furthermore, measures such as allowing only one-way traffic along certain roads should be extended to more areas. Otherwise the purpose of having a Rs 1 lakh car will be lost.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

        
	Sir  There are some self-styled experts and activists who profess to oppose anything and everything. Many of them are against the Nano. But as Indians, they should have stood by an outstanding achievement of Indian engineering. For long, India had little to show by way of genuine talent except for the little progress made by the information technology industry. India can lay claim to no major innovation or invention in the software industry. Thus the Tatas need to be congratulated for giving us the worlds cheapest car at a time when the global automobile industry had given up hope and research on such a product. Global car manufacturers now see India in a new light.
     
	All scientific and engineering breakthroughs will have their share of criticism. But these change the ground conditions dramatically in ways never anticipated. The Nano will not disappoint in this matter. It will reduce vehicular pollution and offer much more safety than a two-wheeler. The authorities will be forced to design multi-storied car-parking facilities in our cities. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Goa

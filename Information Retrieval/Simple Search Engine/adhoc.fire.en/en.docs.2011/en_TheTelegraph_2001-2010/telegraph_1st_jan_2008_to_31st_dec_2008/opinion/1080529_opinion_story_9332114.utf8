The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When Time Stood Still
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WHEN TIME STOOD STILL                                  China Diary - Neha Sahay                              
	The earthquake has united the Chinese and unleashed a flood of patriotism. At the start of the three days of official mourning, China stood still for three minutes  even its internet users, as shown in a graph prepared by Google. The China Daily reads as if a war is on; the news is all about heroism, sacrifice and bravery.        
	It is difficult to believe the gritty tales of survival. A husband shielded his wifes body and before dying, told her to stay alive to guide their son through life after university. Desperate to die, the wife could find only one way of staying awake: she kept hitting her leg that was trapped beneath the debris with a brick till it bled, then drank the blood that flowed over her husbands back. When the rescuers came 73 hours later, she amputated her own leg with a saw. Many drank their own urine.         
	Nine teachers led 71 children on a 36-hour trek to safety over three rumbling mountains and a foggy forest. A six-year-old, buried with her classmates, saw them gradually fade away. Afraid she would too, she kept singing till the rescuers came, and then cheered them as they struggled to free her. A three-year-old saluted his rescuers with his only working arm.        
	Then there are the incredible accounts of sacrifice by ordinary people: teachers and mothers used their bodies to shield children from falling concrete; they died, but the children underneath them survived. One such mother typed this SMS on her mobile, and placed it in her babys hands: my darling, if you are still alive to read this, remember I shall always love you.                
	Stolen sun        
	Some people actually attended to others even though they knew that their own families needed help. A government official hurrying to a collapsed school passed his shattered home in which he knew his son lay. But the thousands that had gathered at the school asked him: As an official, what will you do? Of course, I had to help, he said later. A nurse rushed to accompany survivors to a helicopter, knowing that her husband was buried in the ruins of his office. It was after the last survivor was safely out of the helicopter that she dialled her brother, only to have her worst fears confirmed. Another teacher, knowing his parents and wife must be trapped at home, went back to save three students still trapped inside; he got them out, but couldnt escape himself. Perhaps the saddest story was of a policeman who, calling out for his son, heard him reply: Dad, I am here, come and get me. Seeing his son trapped more than 10 metres under the debris, the policeman ordered his team to first rescue those children who were easier to extricate. He saved 30; but lost his only son.        
	This poem, sent as an SMS, captures the mood of the country: Here, my child/ Grasp Moms hand. The road to heaven/ Is too dark/ Mom is afraid/ You will hit your head/ Hurry child!/ Hold moms hand./ Mom will guide you/ With your hands in mine./ I am scared/ The road to heaven/ Is too dark/ I cant find your hand/ Since the collapsed walls/ Stole the sun/ I cant see/ Your tender eyes either/ My child,/ Get going on the road ahead/ No sorrow,/ No more endless textbooks/ No more of Daddys scolds/ Just remember/ The appearance of Daddy and I/ Well be together again forever, and forever/ Mom,/ Dont worry./ The road is a little crowded/ With many classmates and friends,/ On the dark way./ We all say/ Smile. And no cry!/ Anyones Mom is our mother/ Any kid is a child of Mom/ The days without me/ Give your love to those alive/ My dear Mom!/ Smile. And no cry!/ As tears cant illuminate my road./ Let me walk slowly on my own/ Mom, I keep your face and Daddys in my heart./ Remember our promise/ We will be family again!

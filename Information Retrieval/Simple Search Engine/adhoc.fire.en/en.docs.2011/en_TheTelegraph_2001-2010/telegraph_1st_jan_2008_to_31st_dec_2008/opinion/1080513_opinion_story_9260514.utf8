	Between the Pokhran blasts, conducted ten years ago, and the present, the world has seen major ups and downs. The United States of America, post-9/11, stands on shaken ground, while India, with its many niggling problems, is set determinedly on becoming the next global superpower. It is perhaps possible to claim, retrospectively, that the Pokhran blasts stood for some sort of a statement of such an aspiration. On May 11, 1998, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, heading the newly-elected National Democratic Alliance, decided to go nuclear. Indian scientists carried out three tests in the deserts of Rajasthan that were followed by two more on May 13. There was a lot of scepticism about the real intent behind the blasts. It was difficult to take the Bharatiya Janata Party-led governments expressed intention at face value. Mr Vajpayee tried his best to make a case for national pride, turning Pokhran into a symbol of Indias coming of age in the global arena. However, beneath this rhetorical faade, it was soon apparent that the blasts were motivated by self-interest. Pokhran was the BJPs trump card, meant to bolster support when its popularity was lowest. The nuclear tests should have opened out a range of diplomatic realignments, but in reality they remained not much more than muscle-flexing. Shortly afterwards, Pakistan retaliated by showing its own nuclear prowess. With the threat of sanctions from the US, strong criticism from the international community, and little impact on its neighbours, India was left in the lurch. The Cold War had shown how the nuclear genie could be kept in the bottle through clear-cut policies, diplomatic brainstorming and a widespread awareness of the dangers of nuclear power. In both India and Pakistan, none of these figured as strategic imperatives.        
	The two phases in which India has tested nuclear weapons in Pokhran  in 1974 under Indira Gandhi, and later in 1998  ended up as false triumphs because of a severe lack of diplomatic vision. That failure continues now with the stalled Indo-US nuclear deal, brokered after long negotiations by the United Progressive Alliance government, and opposed by the Left. Indias relations with the US became dramatically stronger under P.V. Narasimha Rao, and were then cemented in the aftermath of 9/11. The pending nuclear deal now gives India its first real chance of joining the league of the superpowers. This opportunity should be seized without delay.

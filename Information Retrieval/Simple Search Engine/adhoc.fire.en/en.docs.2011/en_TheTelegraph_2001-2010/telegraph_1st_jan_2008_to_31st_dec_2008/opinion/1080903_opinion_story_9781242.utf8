The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | If its SIMI,   it must smell of terror
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       If its SIMI,   it must smell of terror
          With the Supreme Court slated to hear the case for the controversial ban on the Students Islamic Movement of India later this month, Anirban Das Mahapatra analyses the law that labels an outfit with the terrorist tag                          Facing flak: SIMI activists rounded up in Ahmedabad last month                                        
	Its a debate thats raging unabated across the country these days. On August 5, a special Delhi High Court tribunal, presided over by Justice Geeta Mittal, lifted a ban on the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) on the ground that there was no evidence to convincingly brand it an unlawful or terrorist organisation. But before SIMI members following six years of ostracism had a chance to celebrate, the Supreme Court put a stay on the ban for a further six weeks, with another hearing slated for September 24.         
	Clearly, the SIMI story is far from over. Especially since the Gujarat blasts in July are also being attributed to them. But while the nation is locked in a discussion over whether or not the ban on SIMI is justified, some experts are now pointing fingers at the arbitrariness of the law that can brand an organisation unlawful, and how a legislation like this can fall prey to political or partisan interests.        
	The legality of organisations or movements in India are judged by the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1963, which was given its final form through an ordinance in 2004. To give the law more teeth, the ordinance fuses the UAPA with certain elements of the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act (PoTA), following its dissolution in 2002. Going by the legislation, an association can be declared unlawful if the Central Government is of the opinion that any association is, or has become, an unlawful association, and may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare such association to be unlawful.         
	Theoretically, the law requires every such notification to specify the reason for issuing it, while referring it to a tribunal which would then adjudge whether or not there is sufficient cause to endorse the governments opinion. However, the law also says, nothing shall require the Central Government to disclose any fact which it considers to be against the public interest to disclose.         
	Critics say that this is a loophole that can be exploited while invoking the law since the entire legislation rests solely on the premise that the governments opinion is unquestionable. And since the government is not obliged to publicly disclose its findings beyond the courtroom, critics say the entire process lacks transparency.         
	As social activist and criminal lawyer Teesta Setalvad points out, Ideally, the governments decision to label an organisation as unlawful should rest on evidence gathered through authentic investigations carried out by the countrys police. Unfortunately, no state boasts a police force that is wholly accountable to the state, or can be trusted to carry out perfect investigations. How can we then blindly accept what they say?        
	Even senior members of the government feel that the law has flaws which need to be addressed. Kapil Sibal, senior lawyer and Union minister for science and technology, says, The rule of law demands that any harsh legislation, while spelling out its purpose, must be substantially reasonable, which the UAPA is not. The legislation still hinges on the quality of investigation carried out by the police, which in our country can easily be subverted by politics. And it has been further complicated by putting in clauses from PoTA, and other sections such as the right to apply for bail.        
	Of the 34 associations currently banned by the government under the UAPA, 18 are of Maoist or Naxalite inclination, three have links to the Khalistan movement, one to the LTTE and 12 are Islamic outfits. Experts find it significant that not one of these is a Hindu extremist group. There isnt a single Hindu body there, no VHP, no Bajrang Dal, says Delhi High Court advocate Rebecca Mammen John. Clearly, the application of the law is what matters here, along with who it is being applied by, she observes.        
	Others too doubt the states agenda when it comes to invoking the UAPA to ban an organisation. Why is it that the government only identifies organisations as unlawful if they happen to stem from minority communities? asks senior Supreme Court lawyer and human rights activist Colin Gonsalves. The arbitrariness of the UAPA lies in the fact that while an outfit proved to have links with the Gujarat riots or the church-burning incidents in Orissa is given the go-by, a body like SIMI is targeted even when no conclusive evidence has been found against them.        
	But those within the government maintain that there are good reasons for banning organisations such as the SIMI. Maloy Krishna Dhar, a former cop and joint director with the Intelligence Bureau, explains why investigations carried out by government sleuths are the best evidence to go by. On many occasions, hard evidence will be lacking, says Dhar. It is not possible for investigators to break into terrorists circles with video cameras and return with footage that conclusively proves their involvement in illegal activities, he reasons.         
	Instead, Dhar says that a bodys unlawful activities are established through years of investigations. Sometimes sleuths go through the records of a particular organisation dating back several years, along with records of interrogations and investigations to make an inference. So when the government forms an opinion, it is based on years of intelligence work and cant wholly be deemed circumstantial, says Dhar.        
	Even so, experts maintain that the UAPA is a draconian law. Prashant Bhushan, senior Supreme Court advocate, says, It doesnt specifically define what an unlawful activity actually is. For example, if one extends medical help to an injured member of a banned outfit, the person can be rounded up by the police, who might choose to define such help as unlawful. Besides, under the law, confessions made during police interrogations can be produced as evidence in court. That is unconstitutional in the context of human rights violations.         
	But the UAPA does offer room to challenge a ban. If found unconvincing, the organisations appeal may be rejected, following which a ban could be imposed, with the option of extending it every two years.         
	Moreover, at any point of time during the ban, the body has the option to challenge the ruling. But that only initiates a long procedure, which, like any other case, could drag on for years without producing any result, says Setalvad.        
	John takes a more critical view. In the 2005 Delhi blasts case, the police picked up four people only because they were Kashmiri Muslims. They are now being tried on the basis of the vaguest of evidences. When the state is hard pressed to try people on such flimsy grounds, how realistic is the possibility of challenging a ban, she asks.         
	Nonetheless, some feel its worth a try. For sometimes, rare as it may be, the government also loses. Like it almost did last month.

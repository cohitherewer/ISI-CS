  - Electing Silvio Berlusconi prime minister for a third term is going to be costly for Italians					 
										      FUTURE IMPERFECT                        An empty bag of tricks				                                       
	This is a wise country, a country that knows when a person is tired and has turned vicious, when it is time to turn over a new leaf. That was the upbeat assessment of Walter Veltroni, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party, just before Italys national elections. So what did the wise Italians do? They elected Veltronis adversary, the billionaire, Silvio Berlusconi, to a third term as prime minister.        
	To elect Berlusconi once, as Oscar Wilde might have put it, may be regarded as a misfortune. To elect him twice looks like carelessness. But to elect him three times is beyond a joke, for he is perhaps the most transparent trickster to have held high public office in a major European country since World War II.        
	What have the Italians been thinking? They were, I suspect, thinking that the situation is so bad that only a self-proclaimed miracle-worker like Berlusconi might have the magic to fix it. He managed to turn himself into the second-richest man in the country; maybe he can do it for the rest of us, too. And if the magic doesnt work, well, at least hes entertaining.        
	Berlusconi truly is entertaining, in a crude sort of way. He is a compulsive clown, once making the sign of a cuckolds horns behind the head of a fellow dignitary in a group photo of national leaders. He rubbishes foreign cooking (The Finns dont even know what prosciutto is). He makes preposterous promises, like a month without taxes (We probably wouldnt be able to do it because it would cost too much, but as you can see we dont lack imagination in solving problems). He claims his Latin is good enough to have lunch with Julius Caesar.        
	One wouldnt dwell so much on the clown-like behaviour if it were just the cover for a serious political programme, but there is none in sight. Having made a fortune first in real estate and then in the media, he got into politics in the early Nineties mainly as a way to evade the bribery and corruption charges that were threatening to bring him down. So far, there have been eleven prosecutions brought against him, and both of his closest business associates have been convicted.        
	Much of the legislative effort during Berlusconis previous two terms as prime minister was devoted to re-writing the laws to help him escape conviction: changing the statute of limitations, for example, so that the charges against him suddenly expired. For all his promises to bring a successful business tycoons methods to the task of fixing Italys ailing economy, he made few significant changes, and the slow decay of the Italian State and economy continued.        
	By now it is getting very serious. The national airline, Alitalia, is about to collapse, and Italians were recently shocked by the news that Spain now has a bigger economy despite having 15 million fewer people than Italy. They were even more startled to learn that the average income in Greece is now higher than in Italy.         
	So why did Italians give this Berlusconi a comfortable majority in both houses of parliament in this election, especially when the worst of the decline happened during his previous time? Perhaps the best answer lies in something written recently by the political scientist, Ilvo Diamanti: Italian society has been hit by a real collapse of the future. Almost two out of three Italians believe that in the near future the young will have a worse social and economic position than their parents.        
	This is despair. People in this frame of mind do not always make rational choices, and in choosing Berlusconi they are looking for magic. But he doesnt have any magic, and after five more years with him at the helm, it is likely that Italy will even have to bail out of the euro. The Italian State is slowly collapsing before our eyes.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       PURE AND INNOVATIVE STEPS                              Sunita Chowdhurie      Dance                                                
	Gurukul Dance Academy presented its annual offering, Nrityamela 2008, on July 13. It was a collection of performances in the Odissi style, presented by the students of the school led by Sutapa Talukdar. The school has a students wing and a performing or creative wing, and the numbers were a good representation of both.        
	The opening presentation, Ramabandana, based on a Tulsidas lyric, celebrated the mystical power of Lord Ramas feet. The number was choreographed by Talukdar and set to music by Raghunath Panigrahi.         
	Two abhinayas followed, both performed by Talukdar. Samudita Madane from Jayadevas Gitagovindam portrays Radha as a viraha uthkanthita nayika, full of love, longing and envy. Pranasanginni Re is an Oriya ballad that describes Krishnas antics and Radhas reactions to them. Originally choreographed by Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra, the two offerings were put on stage by Talukdar. Her charming stage presence remains unmatched and her sensitive portrayal of a womans moods does justice to Gurujis training as well as her own talent. The characters of Radha and Krishna appeared to come alive in Talukdars performance.         
	Siva Tandava, Jatatabigahalahajjala, was choreographed in kalaripayattu by the creative wing and performed by Kajol Hazra and Kashiram Hazra. Kalaripayattu is the martial art form of Kerala practised in the kalari or gymnasium. This was a valiant effort at fusion, but the essentially lasya-imbued Odissi style and its accompanying lyrical poetry sat uneasily with the severe military technique. Based on the Ananda tandava, the lyrics were rendered by Partha Desican and the music had been composed by Panigrahi.         
	The Rabindrasangeet, Biswa-bina rabe, was remodelled by Talukdar for 50 students from the original solo composition by Mahapatra. This was followed by Tandava Lasya, which was choreographed by Talukdar and performed by Somrita Kushari. The interpretation of this piece was based on the Siva- Parvati legend and the choreography was both demanding and beautiful. The dancer did justice to the composition and to her training and showed a lot of promise. The lyrics had been penned by Debashis Sarkar.        
	Jugmadanda, another of Mahapatras choreographic compositions, was presented by the young Rupkatha Ganguly. This was followed by two pallavis: the Mukhari and the Gatived. Gatived, in raga Bagesree, a unique innovation of Mahapatra, has been choreographed to Hindustani music and follows a complex and interesting rhythmic pattern. Both were ably performed by the young students of Gurukul.        
	Shiva Panchakshara Stotra, Nagendra Haraya, describes beautifully the attributes of Siva: the ascetic, the omnipresent, the omniscient, the lover of Gauri, the lord of all worshippers and believers. Presented by Sadhana Hazra and Pinki Barua, this was yet another innovatively choreographed presentation by Talukdar, who adopted the Mayurbhanj Chhau style.        
	Abhinaya on Dekhiba para asare was performed by Tuhina Chakraborty. A sensuous composition depicting Krishnas attraction for a gopini, the performance was well choreographed by Talukdar as a sabhinaya pallavi as opposed to a nritta-based pallavi. Set to raga Chandrakant and jati taal, the music was composed by Balkrishna Das and the mardala was played by Guru Banamali Maharana.        
	Then it was time for a Mangalacharan Ganesh Vandana, Namani Bighnaraja, which, too, had been choreographed by Mahapatra. Mare bana dhara shravana, an old Oriya verse by the poet, Danai Das, had been set to dance by Mahapatra and now forms an element in the vast body of work he has left behind for his followers and disciples. Performed by Sadhana Hazra and Srabanti Bhattacharya, it describes the power and beauty of nature and has been set to raga Shankarabharanam and eka taal.The evening concluded with a spirited rendition of pure dance in all its technical virtuosity. Batu, in raga Mohana, set to eka taal, was a group presentation.        
	The students on the whole exhibited a fair deal of technical competence and this was heartening to see. The dress designing for the entire performance was elegant. The music, though recorded, was well coordinated throughout the show and did not suffer from any flaws.         
	However, some of the presentations stretched for a bit too long. The selection and sequence of numbers could have been crisper and more tightly knit.        
	Talukdars contribution to the promotion of Odissi as well as classical dance in Calcutta deserves praise. Her repertoire too has grown and developed through many years of sheer hard work. Talukdar has inculcated among her students the purity of the classical form and technique. Admittedly, she had to compromise the pure form occasionally for the sake of fusion, innovation and creativity, but it is hoped that she will continue with her good work in the days to come.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A Nation in Turmoil
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A NATION IN TURMOIL                                  Malvika Singh                              
	A patient and sincere Ratan Tata went through the most mindless shenanigans played out by the political parties of West Bengal, wasted huge sums of money all of which have come to nought, expended energy and intellectual capital on a project that has made India appear like an antediluvian State that deserves no better than the mire it is entangled in. It is scandalous that this nation has not been able to put the fundamentals of a civil society in place, across all layers and levels, which would have enabled it to function with a modicum of integrity and honesty.        
	The amount of money that Mamata Banerjee must have squandered on her negative and unproductive campaign against Tata Motors will make a staggering figure. The inability of the Left Front government to deal with the issues at stake clearly stemmed from its confusion regarding its archaic and untenable ideology and its unbending positions in a changed world with a fresh new set of aspirations. A geriatric leadership living in the past, working with the alien models created by Stalin and Mao that have been rejected by the societies which gave them birth, can only be confused, incapable of reaching out to what the world takes for granted.        
	West Bengal will pay a price as it continues to fall between two political parties that squabble endlessly among themselves, a quarrel that has compelled the people there to wallow in continuing, unchanging indignity and poverty. Despite decades of uninterrupted rule of the Left, the state has failed to keep pace with real growth, development and change, and has not been successful in working out a structure in which agriculture, industry, education and health would have prospered. All that would have made Bengal a modern, dynamic, liberal state. A Left regime led by an undisputed patriarch for years should have been able to put such a system in place and assure its smooth functioning. This would have made way for the democratization of Bengal.                
	Black flags        
	West Bengal and its politics epitomize the disturbing reality at the level of political discourse and action not only in that state but across all of India. Dissension, counter- opinions, differing views, alternatives, dialogue and plurality are all an anathema to this political class. These men  whether it is Raj Thackeray, Mamata Banerjee, Prakash Karat or the activists of the Bajrang Dal  want everything their way and no other. They and their supporters take to the streets if they are contradicted or confronted with an opposing view. Some parade the streets with black flags, others beat up, assault, rape, kill, molest, kidnap and brutalize innocent individuals to create and spread social fear, hoping that their strong-arm tactics will frighten the mass and make it cringe in defeat. There are the mobs that burn and destroy homesteads and villages in the name of god and others who do it by shouting lal salaam. The carnage is happening all across India. No politician of any hue is speaking out against this unlawful siege of civil society.        
	It is horrifying that the press too is playing into the hands of the political class. Looking for a sensational incident, the media are running amok with half-true stories, with no adequate proof for what they are projecting on the small screen  whether it be the delay in signing the nuclear deal or the killing of Christians in Orissa. We are continually subjected to the mechanical posturings of a few political leaders. Lectures by a handful of politicians, from places where they are seen dining, partying or dancing, are played over and over again on the television even as the country struggles desperately to survive the horror that has overwhelmed it. India is being raped by those who profess to be her soldiers, the guardians of peace.

	After Iraq: Where Next for the Middle East? by Gwynne Dyer, Yale, 16.99        
	It has been five years since President George W. Bush ordered the American troops to invade Iraq, an event that changed the whole complexion of Middle Eastern politics. With the execution of Saddam Hussein and the invasion by foreign troops, secessionist forces are now likely to rear their heads. President Bushs term is coming to an end but his government is not going to accept the defeat of the American troops in a war they are destined to lose. The world is waiting with bated breath, not only for the British and American troops to leave Iraq, but also to see the fate of the country and the region following such a departure. After Iraq takes up this vital point of discussion and tries to answer some of the most perplexing questions that have plagued American defence experts and political analysts. Will Iraq tumble into a boiling political cauldron once the Americans leave? Or will the Middle East be able to look after itself without American help, which was a pathetic failure anyway? Gwynne Dyer, a senior lecturer at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, and a freelance writer, examines these tricky problems and tries to provide impartial answers in his book.         
	After Iraq begins with the American invasion of Iraq and its aftermath. But it also looks into American policy vis--vis all the countries of the Muslim world. Dyer goes back to history to point out the utter chaos and confusion that exists in the country as far as ethnic, sectarian and religious differences are concerned. There is the Shia-Sunni conflict, the Kurdish- Iraq tussles, and, with the entry of the American troops, hatred directed against a foreign foe. The author also addresses the reasons for the United States of Americas invasion of Iraq.         
	Everybody, he writes, knows that American strategy in the Middle East is about oil, but what, exactly, does that mean? And yet it is not only about oil. It was also strategically important for the US to be present in the region in order to maintain the status quo of its Arab ally as well as to look at the Israeli interest. Dyer does not fail to point out the American policy of interference in the matters of other countries that started way back from the Vietnam days and shows the folly of it. In a short chapter, he lays down the history of Israel, its military strength and its refusal to accept the present-day reality. There is a chapter that exposes the hollowness of the belief that Iran is on its way to producing nuclear weapons. Dyer is practical in his examination of the options that are left to the US as far as Iran is concerned. He gives an ominous warning of the possibility of an attack timed to coincide with American elections so that the vote may be held in an atmosphere of crisis and superheated patriotism. He also quotes the former national security advisor to point out its consequence on world opinion: The world will condemn us. We will lose our position in the world. There is also open discussion in the book about the causes of Muslim radicalization and terrorism. Dyer advises the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and Iraq.         
	After Iraq is fascinating at times, worrying at others, but never uninteresting. It reflects on the complex political scenario not only of the Middle East but also globally. The answer to the books subtitle, Where next for the Middle East?, lies in Dyers open mind and optimism. Without interference from outsiders, the Middle East may be in a better position to decide its future for itself.

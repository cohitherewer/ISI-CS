	The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) has now made history twice over. Earlier this year, as King Gyanendra walked out of the Narayanhiti Palace to make way for a multi-party democracy, the CPN(M) cadre was lost in a daze of euphoria. But success, this time around, probably did not taste as sweet. As the Maoist chairman, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, gathered 438 of the total tally of 551 votes in the constituent assembly, he not only became the first prime minister of democratic Nepal, but also the first ever leader with a terrorist past to occupy the office. As if conscious of this violent legacy, Mr Dahal has relinquished the very position that has brought him this far. Shortly after his election, he resigned from the leadership of the Peoples Liberation Movement, as if to mark his transtion into the world of party politics after heading a politico-military organization for many years.        
	It would be unwise to make too much of this historic shift. So far, for Mr Dahal, the most effective source of power has been the barrel of the gun. For this reason alone, a democratic system of power-sharing among multiple parties might require some getting used to. The CPN(M) has never cared much for principles. It has been fiercely ambitious ever since the exit of the monarchy. Although it does not enjoy an absolute majority, it has tried to influence the election of the president and the vice-president, but has been thwarted on both occasions by the combined forces of the Nepali Congress, the Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist). But, when it came to the top job, prudence seemed to have won the day. The top ministries  finance, defence, planning and labour  have also gone to the Maoists. It is also not clear if there will be a post for a deputy prime minister. In the meantime, Nepal Army is reluctant to have anything to do with the PLA, leaving the guerrillas on tenterhooks. In his new avatar Mr Dahal has at last shed his terrorist past; he will now have to lead his followers by example.

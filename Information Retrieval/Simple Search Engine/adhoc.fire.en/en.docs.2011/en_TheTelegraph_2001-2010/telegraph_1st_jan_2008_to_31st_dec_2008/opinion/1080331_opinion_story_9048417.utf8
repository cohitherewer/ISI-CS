The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Empty package                  
	Sir  That the fiscal budget of the Centre, with its agricultural loan waivers, is nothing but hogwash is proved by the continuing death of farmers. The government announced the package just to endear itself to the people prior to the elections. It cannot but be aware that most farmers take loans from moneylenders, and not from banks. Hence they cannot benefit from the waiver. The case of Lalan Mullick Sheikh of Burdwan, who committed suicide after being forced into a distress sale of his potatoes, is a case in point (Bumper crop kills farmer, March 23). Having borrowed money from a moneylender, Sheikh could not have qualified for the finance ministers largesse.           
	It is a pity that in spite of being among the largest producers of potato in India, West Bengal does not have enough cold storages for the crop. This is symptomatic of the yawning gap between the governments fancy agricultural policies and the reality surrounding production. While the yield of potatoes has increased, the state government has not taken measures to benefit from the bounty by improving cold storage facilities. This callousness leads to a senseless waste of resources. And yet, all that the agriculture minister, Naren De, has to say about the tragedy is that The distress sale in Burdwan is alarming. What is really alarming is the indifference of the government.           
	Yours faithfully,         Subhankar Mukherjee, 
Burdwan             
	Sir  Instances of farmers suicides have become so frequent that they have ceased to cause much reaction among the public. But even then, the news of the death of Lalan Mullick Sheikh comes as a rude shock, especially after the feel-good budget announcements. The state government announced a support price for potato just hours after Sheikh committed suicide. But it is doubtful if a relief package alone will prevent more deaths of impoverished farmers like Sheikh. Perhaps the day is not far when agriculture will cease in Bengal.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Kumar, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Farmers in Burdwan are being forced to sell potatoes at about a third of the price incurred in growing them because production has exceeded storage capacity. It is strange, however, that the price of potatoes in Calcuttas markets has experienced no marked change over the last few months. Yesterday, I bought a kilogram for Rs 5, which was the price in January and in February as well. If the cost price of potatoes has remained constant in spite of supply having exceeded demand for the vegetable, it is because of the middlemen who operate in the market. On the one hand, these men deny farmers the price they deserve for their crop, and on the other, they make buyers pay more for it. These middlemen exploit the farmers in other ways as well. They lend them money at exorbitant rates of interests, and when the poor peasants are unable to repay the loan, they forfeit their harvest and personal property. If the government really wants to think about the agricultural community, it should eliminate these exploitative middlemen from the chain that links the producer to the market.          
	Yours faithfully,        Arunima Basu, Calcutta        
	Mercy mission          
	Sir  The picture of Ricky Martin was splashed on the front page of The Telegraph the day the star visited Mother House in Calcutta to pay his respects at Mother Teresas tomb (Look who is turning whose head, March 26). On the same day, some students of the Calcutta Universitys English department helped a woman called Laxmi get a new life by shifting her to Mother House from the pavements. Laxmi, who is blind and homeless, had been living on the pavement for some time. She been starving for the last few weeks. The students spotted her by chance and by speaking to her became aware of her plight. They informed the Missionaries of Charity about Laxmi, after which the sisters promptly arrived to take her to the home. I was surprised that this news got no mention in The Telegraph even though Ricky Martins visit was made much of. The students who helped Laxmi deserved to be featured in the space where Ricky Martins photograph was published.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Pooja Agarwal, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  I was sickened by way The Telegraph covered Ricky Martins visit to Calcutta. Are we not aware of the real purpose behind these rich mens visit to poor countries like India? They invest their money in charity so that they can evade taxes back home. Yet the media make angels of compassion of these self-interested individuals. And each time they make visit Calcutta, the citys image as a black hole stuffed with squalor and poverty is endorsed.           
	Yours faithfully,         Aroup Chatterjee, London      
	Parting shot          
	Sir  I cannot find adequate words to condemn the teachers who are careless enough to lose the Madhyamik answer scripts they had been entrusted with (Board tries to find way to punish careless examiners, March 12). The least that is required of the teachers who are correcting answer scripts is that they will be serious about the task. After all, a slightest slip on their part can mar a students life forever.           
	Yours faithfully,         Tanmoy Bhattacharjee, Howrah

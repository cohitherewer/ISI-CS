	Huge sums of money are lost and made in the stock exchanges in a matter of days all over the world. While it is debatable whether any investor has been able to add to his wealth in the last couple of weeks, many must have lost relatively large sums of money. As I write this, the Bombay Sensex has dived downwards by over 15 per cent in a week. It has just touched a 13-month low. The fall in other equity markets has been moderate  but only by comparison to the decline witnessed in India. And the future looks just as gloomy.        
	The pessimism surrounding share markets is a reflection of the dark prospects for the world economy at large. Of course, this is quite natural. The lower the rate of growth of an economy, the lower is the aggregate profit earned by the corporate sector. Obviously, this translates into lower valuations of firms and depressed share values.        
	Countries all over the world  developing and developed, small and large  are reeling under the oil shock. Crude oil prices in international markets have more than doubled during the course of the last year, and are currently hovering around $135 per barrel. This dramatic increase in an important input is a major factor explaining the slowdown in all economies.        
	There is no consensus on the future trend in crude prices, except that everyone agrees that prices will never come close to the levels witnessed a year ago. Expert predictions about the future level of oil prices vary a lot. Some believe that the international oil market is being illegally rigged, and that prices will come down to $90 a barrel some time next year. The flip side of the coin is that an equally large number of experts predict further increases, with one estimate being a mind-boggling $200 a barrel.                        
	Some of the major oil-exporting countries realize that such a large increase in crude prices is not good even for their own economies. Perhaps, this realization has forced Saudi Arabia to promise that it will increase crude production. But even this increase in output is unlikely to result in a decrease in prices.         
	While the precipitous rise in oil prices is the most important factor contributing to the world-wide slowdown in growth, there are other factors at work. Over the last year or so, the rate of inflation has also been rising. For instance, the Goldman Sachs index of commodity prices has doubled since early 2007. All the central banks in developed countries  the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve Board  are concerned about the threat of runaway inflation.         
	This means that it is increasingly likely that central banks will give a higher priority to fighting inflation instead of promoting growth. Thus, we are very likely to see a period of rising interest rates across most of the advanced economies until prices are reined in. Unfortunately, the higher interest rate regime is also very likely to exacerbate the worldwide slowdown in economic activity.        
	One often comes across the advice that the right time to invest in share markets is when share prices are low. But, of course, this makes sense when prices are expected to move up. However, there are very few enthusiastic buyers right now because of apprehensions that the worst is yet to come. Of course, these fears become self-fulfilling  all short-term speculators prefer to sell and the excess supply drives share values even lower. This phenomenon certainly seems to be occurring today. In fact, even the big players in the market, who have big pockets and hence can withstand short-term losses, seem to be sellers rather than buyers. We are in the firm grips (or hug?) of a bear market.        
	This still leaves one question unanswered. Why is it that Indian share prices have plummeted? That is, why is the decline in the Bombay Sensex so much more severe than that in stock exchanges round the world? The current explanation and one that is often touted about is that the Indian market has been reacting to the political uncertainties created by the tension between the Congress and the Left parties over the nuclear deal with the United States of America.         
	It is sometimes difficult, if not impossible, to find rational explanations for the behaviour of the Indian equity market. And this is particularly true about the way in which share prices in India react to political uncertainties. Consider the current scenario. There is certainly a possibility that the national elections may be held sooner than later. But why should this affect the stock exchange?         
	Political uncertainty can translate into uncertainties about economic policies only if the new government is likely to follow dramatically different policies. But, in the foreseeable future, the Left and the assortment of parties making up the United National Progressive Alliance have about as much chance of coming to power as Narendra Modi has of winning the Nobel Peace Prize. The only possible contenders for power are the Congress with its allies and a coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, with the recent state elections suggesting that the latter has a slight edge.              
	It would be quite disastrous on the social and human fronts if the latter group does manage to form a government at the Centre. But, if we look back at the economic policies followed by different Central governments over the last couple of decades, it is clear that there is very little difference in the economic philosophy of the Congress and the BJP.         
	It is true that the Congress government headed by P.V. Narasimha Rao brought about a revolution in the way in which the Indian economy functions and economic policies are made and implemented. The industrial licensing regime was dismantled and the economy was opened up to foreign competition. This was certainly a dramatic change from the past. But, this was a one-off event. In a couple of years, and after the first round of big reforms, increasing opposition from all quarters slowed down the pace of reforms. Once the National Democratic Alliance government took over in the mid-Nineties, it by and large traversed the path of gradual and piecemeal reforms  there were no radical reforms. This is the path which has been followed by the current UPA government.        
	Perhaps the only explanation one can find for this overreaction of Indian investors to political uncertainties is that sometimes minor changes in public policy do not seem to have any clear rationale. Often, tax rates on specific industries are changed, seemingly for no rhyme or reason. Various incentive schemes are introduced and then dropped. Often it appears that these changes reflect the idiosyncrasies of individual ministers. Perhaps, P. Chidambarams idiosyncrasies are different from those of Yashwant Sinhas?

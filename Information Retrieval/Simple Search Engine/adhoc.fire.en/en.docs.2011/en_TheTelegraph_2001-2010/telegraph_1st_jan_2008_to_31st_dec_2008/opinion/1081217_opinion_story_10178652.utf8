	Police state                  
	Sir  Sreyashi Dastidars article, Under the gaze of the fortress (Nov 20), provided an insightful analysis of the situation in Lalgarh. It objectively documented the recent developments there, and showed how government apathy and police atrocities have caused the people to turn against the administration. But the article was more than just that. It brought to the fore the equation of power and politics that operates in society at any given point of time. History shows us that it is the usual practice of people in power (who, in this case, are the police) to oppress the helpless. They believe that their position gives them the right to torture those who are unable to strike back. Such coercion takes on added nuances when the excesses are directed against women, who are traditionally looked upon as the weaker sex, especially in a patriarchal system like ours.           
	If we go look back into the past, we will find that men have used women to proclaim their entitlements from medieval times. Women were, and always have been, seen as mens property. Hence, attacking, raping and killing women were a common way of asserting the power of one group over the other. These were accepted methods of intimidating or warning subordinate factions. It is sad that things have not changed much in the supposedly progressive 21st century. Even today, torturing women is seen as the easiest way to get a message across or to teach others a lesson. In episodes like those at Bantala, Nandigram or Lalgarh, we have repeatedly seen how womens bodies are used to make declarations of might. It is necessary that we stop this practice before it is too late. If we do not act now, the society might not be a congenial place for the future generations to live in. One cannot retain the basic faith in social values if the protectors become aggressors at the drop of a hat.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The latest threat to the law and order of West Bengal has been the peoples agitation in Lalgarh. If the problems being faced by the state in recent times are to be solved, it is essential that we begin by dividing them into micro and macro categories. The troubles in Chhoto Angaria or Darjeeling, at various proposed sites of land acquisition like Nandigram or Singur, and the rapid deterioration of health services all over West Bengal are the macro problems. The mayhem in institutions of learning such as Presidency College, Jadavpur University and the Bengal Engineering and Science University that arose out of chronic maladministration, as well as the pathetic state of primary education in West Bengal are the micro problems. Although these cases are widely different from one another, and do not share the same place in the order of importance, they also have certain features in common.           
	These disturbances have their roots in the way the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has chosen to govern the state. The state governments genuine concern for development and industrialization, and for increased employment opportunities in West Bengal cannot be questioned. But faulty planning and official high-handedness have spoilt most endeavours in the long run. The interference of the police in matters in which they should not have been involved has caused men to rise in arms against them. This is what happened in Lalgarh. It is a pity that that the police are controlled by the government here. If the police always serve the governments will, then it is but natural that people will feel insecure and break out in protest.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot           
	Sir  The report, AIDS patient left with ants (Dec 14), presents yet another instance of the abysmal state of the healthcare in West Bengal. A comatose AIDS patient was left unattended on the floor of a government hospital in Behrampore because no doctor or nurse would touch him. Apart from proving the indifference of the administrative staff at the hospital, this horrific incident also highlights the lack of proper awareness among the doctors and nurses in West Bengal. One expects at least the doctors to know that AIDS cannot be contracted by simply touching or by giving food and medicine to a patient who is HIV positive. What is most unfortunate is that incidents such as these are the rule rather than the exception in West Bengal. The media bring them into light but still are unable to make the healthcare practitioners in the state display an iota of concern. The authorities and staff in the Behrampore hospital abused the mediamen instead of acknowledging the mistake. After the incident, the hospital superintendent, Bhaskar Samanta, said that he will inquire into why the patient was not allotted a bed and why nobody attended to him. In most civilized countries, a man like Samanta would have lost his job even before he got the opportunity of making such half-hearted declarations.           
	The doctors who failed to take care of the patient ought to be brought to book for a breach of the Medical Council of India Act. The chapter of the act that stipulates the duties of physicians to their patients states that while doctors are not obliged to look after each and every patient who seeks their service, they must treat a patient to the best of their ability if the latter is in need of urgent medical care. There can be no dispute over the fact that the acutely ill AIDS patient lying on the dirty hospital floor with ants crawling all over his body required immediate attention from the doctors. The doctor under whom this patient was admitted and other associated junior doctors at the hospital are guilty of violation of the MCI rules and are therefore liable to be punished by the medical council. However, unfortunately for the hapless patients of West Bengal, the rules and regulations for our doctors are rarely put into practice. Disciplinary actions against doctors are almost unheard of in India as the members of the medical council are ever ready to protect the interests of their errant colleagues. Unless radical changes are brought about in the medical councils of the country, similar incidents of negligence are likely to occur.          
	Yours faithfully,

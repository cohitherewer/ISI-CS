The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In a neglected corner of India
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       IN A NEGLECTED CORNER OF INDIA                                  WAKE-UP CALL      The Tripura blasts should warn the Centre to take up the problem of terrorism in eastern India seriously                                                  
	Agartala is not Mumbai, nor is it New Delhi, Bengaluru or Ahmedabad. So serial explosions in the small capital-city of Tripura do not evoke the same response from the public as those in the major cities of large and prosperous states. Also, Tripura is in the Northeast  a region that has come to be so closely associated with violence that one more attack goes largely unnoticed, even when it exposes yet again the vulnerability of the countrys eastern frontier.         
	Tripura, West Bengal and Assam have for long been urging the Centre to take up the issue of cross-border terrorism with Dhaka. Initially, Dhakas response had been that Bangladesh does not harbour any anti-Indian element. However, on the face of strong evidence to the contrary, the present caretaker government in Bangladesh was seen as taking certain measures, but that effort has at best been half-hearted. Bangladesh continues to be a safe haven for both Indian terrorists and those from across the border. The people arrested after the recent Agartala blasts were tribals from within Tripura but it does not seem that their action was part of the ongoing strife in the state. There is a strong possibility that they were part of a larger operation planned beyond the nations frontiers.         
	The situation is dangerous. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be enough concern for the crisis in the corridors of power in Indias capital. There the entire attention is on what Pakistan might be doing through its agencies in west and north India. That the same forces may also be active in the Northeast seems to have gone unnoticed. Tripura has almost always been forced to take on the might of terrorism with its own limited resources. So far it has done a fair job, but the recent blasts indicate that the challenge has assumed far more dangerous proportions, and Agartala needs help.         
	But if the past is any indicator, that help may not come. Perhaps, people who refuse to vote for either the Congress or the Bharatiya Janata Party have to pay the price of their choice.        
	Like Pakistan in the west, Bangladesh today causes ripples of fear in the residents of the Indian border states in the east. The euphoria over the Bengali language and Rabindrasangeet that is to be found among intellectuals in Calcutta and elsewhere, pales when confronted with the ground reality. Even if Bangladesh does have elections later this year, what hope can the restoration of democracy bring to eastern and northeastern India? A fledgling democracy will find it difficult to stand up to the forces of international terror.         
	A solution can be found to the problem only if New Delhi decides to tell Dhaka that enough is enough. But that, perhaps, is too much to expect from a capital that always seems to have difficulty in focusing attention on eastern India. Yet, this part is becoming the happy hunting ground of all kinds of mischief-mongers, and the Centre should not ignore this fact.                          SUMANTA SEN

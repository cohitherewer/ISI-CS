The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Flying high and feeling safe
                                                                                                              FLYING HIGH AND FEELING SAFE                                  THIN AIR      With some reaction time, it should not be impossible for passengers to survive air-crashes                                                  
	In the light of the recent non-fatal crash of the British Airways Boeing 777-LR aircraft at Heathrow airport, I am more than convinced that it is time to take a fresh look into the existing flight safety apparatus for civil aviation passengers.         
	Just think of the contemporary air-safety drill. On ground, the measures are pretty tough, at times even annoying and intimidating. On board, however, it is a two-minute announcement of dos and donts. Now what happens in a situation such as the one faced by the Boeing 777-LR which crash-landed at Heathrow? Could the 136 passengers have been saved had the aircraft fallen from a higher altitude?         
	Here lies the challenge to the ingenuity of future aircraft manufacturers of the West. When there is time to react to an impending disaster, the possibility of survival should not be an impossible dream.         
	When the Japanese Boeing 747 with 526 passengers on board crashed in 1985, the entire aviation fraternity watched and waited with bated breath, for more than 25 minutes, to see the end result of a glorious and valiant attempt by the cockpit crew to save the giant flying machine and the 500-plus lives cocooned inside the turning, twisting and tumbling aircraft fuselage hurtling down to earth.         
	Compare this scenario with a fighter aircraft in distress. With a flying speed greater than the speed of sound, high and tight turns, with extremely adverse gravitational force working on the pilots metabolism, the aircraft goes into a spin, the engine fails and the machine crashes into a remote hill. Yet the pilot survives!         
	How? Because the pilot, even when seconds from death, just has to push a button, and his zero-zero ejection seat in a spring-motion vertically tosses him up, opening the canopy of the roof, unfolding the parachute connected with his seat and flying apparel and ensuring a landing. It may be injury-prone, but not fatal.         
	If fighter pilots can survive crashes of planes which fly higher and faster than civil aircraft, then why not try to re-design the Boeings and Airbuses? It may be difficult and expensive. But is it impossible?         
	Paratroopers have a parachuting apparatus strapped to their clothing. They come out of the plane with their head and heart unhurt.         
	Could something be done so that 200 or more passengers could be attempted to be rescued or evacuated from an Airbus or Boeing aircraft in a possibly fatal fall? Why not fix the belted passenger seats on a rail track to be moved backward, with the rear floor opening like a hatch thereby? These can be made to automatically come out, with an inbuilt parachute taking care of the glide, and the oxygen mask protecting the passengers heart-lung functions during the flight.         
	However, the above scenario could be thought of only if there is some reaction time for action  as there was when an Air India Boeing crashed into the Arabian Sea soon after take-off from Mumbai on January 1, 1978.        
	In most air disasters in India, there has usually existed a reaction time. One could therefore try to explore the possibility of providing suit, seat, parachute and oxygen to passengers in future aircraft. On February 14, 1990, the Indian Airlines Airbus-320 crashlanded short of the Bangalore runway. The cockpit crew had lead-time to grapple with the emergency.         
	To this day, therefore, passengers flying the best state-of-the-art jets have no hopes of surviving a crash even as it is seen and helplessly observed by the world which has reached the zenith of technological advancement.

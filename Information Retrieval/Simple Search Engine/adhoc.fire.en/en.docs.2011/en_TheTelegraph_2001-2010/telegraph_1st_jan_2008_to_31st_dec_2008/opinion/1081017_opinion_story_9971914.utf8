	Spot the villain                  
	Sir  A great hue and cry has been raised by some of the partners in the United Progressive Alliance, particularly the Samajwadi Party, over the shootout in Batla House in Jamia Nagar. The allegation that the operation, in which two suspected Indian Mujahideen terrorists were killed, was stage-managed will surely lower the morale of the security forces. How can anyone question the integrity of the police force conducting the raid when one of its inspectors had to sacrifice his life? This is the worst possible kind of vote bank politics.           
	If terrorists are slaughtering innocent citizens, then the leaders are obstructing the course of justice by shielding suspected terrorists and making life difficult for those who combat terrorism at the risk of their lives. The terrorist masterminds within the country and outside our borders must be thanking Indian politicians for doing half their job. The lack of collective will and the absence of a consensus in the Indian political establishment are too obvious for the terrorists to pass up the chance to exploit them.           
	The latest meeting of the National Integration Council convened by the UPA government on October 13, pushed the topic of terrorism to the end of the agenda. It is unfortunate that both the ruling and the opposition parties are busy playing a game of communal one-upmanship in the name of fighting terrorism. But why should they care? They have men wielding the most advanced firearms to protect them. The ordinary citizen should be ready to continue dying like cattle in terrorist attacks wherever they hit next.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The national security advisor to the Union government has rejected the demand of a judicial inquiry into the Batla House police encounter in Jamia Nagar on the ground that it would adversely effect the morale of the police. To him, the morale of the police is so important that their atrocities and excesses, and the gravest violation of human rights, can be condoned for its sake alone. Views like this only reflect the mindset of the bureaucracy, which is not in touch with the aspirations and feelings of the people.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I would like to congratulate Mukul Kesavan for his article, In loco parentis (Oct 2). It was not only timely, but was also refreshingly free from the nationalist overtones of the sangh parivar though it dealt with the tricky issue of terrorism. Unfortunately, the methods employed to deal with terrorism in India lack proper understanding of the phenomenon. As a result, on most occasions, one can detect a startling absence of initiative on the part of the State to address problems of deprivation, poverty and injustice afflicting the largest minority community. It is well known that these lie at the root of young men entering the folds of terrorist outfits.           
	I completely agree with Kesavan that the Jamia Milia Islamia University administration  particularly of its vice-chancellor, Mushirul Hasan  is perfectly justified in giving legal protection to the accused students. This was necessary for a fair trial to take place. This should be a model for other educational institutions.           
	The saffron family should do well to remember that equal opportunity before law is one of the essential features of the Indian democracy. Targeting a particular religious community, thereby creating a notion of us and them, will not help the nation in tackling terror, if indeed they want to do so seriously.           
	Yours faithfully,        Shantanu De Roy,

	Sir  Malavika Karlekars conclusion in Art, travel and the pleasure of watching birds (Oct 9) is not supported by at least two popular books on Indian ornithology. She says that our bird painters did not include background and habitat as integral components. She mentions Indian Hill Birds (1949), illustrated by G.M. Henry, but perhaps hasnt looked at it closely. Many of its plates do show the typical natural environments of those particular birds. Indeed, several are artistically exceptional (for example, the Spotted Forktail in a stream and the Snow Pigeon on an alpine slope) and seem to have been inspired by J.J. Audubon.           
	The paperback, Common Birds, by Salim Ali and Laeeq Futehally, also featured one species on each plate as late as 1967. These, by various hands, had been sourced from the Bombay Natural History Society collection, and while not as detailed as Henrys, still depicted the birds immediate surroundings (some remarkably well, such as the Black Partridge in bamboo brakes, Pied Myna next to grazing cows and Common Ioras nesting amid foliage). The real reason for the backdrops to disappear was the rising cost of colour printing. In the 1960s, with over 250 birds to describe, Alis Book of Indian Birds could not possibly have afforded one bird per page, hence the policy to have four cropped pictures per plate. Common Birds could still manage the old format because it featured only 100 species.           
	Yours faithfully,

	It is always wrong to identify boards of education with regional, or regionalist, allegiances. But all kinds of overt as well as covert prejudices can begin to show themselves in the way colleges define eligibility criteria during admissions. In Siliguri, not-so-subtle divisions are being drawn between local students and those from outside while issuing forms for admission to undergraduate courses. The local has been identified with North Bengal University, and in most colleges the minimum criteria laid down by it are being brought to bear only upon students from the region. The cut-off point for those from the other boards is considerably higher. Therefore, what looks like adjustments made to equalize the criteria may also be seen as ways of creating covert divisions between local students and outsiders, and the entry of the former being specially facilitated by relaxing, or even breaking, the rules. The principal of one college has clearly justified this as safeguarding the interests of local students, challenged by increased migration from other areas owing to the rising success rates in the Higher Secondary examinations. This has been going on for a little more than five years.        
	Is this form of discrimination, which borders on regionalism, confined only to Siliguri? In Calcutta, students whose higher secondary examinations, or their equivalent, were conducted by boards other than the one based in West Bengal have been at the receiving end of such adjustments for many years now. And the further away the boards are from West Bengal, the more numerous and inconvenient the adjustments become. Therefore, those from schools offering the British A-levels have to run up against the greatest number of bureaucratic walls. But it is all done in the name of homogenizing standards. Yet the outside students who are faced with these adjustments, even in colleges that make them sit their own written admission tests, often end up feeling unfairly harassed or discriminated against. It is as if the entire process was thought up with one system and set of standards in mind, and those not conforming to them are therefore outsiders not only to the system but also, by extension, to West Bengal itself, defined almost as a regional identity. Behind the mathematics of eligibility there is often something far more complex and elusive than marks and grades.

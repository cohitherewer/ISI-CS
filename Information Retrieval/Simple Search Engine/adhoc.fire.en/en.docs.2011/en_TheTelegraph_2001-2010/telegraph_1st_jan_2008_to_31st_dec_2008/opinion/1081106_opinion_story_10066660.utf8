                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A LAND WASHED AWAY                                  Kumar Chirantan                              
	The Misings, a tribal community with a population of less than ten lakhs, are scattered in eight riparian districts of Assam. A Constitutional amendment of 1976 categorized the Misings as a scheduled tribe. This categorization is, however, functional only in the plains of Assam.        
	A hostile geographical situation is pushing the Misings towards extinction. For centuries, the riverbanks or the deltas at the confluence of rivers have been the traditional habitat of the tribe. Most of the Mising villages are situated on the banks of the mighty Brahmaputra. Some villages are dispersed along the banks of tributaries such as the Subansiri, Dikari, Simen and Ghainadi in the north and Dhansirimukh, Dusutimukh, Neemati and others in the south. Barring a few rehabilitated ones, all Mising villages are located in areas prone to inundation.        
	The rise of the river beds after the earthquake in 1950 in Assam caused floods and erosions. These resulted in recurring changes in the courses of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries. This has again made floods and erosion more widespread and frequent, rendering thousands of Misings homeless every year. The situation is far more tragic for the Misings inhabiting the northern bank of the Brahmaputra, because the river, with its innumerable tributaries, filled to the brim by the heavy rain in Arunachal Pradesh, enters Assam through the northern districts of Dhemaji and Lakhimpur.         
	Sadly, the unfavourable aspects of riverine lands had been ignored by the Misings ancestors. They never tried to explore alternative places for habitation and the following generations of the Misings continued without a hope of development. Agriculture, the sole livelihood of the Misings, is at stake with the lands being inundated every year. Almost half the tribe has been forced to depart as continuous erosions have hardly left behind any habitable strip of land. The shrines, educational institutions, cultural and commercial centres have all been gobbled up by the rivers.                 
	Damage control        
	The Misings children are unable to go to school, and the literacy rate of the community has been ever plummeting. According to the 2001 census, the overall literacy rate in Assam is 63.25 per cent and for the STs in the state it is 62.52 per cent. In sharp contrast, the literacy rate of the Misings is estimated to be only 37.66 per cent. Some of the Misings have to live like gypsies, roaming from place to place in search of livelihood. The tribe is no position to preserve its cultural heritage now as fighting against the threat of extinction is the only thing they do.        
	The state government has not taken any measure to rehabilitate the Misings. The flood control and irrigation department has failed to protect the people from natural disasters that are regular affairs now. The flood-victims complain that for some political leaders, contractors and government officials, the department has become a channel for siphoning away money from government funds.        
	The Brahmaputra is ranked fourth among the largest rivers of the world in terms of discharge and second in terms of sediment yields. The present systems of flood management and control of erosions adopted by the state government seem inadequate to tame such a mighty river and its tributaries. The management, therefore, should be handed over to the Centre. However, the Brahmaputra Board, a Central government organization, has been working in Assam since 1980. It has been ceaselessly collecting data for the last three decades but has not been able to devise an effective plan to replace the temporary earthen embankment system introduced in 1954. The Centre should seek help from international experts in dyke management before the Misings and many other tribes are completely wiped out of the country.

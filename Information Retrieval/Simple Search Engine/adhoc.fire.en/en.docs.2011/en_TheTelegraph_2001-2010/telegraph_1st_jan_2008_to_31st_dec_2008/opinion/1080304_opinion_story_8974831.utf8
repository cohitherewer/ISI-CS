	With the budget out of the way for another year, and the unwarranted excitement beginning to ebb, our television anchors will have to look for some new story to follow zealously, one that would enable them to pontificate and endlessly repeat their dull, predictable and rather simplistic analysis of the goings-on that have besieged us. To deem Budget 2008 as an election sop because of the loan waiver for destitute farmers, while ignoring the many other unusual initiatives that make it an inclusive, intelligent budget, is superficial, to say the least. We have got so used to sops for the Corporate Shining sector that a deviation attempting to embrace a larger segment of Indians confounded the anchors, which resulted in unintelligent, banal comments on the idiot box. Kapil Sibal, Omkar Goswami, Swaminathan Aiyar and Sitaram Yechuri in discussion with Arnab Goswami was, undoubtedly, the liveliest, most intelligent broadcast on that day.
    
	Opposition parties were finally silenced because there was nothing in this budget that was anti-people! It was embarrassing to see and hear Rajiv Pratap Rudi, with a smirk on his face, attack the allocation made for minority communities. It spoke volumes about this one arm of contemporary Indian politics and how regressive it could become. The budget could be called an election budget if this government were to sign the nuclear deal tomorrow and the Left pulled the plug the day after, and if India were to go to the polls in the next two months. That scenario does not seem likely, making the ridiculous description of the budget being a poll budget a non-starter. By the time we do go to the polls around March/May next year, both the hype and the realities of this yearly statement of national accounts will have been forgotten. And even if we prepone the polls to the end of 2008, the momentum of this budget will have been lost. If the various promises that have been made are delayed in implementation or put on a back-burner, there is bound to be a backlash that the opposition parties will be able to capitalize on in their desperate effort to return to the treasury benches in coalition to rule at the Centre.
        
	Talking through
    
	The Congress has shown, time and again, its propensity to lose every opportunity it gets to consolidate its position across the country. Will it deliver on its commitments to a range of issues and realities? Will it reach out to rural and urban India, engage with their needs and aspirations? Will its leaders begin the dialogue with the electorate a year ahead of the elections, as happens in America? Will the Congress, after delivering a good, inclusive budget that signalled an attempt to bridge disparities, ensure a prioritized, honest and smooth administration? Or will it, as has been its wont, set the stage for the next incumbent to reap the benefits?
    
	As prices of essential commodities begin to rise and the electorate gets annoyed with the ruling dispensation, will the same TV anchors refer back to this budget as being one written to win votes? The debate has been superficial with no real issues raised, no hard questions asked. There was one exception, when Raghav Bahl asked the finance minister where he was going to raise the 60,000 crores from, and when he got no clear reply, he persisted, and ended up asking whether the onus of the waiver was going to be left for the next government to grapple with. At this point, an irritated finance minister pulled off the lapel mike, chucked it on the floor and stomped out of frame. He returned shortly thereafter and continued with the programme. 
    
	A healthy democracy encourages questioning, compels debate, and demands transparency in the responses of the elected representatives. Surely, the Congress leadership upholds these fundamental tenets as well as the freedom of expression. Does it not?

	Dysfunctional or disintegrating families have preoccupied American playwrights much more than European ones. Now that Bengali theatre has ventured out of its socialistic dogma to explore popular domestic themes, it has begun to practise greater glasnost with respect to American drama. Two such classic  and classical  family tragedies have found their way on to the Bengali stage: Eugene ONeills Mourning Becomes Electra and Sam Shepards Buried Child.        
	Theatre Workshops Matir Gabhire is a faithful adaptation of Buried Child by founder-director, Ashok Mukhopadhyay, even though the folder does not acknowledge the original author or text. With its devices of a deep, dark secret and a homecoming, Buried Child brings to mind many precursors: Pinters The Homecoming, ONeills Long Days Journey into Night, Ibsens Ghosts and even Sophocless Oedipus Rex. This derivative inspiration made some detractors scoff when it won the Pulitzer in 1979; according to them, only conventionally-structured plays receive the prize, and Shepard had composed far more cutting-edge work in his experimental mode. Be that as it may, Buried Child grabs you and grips you till the bitter end with its inexorable descent into abnormality in an utterly ordinary, impoverished family.        
	Mukhopadhyay moves the scene to suburban Bengal, depicting with sordid realism the grimy household (designed by Sanchayan Ghosh) of an elderly couple and their adult sons. One of our best actors, he portrays the father (picture) with minute attention to detail as a foul-mouthed man with a manic compulsive disorder. His wife (Rina Halder) tries to maintain some semblance of sanity at home. The brothers offer a study in equally unappealing contrasts: the elder (Krishnagati Chattopadhyay) is a good-hearted but mentally deficient man in his forties, while the physically handicapped younger brother (Swapan Bandyopadhyay), an amputee, is angry with his lot. Into this milieu enter the formers long-lost opportunistic son (Loknath Dey), who earns his living in a dubious manner, and his girlfriend (Srabani Bhattacharjee), also from a shady background, whose name, Shelley, is curiously the only one that Mukhopadhyay retains from the source. He omits just one character, the priest, who is not too important in the scheme of things anyway.        
	I must not reveal the horrifying yet ambivalent denouement reeking of death everywhere, which Mukhopadhyay keeps intact. Suffice it to say that Theatre Workshops actors do an excellent job of presenting this macabre tale of a domestic disaster that can happen anywhere.        
	Mourning Becomes Electra returns to that archetypal Western tragedy of the family as battleground, The Oresteia. A Greek scholar, ONeill, consciously followed the pattern of Aeschyluss trilogy to convey the internecine waste of the American Civil War. Arshis production, Raktagandha, uses Indrashish Laharrys much-edited translation, which stops with the second part of the trilogy. The first play (significantly titled Homecoming) ends with Christine/Clytemnestra poisoning General Mannon/Agamemnon; the second, The Hunted, with Lavinia/Electra and Orin/Orestes killing Christines lover, Adam Brant/Aegisthus, and Christine committing suicide when she hears about it. By dropping the concluding drama, The Haunted, Laharry skirts the most disturbing part, of near-incest between brother and sister. More problematically, he commits injustice to ONeills deliberate project of prolonging the modern theatrical experience through this trilogy and such other four-hour-plus epics as Strange Interlude and The Iceman Cometh.        
	The director, Abanti Chakraborty, locates the setting in modern times without much difficulty, and scores in expressing the high melodrama of tragedy through the gradual breakdown of an already tensed-up Monalisa Chatterjee as Christine and her own resentful, half-crazed Lavinia. However, some loss of credibility results from Chatterjees much younger looks and behaviour (Christine should be forty). Biswajit Chakraborty does not appear long enough for us to form an impression of Mannon, who strikes us wrongly as an innocent victim. Soumen Dutta makes an athletic Orin, while Biplaw Sing has an interesting interpretation of Peter, Lavinias boyfriend, as a guitar-strumming singer.         
	Siobhan Antolioni designed a set of two huge mobile pillars and costumes in simple primary colours, both too basic to require comment. The menials in Raktagandha are expendable; instead, Abanti should go the whole hog and add another forty minutes or so to complete The Haunted as intended by ONeill. In doing so, she would simultaneously uphold his radical conception and push the limits of local theatre.

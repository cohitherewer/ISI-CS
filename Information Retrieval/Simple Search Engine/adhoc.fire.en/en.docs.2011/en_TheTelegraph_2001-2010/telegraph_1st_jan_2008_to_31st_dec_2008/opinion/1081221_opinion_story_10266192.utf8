	Untimely measures                  
	Sir  The staggering rise in the salaries of the president, vice-president and governors with retrospective effect from January 1, 2006, seems to be inappropriate, considering the economic turmoil (Three-fold raise in President pay, Dec 16). The perquisites of former presidents and vice-presidents have also been hiked liberally at a time when common people are reeling under the financial crisis. Most Indians cannot afford two square meals a day and live below the poverty line. A democracy, based on such inequality, cannot flourish.          
	Yours faithfully,        Phani Bhusan Saha, Durgapur
        
	Lesson learnt          
	Sir  It is comforting to learn that our chief minister is showing signs of maturity (CM throws hands up on tuition ban, Dec 15). Finally, he seems to have had assessed the efficacy of his role. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees way of dealing with the problem of private tuition is to leave it to the conscience of teachers. However, he keeps mum on two questions: whether state-sponsored schoolteachers have a conscience at all, and, even if some of them have it, are they willing to comply with such sage advice.           
	The reason why the Left has not been able to stop this practice is obvious: it does not have dual policies for education and industry. If we accept market forces as fait accompli in the industrial sector and are willing to lay the red carpet for private capital, we must also consider private tuition to be another kind of fait accompli, as it is an indicator of the worth of a teacher. The guardians of the pupils cough up money on those teachers who can deliver their moneys worth. Another reason for allowing private tuition is that it keeps the really meritorious teachers busy. Otherwise, average or below-average people occupy the leading positions in teachers bodies.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Motleb Ali, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees admission of the unresolved bane of private tuitions appears to be an act of redemption before the forthcoming general elections. The ban on private tuitions was imposed by the CPI(M) government after the 2001 assembly polls, when the Left was riding high on every aspect of public life, especially on education. It was enforced, on paper, in a way as if citizens were living in a police state in the Stalinist era.           
	However, Bhattacharjee has realized the futility of the ban at a time when everything seems to be going wrong for the Left. Teaching is a noble profession and should not be tampered with by the vested interest of getting political mileage out of it. Instead of addressing the root of the menace of tuitions, hardliners in the government tried to enforce their own agenda. In the name of reform, the government politicized education at every level. Look at the result today: state-funded schools and colleges are in a shambles, with no basic amenities, let alone well-equipped laboratories, libraries, playground and above all a full-fledged faculty balancing the teacher-pupil ratio. Little of note has been achieved by the students of state schools in higher education or in high-profile careers at national and international levels.           
	The scenario is even worse in rural areas, which are the hunting ground of the Left. The financial status of teachers in West Bengal is one of the worst in India. Teachers are not paid their salaries regularly, to say nothing about the fate of retired teachers, who do not get their pension even after years of retirement. Given such apathy, if teachers resort to tuitions to supplement their income, no harm is being done to the society. Teachers have the right to financial security, which the state has failed to ensure. It is high time the government realized the ground realities and lifted the ban totally.          
	Yours faithfully,        Prabhakar Bhattacharya, Nawabganj, North 24 Parganas

	The airport attack alert was expected after the Mumbai mayhem on November 26. The wake up call had been given first by the Tamil Tiger aircrafts bombing of Colombo on Diwali night, and by the Maoist shooting in broad daylight of a helicopter of the Indian Air Force, killing one. The threat to Indias air corridor today is more real than imaginary.        
	It appears that the helicopter was shot at a low height with rifles or guns. Thus, it exposed the vulnerability of the aircraft flying low and slow, especially in areas where runways are small and encircled by higher terrain, or where a person can have unhindered access to the line of sight vis--vis the glide path and take-off trajectory of an aircraft.         
	In fact, helicopters continue to be easier targets of terror attacks because of their slower speed and the small passage required for their take-off and landing. As helicopters usually fly in the midst of buildings, habitation, roads, telecommunication wires and so on, every movement  for instance, who is boarding or alighting  is clearly visible to all. Helipads are almost always located in crowded areas.         
	Indian airports too are no longer free from crowds. All four metro airports are in the midst of dense habitation, highrises and line-of-sight flight path. Mumbais ghettos near the airport, the buildings on either side of Calcuttas runway, the highrises at the Dwarka end in Delhi are easy to see. The new Bangalore and Hyderabad airports are exceptions owing to their new sites.         
	However, advanced man-machine interface can make anything, even a deserted place, a site of terror. A peep into the market and variety of surface-to-air missiles shows how widespread its use has become. Around 21 countries in the world manufacture SAM, normally used for attacking high-speed jets, propeller-driven aircraft and helicopters at low altitudes. The Chinese HN-5 man-portable anti-aircraft missile is capable of making tail-on engagements against jet aircraft or head-on engagements against propeller driven aircraft and helicopter.         
	According to Janes Land-based Air Defence (2007-2008), transfer of HN-5 component technology has apparently been made to Pakistan for use in the production of the then Dr A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories. The mass use and availability of portable SAM in the arms market, however, began and continues to be with the United States of America and Russia. Russian SAM like Igla, Strela and Strelets were given to the North Vietnamese army to counter Americas mass use of helicopters.         
	Despite its faults, the relative simplicity of the Strela SAM has resulted in its popularity with guerrilla and terrorist groups throughout the world. The Tamil Tigers have used the weapon against the Sri Lanka air force.        
	The IAF helicopter attacked recently was targeted with small arms. Tomorrow it could be by man-portable SAM which is designed to target both approaching and receding aircraft as well as rotorcraft anywhere between 60 feet and 6,000 metres, undoubtedly the deadliest if used by trained guerrillas. With the thriving grey market of weapons around the world and corruption in India, anything is possible here.

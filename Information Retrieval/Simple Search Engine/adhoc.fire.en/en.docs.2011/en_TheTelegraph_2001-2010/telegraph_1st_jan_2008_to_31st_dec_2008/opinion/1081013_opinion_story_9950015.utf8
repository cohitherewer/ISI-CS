	Capital offence                  
	Sir  The withdrawal of the Nano project from Singur is the culmination of a process of decline that had set in West Bengal since the 1960s, as pointed out by Rudrangshu Mukherjee in his excellent article, Murder, most foul (Oct 5). Bengalis have been blessed with an illustrious history of the most important things going terribly wrong. Just as the state was poised to enter a new phase of economic development, Mamata Banerjees disruptive street politics bungled Bengals chances irreparably. After Ratan Tatas humiliating exit from Singur, few industrialists would be willing to wager their money, let alone their prestige, on a politically rotten state like ours.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Mala Shelley, Calcutta

                
	Sir  One cannot agree more with Rudrangshu Mukherjee that what Mamata Banerjee has brought on Singur is but a sordid replica of what the Left did to industrialization when it came to power. To this day, the Left does not hesitate to bring the state to a standstill in the name of protesting against some perceived wrong being done in distant Bolivia, or against the Arabs in Algeria. Pervasive trade unionism has dwindled the prospects of a resurgent Bengal. While banks, airports and other essential services continue to operate smoothly in the rest of the country, Bengal prefers to project itself as the model state for political protest by going on strikes called by different workers unions. The Left Front must relinquish its role of being the pre-eminent strike force; otherwise it would be difficult for the government to revive its industry-friendly image ever again.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Rudrangshu Mukherjee has given an accurate depiction of the state of affairs in West Bengal. His recounting of the history of folly would hopefully inject some sense into the Bengalis and make them realize how they are being left behind as other states in India continue to grow rapidly. India is set to transform itself from being a developing to a developed country by the next decade. West Bengal, judging by its performance so far, would be left by the wayside.          
	Yours faithfully,        Saugata Ghosh,New Jersey, US               
	Sir  Civil society, Rudrangshu Mukherjee argues, was led by artists and intellectuals in November 2007 to protest against the atrocities perpetrated in Nandigram. It is debatable, however, how much of this peaceful agitation was motivated by the goodness of their hearts. After all, it is well known that the so-called intellectuals have always enjoyed the patronage of the state government and are, in that sense, politically motivated. With the Singur fiasco, their surrogate activism was revealed before the world as they chose to stand by and watch the decline of Bengal in silence. Instead of blindly towing the line of the Opposition, these eminent personalities should have raised their voices and forestalled the exit of Ratan Tata from Bengal. Leaders like Mamata Banerjee may not know what is best for the people but the educated and respected members of society should have condemned her severely for her thoughtlessness.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu,Chandernagore, Hooghly              
	Sir  Rudrangshu Mukherjee claims that Mamata Banerjee has no vision for industrializing West Bengal. One wonders what kind of planning ought to be necessary for the development of a state like Bengal. Bidhan Chandra Roy, the first chief minister of Bengal in independent India, flagged off industrialization in the state, but he did not have a development manifesto to flaunt to the people. Unfortunately, these foundations have been ritually dismantled by the three decades of Left rule. If there is social harmony, along with suitable living conditions  good roads, electricity, and proper healthcare  industry would come in.           
	When the first chancellor of exchequer of the Federal Republic of Germany, Konrad Adenauer, was asked what his industrial policy would be, he is said to have retorted that he would make men and material free. Politicians like Banerjee would do themselves a world of good if they were to heed this remark. Only, in her case, she should keep her hands off all three  men, material, as well as industry.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Bengalis deserve every bit of what has befallen them with the departure of Ratan Tata. The people of Bengal were mute bystanders to the destructive political campaigns of Mamata Banerjee and her cahoots. Upper-class, elite Bengalis have repeatedly voted for leaders like Banerjee to represent them in parliament. Consequently, bandhs, violent dharnas and gheraos take place at the drop of a hat in the state these days. Surprisingly, the people dont seem to mind so much, and treat each such occasion as a surprise holiday. Bengal is probably the state with the highest number of man-hours lost due to bandhs and hartals. One can only hope that Bengalis will finally wake up and use their electoral privileges judiciously to ensure that the Trinamul Congress loses the forthcoming general elections ignominiously.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Abhijit Bhattacharyya ends his article, Against a sea of troubles (Oct 7), by quoting an outdated adage about there being no bad soldiers, only bad commanders. He should have added that there is, actually, something much worse: bad political leaders who exploit soldiers to fulfil their personal agenda. There can hardly be a better example of this truism than the betrayal at Simla in 1972. The army knows by now that any military victory gained by it will be politically underplayed. Hence there is a growing frustration among the army rank and file, evident in the incidents of fragging.           
	The main reason behind fragging is a soldiers awareness that his life is forfeited to terrorists who are protected by our netas. The delay in Mohammad Afzals hanging to appease the Muslim vote bank is a case in point. This indifference is pushing our soldiers towards the line of reason. Heaven help this country if that line is crossed one day.           
	Yours faithfully,

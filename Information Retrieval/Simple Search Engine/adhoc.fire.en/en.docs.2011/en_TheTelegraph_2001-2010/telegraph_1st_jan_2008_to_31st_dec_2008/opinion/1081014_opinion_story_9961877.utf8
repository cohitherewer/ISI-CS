The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fall into sin
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FALL INTO SIN                                                    
	There has been a flurry of policy changes by the Reserve Bank of India and by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. The RBI reduced banks cash reserve ratio from 9 to 8.5 per cent, but gratuitously added that the move was temporary and ad hoc; it was not something that a self-important central bank like the RBI was proud of doing. The Sebi removed the ban it had imposed last year on issue of participatory notes (notes of title to Indian shares that foreign financial institutions issue to their clients) to foreign investors not registered with itself, as well as restrictions on the share of P-notes in foreign institutions holdings on others account.         
	The occasion for such a lapse into sin is manifest: it is the crisis in Wall Street. The regulators are worried that it will spread to India. It has spread to Mumbai already, where share prices have hurtled in step with Wall Street; the regulators are reacting to their own fears of its getting much worse than it might get, and where it might spread next. The RBIs nightmare is that some Indian bank will run out of cash and close doors to depositors. It should be mentioned that the RBI was the leading culprit behind last years frantic moves. It is a control freak, and since it cannot control what happens abroad, it is allergic to markets abroad in Indian financials. It can stop securities from being traded abroad because their depositories are in Mumbai and can be forced not to register transfers made abroad. But futures are pure bets on prices in Indian markets; they can be traded as easily on the main streets of global financial centres as on the backstreets of the Fort area. So the RBI forced foreign investors to wind up the informal markets in Indian financials they ran abroad for their clients, and forced them to use markets in India.        
	If such markets abroad were undesirable last year, how have they become kosher now? If Indian regulators writ is such a good thing, how do they so blithely relinquish it now? These questions are unlikely to be asked by the men in power; but it is to be hoped that at least some of them are having these uncomfortable thoughts. If they allow themselves a modicum of doubt, they will see that migration of Indian markets to Singapore and Hong Kong was no conspiracy of the wily Chinese; it happened because those markets work better than in Mumbai. And they work better because their regulators are better: they regulate with a light hand, and concentrate on soundness of transactions rather than of transactors. Their regulatory style makes market participants comfortable and reduces their costs. The migration of markets was a comment on the regulatory style of Sebi and the RBI. Instead of lapsing into sin, they should rethink their definition of sin.

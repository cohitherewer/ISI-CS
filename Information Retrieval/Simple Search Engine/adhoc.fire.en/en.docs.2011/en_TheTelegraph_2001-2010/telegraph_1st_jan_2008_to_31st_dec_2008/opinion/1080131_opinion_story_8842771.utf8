	Giving anarchy another name does not amount to doing much about it. So the violence in Kenya remains out of control, even as the American envoy to Africa has given it a precise label: clear ethnic cleansing aimed at the Kikuyu tribe. Because this is ethnic cleansing, and because this is Africa, reports from Kenya immediately evoke for the rest of the world a vague and uninformed mix of Rwanda, Uganda, tribal warfare and genocide. This imagined scenario matters to Britain and the United States of America. The former gives huge amounts of aid to Kenya and the latter banks on it to fight the African chapter of the War on Terror. Kofi Annan, the former secretary general of the United Nations, has also pitched in with his own efforts at mediation. He has made Kenyas re-elected president, Mwai Kibaki, and his opponent, Raila Odinga, smile and shake hands with each other at the Kenyan national assembly. 
    
	But several strands of localized history converge in Kenya at this moment to create an impossible deadlock. Around 900 people are dead and hundreds of thousands internally displaced in Kenya since violence erupted after the election results were declared. The conflict between Messrs Kibaki and Odinga over who won the elections (and how) is only the tip of the pyramid of socio-economic discord. This has its own history, going back to Kenyas independence from the British, and where this left the privileged Kikuyu tribe (to which Mr Kibaki belongs) in terms of land rights, and in relation to other tribes like the Luos and the Kalenjins. In the miserably poor urban slums, and in some of the ethnically mixed pockets of the Rift Valley, where the battles are raging now, the violence is mainly between the less poor and the more poor. The local faultlines that divide the Kenyan poor into oppressors and victims get aligned with the rifts created by the conflict between the presidents. Their smiling handshake is just a little decoration on this unruly mess.

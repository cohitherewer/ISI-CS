	Two minors filed a suit for maintenance from the father through their mother, the legal term for which is next friend. They prayed for exemption from paying court fees under the Civil Procedure Code, which provides for such exemption for a poor person, as the children had no source of income. The trial court rejected their prayer, pointing out that the mother had sufficient income. The children approached the high court. The Delhi High Court held that while deciding on exemption only the income and property of the children should be considered, not that of the mother as she was not party to the suit but only the next friend. However, the high court directed the woman to furnish security in the form of an indemnity bond (Ms Disha Seth amp; Anor vs Chander Mohan Seth).                                
	Mapping the money        
	A person who supplied plastic coated maps to the district magistrate approached the court, as he was not paid for them. The maps, the defence explained, had been purchased for a central government literacy programme. The programme was later discontinued and the funds stopped so the district magistrate had been unable to pay the petitioner. The seller should approach the central government, the accused contented. The Patna High Court held that since the contract for the maps was with the district magistrate, who also accepted the goods, he could not escape liability. It was not the sellers concern as to whom the district magistrate represented (M/s Om Enterprises vs State of Bihar).                    
	The blood trail        
	The high court convicted a person of murder on the basis of bloodstains found on his clothes. The chemical examiners report indicated that the stains were of human blood but did not state that it was the victims. The accused approached the Supreme Court, which held that the bloodstains were not sufficient to link the man with the murder, especially since the report did not link the blood found on the accuseds clothes with either him or the victim. Considering the above factor and other lacunae in the case, the court acquitted the accused (Sattatiya vs State of Maharashtra).

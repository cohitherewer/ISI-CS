	Silent too long                  
	Sir  Since 1993, terrorists have targeted Mumbai repeatedly. Have we ever stopped to think how Mumbai has become such a happy hunting ground for the ultras? Much is made of how Mumbai goes back to work the day after terror strikes. But to say this is also to say that Mumbai has no time to protest. Think of Ratan Tata, for instance. It is only now  after his property, the Taj Mahal hotel, was attacked  that he has spoken out against the governments incompetence. Why was he silent in the past? Terrorists like cities where people dont protest until the gun is trained on them.          
	Yours faithfully,        Gautam Banerjee, Calcutta
                  
	Skipper knows best          
	Sir  It was amusing to find that The Telegraph thinks Greg Chappell had no time for stars (Straight bat, Nov 25). There is very little evidence to suggest this. Not a single star of the Indian team  and Sourav Ganguly would not feature in the top three  got his feathers ruffled by Chappell. In fact, the likes of Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman, Sehwag and Kumble were pampered to the greatest extent possible in the Chappell era. What he did to remove the star system amounted to destroying the career of the then skipper, Ganguly. Chappell had a willing aide in Kiran More, then the chairman of selectors.           
	But Ganguly showed his class by making a glorious comeback in 2006 and scoring tonnes of runs in both versions of the game. It must have pleased Ganguly no end to have scored his last Test century in Mohali against an Australian side that had his one-time tormentor as assistant coach. Who in his right mind would miss the services of an egoistic man like Chappell?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

      
	Sir  Just as mother knows best, a captain knows best what is good for his team. So, if M.S. Dhoni had asked the selectors to choose R.P. Singh, and not Irfan Pathan, then he must have had the best interests of the team in his mind. After the various scandals involving Indian selectors, there is no reason to trust them more than the playing captain.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Jonaki Ganguly, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Following the popular trend, the selection of Indias cricket team should also be done via SMS poll. This will ensure that the most popular players get into the side and the maximum number of people are pleased  not to mention that mobile phone companies will make huge profits and the cricket board will save lots of money by disbanding the selection committee.           
	Yours faithfully,      
S.K. Sanyal, Ranchi

                          
	Show the money          
	Sir  The outrageously extravagant opening of the mega-resort, the Atlantis Palm Jumeirah, in Dubai showed how insensitive the Sheikhs of the Arab kingdoms are towards the financial woes of the rest of the world (Rs 20-lakh passover, Oprah to SRK, Nov 22). Flush with oil money, the Sheikhs do not think twice before splurging their enormous wealth. Couldnt they have spent some of it for a philanthropic cause or two? It is no secret that the amenities they offer attract crooks, smugglers and mafiosi from around the world to Dubai. The love-affair between the Mumbai filmdom and Arab Seikhdom came to light once again, with the presence of our top stars (SRK and Priyanka Chopra, among others) at the opening. They care little if Indian security and intelligence agencies do not approve.          
	The Sheikhdoms contribution to the world economy is negligible, and actually detrimental to the interests of democratic nations. The developed and developing countries must think of ways to stop the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few insensitive kings, dictators and despots. This is important for the future of the global economy.          
	Yours faithfully,

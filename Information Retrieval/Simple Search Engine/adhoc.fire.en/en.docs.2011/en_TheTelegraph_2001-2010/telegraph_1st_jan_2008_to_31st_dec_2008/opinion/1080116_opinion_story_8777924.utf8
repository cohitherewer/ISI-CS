	The unforgettable fire
         
	Sir  It is shameful that the fire at Burrabazar continues to burn even after five days (Turf fight within firefight, Jan 15). This is a damning statement on the capability of the fire services department of West Bengal. However, nobody  including the fire minister, Pratim Chatterjee  seems to be bothered by this appalling display of incompetence. The minister and his firefighters would rather squabble among themselves than do what is required of them. Add to this the eagerness of the civic authorities to sanction the construction of high-rises without paying any heed to safety measures and one can be sure that Calcutta would witness many such fires in the days to come. 
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta 

        
	Sir  The fire at Nandaram market raises a few uncomfortable questions. First, why was the army not pressed into service earlier, even though it was clear that the fire services department would not be able to put out the flames in a day? Second, if the fire minister thinks that the affected building was illegal, then trade licences should not have been issued to the traders by his government in the first place.
          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The devastating fire at Burrabazar has once again exposed the lack of adequate fire-safety arrangements in Calcutta. The blaze at the market assumed unmanageable proportions because the fire services personnel were not prompt in their response. The fire still rages on in some parts of Burrabazar, even though firemen have been at the spot for days. 
     
	In West Bengal, there is a fire services ministry headed by an independent minister. But it seems that the ministry spends its time in doing everything but what is required of it. Every time a fire breaks out anywhere in the city, Pratim Chatterjee, the fire minister, puts the blame on the owners or the occupants of the premises. 
     
	Ours is an old city with defunct hydrants, clogged waterbodies and an electrical system which is in an advanced state of disrepair. As such, the risk of fire is high in most areas, especially in the older parts Calcutta. It is necessary to check old buildings, high-rises and markets for fire-safety rules. The fire brigade should also be equipped with a computerized map of the city identifying the nearest water point. In most cases, the fire brigade loses valuable time deciding on the place from where water is to be brought in.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

        
	Sir  The way fire engines tried to bring the situation at Burrabazar under control revealed the lack of coordination among the firefighters. Of the fire engines that were brought to fight the flames, only a few functioned properly. That Burrabazar is a congested and unplanned area cannot be a strong enough reason to explain the failure of the firemen to bring the situation quickly under control. The truth is that the firemen themselves were not competent for the task they were required to perform. They lost crucial time in deciding upon the source from which to draw water. As a result, the bellowing fire spread quickly to the adjoining buildings and shops. 
     
	I fail to understand why the owners of shops and godowns in Burrabazar had not taken adequate precautions while storing their combustible wares. They will perhaps cite the excuse commonly held out in such cases  that the lack of infrastructure kept them from taking preventive measures. This may well be true but the shopkeepers must realize that when massive fires such as the one in Burrabazar break out, then they end up being the biggest losers. Hence it is their responsibility to ensure that their shops abide by the fire safety norms. 
     
	Yours faithfully, 
   
Saurik Ginoria, Calcutta 

        
	Sir  While the ministers in the government, including the chief minister, were busy in a political rally, the means of livelihood and lifetimes savings of thousands of people got reduced to ashes in front of their eyes. The fact that a small fire was allowed to turn into an inferno proves how efficient the administration is in managing disasters. The personnel of the fire services department are an untrained lot. Worse, they seldom let others do the job efficiently. The army and the air force, which had been sent to fight the fire at Burrabazar, were thus of little help because of the lack of cooperation from the firemen. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Mahendra Kejriwal, Calcutta

        
	Sir  It was only a few years ago that a fire destroyed the Calcutta Book Fair. As distraught shopowners and booklovers rummaged through the ashes, there was much talk about equipping buildings and shops with fire safety tools. But the talks died down almost as soon as they had begun. As a result, no steps were taken to prevent such tragedies from taking place in the future. The Burrabazar fire is a case in the point. The shops in Burrabazar were not only in a dilapidated condition but also did not have any fire-fighting equipment. They had been allowed to stand, despite the courts order to demolish these illegal and dangerous buildings. 
     
	There is no doubt that the devastating fire has burnt down the hopes and future of the shopowners in the area. But the flames at least have performed a task that the authorities were loath to carry out. Now that the ramshackle Burrabazar shops have been razed to the ground, one hopes that the new ones that will come up in their place will be safe enough from fires.
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Ravindra Kumar, Calcutta

        
	Sir  It is common knowledge that Calcutta is sitting on a tinder box. Be it Burrabazar or the swanky malls, glitzy theatres or residential complexes that have mushroomed all over the city, no place is safe against a fire. The ground floors of many multi-storied buildings that were meant for parking spaces have been taken over by illegal shops or eateries. In most cases, the promoters, in connivance with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, have bypassed fire safety requirements for the sake of commercial gain. More conflagrations like the one that destroyed Burrabazar are to be expected in the future if the civic authorities continue to shirk their responsibilities. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

Rao                        For a wider safety net				                                             
	No longer is there the chest beating over Indias strong economic fundamentals, 9 per cent annual growth almost forever, soon to match China, the demographic dividend and how that is going to make India among the most powerful nations on earth, the transformation in our attitudes to the world and its challenges, our insulation from shocks because of low export dependence and a growing domestic market, large foreign exchange reserves, and so on. Unlike China, we opened up the financial markets to foreign institutions before strengthening the real economy. We built foreign exchange reserves out of volatile non-resident Indian deposits, foreign institutional investments in equity and external commercial borrowings, not from consistent export surpluses and foreign direct investment.         
	We are at the start of a rapidly spreading, severe economic crisis, with decline in exports and industrial production, growing layoffs, banks unwillingness to lend, the falling rupee, inflationary tendencies and falling expectations. Fortunately, the crisis is mainly in industry and finance, but if not tackled boldly, will soon engulf other sectors.        
	The first response over three months or so was purely monetary: expand liquidity and lower interest rates. These did not help. Now we have the first part of a package that aims to stimulate demand by bringing down prices of manufactured goods, stimulate automotive usage and purchase as well as dampen inflation by reducing petrol and diesel prices, reduce costs of housing loans, and stimulate purchasing power in the economy through investments in infrastructure.               
	Monetary policy initiatives failed because: borrowing by oil companies and others using government bonds as security sucked out liquidity; the Reserve Bank of India sold dollars to bolster the rupee, sucking out more liquidity; interest rate reductions were not accompanied by any stimulus to confidence among lenders to lend. On the other hand, cutting deposit rates could have released some consumer funds from savings into investments or for consumption. We have yet to curb volatile fund inflows by FIIs and illegal Indian holdings overseas that have destabilized our stock markets and liquidity. Similarly, FIIs and foreign banks are free to continue moving money out of India at will. The downward pressure on the rupee continues and hurts exporting companies and others who have raised money abroad.         
	Banks are not lending even to their old customers, let alone new ones, because of the fear of default. This is because the declining prices of most manufactured products, declining demand, higher costs of external borrowings made earlier, layoffs and salary reductions, are deterring banks from lending to old industrial customers as well as to individuals.         
	As the economy slows further and more people get laid off or have their salaries cut, and in the anticipation of even worse things to come, the unwillingness of banks to lend will increase. Borrowings for housing, durable consumer goods, cars and so on have sharply fallen, not because of high interest costs but because both lenders and customers are reluctant to take on fresh commitments. Existing borrowers are expected to increasingly become unable to service their borrowings. Property developers are so short of cash that they are unsuccessfully offering properties at discounted prices, and offering high interest rates but still not getting funds. The production and sale of cars and durable goods have slowed not so much because of prices as because of the difficulty in getting loans and the reluctance to borrow in uncertain times. Price reductions because of lower excise duties will not lead to a flood of purchases.        
	Borrowing from banks and financial institutions even by established large companies has become difficult. The small-scale sector is much worse off. Borrowing at high interest rates  from moneylenders, other companies and after many years, large companies inviting deposits from investors  is now common. The fall in share values means that companies are no longer able to raise fresh funds in the market. Recently, large primary issues have failed or faltered. Until a few months ago, Indian companies were able to raise large funds overseas. That has dried up and, if available, has become more expensive. Private-sector investment has therefore slowed down. The decline in investment expenditures is causing a further downturn in industry.        
	The falling rupee has also made earlier external borrowings much more expensive because company accounts are in rupees, now converted at Rs 50 to the dollar when the original borrowing was at around Rs 40. The accounting rule is to mark to market. Companies have to revalue external borrowings, quarterly and annual accounts. Today it damages results notionally. Yet it pulls down their credit ratings and makes lenders even more wary of them. The government must ask the Institute of Chartered Accountants to suspend this rule for a year. Of course interest payments in the books are in rupees and immediately hurt results.        
	Inflation is still hurting the consumer and remains a risk for the economy. The wholesale price index is falling because of decline in prices of industrial products, raw materials, intermediates and services (steel, cement, sulphur, shipping freight rates). The reduction in petrol and diesel prices gives a respite. It seems unlikely to be enough to reduce lorry freights and hence prices of fruits, vegetables and other farm products. The consumer and especially the poor remain badly off. High prices, job losses, salary cuts, expectations that one or both will hit them soon, make for declining expectations for revival.        
	The prime ministers revival package provides for faster spending and more funds for infrastructure. The fiscal deficit today in reality is as large as it was when reforms began in 1991. But it should not be allowed to hold back public investment for economic revival. The new infrastructure spending package shows that he has decided to take the risk of mounting deficits.         
	But the intent to spend is not enough. It must happen quickly and efficiently. Expenditures on infrastructure and social support programmes are bogged down by bureaucratic delays, corruption and inefficiencies. They prevent creation of assets, incomes and jobs that could stimulate the economy. Efficient ministers and administrators should be in charge of major expenditure programmes like the National Highways Authority of India, National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and others to improve implementation.               
	The most important task must be to get lenders to resume lending. There is nothing in the prime ministers package to ensure this. The government must institute a massive insurance programme to de-risk banks and lending institutions, and protect them against defaults. Lending to organized, small-scale and tiny industries, as well as to individuals for housing, and durables could then resume. Housing, car and consumer loans must be similarly covered by government guarantees. Defaulters must be supported by the government through the lenders till they revive, in, say, a years time. The immediate priority must be the resumption of lending to those who were customers until a few months ago, both industries and individuals, and to new borrowers.         
	Excise duty reduction by 4 per cent might stimulate a little new demand, but not much. State governments might also be advised to sharply reduce registration costs for new properties for a limited period so that real estimate is also stimulated. India must enlarge its foreign exchange assets through borrowing maximum funds from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and bilateral and multilateral institutions, which must be lent to re-enable private capital expenditures.        
	The safety net for those laid off must be immediately widened. The government must guarantee a portion of their last drawn salaries, till they find other jobs. Laid off blue-collar workers must be brought into a food safety net, given free public medical care and waiver of school and college fees for their children.         
	These are unprecedented steps and they go beyond the present monetary, tax-reduction and public investment packages. However, they are essential steps.

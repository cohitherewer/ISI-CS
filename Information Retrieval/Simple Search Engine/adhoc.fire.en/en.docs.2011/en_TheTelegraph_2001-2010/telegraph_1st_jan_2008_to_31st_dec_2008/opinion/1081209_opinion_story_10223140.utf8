	The Bharatiya Janata Party is having poor luck with women. Two allies, both female and hungry for domination, have let go of their alliance with the BJP. Not that they had helped the BJP greatly during their alliances in the South and in the East respectively. But a partner rooted in a region yet to be conquered was certainly better than no partner at all. J. Jayalalithaa has taken the expected turn. Confirming the suspicions of the BJP, aroused by her recent parleys with the Communist Party of India, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has sealed a pre-poll alliance with the Left for the forthcoming Lok Sahba polls. The alliance  the third after 1999 and 2001  has come after much heartburn, not so much in the AIADMK fold as within the Left. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), though much impressed by the puratchi thalaivis objection to the nuclear deal, was hesitant to join hands with someone it still cannot trust in the post-poll scenario, and with whom the ideological differences are far too many. But poll arithmetic showed that by joining hands with Ms Jayalalithaa the CPI(M) bypasses the risk of dividing the Left vote while taking the best chance to get the maximum number of Lok Sabha seats from the region possible under the circumstances.        
	The same logic dictates the choice of the AIADMK leader, who, after hosting what can only be termed a thanksgiving lunch for Narendra Modi earlier, has not looked the saffron way. The BJP is a spent force in Tamil Nadu, thanks to Ms Jayalalithaa herself, who, on both the occasions that the AIADMK allied with the party, saw to it that the BJPs gains never outweighed her own. Since the poll debacle of 2004, the BJP has been unable to find its feet again in Tamil Nadu, although its poll partner in that rout  the AIADMK  has substantially improved its own standing, if only because of the anti-incumbency factor. With the Left, which is tapping into voter sentiment with its pro-Sri Lankan Tamil agitation and anti-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam gambits, Ms Jayalalithaa has more chance of making headway in regional politics (which continues to be top priority) than with the BJP. It is the same confidence about ones own political viability that has made Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal part ways with the BJP. Both women, never chained by ideology, have had no qualms in casting away their excess baggage.

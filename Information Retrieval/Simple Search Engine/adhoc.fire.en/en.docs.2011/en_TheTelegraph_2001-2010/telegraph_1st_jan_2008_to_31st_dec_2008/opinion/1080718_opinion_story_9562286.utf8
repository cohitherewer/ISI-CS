	GOODYBYE SHAHZADI By Shyam Bhatia, Roli, Rs 295        
	This is a quick-job book, a far cry from a political biography of Benazir Bhutto as Shyam Bhatia audaciously claims in the subtitle. At 130-odd pages, the book is not only thin, but also flimsy on originality, drawing generously on Benazirs autobiography, Daughter of the East (1989). It is also based on Bhatias 34-year-old friendship with his subject, going back to the Seventies when they were both at Oxford. For a large part, there is nothing shockingly new about what Bhatia tells us about Benazir. She herself made no bones about her jet-set lifestyle in Oxford; if anything, she wrote candidly about her time with the Bright Young Things, the lavish parties she would throw, the yellow sports car  a gift from her beloved Papa  she loved driving. Bhatia, who claims to have had the good fortune of seeing Benazir in pyjamas and dressing-gown, adds to this list her fondness for white boyfriends and the odd glass of white wine, and her fabled besottedness with two dashing Pakistanis, both of whom, for reasons neither clear nor credible, ditched her proposal for marriage. There were temper tantrums as well, when she threw ashtrays like flying saucers at the servants in her family home in Larkana.        
	Bhatias unabashedly personal, even prurient, interest in his subject is ideal for a kiss-and-tell memoir, not serious life-writing. His analysis is mostly based on sources either unacknowledged or classified or on information revealed in the strictest confidence. In one of the interviews Bhatia did with Benazir, the lady confessed, off the record, that she had been an official Mata Hari ferrying state secrets on nuclear enrichment between North Korea and Pakistan. To turn herself into a female James Bond, she shopped for an overcoat with the deepest possible pockets which made her job infinitely easy  this puts to shame Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible.         
	It is a pity that such potentially amusing moments get lost in Bhatias incoherent ramblings. The editing is remarkably shoddy, with facts repeating themselves in every other chapter, arranged without much rhyme or reason. Bhatia is fascinated by Benazirs chameleon-like quality of transforming herself from a flamboyant Oxford graduate into a kleptocrat in a Hermes headscarf, as Jemima Khan called her. He points out, with good sense, an abiding ambivalence in her foreign policies, which were forced on her by the formidable Troika of the army chief, president and the ISI. She was sensible enough to stop Kargil in 1988, but raised a storm by crying out Azadi, azadi when she visited troops in Kashmir. When the Soviet occupied Afghanistan, she had no qualms about financing the Taliban, only to eventually fall prey to the beast she had nurtured in the backyard. Bhatia sneers at her marriage to Asif Ali Zardari, the appositely nicknamed Mr Ten Per Cent, but for all the wrong reasons  because she consented to an arranged marriage with a man who was her intellectual and social inferior. He even adds, rather ruefully, who went on to father their three children  as if it is out of form to have children with ones wedded husband.        
	Bhatia recycles some well-worn conspiracy theories, most memorably the one claiming Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as half-brother to Jawaharlal Nehru, the common factor between them being Lakhibai (ne Lady Khurshid) who married Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto after having a reckless affair with Motilal Nehru. Bhatias precise account of the changing US attitude to Benazir (from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush), and the role of her lifelong friend, Peter Galbraith, in the process, deserves mention. But such passages of clear thinking and writing are few and far between.

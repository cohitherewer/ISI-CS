	Two faces of terror                  
	Sir  Mukul Kesavans No small difference (Nov 20) has exposed the hypocrisy of the saffron brigade. The real purpose behind Bharatiya Janata Partys vehement support for Pragya Singh Thakur and Shrikant Purohit  the alleged conspirators of the Malegaon blasts  is to project them as innocent Hindus being wrongly accused to mislead the people. Incidentally, the BJP had condemned the Jamia Millia Islamia university for offering legal aid to its two students who had been arrested on charges of being involved in the Delhi blasts. Now the same party is trying to protect Thakur and Purohit who have been arrested on almost similar charges. In the name of defending Hindus, the sangh parivar and the BJP are justifying the violence perpetrated by their supporters who are no less militant than jihadis. These self-proclaimed defenders of Hinduism have tarnished the religions time-tested tradition of tolerance and respect for other religions through their violent acts in Orissa and Gujarat. Worse, they have also attempted to bring the various administrative agencies under their control. Now it is being suspected that an armyman is also involved in the mischief. Sadly, the BJP and its allies have managed to contaminate even the armed forces, one of the few remaining apolitical institutions in this land.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Joy Besra, Berhampore, Murshidabad

                
	Sir  It seems that Mukul Kesavan is driven by the same divisive ideals that inspire the BJP and the sangh parivar. The only difference is that while these outfits spew venom at Islamists, Kesavan is critical of Hindutvabadis. Both are therefore following a dangerous argument that threatens the integrity of the nation. Kesavan refers to the BJPs denunciation of Jamia Millias support for its two Muslim students detained on charges of terrorism. He also questions the partys patronizing of the prime suspects in the Malegaon blasts. Kesavan finds fault with the BJP because it supports alleged Hindu terrorists and, at the same time, demands stringent punishment for Muslim insurgents. Such a bias is indeed unacceptable, but Kesavan should have attacked the BJP for rallying around alleged Hindu terrorists instead of pointing at the partys hypocrisy. Also, nowhere in his article does Kesavan mention that the country is suffering equally at the hands of Muslim militants who are having a free-run at the moment.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Srimanta K. Chatterjee, California, US

                
	Sir The manner in which the BJP and its allies are justifying the violence perpetrated by Hindus in the name of combating Islamic extremism is despicable. But Mukul Kesavan should not have been dismissive of the argument that since the administration has failed to protect the majority community, its members are now taking the law in their own hands. In India, the administration has failed miserably to contain both terrorism and communalism. Indians have already lost faith in the police, which have failed to protect minorities in Orissa and Gujarat. The allegations against the sadhvi and Shrikant Purohit in the Malegaon blasts now show that even the military is not free of corruption. Is it then a surprise that in a country blessed with a defunct administration, the people have to protect themselves?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Srinivasan, Calcutta

                
	Not for everyone          
	Sir  Portraying a rosy picture of Assam must have required some effort on the part of Suhel Seth (Temple of wisdom, Nov 20).The state is now known for blasts and terror attacks and the situation is getting worse by the day. The regional parties spend their time in petty squabbles instead of working towards development. Assam has a lot to offer apart from its miseries: it has the mighty Brahmaputra, the beautiful Kaziranga and Majuli (the largest river island of the world) and Asias oldest oil well at Digboi. But in his messianic attempt to redeem Assams glory and charm, Seth has forgotten to mention the states natural and cultural riches. Instead, he showers praise on Assam Valley School. The institution is undoubtedly one of the best in the business, but only privileged children can afford to study there. There are other institutions in Assam, some more than a century old, where students from middle-class families are being taught the basic values of life sans frills such as a 260-acre campus, seven football fields and an equestrian park. Perhaps they deserve a mention as well.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Debajit Baruah, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Suhel Seths column reads more like a publicity material on behalf of Assam Valley School. He laments the fact that the cultural and traditional heritage of Assam have largely gone unsung, and chooses to gush about AVS. Football and equestrian lessons as well as quality education can surely turn students into men and women of integrity and compassion. However, the school is meant for the rich only. Thus, even if Seths words are taken to be true, there will only be a privileged few who will be endowed with integrity and compassion that are required to take the nation forward. Seths fluent language cannot hide the fact that this world of lofty principles is meant only for the elite to savour.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Krishnabhushan Pattri, Guwahati

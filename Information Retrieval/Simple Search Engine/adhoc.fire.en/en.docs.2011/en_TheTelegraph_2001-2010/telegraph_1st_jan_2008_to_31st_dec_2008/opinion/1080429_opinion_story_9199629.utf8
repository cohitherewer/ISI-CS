	While there can be a law that condemns obscenity in public, it cannot define, for all times, what the obscene consists of. The ministry of women and child development came away with this lesson when it proposed changes to the Indecent Representation of Women Act, 1986. The ministry feels that it is time that this law, given the new freedoms promised by mobile phones and computers, is extended to include the depiction of women in cyberspace and advanced electronic gadgets. But the Union cabinet has been more guarded in its response. The cabinet recognizes that amending the law according to the ministrys suggestions might lead to violations of personal liberty. But more important, it is not a good idea to uphold a fuddy-duddy perception of what is obscene, particularly in this age of the public display of affection. The contention that a certain form of behaviour is obscene might be overruled as prudish anxiety, as not in tune with the times, even by a court of law. This was exactly what the Supreme Court did when it suspended the arrest warrant against Richard Gere for kissing Shilpa Shetty at an AIDS awareness rally last year.         
	In civil society, certain actions are considered, by consensus, to be obscene, and therefore subject to the jurisdiction of law. But the definition of what is obscene is not timeless, and must carefully adapt to the cultural, technological and economic changes that affect the moral structures of a society. In a democracy, the legislature is expected to engage with these changes positively and allow them to be reflected in the workings of the judiciary. In 1960, D.H. Lawrences Lady Chatterleys Lover was framed for obscenity under the Obscene Publications Act of 1959,which was supposed to weed out works that tended to deprave and corrupt the minds of the people. Between 1928 (when the novel was written) and the trial, notions of obscenity changed dramatically. Leading intellectuals, including churchmen, gave overwhelming evidence to turn the judgment in favour of the book. A law of this kind can only be effective procedurally, when it is implemented in a court of law. The principles enshrined in the law have to be interpreted by the courts. The boundaries of decorum cannot be set with any certitude. Decorum can only be gestured towards, but not codified forever. Once questioned, it might turn to smoke.

	Uttiya Majumdars exhibition of digital art prints, Grunge Matter (Gaganendranath Pradarshashala, June 28-30), looked experimental in Calcutta. But digital art is as old as any other form of cyber-culture, with its roots in horror, fantasy and the Gothic. There is a whole subculture in the virtual world, truly global now, in which the boundaries between art, literature, music and cinema blur, producing a visual universe with its own mystical-psychological symbolism. Grunge Matter draws upon this image-repertoire, and then transforms it digitally into the stuff of an individual imagination. This is formed by a mix of the grotesque, the macabre, the supernatural, the erotic and the abstract. Majumdars compositions move between the exploration of texture and colour, to the arrangement of figures and patterns.         
	Every cult has its symbology, which could become a trap for its individual practitioners. Majumdar will have to be careful about the clichs that hover close to the materials and processes he works with. Making this shared world an expression of his distinctive inner life as an artist and human being is the challenge. Also, it might be worth reflecting on the relationships among his images to see what sort of stories and sequences emerge.

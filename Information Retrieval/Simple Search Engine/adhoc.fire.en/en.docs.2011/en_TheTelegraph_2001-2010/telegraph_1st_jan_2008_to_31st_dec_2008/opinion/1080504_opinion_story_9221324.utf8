The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | a traditional shame
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A TRADITIONAL SHAME                                                          
	In a country where people have been quietly killing girls, born and unborn, for years, a prime ministers condemnation of female foeticide may not be of more than symbolic value. That he should speak of this at all, while positioning himself as the proud father of three daughters, is a marker of the scale of the problem. As for effect, that remains to be seen. The prime minister spoke of the need to strengthen legislative enforcement, basic healthcare and nutrition and to re-orient national literacy and school education to give greater focus to women and girls. All of this sounds substantial and meaningful. Not that the government is not trying. There are schemes and incentives to encourage people to allow a baby girl to be born, and to let her grow.        
	Yet it is the richer states  with less need of schemes and incentives  that have the worst sex ratios. Obviously, the governments admonitions, legislations, and programmes are missing something. The law against sex-selective abortion is predictably caught in the toils of doctor-patient privilege. A country, which is suspected to have 2,000 female foetuses destroyed every day, has managed to convict or penalize only 20 doctors and institutions so far. This is one of those issues in which administrative vigilance and intervention can only go that far. When a private choice contributes to a public disaster what is the role of the government? Better nutrition, better education, a government investment of Rs 500 every time a girl is born might all help Indian women in the long run. But she has to be born first. How is the government to counter traditional systems weighted against the girl in spite of an arsenal of laws? Dowry, property disposal, carrying on the family name, the idea of investment and return, all put the girl at a cruel disadvantage. Why spend on a girls education and health when she will take it all away to benefit others?        
	The bias against the girl is both economic and cultural, each feeding the other. The government has been trying to include religious leaders to spread awareness about the evils of female foeticide. Sikh religious heads have declared that anyone known to have committed female foeticide would be excommunicated. But such knowledge would be rare to come by. Besides, most religions are strongly biased towards a patriarchal value-system. Whether it is a good idea to involve imams in Jammu and Kashmir in the campaign against female foeticide, as the government plans to do, remains to be seen. In much of Hinduism, for example, women are of secondary or no importance. Can religious leaders be asked to campaign against the killing of girls? The actual fight must ultimately come from the women themselves, and the rare men who support them. And for that future fight girls will need the better nutrition and better education that the prime minister is talking about.

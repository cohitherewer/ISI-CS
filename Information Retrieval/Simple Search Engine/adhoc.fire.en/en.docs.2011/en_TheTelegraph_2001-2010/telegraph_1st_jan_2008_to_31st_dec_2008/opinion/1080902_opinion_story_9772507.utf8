                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             SAFETY FOR ALL                                                    
	Everyday life is full of things taken for granted that are worth thinking through clearheadedly. Why, for instance, should two coaches be reserved for women on trains of the Metro Railway between 9 am and 7 pm every day? What is the logic behind this, and what are the holes in that logic? If the basis of this measure is chivalry towards the weaker sex, then it is time for public spaces to be rid of such useless and unthinking paternalism. With facilities like public transport, it is the duty of the State to protect men and women alike from physical danger, and questions of safety or security have nothing to do with the protection of female modesty. It is equally important to bear in mind that certain other public facilities  like police stations, public toilets or local trains  are accessed by women in radically different circumstances. So these spaces need to be sensitized, secured or equipped, in specific and practical ways, for the use of women. Reserving coaches or seats for women in the Metro could only lead to such uncivil conduct as elderly men rudely, yet legitimately, being denied seating by perfectly able-bodied women simply because the former happen to be the wrong sex.        
	Rather than waste time and resources with such cosmetic measures, Metro Railway should think hard about, and act fast on, introducing proper facilities for the elderly and the disabled on its trains and stations. Given the ancient trains, leaking stations and rattling escalators, commuters also need to be reassured on basic questions of safety. How up-to-date and well-rehearsed are the fire-safety and medical-emergency arrangements? Why are there no toilets and wheel-chair access in any of the stations? Why do staff at the exact-fare counters agree to serve people who come unprepared with the exact fare? Why is it impossible to hear any of the public announcements clearly? No other Metro in the world worries about protecting the ladies at the expense of rudimentary maintenance and safety.

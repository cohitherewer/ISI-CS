                                                                                                            Letters to Editor
                
	Unknown citizen                  
	Sir  In Tale of the three As, (Feb 1), Ashok Mitra cites the arrest and torture of Aftab Alam Ansari as an example of arbitrariness on the part of the police and security forces. In a democratic, ostensibly civilized society like ours, a human rights lawyer with both conscience and guts could take Ansaris case to court to get justice for him, and our country allows for such a possibility. But such provisions are unthinkable in a country like China. China conducts State-sponsored summary trials and executions by the thousands every year, more than any other country. No one has the guts there to defend the hapless victims of untold atrocities that are clearly cases of human rights violation. Such horrid acts by a socialist state are ignored by Mitra, a veteran Marxist, while a 24-hour interrogation in Boston of a person of south-Asian origin has been condemned by him simply because it happened in the United States of America. This is no more than an example of rabid anti-Americanism.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra rightly points to the threat that people in uniform often pose to civil society. They seldom deliver the services for which they are paid at taxpayers cost, and consider themselves to be above the law. Political powers patronize and pamper these licensed ruffians. While our leaders worry a lot about the growing incidence of fragging, no action is taken against the administrators who perpetuate acts of violence on fellow countrymen. Some of these instances are not just shameful but also ridiculous. Take the case of Amrita Saran, the army majors wife who, in 2006, had ordered some jawans to go on a rampage at a weaving centre in Tezpur after being told that the scarf she had ordered was not ready (Major wife in ransack row, March 4, 2006).           
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

                
	Sir  The arrest of innocent men and the persecution of members of a particular religious community in the name of combating terror are indeed unfortunate. However, it cannot be denied that the administration is invariably led to certain common factors and denominators while following the trail of terror. The system to combat terrorism is still in its nascent form in India, as it is in many other parts of the world. In due course, hopefully, such errors will be minimized. The fact that Aftab Ansari has lived to tell the tale should itself be seen as a sign of hope.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Jayanta Ray, Calcutta 

                
	Hardly an honour          
	Sir  The Bharat Ratna sparked off a political controversy when L.K. Advani, in a bid to repay his indebtedness to Atal Bihari Vajpayee for having recommended the prime ministerial candidature for him, proposed the latters name for the highest civilian award. Similar submissions came in from other party leaders for their personal favourites, thus undermining the true value of the honour. Failing to sort out the imbroglio, the selection committee has shelved the award nominations this year. The Padma awards too faced a lot of controversy when it was found out that nominations were being decided not by a panel elected for the purpose but by people with clout. It is embarrassing that the political class is being allowed to cast a shadow over the most important recognition of public service in the nation. A panel of judges comprising eminent personalities from diverse fields must be instituted forthwith.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Sir  The Padma awards should be conferred only on those who have contributed to the improvement of society. It was surprising to see businessmen like N.R. Narayana Murthy being nominated for the civilian honour. Businessmen should be considered for such awards only after they promise to pledge a portion of their annual profits towards social welfare. At best, they should be considered for business chamber awards and not national honours.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Sanjay Kuruba, Bangalore

                
	Sir  After the announcement of the nominees for the countrys civilian awards, it seems there is not a single person deserving of Indias highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna. The selection committee for the awards must be congratulated for not succumbing to political pressure and giving the award to one of the various political figures whose names were recommended by their powerful supporters. Nevertheless, it is still amazing that in a country of a billion people, there is not one who merits the Ratna.           
	Then again, there is the case of Sachin Tendulkar having been awarded the Padma Vibhushan only years after he was given the Padma Shri. There is no doubt that the nation is passionate about cricket, and Tendulkars contribution to the sport is undeniable, but cricket is not our national sport. Besides, has Tendulkar in any way improved Indias image in the world of sports? I am not against the honouring of Tendulkar, but why then was a cricketer like Sunil Gavaskar omitted from consideration for the award?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  No politician is worthy of being conferred an honorary award for having served the nation because none of them does so with competence. Besides, most of them are involved in political conflicts and conspiracies against each other. The Bharat Ratna must be awarded to those who have ensured economic prosperity for the country and have earned for it a reputation across the world, generating employment and revenue in the process. In this respect, industrialists such as N.R. Narayana Murthy, the Ambani brothers, Ratan Tata and others are far more deserving of the award than cricketers or politicians.          
	Yours faithfully,      
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

                
	Sir  India has always been second to none in politicizing an issue that catches its fancy. The Bharat Ratna is one of the most prestigious honours conferred on a person for his outstanding contribution to a particular field of expertise that brings India international acclaim. It is unbelievable that there are senior politicians in this country who do not think that by recommending nominees they are grossly overreaching their authority. Perhaps this is only natural in a country where the nexus between politics and corruption is so strong. The only hope is that the selection committee seems to be unmoved by political pressure.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Susanta K. Biswas, Calcutta

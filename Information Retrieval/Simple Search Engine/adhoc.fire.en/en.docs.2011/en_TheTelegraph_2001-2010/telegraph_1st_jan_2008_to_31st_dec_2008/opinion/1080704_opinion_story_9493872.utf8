	Sunny days                  
	Sir  The editorial, Twas a famous victory (June 22), was well-timed to coincide with the silver jubilee of Indias historic win against the formidable West Indies in the 1983 World Cup final. Kapils Devils beat a Caribbean side that included players such as Vivian Richards, Gordon Greenidge, Clive Lloyd, Desmond Haynes, Malcolm Marshall and many others. After Indias innings had ended, no one could imagine that Kapil and his boys would be able to defend their paltry score of 183 runs. However, the Indians managed to do just that, showing yet again that cricket was a game of glorious uncertainties.           
	Cricket may be the most popular sport in India today. Yet, 25 years ago, things were very different as far as the game was concerned. The frenzy surrounding the modern game was certainly absent. The players too were not pampered with cash and awards as they are now. These have ended up altering Indian crickets contours and character. Big money and sponsorship have robbed cricket of its beauty and sporting spirit. Professionalism has been replaced by crass commercialism. So much so that even the great icon, Kapil Dev, fell out of favour with the Board of Control for Cricket in India for his association with a T20 cricket league that was started by the boards rivals. At one time, it appeared doubtful whether the BCCI would invite Kapil Dev to the reception that it hosted for the World Cup winning team in Delhi. However, good sense prevailed, and Kapil featured prominently in that function.          
	The strained ties between the board and Kapil do not augur well for the future of Indian cricket. Instead of demeaning Kapil, the BCCI should work towards carrying forward his legacy. This, however, can only be possible if the board frees itself of parochialism and concentrates on finding new talent who would serve Indian cricket well in the future.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Indias victory over the West Indies in the 1983 World Cup final cannot be compared to any other triumph that India has had on the cricket field. It is a pity that the heroes of that Indian side received far less attention from the board and the media than even the players who won the recent tri-series tournament in Australia. Modern Indian cricketers also earn far more in terms of money and perquisites than those who won the World Cup for us. While the BCCI should be complimented for the reception that it hosted for Kapils team, it would have been a good idea for the board to ask the members of the present team to attend the ceremony as well. Who knows, it might have inspired M.S. Dhoni and his boys to emulate the feat achieved by their predecessors in England over two decades back.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Pranab Hazra, Asansol 

      
	Sir  The silver jubilee celebration of Indias World Cup win is nothing but a waste of money. It is shocking to see such extravagance at a time when the economy is reeling under inflation. Former cricketers earn enough thanks to television and coaching assignments, yet they seldom shy away from making a quick buck. The BCCI also seems to be eager to dole out money to them. The boards office bearers should resign over such wasteful expenditure.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Sunil Gavaskar said recently that Kapil Devs knock of 175 against Zimbabwe in the 1983 World Cup was the best one-day innings played ever. Many of us will agree with Gavaskar. India has produced only one Kapil Dev so far and every Indian should be proud of what this great player has achieved. The board needs to forget its differences with Kapil over the ICL issue. In fact, steps should be taken to merge the two rival T20 leagues. After all, there are young players of merit in the ICL too and their future should not be compromised by the war between the board and its competitor. While Kapils contributions can never be denied, we should also remember that Gavaskar continues to work to better Indian and Asian cricket. He was also the force behind the silver jubilee celebrations of Indias World Cup triumph. As a technical adviser, a commentator, and a well wisher of Indian cricket, he holds a special place in every fans heart.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Cricket, especially the shorter versions of the game, is a matter of pure chance. Indias win against the mighty West Indies in 1983 is certainly creditable, but it must be accepted that Clive Lloyds team was a far better side, which happened to have a bad day at work.           
	But that is history now. It is no use patting ourselves on the back for the win 25 years ago. Indian cricket has to move on. The old war horses did a splendid job, but havent we had enough television shows and newspaper reports celebrating the victory? Have we ever celebrated any other sporting triumph in this manner, the Olympic wins in hockey, for instance? The media should remember that they cannot fool the discerning sports lover, no matter how hard they try to take our minds back to a golden summer at Lords.          
	Yours faithfully,

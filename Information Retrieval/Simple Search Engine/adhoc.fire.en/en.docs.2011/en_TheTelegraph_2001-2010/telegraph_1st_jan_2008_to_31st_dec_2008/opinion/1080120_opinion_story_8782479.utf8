	Disturbing images
         
	Sir  Nowadays, we get to read of murders and violent deaths, whether in terrorist attacks, bomb blasts or riots, almost every day in the newspapers. The reports are distressing enough. They become even more disturbing when photographs of bloodied, mangled bodies are published along with the news. Since children also go through newspapers, these pictures must be leaving a nasty impression on their tender minds. Newspapers and magazines should think twice before printing such pictures.
     
	Yours faithfully,
    Atanu Tarafdar, Jalpaiguri

    
	At the top
     
	Sir  The names of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay will forever be associated with Mount Everest (End of an Everest era, Jan 12). By conquering the worlds highest peak at a time when there was none of the sophisticated equipment so easily available to mountaineers today, the duo proved the power of the human will to surmount all odds. Expeditions to the Everest today are more common than to other inaccessible regions of the globe largely because of the way the mountain captured the public imagination after Hillary and Tenzing made it to its top in 1953. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  With the death of Edmund Hillary in New Zealand at the age of 88, India has lost a true friend. His friendship with Tenzing Norgay brought him close to the people of Nepal and India. He had been New Zealands high commissioner to India, Nepal and Bangladesh, and had lived for almost five years in New Delhi. He spent much of his time helping the Sherpas through his Himalayan Trust. It was mainly because of his efforts that schools and hospitals came to be built in the remote reaches of the Himalayas. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I was 15 years old when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay ascended the Everest in May, 1953. This coincided with the coronation of Queen Elizabeth. I still remember photographs of the new Queen conferring knighthood on Hillary, and those of Tenzing on the worlds highest peak. As a young man with an avid interest in mountaineering, those pictures thrilled me. They seemed to tell me that nothing is impossible. Fifty-five years later, on Hillarys death, I feel as if I have lost a friend. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Death in the woods
     
	Sir  The death of yet another elephant on the railway tracks inside the Buxa Tiger Reserve is proof enough that the state forest department is unable to carry out its duty of safeguarding wildlife (Elephant death on tracks again, Jan 16). Despite repeated such deaths, no long-term solution to the problem has been found. 
     
	The real culprit in these cases are, however, the railway authorities. Trains hurtle down the sanctuaries of north Bengal at over 70 kms per hour. Drivers are hardly concerned about wildlife. A.K. Jha, the divisional railway manager of Alipurduar, said that as the area in which the elephant died did not fall within the four specified elephant corridors, it was natural for the train to run at a high speed. It was a callous comment. How are elephants to know the area consecrated to them by human beings? 
     
	The report points out that this was the tenth elephant to die on the tracks in north Bengal after the conversion of the metre gauge to broad in 2004. In my estimate, however, more than 15 elephants have fallen victim so far in the Alipurduar junction-Siliguri section. If the train drivers and railway authorities are not brought to book soon, north Bengal may soon be devoid of wildlife.
     
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Deep, resonant notes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             DEEP, RESONANT NOTES                                  THIS ABOVE ALL -   KHUSHWANT SINGH                                              
	The last time I was in Bangalore (more than 10 years ago), I decided to visit all the historic places of worship I had not seen before. On these visits my companion was Nirmala Mathan, whom I had befriended during my long stay in Bombay. She was, and is, a lovable peron with a rich voice. At my request, she recorded my translations of Sikh hymns for Polydor. The album, entitled Sikhism through the Songs of the Gurus, was released on the 30th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh. It was well received by the community. I was much beholden to Nirmala.        
	After we had done our round, she said: Now that youve done all the Hindu temples and mosques, you might as well do St Marks Cathedral. It is the oldest church in Bangalore. So the next Sunday morning, I accompanied the Mathans to the morning service. The Mathans are devout Christians and the entire family is into singing. The experience still haunts me.         
	St Marks was built soon after the British defeated Tipu Sultan at Srirangapatnam in 1799. Previously, there had only been a small chapel deep in the woods infested by monkeys  the locals called it the metropolis of monkeys. When Bangalore became the regimental headquarters of the British army and the cantonment was built, it was decided that a large church should be constructed for the troops. So in 1808, St Marks Cathedral came up on what is now Mahatma Gandhi Road. Next month, the cathedral will celebrate its 200th anniversary with special thanksgiving services.        
	St Marks looks like a smaller version of St Pauls Cathedral in London. If St Pauls now sticks out incongruously in the midst of Londons heavy traffic, St Marks is an island of greenery with the jacarandas and the frangipani, and as such, well integrated with its surroundings. Its altar and pews are made of ancient teak and rosewood, and its pulpit and baptismal front are made of Italian marble. The pride of the church is its pipe organ, gifted by the Cowdrey family in 1928. It fills the cathedral with deep, resonant notes when hymns are sung.        
	I sat dutifully through the service. Nirmala kept turning the pages of my hymn book to help me follow the words. I did not even try to sing because my voice is like that of a horse.        
	After the service was over, we stood in the lawns, where tea was being served. The vicar, Reverend Vincent Rajkumar, joined us. He was anxious to know who I was and what had brought a Sikh to a church service. I replied as best I could: I go to every place of worship so that I can learn something about the worshippers faiths.                
	To care and share                
	British newspapers and magazines do not carry matrimonials. Instead, they have tabloids appearing on Sundays where eligible men and women offer themselves as life-partners, giving personal details about their age, height, hobbies and suchlike. Among Englands magazines, the fortnightly Private Eye is unique in having a column oddly entitled Eye to Eye, which caters to those looking for company of the opposite sex. To call it a matrimonial column would be a misnomer  Liasons would be a more apt title. Some items appear regularly  for example, Meet oriental ladies in London, or Meet air hostesses who are off duty and want to have a good time and so on. At times real intentions are spelt out with refreshing candour  Wanted a sperm donor, announced one. In the last issue of the journal, which a kindly English gentleman airmails to me, I came across two amusing items. One reads: Seduce a sophisticated woman, Me, North-East Yorkshire, can relocate. You: 50s-60s, tall and passionate.        
	The second item is equally seductive. It reads: Venus lascivious widow ready to enjoy meaningful, exciting, pampering life again. Attractive blonde, late 50s. Military and caring professional background W.L.T.M. Sincere, kind, compassionate gentleman 60+, to care and share whatever interests. Letter, photo [will] ensure immediate response. Will reciprocate. 10 miles from London.                            Love that failed        
	Never after                
	Indian communists are on the grill,        
	Though vanquished, they are         
	arguing still.        
	They have sunk the deepest in        
	hypocrisy,        
	And their kushti with the Congress         
	Is a mockery of democracy.        
	They do not want the FDI in India at        
	all,        
	But they go abroad to beg for it for         
	West Bengal.        
	Anti-poor, anti-people, the Congress         
	they call,        
	But will not pull the rug and allow        
	their government to fall.         
	The Congress, too has gauged their        
	might,        
	They may bark but they will not bite.        
	All this drama is because of election        
	woes          
	How can they be friends at the         
	Centre and         
	In the states be foes?        
	Now on the Indo-US nuclear pact,         
	They can walk neither right nor left.        
	Then, the BJP sent them a         
	proposition         
	Why not fight the UPA as united         
	opposition?         
	When the bridge comes we shall        
	cross it.        
	But what if the bridge collapses        
	when they are on it?        
	And now, The marriage with UPA        
	will continue,         
	But without love, of course.        
	At a time suitable to us we shall file a        
	case for divorce.        
	But be sure that we shall now be, Sleeping in different rooms in the        
	same house.

                                                                                                                 DANGEROUSLY PREDICTABLE                                  The budget will set directions for social spending, but its loan waivers will damage the stability of the banking system, writes S.L. Rao                                            
	In this budget, the finance minister has tried to reconcile four considerations  politics, controlling inflationary tendencies, accelerating economic growth, and getting more for less expenditure by improving efficiencies. Sadly, he has been unable to reconcile the contradictions among these four considerations. He has prepared a sound political budget. This budget will spend so much that it will help stimulate growth. But he has done little to restrain inflationary tendencies.        
	He has responded to the charge last year that his deficit reduction was fudged since it did not account for the bonds issued to oil companies, the Food Corporation of India and the fertilizer industry, by acknowledging that the deficit figures would be higher if they were included. This year these bonds would come to about 2 per cent of the gross domestic product. So the claimed deficits, on revenue of 1.4 per cent and the fiscal of 3.1 per cent, are misleading and the expenditures proposed would add significantly to the inflationary pressures.         
	India has seen considerable buoyancy in tax revenues. To GDP they were 9.2 per cent in 2003-04 and 12.5 per cent in 2007-08, due principally to superior information. It also reflects better compliance because of lower tax rates and general economic buoyancy.              
	The budget emphasizes the inflationary pressures because of rising world prices of crude oil, iron ore, copper, tin, wheat and rice, the difficulties of managing their supplies, and the short-term management of capital inflows for which Indias absorptive capacity is poor. Chidambaram stated that temporary measures would be needed to manage inflows. The budget speech is thus an implicit warning that liquidity and stop-go actions on foreign capital inflows can be expected. Interest rates will not be reduced and stock markets, so dependent on foreign funds, will see considerable volatility. This will hurt new initial public offerings and the ability of companies to raise fresh capital. High interest costs will erode corporate profits even further than they are doing now.        
	The electoral politics of the budget are clear. The deadline of June 30 for completing the unprecedented write-off of Rs 60,000 crore of bank loans to four crore farmers (amounting to 4 per cent of all bank lending) is a strong indication that Parliament will be dissolved after the budget session.        
	The other indicator of elections being near is the targeting of substantial supports for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and minority communities (indicated by the acceptance of the Sachar report). These groups need help. However, governments did little for them in past years but is now pouring money on them, obviously hoping to win their votes. Social programmes introduced in recent years receive much attention. The Bharat Nirman Programme, Sarva Shikhsha Abhiyan, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme, special programmes for girls, mid-day meal schemes, focus on minority employment in defence, all point to money being poured in before forthcoming elections to attract votes.        
	Such social programmes for the poor, women, SCs, STs, minorities and farmers are long overdue. They have added a new concern in Indian politics for the poor and the disadvantaged. Even if poorly administered, there is growing opportunity for them to climb in society. However, by the time this budget is passed and money disbursed to the lowest levels in the departments concerned, there will be little time for these programmes to be actually effective. The only one that might happen in time will be the debt write-off to farmers because this is to be administered by banks. It is unlikely that they will have any effect in swinging an election.        
	Industrial growth has decelerated. The budget tries to help accelerate manufacturing growth by reducing Cenvat by 2 per cent, cutting excise duties for pharmaceuticals, two- and three-wheelers, small cars, materials for housing and other such items. These could help stimulate most of them.         
	The concessions for the power sector and especially for transmission and distribution, roads, urban infrastructure and housing for the poor will, along with the excise duty reductions, certainly help to stimulate demand for most of them. Industry must also be pleased that there is no lowering of the peak rate of customs duty and so no increased price competition by imported goods. Industry did expect some adjustment if not abolition of the tax surcharge and some softening of the fringe benefit tax. Neither has happened.         
	However, the removal of duplicate taxation on dividend distribution by subsidiary companies is a welcome move. Companies are now leveraging lower equity with a lot more debt by setting up subsidiaries over which they can retain control. This will help them start new businesses with less equity. The extension of 125 per cent weighted deduction to outsourced research by companies will also expand research farmed out to other laboratories and is in the long-term interest of industry.        
	The most welcome feature of the budget is its attention to higher education and skills development. This is essential if the growing working population in India is not to become a demographic disaster instead of a demographic dividend.               
	The write-off of Rs 60,000 crore of farmer loans is a response to the spate of farmer suicides and to the need for farmer votes. There is no specific commitment to fully reimburse banks. Most are quoted in the stock exchange and have other shareholders than the government. It also raises a serious moral hazard in penalizing farmers who repaid loans on time and rewarding those who did not. It will tempt farmers and other large borrower groups to hope for similar forgiveness in future. It could wreck the stability of nationalized banks that have only recently been strengthened after the disaster of the loan melas in the Indira Gandhi years        
	The pay commission will report by end-March, 2008 and add substantially to Central and state expenditures, upsetting budgetary calculations. The finance minister talked last year of monitoring outcomes rather than merely outlays. He is now setting up a monitoring mechanism and independent evaluation for 1,000 plan schemes. This will not, of course, apply to government employees for whom no performance orientation was accepted in the last pay commission report, nor will be in the present one.         
	This budget is along expected lines. It will set directions for social spending (especially on education) in the future, as well as for agriculture and infrastructure. It damages the stability of the banking system by loan write-offs and waivers, and does nothing to improve government efficiencies in delivering services. It has dangerous inflationary potential but could stimulate more growth in the short term.

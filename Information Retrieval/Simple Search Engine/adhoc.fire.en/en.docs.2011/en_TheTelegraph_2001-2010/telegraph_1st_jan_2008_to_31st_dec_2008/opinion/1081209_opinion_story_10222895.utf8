	Taking sides                  
	Sir  Reading Ashok Mitras Thoughts of the day after (Dec 5), one could not be blamed for thinking that the author would rather defend Muslim terrorism than condemn those who are spreading terror in India. If, as Mitra confidently says, the specific sites [the terrorists] chose make their targets of wrath obvious: the Western countries and Israel, then why India? The answer is provided in terms of the United States of Americas war in Iraq and Afghanistan, which antagonized the Muslims. Why Muslims? Logically, only the Iraqis and Afghans should fight against the US, not the Muslims of the world. Mitra also believes that Indias nuclear treaty with the US has angered the Muslims. Then how is it that the mythical Muslim world has not stopped trading and transacting with the US? Mitra has no reason whatsoever for saying that those professing other religions are to be allowed to reside in this land, but their right of residence is subject to one overriding condition, they must play second fiddle to the Hindus. How then do we have Muslims in prominent places in India  a phenomenon not encountered in any Islamic country vis--vis its minority communities? And finally, if the Kashmir issue has angered the Muslims, shouldnt the states part-occupation by Pakistan anger Hindus too?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Like Ashok Mitra, I too believe that giving vent to anger is not the answer to the problems India faces today. This is not the time to lose our cool and think in terms of retaliation, as hinted at by many of our politicians and celebrities. What is needed is a great deal of introspection, leading to attempts to change the country from within. We have to believe in the sanctity of life and respect difference. Problems can be solved only through dialogue and a willingness to listen to others. I feel that the undue emphasis on consumerism lie at the root of Indias present troubles. Very little effort is being made to cultivate the mind. Gone are the maxims of simple living and high thinking.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Where democracy is a word without meaning, where the military kicks and tramples upon the elected government time and again, where the puppet government rules at the order of the army  that land is called Pakistan, a safe haven for terrorists operating around the world. But in India, these soulless, beastly men have a supporter and sympathizer in the form of Ashok Mitra, who can unabashedly write, Perfidious India deserved to be taught a lesson.           
	Since its birth, Pakistan has been against India, sometimes trying to capture its land, declaring war at other times, or plotting and executing terrorist attack with the States military support. Perhaps aspiring terrorists should contact Mitra before chalking out their future plans.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sushamoy Roy Choudhury, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  There is no doubt that Ashok Mitra is quite aware of the consequences if a large number of Indians decide to give vent to anger. The policy of war-nationalism may help sell poll-nationalism, but it is the people who have to pay. So, strengthen and enlarge our security system with a sophisticated, globalized approach. The anger felt by the citizens should be channelized to consolidate our internal protection systems.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra assumes the role of the typical Indian nonconformist to the hilt. He and his ilk try all the time to justify acts of Islamic terrorism in India citing Indias supposed action or the lack of it whether in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran or Palestine. It is common knowledge that the root of Islamic or Arab discontent has primarily been against the Christian West, but I wonder if Mitras theory will help India avert future terror attacks.           
	Yours faithfully,

	No takers for noble intent          
	Sir  I had to spend the night of Saturday, December 6, at the Jadavpur police station. The charge brought against me was of being drunk and creating trouble on the streets of Jadavpur Station Road, near the 9B bus-stand.           
	I admit that I had had a couple of drinks that night. But the incident which was presented as the proof of my drunken behaviour, was actually me noticing a person at midnight taking pictures of the streets and shops around the area near the Jadavpur railway station. Keeping in mind the recent activities around the country, I went and asked the photographer about the pictures he was taking. In the meantime, a police patrol car came from nowhere and unceremoniously whisked me off  just me, and not the camera-wielding man. After reaching the police station, they sealed both my mobile phones, thus cutting off my access to my family and friends. But isnt it true that every man has the right to make a call or contact a friend in the event of being arrested? That whole night, my family spent distressed and worried, not having heard from me and not being able to call me. They were about to go to lodge an FIR with that same department that had detained me when I was allowed to go.           
	If a well-intentioned civilian could be subjected to such harassment, why should anyone come forward and help the government in tackling terrorism?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tirthankar Das, Calcutta

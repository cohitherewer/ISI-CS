	Eid was different this time. The sorrow and fear that enveloped Indians in the aftermath of the Mumbai terror attack cast a gloom on the traditionally happy feast. There were two messages that religious leaders of the minority community wished to convey by keeping the occasion low key. The Muslims were mourning for those killed in Mumbai, and they were also telling the killers that terror is no part of Islam. In themselves, these were strong messages, being unitedly sent by everyone participating in Eid all over India. But these were given shape and point by senior community leaders, who pulled no punches in demonstrating that in spite of the terrorists efforts, they had not been able to drive a wedge between the minority community and others in India.        
	For a while now, maulvis and imams had been making a point of dissociating terrorism from Islam, saying that their religion did not support terror, and that terrorists are enemies of all human beings. They evidently felt it necessary to speak up in response to a growing perception that the minority community encouraged, or at least silently supported, terrorism. The proponents of Hindutva seldom missed a chance to urge the tendency to identify Islam with violence, either directly or indirectly. Their job was rendered easy by the fact that history has not always been kind to the relationship between the majority and minority communities in India. In comparison, the secular ideal of the equality of religions is difficult to implement in a multi-layered culture that bears old wounds and memories. Yet Indian society seems to be falling less into the trap of hate-mongers in recent times  the attacks of 2008, for example, have not led to a sectarian confrontation.         
	The Mumbai attack has defined positions and issues more clearly than ever before. So, while it may be heartening to hear the leaders of the minority community speaking out in no uncertain terms, it also has to be asked why they need to do so. The most intimate enemy is within the secular fabric, and divisions and differences are created as much by dogmatic hate-mongers of all communities as by killers and terrorists who recognize no law, civil or religious. As a famed actor asked recently, why do Muslims need to prove their patriotism over and over again? That they feel the need to reiterate that the terrorists are attacking them too, because they are Indians, should cause some serious introspection among the leaders of a secular republic. It is a Muslim leader who has underlined the peculiar timidity that dogs all policy and much perception. If politicians think that by taking a hard line against terrorism they will lose the minority communitys vote, they are wrong, he has said. The people of the community do not support terrorism, and look upon terrorists as enemies of their homeland. It is such forthrightness that is truly heartening, and would go a long way towards clearing the fog of doubts and fears.

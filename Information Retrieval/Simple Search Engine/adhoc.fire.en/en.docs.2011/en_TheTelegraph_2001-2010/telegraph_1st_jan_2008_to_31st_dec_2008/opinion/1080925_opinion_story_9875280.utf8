                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       THE INVISIBLE WAR                                  Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	Terrorism struck the capital of India once again on September 13. An expected series of events followed with electrifying speed thereafter. Panic gripped the city. The police persuaded the traders to down shutters. The visual media went on an overdrive to show the ghastly photographs of the pained and the maimed.The public transport system went haywire.         
	Why did the capital of a nation of over a billion people  a nation that boasts of being the largest democracy in the world, with an impartial judiciary, and a steel-frame bureaucracy  panic the way it did? Why did the silence of grave-yards descend suddenly on Delhi? Was it right on the part of Delhiites to give signs of despair to those who perpetrated the crime against humanity?         
	True, the bomb blast was shocking. True, the post-blast scenes were gory. True, the law enforcement agencies were in for tough calls. But that was, after all, the brutal face of terrorism. By showing a lamentable lack of courage to face the grim situation stoically we have given a huge leverage and conceded moral victory, albeit temporarily, to those who aim to weaken the fabric of the Indian democracy.         
	A paradigm shift appears to have taken place in India during the last few years so far as the terror network is concerned. The foreign elements operating till now have given way to a highly motivated batch of terrorists emerging from indigenous factories. But how does one identify, track and capture them? One can either gauge their existence through the electronic communication system or through counter-terrorist crackdowns.                 
	Soft target        
	However, given the vastness of the country and its dense population, the method is easier suggested than realized, more so because of the differing priorities of the various constituent states. If some one is under the impression that the intelligence unit, however efficient, of a country like India can come up with an instantaneous and accurate prediction of the date, time and location of a future blast, he must be a nave and gullible man. Terror attacks cannot be foretold by a few intelligence officials or by the government. In fact, countries all over the world are repeatedly being taken in by such assaults.         
	India becomes a soft target for terrorists all the more because of the conspicuous absence of awareness, not to speak of knowledge, of the people on the subject. Indians are usually too indifferent to take terrorism seriously and too emotional to castigate it publicly, and yet they tend to forget and forgive it easily. With this benign attitude, it would be an arduous task to make any headway because, as said earlier, tackling terrorism cannot be the responsibility of a few in the establishment.                 
	Stoic calm        
	Post 9/11, the people of the United States of America groaned and mourned, but rarely criticized the government and the Central Intelligence Agency, their monumental error of judgment and the intelligence failure notwithstanding. The government and the people of the US subsequently tried to tackle the problem in every possible way. The department of homeland security was born and the US today, at least in theory, appears to be an impregnable fortress.        
	Can India pull off a similar feat? Can there be a foolproof anti-terrorist system in place in India too? That would be difficult to achieve but to make it succeed the first step should be to eschew criticism of the authorities and take collective action. Going on a ruthless fault-finding drive will serve no purpose other than giving a boost to the terrorists. This is not the time to get demoralized or frustrated. One must be brave and accept sorrow stoically and success, when it comes, with humility.

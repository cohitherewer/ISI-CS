	 Zealous Reformers, Deadly Laws: Battling Stereotypes (Sage, Rs 495) by Madhu Purnima Kishwar is a collection of essays that analyse and question social attitudes to women and legal enactments purported to strengthen womens rights. These articles have all appeared in Manushi: A Journal about Women and Society (of which the author is the founding editor) at different points of time. The book records the various womens movements that have taken place in India, and the legislations that have been passed to improve the condition of women. Kishwar tries to understand the outcome of statist interventions in womens lives, and uses case studies to present strategies for more effective social reform. The author writes lucidly and avoids academic jargon. This is a valuable book both for scholars of womens studies as well as for laypersons interested in womens issues. However, Kishwar would perhaps have done well to revise and update the articles to incorporate the changes in legislation and the newer problems created by them in the lives of Indian women.                        
	The Finger Puppet (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Anu Jayanth is a charmingly written debut novel, set in south India in the Sixties. It tells the story of the young, speech-impaired girl, Tara, and her life in a wealthy, Brahmin family in Tiruchirapalli. Taras abusive father, her pretty and talented sisters, and her submissive mother make up her world. She retreats from this world into one of her own imagining to escape her insecurities about speech impediment and a sense of inferiority to her sisters. The finger puppet, her thumb, enters the novel as a sort of invisible character, the only one who understands Tara and becomes her confidante, as the young girl begins talking to it. Carnatic music and Indian folk tales form an important part of the childhood experience captured by Jayanth. This tale of a childs escape into fantastic worlds of the mind poignantly evokes the many facets of growing up.                        
	 The Pleasure Inn: A Collection of Short Stories (Frog, Rs 195) by Sony Kedar is so outrageously bad that it is certain to invite the wrath of unsuspecting readers who chance upon it. Ridden with clichs and painfully unimaginative, these stories, which purport to cover all genres of fiction  from romance to fantasy and mystery  are so unremarkable that the only purpose of reviewing this book is to warn potential buyers. The authors limited vocabulary and the abysmal editing are only two of the many flaws of this book. Her alarming disregard for the use of the definite article is perhaps the only mystery that this anthology offers.                                    
	 Who Cares About Britishness? A Global View of the National Identity Debate (Arcadia, 11.99) by Vron Ware throws up questions of national identity in contemporary Britain, the greater component of whose population today comprises immigrants from countries previously colonized by the Empire. Ware seeks to represent the voice of the second-generation of these settlers. She explores this new Britishness and the importance of national identity for an emerging class of urban, educated young men and women. For these people, the concept of nationhood is losing its relevance in a globalized economy, where choice and opportunity are more important than geographical borders and national identity.

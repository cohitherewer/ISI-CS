	It is no strange coincidence that Asif Ali Zardaris accession as the president of Pakistan occurred at the same time that the United States of America felt it necessary to carry its war on terror into Pakistans borders. Within a week of Mr Zardari becoming president, apart from successive air strikes, the US special operations troops had staged their first-ever ground operation on Pakistan soil. That too, without as much as a nod from its principal ally in the war on terror. The rush of adrenalin in the US establishment  not entirely unconnected with its response to the heightened pitch of the Democratic presidential campaign  may have been induced by the desire to browbeat the new civilian administration of Pakistan into taking a definite stand on combating terror. It may have also been inspired by the USs newfound enthusiasm to shift the theatre of war from Iraq (where things are supposedly better) to Afghanistan. But this has only succeeded in driving a wedge into the international coalition, further muscling the army in Pakistan, and saddling the Pakistani president with another crisis in his public-relations management. France and Britain have both distanced themselves from the American adventure. By ordering his forces to defend Pakistans borders by any means, General Ashfaq Kayani has made full use of this unprecedented opportunity to display his, and the armys, nationalistic credentials vis--vis the sluggishness of the civilian leadership. And Mr Zardari has found it necessary to crashland in London and hold a two-and-a-half-hour-long talk with Gordon Brown to salvage his image as the worthy successor of the former president in matters of diplomacy.        
	There can be no arguing over the need to confront Pakistan with its doublespeak on combating terror while using terrorists to maintain the countrys strategic depth in the area. But there is no instant formula for disabling the Inter-Services Intelligence and dissolving the training camps within Pakistans borders. The impulsive air raids and ground operations, without the modalities of such a war being sorted out on the table with the allies, can only multiply civilian casualties and feed jingoism. Hamid Karzai, despite his support for US action, is already complaining of the hardships forced on the population by such action. And public outrage in Pakistan against US aggression has already put General Kayani at a significant advantage over the head of state.

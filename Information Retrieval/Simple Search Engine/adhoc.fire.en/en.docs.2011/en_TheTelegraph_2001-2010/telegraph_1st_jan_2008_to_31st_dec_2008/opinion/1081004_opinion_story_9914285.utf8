	Dirty dancing                   
	Sir  The dancing policemen ( or were they sources?) inside the sessions court who celebrated the bail of three of their brethren accused in the Rizwanur case showed that cops and their followers have no sense of morality or decorum. An innocent life has been lost, but the police are concerned about their tainted colleagues only. The Rizwanur case has dented Calcutta Polices image, but instead of being shamed by the events, the unrepentent men seem to be hoping that the law doesnt catch up with the guilty.           
	Yours faithfully,         Chaitali Tarafdar, Laguna Park, Singapore     
	Fresh wounds          
	Sir  Rattled by the European Unions criticism of the violence against Christians in Kandhamal, Orissa, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, directed the state government to protect the life and property of minority communities (Singh weathers French storm, Sept 30). However, Singhs mild admonishment has expectedly failed to turn things around in Orissa. The violence continues unabated, and now seems to have spread to the neighbouring district of Boudh (Orissa Christian attacks spread, Oct 3).           
	There are two possible reasons for the state governments failure to bring the situation under control. First, the chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, has been restrained by the Bharatiya Janata Party, whose support props Patnaiks government, from putting an end to the mayhem. Second, it is clear that the mild mannered Patnaik is incapable of dealing with the situation in a firm manner. In the initial phase, the first seemed to hold true. However, now I am convinced that it is Patnaiks weakness that has led things spin out of control. Patnaiks grip over his administration seems to be slipping and that is certainly a cause for concern.  
	Yours faithfully,        Soumyajit Mohanty, Bhubaneswar         
	Sir  The Telegraph has consistently reported the attacks on churches in Kandhamal. However, the reports have failed to highlight the root cause of the violence in this impoverished district. It is significant that attacks on minorities have not been reported from relatively developed areas such as Puri, Cuttack or even Bhubaneswar that are home to a number of Christians. This is because the drive to convert people to Christianity by missionaries is concentrated mostly in poor districts such as Kandhamal. The resultant tension between those for and against conversion has sparked off the present crisis. The need of the hour is to monitor and curb missionary activities. Care should also be taken to develop Kandhamal on a war footing because an improvement in the peoples standard of living will surely prevent such outbreaks in the future.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot    
	Sir  The fact that a restaurant in cosmopolitan Mumbai discriminates between Marathi and non-Marathi speakers is shocking (Dinner discount? Speak Marathi, Sept 29). Marathi-speaking diners reportedly are given a hefty discount as a part of a strategy to encourage Maharashtrians to eat out more. This is simply a thinly disguised attempt to legitimize a biased practice. In fact, instead of permitting waiters to eavesdrop to find out whether a customer is speaking in Marathi, the restaurant owner should put up the rule on sign boards or print it on menu cards to spare non-Maharashtrians the embarrassment. Such discrimination in a public place ought to be considered illegal and the consumer court should be approached to ensure that all customers are charged equal rates.  
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TWIST IN THE TALE                                  China Diary -Neha Sahay                              
	The Wengan riots last week over the alleged cover-up of a rape-cum-murder of a 15-year-old, and the subsequent beating to death of her uncle by the police have ended with an unexpected twist. The third autopsy on the girls body, performed in the presence of her parents, confirmed what the previous two had: death by drowning, and no rape. More, her uncle is not dead. He has told reporters that he is recuperating in hospital, having been beaten by unidentified goons. Finally, the two boys suspected of having raped her and said to be well-connected, turned out to be farmers children, just as she was.         
	So what caused the riots? The original official version was that the rioters were instigated by criminals spreading rumours. The burning of the police headquarters, and the party and county office made even President Hu Jintao express concern. Two days later, the provincial party secretary was sent to investigate.         
	Hong Kong reporters and the party secretary found that the incident was no more than a tragic suicide. The girl, having spent the evening drinking rice wine with friends, announced her intention to jump into the river. Her friends  two boys and a girl  dissuaded her but didnt take her too seriously. When she jumped, the boys, one of them her boyfriend, tried saving her, but failed. All four were students, living away from their families. The girl lived with her elder brother, also a student.        
	When the parents arrived, they believed the police version, but provoked by sceptical relatives and locals, demanded a re-investigation. By then, the police had started insisting that the body be buried. The parents refused and brought their own coroner from a bigger town.        
	The face-off between the police, who, having questioned the girls friends, were convinced that it was a suicide, and the family, who insisted that it be treated as murder, led to widespread resentment. The rumour that the uncle had been assaulted to death by the police brought matters to a flashpoint.                
	More questions        
	Whats significant is that all over the country, netizens felt the parents were right. In fact, the provincial secretary began his meeting with local officials by reading out the netizens comments to them. Indeed, the manner in which this official investigation was conducted is probably the most remarkable thing about the incident.        
	The provincial party secretary not only met ordinary citizens unannounced but he also encouraged them to talk frankly, seeing their hesitation. When they spoke about their insecurity, the frequent rapes and murders that had taken place and the way the rich could buy off the police, the 62-year-old senior party official apologized to them. As Communist Party officials, we should learn to serve the people, not just think about promotions and getting rich, he told them. Blaming the police for the citizens feelings of insecurity, he recommended that they be dismissed from class. Within a week, the two seniormost party and police officials were dismissed.        
	The tragedy is that this revolutionary investigation and its equally exemplary outcome were initially reported in its usual sanitized style by Xinhua, the official news agency. It quoted the party secretary mouthing the usual platitudes about social harmony and blaming criminals for the incident. This further enraged the netizens. Its only now that China Daily and Xinhua have begun reporting on how the investigation was conducted.         
	Will the 62-year-old party official survive this investigation?  this is the question now being asked.         
	Why did the 15-year-old kill herself? Her friends told reporters that she felt that her parents loved her brother more than they loved her. They sent him more pocket money. He, in turn, kept a strict watch over her love of gaming parlours.

	Impasse may well become the middle name of the Doha round of trade talks that are currently in their seventh year. The World Trade Organization wants to hold a ministerial round of talks in July to finalize things, after minimizing differences. The differences are major and it is unlikely that they  or even the crucial ones  will be resolved. Under the circumstances, there is the fear that the ministerial round will yield nothing  or will not be held at all. One important factor in the looming pessimism is that very soon, the president of the United States of America will become lame-duck till the election of a new president in November. Ministerial level talks without a principal driving force is tantamount to a charade. India has been a major player in the talks. But it is now in danger of losing its two main allies  Brazil and South Africa. The former is wavering and the latter might be won over. On its own, Indias bargaining power will be much lower. India is thus somewhat indifferent to the new round of talks, which might actually see Indias demotion from the high table of negotiations.        
	It may well be asked: what is the fuss about? The US Congress has passed a bill that restricts what a country can do by way of reduction in subsidies in agriculture. This affects India since it means a reduction of agricultural tariffs. This is politically non-viable. Some kind of bargaining chip is required, but there is very little of importance that can be done in agriculture. India cannot give in on another critical issue: access to non-agricultural markets via only a small reduction in the present level of tariffs. India also feels that it has not gained too much in the facility of people going abroad on short-term assignments or on contractual work. Indias weak bargaining position is compounded by the fact that protectionist lobbies have become stronger in many developed countries. This is a direct fallout of the rise to eminence of the economies of China and India in the last decade. It is a major change, and has taken place since the Uruguay Round was completed 10 years ago. Laggards have now become competitors, and this has completely altered the perspective and perceptions of negotiators from the developed countries. Indias strength is in some ways Indias weakness in the Doha round of trade talks. There is no reason why India should not be proud of this irony.

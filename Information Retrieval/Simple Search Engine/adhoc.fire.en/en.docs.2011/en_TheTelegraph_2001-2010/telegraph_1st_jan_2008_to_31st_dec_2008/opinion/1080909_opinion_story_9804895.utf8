	Statistics are usually officially true, but unverifiable. And this is the reason governments love them and ordinary citizens resist them. It is one thing to be told that there are actually fewer people living with HIV/AIDS in India, and quite another to notice the real presence of HIV/AIDS in ones immediate environment. This is the sort of game that is now being played with leprosy in Bengal. The official figure is still one in 10,000, but it was declared a couple of years ago that leprosy had been eliminated, even when for that to happen the number had to be less than one in 10,000. So all state and Central government leprosy units in Bengal have been shut down, although neither this figure nor the official stance fits the actual scenario. Leprosy has not been eliminated and the stigma around is still in place. Those who have the disease are yet to be treated within the ordinary medical infrastructure, and those who have recovered have not been rehabilitated into the mainstream.        
	The first thing that the state finance minister has asked for is a register of people suffering from or disabled by leprosy so that they can all be given the pathetically inadequate disability allowance of Rs 500 per month. Some doctors, field-workers and public health managers have also suggested that figures are often manipulated to show the elimination rate stipulated by the World Health Organization. The only way to meet these targets is to activate political will in the state to achieve the full integration of the treatment of leprosy into general health services, thereby reducing the stigma as well. Taking refuge behind statistics is not the best way of starting to do this.

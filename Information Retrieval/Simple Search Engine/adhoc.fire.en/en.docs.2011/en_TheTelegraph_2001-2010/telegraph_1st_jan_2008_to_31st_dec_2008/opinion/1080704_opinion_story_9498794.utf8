	Behenji: A political biography of Mayawati By Ajoy Bose, Viking, Rs 499        
	If the rise of Mayawati is a miracle of democracy, as P.V. Narasimha Rao exclaimed after she became the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh for the first time in 1995, then her unique brand of caste politics embodies democracys biggest romance. The vision of social inclusiveness, enshrined in the concept of a bahujan samaj, had its roots in trade unionism, with Mayawatis mentor, Kanshi Ram, a Dalit Sikh from Punjab, setting up the All India Backward and Minority Employees Federation in 1973. Its political wing, the Dalit Soshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti, formed in 1981, provided the ideal stepping-stone for the establishment of the Bahujan Samaj Party in 1984. Even as the magic spell of democracy made possible this incredible transition of an oppressed group from their traditional invisibility to redeeming prominence, the movement refused to be tied down to its origins. With her outstanding victory in the 2007 UP assembly polls, which ushered in her fourth tenure as CM, Mayawati has defied every kind of parochialism by extending her vote bank to embrace a holistic sarvajan samaj. The result is a veritable melting pot, including the entire range of castes from the highest to the lowest, and even Muslims. Is this then the triumph of democracy, the strange fruit of its composite utopian aspirations? Or perhaps this is the logical outcome of the peculiar expediencies of electoral politics, born out of the self-serving impulses of coalition governance, that maker of the strangest bedfellows?        
	Ajoy Boses life of the iconic Dalit leader is neither hagiographic nor sensational. Rather, it examines how Mayawatis meteoric career and the course of identity politics in post-colonial India are tied up with evolving structures of parliamentary democracy, social justice and economic reform. This is not to deny the book a certain human interest. But Bose categorically stays away from psycho-biographical guesswork. He admits the paucity of information about Mayawatis childhood, with little else other than the sanitized glimpses in the politicians autobiography filling in the blanks. For this reason perhaps, Boses Mayawati never stops being the iron lady of Indian politics, with little detail on her personal experiences either as Dalit or a woman. Bose vividly recounts the attack on her by Mulayam Singh Yadav and his cadre at a guesthouse in Lucknow in 1995, as also the controversies trailing her career  from the the Taj corridor scandal to the outrageous claim made by Dainik Jagran about her having a love-child. But her private life, particularly her relationship with Kanshi Ram, remains shrouded in mystery.        
	What Bose does, and does with disarming sophistication, is analyse Mayawati as a creature of the forces of history and Indian party-politics. She is probably the most important Dalit leader the nation has seen, overshadowing even B.R. Ambedkar, the Father of the Constitution and architect of affirmative action, with her strident humanness. If Babasaheb is a demi-god, then Behenji, with her fiery imperiousness is flesh and blood, the quintessential Dalit ki beti. In her earlier terms as CM, Mayawati captivated the public imagination with this all-too-humanness. Samajwadi Partys successful defection of her cabinet had made her chronically insecure, to the extent that she insisted on inspecting every scrap of document that was released by her ministry. Such manic suspiciousness turned her into a seasoned control freak, so much so that she ended up signing the days last few official documents at her bungalow in a night-dress.        
	Bose teases out the portrait of an anguished and unscrupulous politician by probing such details. Easily bullied by the media, Mayawati is perhaps the only Indian politician to have gone on record saying the most explosive things about the nations other father  Mahatma Gandhi. She openly criticized the term harijan, coined by Gandhi in deference to the untouchables, wondering if Dalits are the children of God, are the others children of the devil? Even the Bharatiya Janata Party, whose attitude to Gandhi, at the best of times, is ambiguous, was shocked by her impudence. Mayawati also displayed a comparable irreverence when making and unmaking political alliances. Between 1995 and 2007, UP saw a series of incredibly volatile coalition governments, desperate to survive by hook or crook. (In 1996, a brief BJP-BSP tie-up had Mayawati and Kalyan Singh taking turns every six months as chief ministers.) Mayawati seldom let emotions influence her ruthlessly pragmatic choice of allies. Despite her fabled closeness to Sonia Gandhi in the past, she did not hesitate to withdraw support from the United Progressive Alliance government, taking exception to the Indo-US nuclear deal, which ostensibly clashes with the interests of her Muslim vote-bank.        
	Most Indian politicians are skilled at hopscotching, shifting loyalties, making fairweather friends and foes. Mayawatis inconstancy therefore remains unremarkable. (The illusory nuclear deal, for instance, has softened the Samajwadis towards their bitter rivals, the Congress.) It makes better sense to understand her resounding success in terms of her core ideological principles. Despite her obvious pro-Dalit affiliations, does Mayawati have a comprehensive solution to end the egregiously hierarchical caste system? Even ten years ago, her policies were more anti-Brahmin than anti-discrimination. When Mayawati attacked Gandhi, she upheld Ambedkars plea for separate caste-based electorates, a line of argument that is far from her mind at present. Instead of compensating the psychic costs of suffering an inequitable system  which Pratap Bhanu Mehta describes as the burden of democracy  through mere belligerence, Mayawati now has a more ingenious strategy to reverse the social pyramid.        
	Before the 2007 assembly elections, she enlisted the support of the upper castes to create a Dalit-Brahmin bhaichara. A clever sleight of hand, this rainbow alliance also included Muslims, playing up the secular card in a state tainted by a series of communal riots, the most spectacular following the demolition of the Babri Masjid. The strategy turned out to be immensely successful, winning her party an astonishing 206 seats. Mayawati found the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, scores of Brahmins of the highest pedigree supplicated before her, touching her feet publicly. Crores continue to be lavished on statues of the Dalit heroes (she is herself now part of the pantheon) spread all across the state, while her pet project, the Ambedkar Park in Lucknow, continues to grow in leaps and bounds. But these remain only the signs of the times  symbols of pride, success, and glory  and should not be mistaken for enduring signals of change.                          SOMAK GHOSHAL

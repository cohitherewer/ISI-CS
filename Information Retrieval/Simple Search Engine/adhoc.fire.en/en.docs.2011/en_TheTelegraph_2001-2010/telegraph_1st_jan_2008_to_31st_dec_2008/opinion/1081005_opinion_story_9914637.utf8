	Rivals in celebration                  
	 Sir  In the last annual general meeting of the East Bengal club, the general secretary, Kalyan Majumdar, had stated that the club would refrain from celebrating a particular day as special, as Mohun Bagan celebrates Mohun Bagan Day on August 15, to commemorate its birthday. But why does East Bengal then have a Sports Day on August 13, the birthday of the late Dipak (Paltu) Das, a former general secretary of the club? If East Bengal wishes to pay homage to a club official, then the most apposite choice would be the late J.C. Guha. One wonders why Dipak Das was chosen for the honour, leaving aside the more eminent ones like J.C. Guha, Nishith Ghosh or Nripen Das.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Out in the open          
	Sir  After a lot of dithering, the Centre has finally decided to impose a blanket ban on smoking in public places from October 2. It is even more heartening that there are future plans for making pictorial warnings on cigarette packs mandatory (Court paves way for puff ban, Sept 30). However, a ban like this is hardly going to be a foolproof way of dealing with health hazards caused by nicotine. Rather, the Union government should follow countries like Bhutan by imposing a complete prohibition on the manufacture and sale of tobacco products.           
	The aim should be to look beyond smoking and also include other forms of tobacco consumption  as in chewing paan or gutkha  which are equally detrimental to health. Relying merely on self-regulation is not going to work. If it did, drivers would not have to be threatened into using helmets or fastening seat-belts on Indian roads.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Like sex, cigarettes too have to be had in private from now on. Perhaps the idea is to suggest that both these activities are equally harmful for society, as the former results in the increase in population and spread of diseases (unless suitable preventives are used), while the latter spoils the health of citizens.          
	Yours faithfully,       
M. Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Sir  These days, smoking is generally frowned upon in Europe and in the United States of America. It is actively discouraged in public places like restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Recently, gory pictures of infected lungs were put on cigarette packs to increase public awareness in the West. Attempts have also been made to enact legislations to bring the tobacco industry under the purview of the Drugs Act in the US. Compared to this proactiveness in the West, India seems to be newly discovering the dangers of smoking.           
	It is widely believed that tobacco companies systematically increase the nicotine content to keep existing smokers addicted and get new ones hooked. Moreover, labels like mild, ultra mild or lights often mislead people, who are given to understand that these variants are less harmful than the others. At last, with a ban like this, we can now expect to counter the menace of smoking in a concerted way.          
	Yours faithfully,      
H.N. Ramakrishna, Bangalore

                
	Sir  I am relieved that the government has decided to put an embargo on smoking in public places. But sadly, this ban is being flouted not so surreptitiously. When I recently discovered my mathematics teacher smoking inside the school premises, I pointed out to him that he was defying the law. I was given a slap in return, and my teacher went on smoking, uninhibited. Although theoretically, nobody is above the law, it is seldom possible to enforce the rule of the book on everyone uniformly.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Pradip Kr Santra,

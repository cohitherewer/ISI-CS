	Mating is a notoriously tricky business for porcupines, but even the first date is an awkward transaction. Likewise for prickly customers like China and Taiwan: when a high-level Chinese delegation arrived in Taiwan last week for landmark talks on closer relations, the Taiwan police even prevented people on the roads from waving Taiwans flag so as not to hurt the visitors feelings.        
	The two countries (or one, if you prefer) broke apart almost 60 years ago, and it has only just become possible to travel directly between them. The 180-km-wide Taiwan Strait remains one of the most heavily militarized regions in the world, with nearly 1,300 Chinese missiles pointing at Taiwan.        
	Even under the new government of President Ma Ying-jeou, which is committed to improving relations with the mainland, Taiwan keeps its defences up. It recently signed its largest-ever arms deal with the US, agreeing on a $6.5 billion package of guided missiles, attack helicopters and other advanced weaponry. In retaliation, Beijing cancelled a series of scheduled meetings between Chinese and US generals, but not the visit of Chen Yunlin, the most senior Communist official ever to set foot in Taiwan.        
	The first results of the encounter are already known: in future, cargo ships will be allowed to sail directly between Taiwan and China, and there will be over a hundred direct flights a week between their cities. There are hopes, especially in Taiwan, that this will lead to greatly increased trade between the two sides, and the next round of talks (to be held every six months) will focus on closer financial ties as well.        
	But where is all this leading? Reunification? The opposition Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan fears so, and a million of its supporters demonstrated against the meeting, but Ma swears that he will not make a move that might compromise Taiwans sovereignty.                
	Nowhere to go?        
	Over the past quarter-century, prosperity has soared in China and the ruling Communist Party has scrapped most of its ideology. But Taiwan has changed even more. Sixty years ago, the Nationalist Party that ruled the island was almost identical to the CCP in its structure, its nationalism, and authoritarian style. Both parties were formed in the wave of nationalism that swept China after the 1911 revolution overthrew the monarchy, and Chiang Kai-shek, who led the Nationalist Party until his death in 1975, was as autocratic as his great rival, Mao Zedong, the CCP leader. But the Nationalists lost the civil war in 1949 and withdrew to Taiwan, where American sea-power prevented the Communists from following. So Taipei became the seat of the government-in-exile of the Republic of China.        
	That was how Chiang saw it, and he suppressed any expressions of Taiwanese separatism dreaming of returning to Beijing as the leader of a reunited China. But after Chiangs death, the NP, while still dedicated to a united China in principle, gradually moved towards a fully democratic system  and so lost power in 2000 to a separatist party.        
	There was genuine support for that goal in Taiwan, but it was never a real possibility: Beijing made it clear that a declaration of independence would trigger an invasion. So after eight years of economic stagnation and growing corruption, the separatists lost power last March to the Nationalists under Ma. They remain committed to the reunification of China, but not under a Communist dictatorship.        
	Improving trade with China is important to Taiwan, which has not done well economically of late: the average Taiwanese still earns about five times more than the average Chinese, but the gap is narrowing. However, closer political ties are more problematic, and the military still stand ready on both sides of the straits. The two governments may have set off on a voyage to nowhere, but at least it has started well.

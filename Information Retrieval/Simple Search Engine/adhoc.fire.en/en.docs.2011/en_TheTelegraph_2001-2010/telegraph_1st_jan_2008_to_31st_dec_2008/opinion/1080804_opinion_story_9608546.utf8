	So why was Karadzic in disguise then? Because he was a compulsive showman who always sought the limelight, and hiding in obscurity was driving him crazy. The disguise, the false name, the whole different persona were ways for him to resume a public life (as an alternative medicine healer), not a way of hiding from the state security and intelligence services. They were actually protecting him from the agents of the international court because that was what the Serbian government wanted.        
	It was certainly what Slobodan Milosevic, the main author of the Balkan wars of the Nineties, wanted. Until he was overthrown by a bloodless revolution in 2000, all the ultra-nationalists who had set out to cleanse non-Serbs from the Serbian-inhabited parts of former Yugoslavia were safe from the United Nations tribunal in The Hague, including Karadzic and his chief collaborator in the murder of thousands of Bosnian Muslims, Ratko Mladic.        
	But Milosevic was overthrown because he had lost the wars and ruined the economy, not because he had sponsored a genocide. Even today, a third of the Serbian population believes that Serbs are the innocent victims of foreign plots, not the citizens of a state that set out to cleanse non-Serbs from all the parts of former Yugoslavia where there was a substantial Serbian population. And the new president who sent Milosevic and a couple of his close allies off to face trial at The Hague, Zoran Djindjic, was assassinated by a Serbian extremist in 2003.                 
	Two charmed letters        
	Indeed, in recent years it seemed likely that none of the major Serbian perpetrators of the genocide would be punished at all. Milosevic died before he could be convicted, and Serbia wasnt handing over any more suspects even though it was increasingly beset by isolation and poverty. Then came the parliamentary election, ten weeks ago. It was not a sweeping rejection of the nationalists and their obsessions, but it did create the mathematical possibility of a coalition government in Belgrade that rejected the past.        
	It took two months, but early this month a government emerged (with much help from President Boris Tadic) that was willing to move against the Serbian war criminals. Led by Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic, it has already found Karadzic, and before long it may also find Mladic and the Serb responsible for the worst atrocities in Croatia, Goran Hadzic. What is motivating it to act so decisively, and why are so many Serbs now willing to go along with it?         
	Two letters: EU. The Serbs are tired of being out in the cold, they want the prosperity, the constitutional stability, the democracy, the rule of law that seem to flourish almost magically in countries that join the European Union. And EU diplomats have made it very clear to the Serbs that there will be no discussions about membership until Serbia hands over its war criminals. The EU is playing hardball but meeting its demand should not cause Serbians to break out in a sweat because they surely must know the whereabouts of their war criminals. Then, the Serbs reckon, its one year to candidate membership status, and five years to full membership.         
	Genuine repentance for all the horrors that Serbia inflicted on its partners in former Yugoslavia would be nice, but its too soon to hope for that. Karadzic in chains will have to do for now.

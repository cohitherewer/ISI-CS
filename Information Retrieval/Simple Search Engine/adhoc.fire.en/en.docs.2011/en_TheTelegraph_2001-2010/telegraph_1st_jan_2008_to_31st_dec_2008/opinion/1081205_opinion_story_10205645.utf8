	Once upon a time in a small town                
	Khairlanji: A strange and bitter crop (Navayana, Rs 190) by Anand Teltumbde revisits the horror perpetrated at Khairlanji in September 2006, one of the many atrocities that are committed in the name of caste in India. Surekha Bhotmange and her children were lynched by a village mob of men and women from the upper castes. Teltumbde chronicles this chilling episode and delves deeper into the faultlines to explore how an unequal society and its institutions conspire to create the conditions for such barbarity, and then acts swiftly to brush the crime under the carpet. Teltumbdes research is exhaustive and he shies away from sensationalizing the tragedy. Khairlanji will force readers to ponder whether modernity and globalization hold any promises for the disempowered in this country.                          
	Poona Company (Harperperennial, Rs 200) by Farrukh Dhondy brings together nine interconnected stories about Dhondys childhood and the strange characters that filled his early life in Punes Sarbatwalla Chowk. Among them was Eddie who loved old phonograph records, the gigantic Samson who refused to work and, on one occasion, crushed three bicycles instead of the thieves he was supposed to catch, the mysterious Black Dog, and the despondent Farrukh himself, grieving over his broken spectacles. Dhondy writes about this motley bunch and their quirky experiences, recreating in the process the life and times of a quaint town with a fondness and sharpness that can come only to someone who belonged to this charming circle.                            
	Captain Cool: The M.S. Dhoni story (Westland, Rs 150) by Gulu Ezekiel recounts the present Indian cricket captains remarkable journey from obscurity to stardom. Ezekiels anecdotes show how the lad from Jharkhand overcame challenges  both personal and professional  to become crickets new wonderboy. Here, there is something for the statistically-minded as well: an entire chapter of career facts compiled by Mohandas Menon as proof of Dhonis raw talent. But what comes through most in Ezekiels writing is the young mans unflappable nature: Dhoni appears to have remained touchingly human, despite being turned into a demigod by a delirious nation. The photographs accompanying the text disappoint however.

	Short of being waterboarded by the CIA, I wouldnt even think of voting for Hillary Clinton. Yet my money has been on her to win the Democratic candidacy, and then the United States of Americas presidency, from the start  for all the reasons which I least like in politicians, and which may be most necessary to them. She excels at being all things to all voters: the sight of someone who spent eight years in the White House recently rebranding herself as a Pennsylvania redneck would have made angels gag, but plainly not the voters it was aimed at. She not merely bends facts but concocts them, Bosnian airport snipers and all. And, like Churchill or Robert Mugabe, she has a huge and uncritical belief in herself.        
	She also has one more admirable quality: she is tough as nails. Any woman politician needs this, and far more than men do. Margaret Thatcher had it in spades. At the time of Britains Falklands war with Argentina in 1982 she was described as the only man in the cabinet. She could have prevented the Argentine invasion of the islands before it started. But having made the blunder, it was she, defying White House, world and British pressure, who steeled her ministers and brasshats to reverse it.         
	Im less sure about Indira Gandhi. She was tough (and wrong) enough to suspend Indias democracy in a manifestly bogus emergency just to safeguard herself. Yet I suspect history will rate Sonia Gandhi higher in this respect. True, it was Rajivs murder that first brought her to the top. But, Italian-born, you surely dont get to stay for ten years at the head of Congress simply by being someones widow.         
	Benazir Bhutto, like both Gandhis  and other women leaders in South Asia  came to the top thanks to her links to a dead man who had been there. But she was certainly tough in her attempt last autumn to reclaim her place.                 
	Fitness of things        
	No one needs telling why women politicians need to be even tougher than men: they have centuries of male dominance and even now of prejudice or mere inertia to fight through. Thats why some political parties have laid down rules to ensure greater gender equality; even Britains Tories are trying (so far, unsuccessfully) to get a 50-50 split in their choice of candidates.         
	In Europe, women increasingly are getting elected and, more than that, getting ministerial posts. Spains new (male) prime minister last year chose a cabinet with as many women as men. Finland has a solid majority of women. Even in Britain, women have a larger share of the cabinet than of parliamentary seats.         
	I doubt that such choices reflect solely fitness for the job. Government leaders take account of umpteen factors in choosing ministers. Few people question Condoleezza Rices competence in what must be a fiendishly difficult job, with Bush on one hand and the real world on the other. But when Tony Blair brought Britains first wave of women into ministerial posts, their performance was unimpressive. It may be, though I hope not, that at this level positive discrimination in favour of women does them no favours.        
	Should we want more women at the very top? Id say yes. You can ask where it will lead: Thatcher was widely hated. Indira Gandhi and Benazir Bhutto ran regimes notorious for corruption, and the women who have held power in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have been no advertisement for their sex. But then the same has been true of countless men.         
	The world is miles from what the Scottish presbyterian, John Knox, denounced in the 16th century as the monstrous regiment of women. But if the world ever gets there, one thing is certain: women could not mess it up any worse than we men have done. So, if (alas) she beats Barack Obama, maybe thats a reason for Americans to vote Clinton in November after all. Me, Id put another modest bet on her and hope  though not expect  to lose.

	Winning an election was not enough for Robert Mugabe  although saner observers refuse to call what happened in Zimbabwe either an election or a victory. Mr Mugabe also had to enforce at least the semblance of an endorsement of his presidency at the African Union summit in Egypt that ended yesterday. And most of his neighbours, whatever their private apprehensions, seemed to have few qualms in treating him like a democratically elected head. Mr Mugabe was seen hugging everyone near him at the summit; the Egyptian president hosting the meeting talked of peace and stability, but not of democracy in his welcome address; and one of Mr Mugabes aides, when asked to respond to the worlds growing disapproval of the Mugabe regime, replied that the West can go hang a thousand times. He added that only a Zimbabwean way could resolve the crisis in his country, if at all this was a crisis. Very few of the African leaders assembled at the summit, including the Egyptian host, have impeccable democratic credentials. So, discrediting Mr Mugabes victory might set an inconvenient precedent for them. Besides, any explicit talk of disapproval and intervention would look like riding the white-supremacist high horse. No wonder the South African president, whose interventions were the most hoped for, chose a non-committal form of quiet diplomacy when it came to handling Mr Mugabe. They are both scions of the liberation movements against white-minority domination that brought them into power in their respective countries.         
	After wresting almost 90 per cent of the valid votes in an eventually uncontested election, through a vicious campaign of beatings, abductions, rapes and murders, what would be the next stage of the Zimbabwean way? Mr Mugabes opponent, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change, has now come out of his refuge in the Dutch embassy. Whether Mr Tsvangirai is open to talks with Mr Mugabe, what sort of compromises the latter is willing to make, and what form any power-sharing would take are still deeply uncertain. What is evident is that Mr Tsvangirai remains frightened and unsure, confronted by a system that has proven itself to be desperately skilled in violence and intimidation. Ordinary Zimbabweans, now existing at subsistence levels, and the rest of the increasingly appalled world can hardly bank on him to rescue Zimbabwe from this grimness.

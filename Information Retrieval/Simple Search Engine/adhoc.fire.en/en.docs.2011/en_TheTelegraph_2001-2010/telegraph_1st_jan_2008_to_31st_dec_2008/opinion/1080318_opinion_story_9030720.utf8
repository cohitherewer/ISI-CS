The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Death drive
                                                                                                                 DEATH DRIVE                                                    
	With buses streaking murderously through the city day after day, Calcutta is plumbing new depths of what has begun to look like irreversible savagery. It is yet another instance of a lethal and extreme form of lawlessness becoming part of the normal texture of everyday life in the city and its suburbs, through nothing other than simple recurrence. Buses are looked upon in Calcutta as tigers are in the Sunderbans: protecting oneself from them is ones own responsibility. To kill is the natural prerogative of both. And the brutality of the racing drivers produces an answering brutality in the people, who take upon themselves the task of punishing the drivers. Lynching, burning and other collective expressions of public fury have become an inevitable part of each such episode. There is, of course, a corresponding increase in the ineffectuality of the State machinery, especially of the police, in dealing with the drivers or the angry mob. So men, women and children, the young as well as the elderly, die in hundreds every year, and the episodes and their aftermath remain astonishingly the same, year after year.        
	The most recent episodes were particularly gruesome. A womans arm was wrenched off, the window-rods impaling her throat and temple, and a young girl dragged down the road full speed, her leg caught in the front wheel. Elsewhere, on the same day, there were three other accidents, out of which one was fatal. In most of these daily occurrences, the primary offender is a driver speeding, racing another bus or ignoring the traffic lights. But a whole penumbra of irregularities surrounds that offence and feeds into it: apathetic policemen, or policemen chasing for bribes, unlawfully parked vehicles, lorries unloading sand for illegal constructions and leaving little space for pedestrians to walk safely out of the buses reach, and so on. The offence, or complex of offences, may be explained in various ways and put in various contexts: badly trained and underpaid drivers competing for custom, trade unionism overriding legal measures, pedestrian zones taken over by illegal occupants (hawkers or squatters). This is, in a way, to accept the existing state of affairs and give up on trying to change it. But to write the situation off as irreversible is to be complicit in the violent undermining of every civilized principle on which a modern metropolis should be founded.

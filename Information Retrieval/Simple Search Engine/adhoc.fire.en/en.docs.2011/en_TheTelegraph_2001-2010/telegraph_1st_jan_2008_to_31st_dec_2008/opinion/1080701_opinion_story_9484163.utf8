	While Iran and Iraq continue to bleep louder on George W. Bushs axis of evil, North Korea is finally off the radar. On June 27, as a cooling tower of the Yongbyon reactor went up in a spectacularly symbolic mushroom cloud, Pyongyang ushered in a closure to its nuclear activities after being for nearly two decades on the terror blacklist of the United States of America. Delayed by six months, North Korea has submitted a huge inventory  running into 18,000 pages  of its atomic resources to China, according to the resolutions adopted in the last six-nation talks. In return, the US has promised to lift trade sanctions within 45 days  the time it will take international inspectors to go through the list  although UN sanctions would continue as before. It is only reasonable to be prudently optimistic about North Korea, given its legendary secretiveness. In 1994, it froze its plutonium programme to avoid war with America, but pursued clandestine uranium enrichment. Last September, the US was shocked to discover a Yongbyon-like reactor in Syria, before it was destroyed by Israel  a testimony to North Koreas endless guile.        
	This dangerous cunning has kept the West apprehensive about North Korea. A totalitarian regime continues to reign there, and despite its appalling human-rights record, it has slithered out of every trap that the US has laid for it. For instance, international isolation, instead of deterring Kim Jong-il (and before him his father, Kim Il Sung), helped him perpetuate a Stalinist dictatorship in the absence of outside intervention. North Korea has consistently dodged every call to sign the nuclear proliferation treaty  even allegedly carrying out a blast in 2006. President Bush need not feel complacent about having made a break-through this time. In fact, on its own, the US would have made no headway into the talks, without the persuasive skills of the other four nations  Japan, South Korea, China and Russia. Clearly, North Korea cannot be won the Iraq way, just as it would be unwise to try out strong-arm tactics on Iran, given the support it receives from the Islamist bloc consolidating itself across west and central Asia. The removal of the economic embargo might give the US a much-desired point of entry into North Korea. After all, only a closer diplomatic relationship and economic development helped terminate the authoritarian rule of Park Chung and his clan in South Korea.

	After four long months, it now seems to be the season of reconciliation in Nepal, or almost. After their drubbing in the elections for the posts of president and vice president, the Maoists reconciled themselves to the realities of a multi-party system and, not being strong enough to form a government on its own, agreed to an alliance with the communists and the Madhesis. The communists, in turn, realized that denying the Maoists the office of the prime minister may have dangerous consequences, as they still have the capacity of disturbing peace in Nepal. The Madhesis, of course, were only too willing to be a part of the new government, rather than waste time sitting in the opposition.        
	Right now the Nepali Congress is the lone opposition party. This is something that had been expected all along because of the Nepali Congresss deep-seated mistrust of the Maoists. However, as Nepal begins to walk along a new path under Pushpa Kumar Dahal or Prachanda, the Nepali Congress, as the second largest party in the constituent assembly, should also have a role to play as a watchdog. For the time being, the party may feel that it was let down by the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) and the Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum, but the mature leadership is also sure to appreciate the fact that denying prime ministership to the single largest party would have been against the peoples mandate. The old warhorse, Girija Prasad Koirala, also knows that a time may well come when the coalition will fail to work and in such a case, his party will have a vital role to play.                 
	Little knowledge        
	The future of the coalition will of course depend largely on the Maoists, or to be more specific, on their plans for their erstwhile guerrillas. The prime ministers stated position so far has been that they should be integrated into the army. The army naturally is totally opposed to this  soldiers cannot be expected to work shoulder to shoulder with enemies of the recent past. The Nepali Congress shares the armys reservation and even the two coalition partners cannot be too happy with the idea. On the other hand, the Maoist leaders feel this is a must  they cannot let down their comrades.        
	Whether Prachanda will have a re-look at the issue, given the situation, is not immediately known. His trip to China and his meeting with communist leaders in Beijing may well instil in him a sense of pragmatism for which the Communist Party of China is now famous. He may also get a few tips on how to go about resurrecting the economy, keeping both his ideology and the presence of a strong feudal lobby in Nepal in mind.         
	Another tricky subject is the Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950, a favourite whipping boy of both the Maoists and the communists as they feel it is loaded against the Nepalese people. One aspect of the treaty is unrestricted travel between the two countries. If Kathmandu wants to impose restrictions on travel, that will actually be going against the Nepalese in the long run, as it will deprive many of them of the means of livelihood. India, on the other hand, may gain from it as terrorists operating here very often have bases in Nepal.        
	Indias major problem is that very little is known about the Maoists in the corridors of power in New Delhi. Without any idea of the thought processes of the parties on the other side of the border, New Delhi may find itself in a tight spot during negotiations in the coming days. In the past, the offices of the CPI(M) leader, Sitaram Yechury, had been used by the Manmohan Singh government in case of deals with Nepal but now the situation has changed. Yet a peep into the minds of Prachanda and Baburam Bhattarai is essential for maintaining even a working relationship with Kathmandu.

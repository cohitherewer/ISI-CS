	Poor analysis                  
	Sir In Vulnerable, but united, (Oct 26) Githa Hariharan laments the lack of basic amenities for poor Muslim women. However, it is not just the Muslims who suffer on account of lack of drinking water, electricity or education. The poor in India, irrespective of their religious affiliation, are discriminated against when it comes to the distribution of resources. Poverty does not have a religion, so it makes better sense to discuss ways to alleviate it by looking at the poor as a class and not on the basis of their faiths.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 
        
	Hail the king          
	Sir  The Battle of Bonn finally ended with a decisive win for Indias Viswanathan Anand who succeeded in defending his world chess title. Anand showed his class by beating his opponent, Vladimir Kramnik, in a comprehensive manner. This win establishes Anand as the undisputed leader of the chess world as he has won all the major championships in all formats of the game.           
	Anands career spans more than two decades. In this time, he has displayed exemplary courage and resilience on a number of occasions: he nearly matched the brilliant Garri Kasparov in New York, in 1995, played a marathon tournament against Anatoly Karpov at Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1998, and has now beaten the temperamental Kramnik in Bonn. Finally, he has ended the reign of the Ks in the world of chess.          
	Years ago, when Anand attended a tournament in Reggio Emilia in Italy, a Russian grandmaster reportedly commented that he could never be a champion as he had not modelled himself on the Soviet-school chess-players. Little did he realize that the bespectacled young man would revolutionize the game in his country and win accolades all over the world. Chess, as we all know, is considered a cerebral game, Anand fired the imagination of a new generation of Indians, inspiring them to take up chess as a career.           
	A remarkable aspect to Anands personality is his humility. This trait has enabled him to stay grounded despite crossing many a milestone. The victory over Kramnik has added one more feather on the cap of this champion chess player from India.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Yasmin Banu, Abu Dhabi, UAE 

      
	Sir  Viswanathan Anand has done it again. In a country besotted with cricket, Anand has proved his calibre by holding his own against the pampered cricketers, and by winning major tournaments such as the world chess title three times. What is truly amazing about Anands achievement is the fact that he has scaled one peak after another in chess with the help of hard work and his dedication. Anands achievement is doubly creditable, because he has achieved glory for himself and his country in spite of the step-motherly treatment that is meted out to chess in India.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

                
	Sir  After drawing the penultimate game against his Russian opponent in 24 moves, Viswanathan Anand became the world chess champion. Those hailing from southern India are considered disciplined and industrious. Anand has both these qualities, and is supremely intelligent as well. These attributes have played pivotal roles in his life and helped him to become the first Indian to win the world title for the third time .           
	It is a pity that cricket-mad India neglects most other games, including chess. Anands achievement will definitely draw the attention of young men and women to chess. They must take lessons from Anands perseverance, power of concentration and skill.           
	Yours faithfully,         A. Bhattacharya, Calcutta

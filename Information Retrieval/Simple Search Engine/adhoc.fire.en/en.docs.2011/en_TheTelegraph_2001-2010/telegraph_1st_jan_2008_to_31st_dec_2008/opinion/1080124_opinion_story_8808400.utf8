	Sweetest victory
         
	Sir  The Indian cricket team won an important Test match in Perth (Perth-breaking, Jan 20). The victory was the result of teamwork, determination and strategy. Steve Bucknors removal had made the umpires in Perth overcautious. In fact, some of the decisions of Asad Rauf and Billy Bowden, the two umpires, perhaps favoured India unjustly. The Australians should be praised for their reticence after the turning down of two confident appeals against Sachin Tendulkar. Neither did the Aussies protest against Michael Hussey and Andrew Symonds being declared out, at a very critical stage, even when Hawk-Eye showed them to be not so. They might have turned the tide of the match. Had these two decisions gone against India, our cry babies would probably have packed their bags and returned home. Besides, while praising Anil Kumble and his boys, former Indian cricketers conveniently forgot Sourav Gangulys team that had beaten a stronger Australian side Steve Waugh.
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Indias victory in Perth is all the sweeter for the element of poetic justice in it and for the fact that it put an end to Australias enviable string of Test victories. Without taking away from Indias achievement, it can be said that the psychological blow received by the Aussies after the Sydney Test contributed to their defeat. Sportsmen the world over should learn a lesson from Australias humiliation and, henceforth, compete in the right sporting spirit. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Indias victory showed how well the team has come up under Anil Kumble. The Indians erased Ricky Pontings confident smile. Kumbles tactics and the aggressive swing bowling did the trick. The match also proved that, apart from being masters of spin bowling, Indians today can match the fast bowlers of Australia.
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  This is the second time Indians have frustrated the Australians attempt at creating a record of consecutive Test wins. The last time was in India, while this time, Indias feat came in Australia, where conditions were favourable for the Aussie fast bowlers. Ricky Pontings attempts to go past the previous Australian record by hook or by crook only resulted in drawing attention to his underhand means. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
S. Pattanayak, Bhubaneswar

        
	Sir  I was in favour of the Indian team returning home after the Sydney fiasco. But the Perth victory has pleasantly proved me wrong. The decision to remain in Australia was wise. Indias win is also a slap on Ricky Pontings face. Everybody knows now that India would have won the Sydney Test too had it not been for Pontings tricks and the umpiring glitches. 
     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  After Perth, people will say that the Australians cannot be world champions if they are asked to be decent on the field. The Indians bettered them the moment the Australians were forcibly restrained. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
Ashim Choudhury, Calcutta

        
	Sir  While the Perth victory is laudable, one must only give the Indian success its due and no more than that. For Australians, winning is a matter of habit and, therefore, they hardly go overboard after a victory. For India, on the other hand, a Test victory abroad is rare. Thus, we rank below the Aussies in international cricket ratings even after this win. In any case, winning a match in a sport played by a handful of countries is not the same as winning a gold medal at the Olympics. Indias inability to produce world-class teams in sports other than cricket requires greater public attention. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
N.S. Venkataraman, Chennai

        
	Sir  Anil Kumble has branded the win in Perth one of the best of his career  a mature and measured comment from a great cricketer. However, Sunil Gavaskar got carried away and declared that this was the greatest achievement for Indian cricket in 40 years. But how could Perth rank above the victory at Eden Gardens on March 15, 2001? The Australians were on a 16-match winning streak then too, they had whitewashed India 3-0 the previous year, they were leading the series 1-0 with a 10-wicket win in Mumbai, and they had enforced a follow-on in Calcutta. In the 1,534 Tests played till then, there had been only two instances of a team winning a Test match after being made to follow on. And a defeat at the Eden Gardens would have cost India the series too. The rest is history  V.V.S. Laxman produced one of the greatest innings ever played, Harbhajan Singh devastated the Australian batting and the team fought together to register one of the greatest victories in the history of cricket. They also went on to win the series 2-1. We need to look back with pride at that memorable match played less than seven years ago. It was Indias best Test victory, whether at home or abroad. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
P.B. Lahiri, Calcutta

        
	Sir  Some experts have attributed Indias victory to the acrimony carried over from Sydney. But why must we always depend on extraneous causes to motivate ourselves? It is time Indians stopped choking and went about winning matches like professionals. 
     
	Yours faithfully,
   
S. Chatkhandi, Calcutta

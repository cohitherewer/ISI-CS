	Back of the class                  
	Sir  The report, Business in Bengal time trap (June 24), accurately points out the real position of the industrial endeavour in West Bengal. In this connection, I would like to mention my personal experience in the state of Goa where I was associated with the setting up of a production unit of a Bengal-based company (then multi-national). It would make for a good comparative analysis of the viability of industry in the two states. In Goa, inquiries about the availability of land were promptly and cordially answered. It took about two months for us to make our final decision on the choice of location. The registration of the property was completed in three days. When we changed our choice of industrial estate for another that had better facilities, the amended registration took only three hours. The procedure of payment and signing of documents were also smooth and hassle-free. Electrical connections were all installed within two months. This was in stark contrast to our bitter experience in Bengal. One wishes Bengal would follow the Goa model of efficiency to attract industry to the state.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S.K. Ray, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The report on the number of days taken by different states to clear business proposals gave a good picture of why West Bengal is lagging behind states like Karnataka, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh in attracting industry. Political agitation is a very obvious cause of the delay in West Bengal. However, I feel that the comparison of Total Days among different states in the accompanying graphic is not fair. That is because applications for some of these, say, construction approvals, power supply, water and sewage, pollution clearance, could, in principle, have been made simultaneously. The concerned business group need not wait to get clearance of one to apply for the next. For example, if clearance application for power supply in Bengal (45 days) is filed on the very next day after filing the same for water and sewage (30 days), the actual number of days required for both of these together comes out to be 46 (and not 75). Therefore, for the overall comparison, it would have been better if the item that took the maximum number of days to get clearance was used. For a more realistic estimate, different tasks might have been divided into different stages and their simultaneity taken into account while deriving the figures.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Telegraphs expos of West Bengals dismal industrialization scene was shocking. Following from the archaic legislations of the regime of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) patriarch, Jyoti Basu, on the use of land, the present government, headed by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has jumped headlong into rapid industrialization that often takes the form of political turbulence. Except strikes, bandhs and gheraos, there was nothing in the states industrial platter during three decades of Left rule. Political interference and red-tapism are other hazards impeding industrialization here. While all the states are vying with one another to attract investment, there is an inexplicable lethargy in the commerce and industry ministry here. Industrialists cannot be expected to move from door to door to obtain clearance to set up business and generate employment and revenue within the state. That property acquisition and registration in Gujarat takes a single day, whereas in Bengal it takes 105 days is not a fact that will encourage real estate developers. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government should take a reality check.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Much-loved man of war          
	Sir  Field Marshal Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Bahadur Manekshaw, Indias iconic army man, is no more (Charming, Sam could call a spade a spade, June 28). His demise is a great loss for the country, as he was a role model for defence personnel in India. His death is to be mourned not only by Indians but by Bangladeshis too, who are indebted to him for the creation of their nation. Bangladesh should remember that it was under this great warrior that the Indian army defeated Pakistan in less than 15 days, and paved the way for the creation of the new nation. This victory broke the record of the German Blitzkrieg in the Battle of France during World War II. Although he was honoured as the first Field Marshal in post-Independence India, the government should have awarded him the Bharat Ratna for his honesty, valour, leadership and the shrewd strategies that helped him win battles.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  It is not only surprising but also shocking that the countrys first Field Marshal and a 1971 war hero, Sam Manekshaw, was laid to rest without the defence minister, army chiefs, or any important political leader attending the event (Nation mourns 71 war hero, June 28). Shouldnt the president of India, as the supreme commander of the armed forces, have been present, along with the service chiefs?           
	Manekshaw was the first of only two Indian military officers to hold the highest rank of Field Marshal of the Indian army (the other being Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa). A shrewd tactician, Manekshaw meticulously planned the Indian attack on Pakistan on both fronts  East and West. While the Indian forces captured the then East Pakistan in the eastern sector, they made heavy inroads in the western sector too, going up to Lahore. Adopting a mature war strategy, he masterminded the rout of the Pakistan army in one of the quickest victories in recent military history, and liberated Bangladesh.           
	Is this the way to show respect to our outstanding war heroes? Had ours been a developed country in the West, both the prime minister and the president would have attended the Field Marshals funeral. It seems that we have lost the right to demand respect from serving soldiers during war and peace.                     
	Yours faithfully,

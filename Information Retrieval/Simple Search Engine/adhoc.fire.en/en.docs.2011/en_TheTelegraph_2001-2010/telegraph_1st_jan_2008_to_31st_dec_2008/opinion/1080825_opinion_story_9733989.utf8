	Cynicism and hypocrisy are always part of international politics, but in the case of Poland and the anti-ballistic missile, everybody is over-fulfilling their norm. Nobody involved in the controversy  Polish, Russian or American  believes a single word that is being said about this misbegotten missile defence system, whose principal characteristic is that it doesnt work  it never has, and probably never will.         
	Washington insists that the ABMs are being put into Poland to protect the United States of America and its allies from Irans long-range ballistic missiles (which do not exist) tipped with nuclear warheads (which Iran doesnt have either). Yet, after months since US-Polish talks on the subject were stalled, suddenly last week Warsaw agreed to provide a base for the missile defence system  because it would infuriate the Russians.        
	The Poles, who are anxious about Russias intentions in the light of recent events in Georgia, want to send a signal of defiance to Moscow and get a permanent American military base of some kind on their soil. Theyre not worried about non-existent Iranian missiles  and if they do occasionally worry about very real Russian missiles, they are not so foolish as to believe that this American missile defence system would actually protect them. It doesnt work. So why are the Russians so upset about all this? Dont they know these dont work?        
	Of course they do, but the Russian military needs a dramatic foreign threat to justify its demands on Russias resources, and for that purely political purpose the American missiles work fine. Russian strategists claim that this system is actually intended to shoot down Russian ballistic missiles, and so undermine Russias ability to deter an American attack by destroying its ability to strike back.        
	Even if the American ABMs did work, ten launchers on Polands Baltic coast are not going to make much difference given Russias 848 long-range ballistic missiles, including hundreds that can be launched from submarines that are much closer to the US than to the interceptors in Poland. The Russians are only pretending to be worried about the ABMs in Poland, although they are seriously annoyed by US military bases there.                
	Fantasy strategy        
	The new American missile defence base in Poland gives all the interested parties a way to make their political points, while having no serious strategic importance whatsoever. But why has the US spent $120-$150 billion on this ludicrous white elephant of a system since Ronald Reagan first launched the Star Wars project in 1983? Precisely because ever since 1983, the missile defence project has provided American politicians with the opportunity to pour huge amounts of money into the defence industry, in return for much smaller but politically vital campaign contributions. The technology can never be made cost-effective, but the project is impossible to kill because so many politicians benefit from it.        
	It will always be ten to a hundred times cheaper to evade the ABM defences by adding decoys and other penetration aids to the incoming warheads, than it is to upgrade the performance of the interceptors. That performance, after a quarter-centurys work, is so poor that only two out of the last five tests worked. And those tests are rigged in the ABM systems favour, with the defenders knowing the incoming missiles type, trajectory and destination. In more recent tests, they have used no decoys at all in an attempt to get the hit rate up. Yet they have deployed the system anyway, first in Alaska and now in Poland.        
	This is fantasy strategy in the service of the military-industrial complex, and no strategist in the know takes it seriously. But it does allow the owner to make quite impressive symbolic gestures, albeit rather expensive ones.

	Faith on sale                  
	Sir  In his article, An alien possession, (Oct 9), Mukul Kesavan displays an irrational antagonism against Hindu organizations like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. His prejudice causes him to give a lop-sided explanation of the present Hindu-Christian conflict in Orissas Kandhamal district.           
	India is home to people of various faiths, and its secular fabric can survive only if the various religious communities make a constant effort to maintain goodwill among themselves. Since Independence, Indias Christians and Muslims have done little to uphold the secular edifice of our country. While Muslims in general do not seem to believe in the concept of a secular nation at all, the ideals of Christianity have been eroded in India after the British left. The converted Christians of India lacked almost every quality of the white missionaries: for instance, their knowledge, tolerance, courage and unbiased attitude can in no way be compared to those displayed by missionaries of yore. In a bid to carve out a niche for themselves, Indian Christian missionaries have maligned the customs and festivals of Hindus. This has resulted in the creation of animosity between the practitioners of these faiths. This is the chief reason behind the violence that has broken out in Orissa.          
	In Kandhamal, the Church first tried to convert the Kandhs but failed because the time-tested traditions of the community proved too strong to be replaced. So the Christians then turned to the socially weaker Panos, taking for granted that the Hindus in the region would not object. Once the Christians had the Panos in their fold, the community started denigrating the Hindus. While the conversion of ignorant people with the lure of aid and education is acceptable, the vilification of Hinduism in the process cannot be tolerated.          
	While the violence against minorities and the destruction of their property cannot be condoned under any circumstances, it also needs to be asked why a predominantly Christian Nagaland and a predominantly Muslim Kashmir often flaunt secessionist attitudes. Hindus cannot be expected to preach and practise tolerance when other religious communities are keen on engaging in violence at the drop of a hat.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur 

                
	Sir  Mukul Kesavan perhaps needs to find out why Christian missionaries are usually most active in the poorest regions of India only. These men and women arent selfless messiahs. They target the poor and the deprived, who cannot stand up for their rights, and convert them by offering various inducements. Such conversions under duress are creating conflicts not only within various communities but also within the extended family. If someone is to be blamed for the situation, it is the Central and state governments, which have failed to eradicate poverty even after 60 years of Independence. Unless the living standards of the poor are improved, violent outbreaks such as the one in Kandhamal will recur.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.N. Mahanty, Puri 

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  More than 40 years ago, I had to make a momentous choice  to change my Bengali surname to a north Indian one. I was loath to surrender the identity I was justifiably proud of. I wanted everyone to know that I belonged to that elite group known as Bengali. Today, living in a Bengal that is taking one regressive step after another, I am not sorry for what I did. I no longer wish to be counted among members of a society that creates Frankensteins, such as the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Trinamul Congress, that manipulate an ignorant electorate for petty political gains.           
	I am ashamed that we continue to tolerate, support, and even encourage, mindless political exploitation which seems to go on for years; that our educated, talented young men and women have to migrate to other cities  Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai  or go abroad to earn a better living and prosper; that we consider actors, producers and others from the entertainment world to tell us what to think and do; that we define and measure the countrys prosperity and progress by counting the number of shopping malls and restaurants that have come up in our cities: that Shah Rukh Khan comes down from Mumbai to drum up enthusiasm for Durga Puja and culture conscious  Bengalis enjoy themselves dancing to popular Hindi songs in the immersion processions of the goddess.           
	I am sure that my views will unleash a torrent of protests: we are very good at protesting, and so it should be. But it wouldnt hurt if we indulge in a bit of introspection and ask ourselves what Bengalis in Bengal have come to signify these days.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Iti Misra, Calcutta

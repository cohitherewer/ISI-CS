	The decision by the Nuclear Suppliers Group to exempt India from full-scope safeguards as a condition for nuclear cooperation is indubitably one of the most significant foreign policy achievements of the Manmohan Singh government. The decision should help end more than 30 years of nuclear isolation, technology denial and bring about a de facto recognition of Indias status as a country with nuclear weapons. The decision  read with the text of the US-India 123 Agreement and the understanding with the International Atomic Energy Agency is an acceptance of India as a rising power and the need to accommodate it on the high table of international politics.         
	The NSG is a heterogeneous group of states driven by different stakes. During the nerve-racking negotiations in Vienna, it became clear that at least a few states were opposed to the waiver because of pressure from the nuclear-proliferation lobby and domestic constituencies. It goes to the credit of the United States of America and its negotiating team that they backed India to the hilt. Indeed, President George W. Bush personally spoke to several leaders in order to emphasize the importance of the decision. The negotiations also brought to the fore classic Chinese doublespeak. Clearly, Beijing, in the run-up to the negotiations, had hoped that other states would block the deal and, therefore, disingenuously signalled to India its support. At Vienna, however, Beijing openly expressed reservations about the waiver once most other countries had fallen in line. It was only the combined pressure of the US and India, at the highest level, that made China relent. The Chinese behaviour in Vienna should be a lesson for those still hoping to revive the spirit of Hindi-Chini bhai bhai.         
	Contrarians in India have suggested that New Delhi, in Vienna, has forsaken its right to test nuclear weapons in the future. This is, however, far from the truth. Admittedly, there will be a price to pay if India tests in paramount nuclear interest. But this is a price that would have to be paid in any case, deal or no deal. Moreover, after Pokhran II, India unilaterally and voluntarily declared a moratorium on testing. And no nuclear scientist of any credibility has suggested the need to test again in the foreseeable future. It may, however, be too much to hope that the opposition parties will stop queering the pitch and generously hail Indias victory. But in larger terms, the events in Vienna should give India confidence in itself. The challenge, however, is also how to use this confidence to assert, with greater vigour than before, Indias presence in the international system.

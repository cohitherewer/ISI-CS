                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SALVE FOR THE SORE HEART                                  This Above All - Khushwant Singh                          Keeping it simple                                        
	I read sacred texts of different religions because most of them have passages of great literary merit. Since I cannot read Sanskrit or Arabic, I read the works translated into English. Translations rarely catch the music of the words and I sense I miss a great deal, which those who know the languages of the original texts enjoy in full measure. I have less difficulty with the compilations of the Sikh scriptures as they are closer to Punjabi spoken today. Perforce my concentration is on the Bible: though translated from Hebrew and perhaps Latin, it has been polished by successions of scholars. Both the Old and the New Testament have passages of linguistic excellence that have become an integral part of European languages spoken today. Among the many passages that most Christians know by heart is the Sermon on the Mount found in the Gospel of St Matthew, usually known as the Beatitudes or Blessings. I refer to it because one Indian Christian friend living in England and editing a journal wants my views as an agnostic on the subject.        
	First, the Sermon, for those who do not know what it is: Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousnesss sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manners of evil against you falsely for my sake.        
	Note the utterly simple language shorn of literary conceits. The strength of the Sermon lies in its simplicity and directness. The message goes straight into readers hearts and stays there forever. In this context, the word blessed does not mean one who is blessed with good luck but one who is in need of solace.         
	One should keep in mind that the message of the Sermon is different from that of the Commandments, which spell out a code of conduct  what we should or should not do: dont lie, thieve, covert anothers property, commit adultery  and so on. But the Sermon is an assurance that those who suffer will, by Gods grace, be comforted.         
	Listed among the sufferers are the poor in spirit, those in mourning, the meek, the hungry, victims of wickedness, the merciful, restorers of peace among people at variance with each other, and those who suffer for their faith in their messiahs teachings  the teaching of Jesus Christ in the case of Christians and in the case of others, the founders of their religion. The Sermon need not be read as an exclusively Christian text. The main difference between the Commandments and the Sermons is that while one is the rod of correction, a danda for those who stray from the path of rectitude, the other is a salve, a malham to soothe those who are hurt.                
	A sight to dream of                
	Many years ago, I happened to be on the panel of three judges in an all India beauty contest. Entrants were required to be in bathing costumes and have their vital measurements  the size of breast and waist  taken and announced in front of a large audience. Some of the girls were reluctant to do so and so opted out. Now I see similar contests on television with girls appearing in two-piece costumes. I was intrigued by the fact that these two strips of cloth together is known as the bikini. Why?        
	Bikini is the name of an atoll in the Pacific in which the United States of America tested the efficacy of the first atom bomb in 1946. The effect was devastating. The year following, girls were seen strolling along the French Rivera in two-piece costumes. The effect on the spectators was equally mind-boggling. No one really knows if there is any connection between the two but from France, the world bikini gained worldwide acceptance for a two-piece bathing costume. Now beauty pageant judges have become more demanding and require contestants to remove the upper half of the costume as well for a bra can conceal the real shape of breasts. So now we have a new word for the one-piece female loin cloth. It is called the mono-mini  the western version of the female langotee.                 
	What is love?                
	Lovers of Urdu poetry, even with scanty knowledge of the language, will know this couplet of Asadullah Khan Ghalib on the unpredictability and the power of Love:                
	Ishq par zor naheen, hai yeh voh        
	aatish Ghalib        
	Ke lagaae na lagey, aur bujhaaye        
	na baney                
	One afternoon, having nothing better to do, I translated it into English:                
	There is no power above love,        
	Nor do we know what it is about;        
	It is like a raging fire, O Ghalib;        
	When you want to light it,        
	It refuses to ignite;        
	When you want to end it,        
	It refuses to be put out.

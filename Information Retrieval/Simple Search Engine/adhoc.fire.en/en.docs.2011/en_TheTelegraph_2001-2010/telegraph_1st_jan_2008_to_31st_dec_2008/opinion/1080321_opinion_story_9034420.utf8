	Up in flames                  
	Sir  The unrest in Tibet is a cause for concern (Simmering anger led to Tibetan backlash, Mar 19). The people of Tibet have every right to protest against Chinas occupation of their country. But their protests are likely to invite an even harsher reprisal from China. What is surprising is that the Dalai Lama is still talking of greater autonomy at a time when his own people are dying for the cause of their nations independence. For nearly five decades now, the Dalai Lama has been enjoying Indian hospitality. He has done precious little to free his country from China during his stay here. Now, after all these years, it will be difficult for him and his followers to wrest control of Tibet from the Chinese.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Goa 

                
	Sir  The United States of Americas silence on Chinese atrocities in Tibet is baffling. Isnt the US supposedly the protector of weak and oppressed nations? China invaded Tibet in 1949. But the international communitys failure to force the Chinese to free Tibet has meant that it remains an occupied territory even today. The Dalai Lama fled his country with some of his followers and took refuge in India. But other Tibetans were not as lucky, and suffered terribly under China.           
	China, today, is a member of the United Nations, and even has a permanent seat in the powerful security council. Therefore, China will not find it easy to ignore the international communitys demand to free Tibet. The US, on behalf of other nations, should force China to withdraw from Tibet. The Dalai Lama and other Tibetans in India would then be able to return to Tibet after a long exile.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                
	Sir  The Communist Party of India (Marxist) declined to comment on the uprising in Tibet, saying that it is Chinas internal matter(CPM plays down clashes, Mar 18). Since when have the Marxists decided not to take an interest in internal matters of other countries? Only the other day, Sitaram Yechury visited Kathmandu to hold parleys with Nepals communists about the situation in that country. The Marxist line on the recent Tibet crisis is riddled with loopholes. When human rights are violated in any part of the world, an internal matter often turns into an international issue. The world should not follow the example set by the Indian Left. Instead, other countries should come together and call for sanctions against China for its crimes in Tibet.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Tibetans are a peace-loving people who have been ill-treated by the Chinese. China should now grant some freedom to Tibet in the same way in which it awarded autonomy to Hong Kong a few years back. But it is doubtful whether China would be able to hold on to Tibet with the help of brute force. After the recent protests in Lhasa, Tibetans will start receiving more support from the international community, making it impossible for the Chinese to occupy Tibet for long. But given Chinas past record in Tibet, the violence is bound to rise in that country. The bloodshed might, in fact, cast a shadow on the Beijing Olympics. But whether this forces the Chinese to make peace with the people of Tibet remains to be seen.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The riots in Tibet will deal a death blow to Chinas aspirations of emerging as the next superpower. Significantly, the Tibetan youth seem no longer enamoured of the Dalai Lamas doctrine of Middle way (Young waver on Dalai way, Mar 17). Unlike the Dalai Lama who wants greater autonomy for Tibet, the people in Tibet are demanding independence from their oppressors. This in itself signifies the changing mindset of the youth. The Dalai Lama, keeping in mind his peoples sentiments, should now adopt a harder stance against China.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Saurabh Sharma, Liluah

                
	Sir  The people of Tibet were waiting for an opportune moment to give vent to their anger against China. And one must say that they got the timing of the protest absolutely right. At a time when China is busy preparing for the forthcoming Olympics, the unrest in Lhasa will invariably fix the worlds attention on Tibet. This might even generate global support for Tibets demand for independence.           
	It is a pity that very few countries seem to be genuinely interested in freeing Tibet from Chinese rule. Even India, which has given shelter to the Dalai Lama as well as the Tibetan government in exile, has accepted Tibet as Chinese territory. Some might point out that India cannot afford to offend China, given Chinas growing clout in international affairs. But, at the same time, India should not turn its back on Tibet. Our country needs to stand by Tibetans and help them make their dream of winning freedom come true.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot           
	Sir  The report, Welcome to Friday confluence (Mar 20), points out that Friday, March 21, is special for Hindus, Muslims as well as for Christians. But what it does not mention is the fact that even the Parsis will be celebrating Jamshedi Navroze on the same day. The Parsis may be smaller than the other three communities that have been mentioned in the report in terms of numbers. But what we lack in numbers has been compensated by the meaningful contributions that have been made by members of our community.           
	The Parsis are very much an integral part of the country and take pride in being Indian. Therefore, it is surprising to find that while the report says a lot of things about religion, and about three specific faiths in particular, there is no mention in it of a festival of the Parsis, who are followers of one of the oldest religions in the world.                     
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | pining for Mr pyne
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       PINING FOR MR PYNE                                                          
	What unites, and divides, Sourav Ganguly and Ganesh Pyne? They are both Bengali; and the former topped while the latter ranked last in the CNN-IBN amp; The Telegraph Bengali Number One poll. The list is scandalously entertaining, with 59.15 per cent voting for Mr Ganguly as the Greatest Living Bengali, followed by Rani Mukherjee at 38.92 per cent. The rest did not even make it past the decimal point. So, there is Amartya Sen in third place with only 0.61 per cent of the votes, and the abyss yawns wider with music, literature and painting, until one finds Mr Pyne down where all the ladders start, with 0.1 per cent of the voters going for him and Jhumpa Lahiri for company (though a notch above him).        
	It is only when a poll like this is not taken seriously at all that its results begin to appear interesting. For instance, what if one stands the list on its head? Isnt there a way of arguing that those who feel Mr Pyne is the greatest living Bengali are precisely the sort of people who would never bother to reach for their phones and vote? It would therefore be terribly distinguished to be valued by that 0.1 per cent  a mark of election that one might naturally associate with an artist of Mr Pynes distinction. What the list brings out, then, are two different kinds of greatness at the two opposite ends of the spectrum. Mr Gangulys (or Ms Mukherjees) is a greatness measured by popularity, while Mr Pyne wins on exclusivity. Taking ones shirt off at Lords and painting the Boatman series are surely two vastly different kinds of performance  although Mr Gangulys achievements can, on no account, be reduced to that historic act of subversive exultation.        
	What if such a poll had been conducted in, say, Maharashtra, and the results put Sachin Tendulkar at the top and Vijay Tendulkar at the bottom? Would cultured Maharashtrians despair at these results with the same sense of doom as their Bengali counterparts? What is it about Bengal that prompts such a reaction when the fine arts lose out to the more popular ones? Why does it begin to look like a Culture in Crisis? Perhaps this has something to do with the nature of Bengali self-definition, and hence, self-esteem. And the genteel arts, rather than the rowdier forms of success, are what this cherished Bengaliness should be all about. Such a sense of cultural identity is likely to receive its greatest jolt when asked to redefine itself in terms of sporty aggressiveness or husky-voiced sirenhood, being instinctively more comfortable with Nobels and novellas.         
	No chasm separates the two Tendulkars in their own state. There are those who know the cricketer, and those who know the playwright  and the two sets are unruffled by their differences from each other. But in Bengal, a lot more is at stake in that difference: Mr Ganguly above Mr Pyne turns the world upside down.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Why we call this Friday good
                                                                                                                 WHY WE CALL THIS FRIDAY GOOD                                  March 21 is Holi, Fateha-e-Dwaz Daham and Good Friday. What better occasion for a new look at religion and life? asks Shams Afif Siddiqi                                            
	I am delighted to know that three great religious festivals  Fateha-e-Dwaz Daham, Good Friday and Holi  are going to be celebrated on the same day tomorrow. I do not know what excitement it will create in the rest of the country, but being a Calcuttan all my life, I expect my city to be excited by this coincidence. For Calcuttans are like that  emotional, catholic and ready to go an extra mile to see whats happening on the other side of the fence.         
	Brought up on the Quranic verse, Lakum di nokum wale ya din (For you, your religion, for me, mine), I have memories of enjoying Good Friday, and although I never got drenched in the beautiful colours of Holi as a child, I loved to see others playing with the coloured water in among our lanes and bylanes, secretly wishing to be a part of it. Fateha-e-Dwaz Daham, is actually the birthday of Prophet Mohammad. Do-Yaaz Daham, or the 12th in Persian, refers to the 12th day of Rabiul Awal, the third month in the Islamic calendar in the year 570 AD in which the Prophet was born in Mecca.         
	Since my childhood, Fateha-e-Dwaz Daham has been associated with delicious food and sweets. We would look forward to having the time of ones life, in spite of the few minutes of Fateha, or short prayer, in which some elders (not necessarily a maulvi) incanted verses from the Quran. We sat in a semicircle, and stared at the mouth-watering ladoos and baloo shahis, and at the hot, smoking zardas. I also waited all year for the new clothes, shoes and fez caps. My family was one of the earliest to settle in Calcutta, when the CIT Road area was a jungle infested with dacoits. So from my childhood days, I have been part of these celebrations. Halwais or the sweet shop owners would spread out their wares almost on the thoroughfares and shout out their trade cry to allure customers. Thousands of schoolchildren joined in the processions taken out from all nooks and corners of the city. Non-Muslims would also join in, as they would even now.         
	Festivals are, indeed, occasions in which different communities get a chance to know one another better. The problem in the city as well as in the districts is that even sixty years after Independence, Muslims and Hindus live segregated in their respective areas. Christians seem to feel comfortable living in Muslim-dominated areas. It is a fact that the beliefs, food habits and, to some extent, the dress code of the Muslims are different from the those of the Hindus. But that should not make people live in fortified castles of their own. Today, a generally conservative country like the United Kingdom is thinking of making some Shariat rules part of its legal system. Even the United States of America is opening up to the idea of a multi-religious and multi-cultural society.         
	Yet we continue to live in islands of our own. Some sort of hesitation in the people may be responsible for this, but if the trend is slowly reversed and the two communities started living together, much misunderstanding can be cleared.         
	Some years ago, my mother, an upcountry lady who usually does not venture out on her own, had to hire a taxi to take our grocers pregnant wife to hospital, for the grocer or any male members of our own family was not at home. At the hospital, she signed the official form as the womans guardian. When the curious official asked how my mother could be thus related to a Hindu woman, my mother, who is a very firm woman, became furious at such a thoughtless question. The official felt duly ashamed and our grocers poor wife was rushed into the operation theatre. My mother waited outside until she got the happy news of a boy being born. He is now married and lives happily with a small family.         
	I have worked in many parts of West Bengal, with members of other communities as colleagues. But I have never, for a moment, felt that I was different from the others  because they have never made me feel so. Such is the power of living and working together.         
	Today I do not like sweets, and new clothes do not interest me any more. Yet I still wait every year for this happy occasion of Fateha-e-Dwaz Daham because it renews my love and respect for one who is referred to as a mercy for all mankind. But this particular instance of the three festivals coming together, makes it a day for reflection and some hard thinking. Each festival celebrates, in its own way, the beginning or renewal of life. What better occasion, then, to contemplate the birth of a new way of life through a change in our mindset? For, as they say, the taste of life lies in its diversity.

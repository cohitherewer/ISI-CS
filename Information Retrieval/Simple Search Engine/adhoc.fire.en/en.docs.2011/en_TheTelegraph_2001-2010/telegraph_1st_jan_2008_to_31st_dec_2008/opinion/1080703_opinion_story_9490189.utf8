	So Nepal is no longer a kingdom. King Gyanendra is out, the Narayanhiti palace has been converted into a museum , people have danced once again on the streets of Kathmandu. Euphoria, however, does not last long, and it will not in Nepal. Perhaps there it will die sooner than expected for the mandate was not just for ending the rule of the palace, it was for governance in a democratic manner. Will Nepal, crying out for long for succour, see that happening? The present indications are a bit disturbing.         
	The Maoists are a problem. They have the largest number of seats in the constituent assembly but they do not enjoy absolute majority. They will have to work in tandem with others to draw up a new constitution and, more importantly, to give the country a taste of what proper administration is. The wranglings over who will be the first president raise serious doubts about the future. The problems, particularly in the countryside, are huge and many. Rural Nepal lacks even the minimum facilities needed for survival. For now and the days to come, bickering among three major political forces can only hamper that work and, what is more serious, can lead people to ask whether the old order has really changed. The various photographs of Pushpa Kamal Dahal or Prachanda, heavily garlanded and beaming, are all pleasing to watch, but at the ground level is there much to be happy about? Already Prachanda seems to be having differences with Baburam Bhattarai, the latter reportedly stopping the former from agreeing with the Nepali Congresss demand that Girija Prasad Koirala be made the president. The Maoist argument that the veteran leader is too old does not carry much conviction, since the office is more ornamental than effective. If the Maoists stick to their stand, then their journey to a new future will begin on a bitter note. The Nepali Congress has fought many battles with the royalty, has a definite support base and Koirala is not exactly a discredited politician.                 
	Beyond self-interest        
	Prachanda, Bhattarai and their comrades need a change in their mindset. They must realize that they have not won an armed struggle. The power they have secured was won through the ballot and the victory came at the end of a movement in which the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (united Marxist-Leninist) were co-sharers. The outcome demands collective functioning at least during the tenure of the present house. Unfortunately, democratic functioning is a concept alien to a party, which for years has been taught that power flows only from the barrel of a gun. This training would have appeared valid if the attempted revolution in Nepal had succeeded. It did not because the Maoist leaders themselves realized that it will not.        
	The Maoist leadership in Nepal is not inexperienced. The leaders must be aware that the situation demands that they go along with the others. But to what extent will they be able to carry their cadre along with them? They can accept a life without arms only when they are presented with a way of life in which sustenance does not depend on causing fear. In a country that has never known what development is, this will take time and the delay might make the former guerrillas impatient. If the action of the leadership is marked by intransigence, it may be interpreted as a message to return to arms. This may well become a reality if the other, more contentious, issue of integrating the peoples revolutionary army with the regular military is not resolved to the Maoists satisfaction.        
	Experiments with even limited democracy had failed earlier in Nepal and the palace had intervened. This time there is no mediator. Prachanda and his comrades must realize the implications of this even as they continue to think about their own constituency rather than the society as a whole.

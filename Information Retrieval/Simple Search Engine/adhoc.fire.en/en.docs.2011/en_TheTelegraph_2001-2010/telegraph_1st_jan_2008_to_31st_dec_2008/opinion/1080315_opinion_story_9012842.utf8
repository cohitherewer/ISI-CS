	Retirement blues                  
	Sir  Poor Oliver Kahn. To think that this great German goalkeeper would have to bid adieu to the game after playing against an Indian club is simply preposterous (Chance for Calcutta to bid Oliver Kahn farewell, March 13). Kahn surely deserved to be sent off in style, considering his contributions to German football. Instead of playing a top European or Latin American club, Kahn will be under the bar for the last time against minnows Mohun Bagan. His only consolation is that he wouldnt have to do much in his final appearance.

	Blood on sand          
	Sir  The police in Goa have claimed that Scarlett Keeling was first raped and then left to die by a barman called Samson D Souza. (Scarlett left to die after rape: Cops, March 14). However, the fact that this brutal murder had to be uncovered by her mother, Fiona Mackeown, in the first place shows how corrupt the Indian police have become. If this is how policemen in India treat foreigners, one can imagine how they would behave with their own countrymen. There is no denying that the evil nexus between politicians and lawkeepers has stripped the force of values such as honesty and impartiality. This, coupled with an acute shortage of judges, has meant that Indian citizens are often denied justice. The alarming rise in crimes against foreigners all over the country has dented Indias image as a safe tourist haven. Will the government sit up and take notice before its too late?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The mystery behind Scarlett Keelings killing has now been solved. Keelings mother still believes that the local police are trying to shield the real culprits. This might be true, considering the fact that the cops had first tried to pass off the murder as a case of drowning. They also accused Fiona Mackeown of neglecting her daughter who was a minor. But isnt it also the duty of the police to be extra vigilant when it comes to protecting teenagers, especially girls, in a country such as ours? The police also need to find out how drugs are being sold and bought openly on Goas beaches. The chief minister, Digambar Kamat, has not done the right thing by turning down Mackeowns request for a CBI inquiry into the case to find out the truth behind this tragedy.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The rape and murder of British teenager, Scarlett Keeling, on a Goa beach comes as a shock. Goa is no more a tourist paradise. With rape, murder and other crimes becoming common, it has now become a living hell. It is time the police in Goa put an end to the violence that has endangered the life of people and could, in fact, cripple tourism. The government too should work harder to maintain law and order in the state.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Fiona Mackeown must now be regretting her decision to leave her daughter behind in Goa while she visited Karnataka. Yet, that does not mean that the Goa administration has the right to blame Mackeown for negligence. After pointing fingers at the mother, the police are now claiming that they have solved the Keeling murder case. Even then, Mackeowns demand for a CBI probe into her daughters murder is absolutely justified. Only an impartial investigation by the CBI would help us know whether there was a cover-up. It is said that Indians look upon their guests as god. Keelings murder shows that the claim is just a figment of the imagination.                    
	Yours faithfully,

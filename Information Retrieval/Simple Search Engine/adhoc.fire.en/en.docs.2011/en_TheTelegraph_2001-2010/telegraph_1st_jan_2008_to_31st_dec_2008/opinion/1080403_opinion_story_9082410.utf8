                                                                                                               Letters to Editor
                
	Different voices                  
	Sir  The national football captain, Bhaichung Bhutia, has declined to participate in the Olympic torch relay as a mark of support for Tibet and its heroic people (Bhaichung leaves torch team, April 1). While Bhutias gesture is much appreciated, one cannot help but feel that he should have chosen other means to express his solidarity with Tibetans. The Olympic torch relay is a special event, which symbolizes the spirit of human perseverance. For sportsmen, it is considered a great honour to participate in the event. Bhutia certainly will regret his decision in the future.           
	But then, the Games have seldom been free of politics. The Berlin Olympics were controversial because of the presence of Hitler and his Nazi cronies. The United States of America and its allies pulled out of the Moscow Olympics in 1980. The Soviet bloc retaliated by shunning the Los Angeles Games four years later. Now, the Tibetans are using the forthcoming Olympics as a platform to attract the worlds attention to the brutalities committed by the Chinese regime in Tibet. Their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, is not opposed to the games. But it seems that he has lost control over the young people who are against the event. Bhutia has every right to voice his concerns for the situation in Tibet. But, as a sportsman, he should not forget his pledge to the Olympics.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir Bhaichung Bhutia has risked the wrath of Indias sports authorities by deciding to drop out of the proposed Olympic torch relay. Bhutia should be praised for supporting the Tibetan cause by putting his career at great risk. Other Indian sportsmen should follow Bhutias example and boycott the event. After all, Tibetans today are fighting an oppressive regime. The Chinese authorities, in a bid to cover up their atrocities, even restricted the movements of the visiting journalists who had been to Tibet after the recent violence. The whole world knows what China is doing in Tibet. The government of Indian should gather enough courage to protest against the Chinese oppression in every possible manner. Calling off the Olympic torch relay in Delhi could surely be one way of voicing Indias disapproval.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has described Indian supporters of the movement for an independent Tibet as doing a great disservice to the motherland. By this logic, Bhaichung Bhutia, who has decided to opt out of the Olympic torch relay on April 17, should be considered guilty of such disservice as well. Karats comment is distressing and lays bare the communist brand of subterfuge and doublespeak. It seems that Karat and his comrades still believe that Beijing can do no wrong, and that their masters in China will be able to get away with their crimes in Tibet. While blaming the West, especially America, for breaking up nations in the name of protecting ethnic minorities and human rights, he has chosen to remain silent on Chinas role in fanning trouble in Indias Northeast, or, for that matter, on its claims on Arunachal Pradesh.           
	The truth is that China invaded Tibet, although it has denied that a free Tibet ever existed. One wouldnt be surprised if Karat believes Chinas doctored version of history as well. India should support Tibets demand for independence. A free Tibet can be Indias first line of defence against a mighty imperial state looking to expand its territories.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Prakash Karats comparison of the freedom movement in Tibet with the secessionist movements in Jammu and Kashmir is preposterous and exposes his lack of knowledge of history. Tibet was occupied by the Chinese forcibly since the Fifties. The erstwhile princely state of Kashmir, on the other hand, joined the Indian Union through an instrument of accession. India, Karat might have forgotten, did not invade Jammu and Kashmir. The secessionist movement in the state today is led by militant groups with help from across the border. It cannot thus be compared with the Tibetan freedom movement.           
	Karats comment can be dismissed on other grounds as well. For instance, the Chinese invasion of Tibet resulted in Tibetan refugees fleeing to India. There has been no such exodus of refugees from Jammu and Kashmir to other countries. The Pandits who have been forced to leave their home because of terrorism have migrated elsewhere in India. Finally, unlike in Tibet, where the government has discriminated against the indigenous population in favour of the Han Chinese, the government of Kashmir has not been biased in its dealings with the people of the state. The Left in India has been a loyal supporter of China. Now it is forcing the the Centre to bend over backwards to keep China happy This certainly does not bode well for Indias future.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Prakash Karats unflinching support for Chinas claim over Tibet was expected. The Left have and will always support Chinas misdeeds, be it the war with India in 1962 or its atrocities in Tibet. It is ironical that communist leaders of India, which suffered nearly two centuries of colonial rule, are now supporting the dubious claims of imperial China. The Chinese incursions in Indias Northeast and Chinas covert support to Pakistan in an arms race against India are established truths. Unfortunately, for the comrades, ideology and politics always take precedence over justice. Hence, they have turned a blind eye towards Chinese atrocities in Tibet. The government, which survives on Left support, has endorsed this position in a bid to placate its left allies. Meanwhile, the Tibetans continue to suffer at the hands of their oppressors. Karat should be made to apologize for his views. Otherwise Left leaders will continue to make such irresponsible statements in the future.           
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       DELIVER THE BASICS                                  MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The real problem of governance in India has been the failure of honest law-enforcers. Those entrusted with the power and the tools to enforce the law and ensure the dignity of life have instead abused the law, selfishly exploited their exalted positions and successfully reduced civil society to an anarchy with blurred lines between right and wrong. They have mastered the skill of creating options, allowing endless interpretations to all the laws that affect everyday life, and have demeaned the statutes that were established to uphold the rights and the equality of citizens.        
	Examples abound from across this land. From the inability of the bureaucrat working in rural India to ensure that all castes and classes can safely fetch water from the village well to the failure of law and order in general, this corroded machine of governance, which was empowered to set the standards, has instead steamrolled over our ethics and values, our beliefs and traditions and has transformed India into a misgoverned and misruled state. Corruption is everywhere  it is to be observed in the intellectual distortions of reality and in the manipulation of rules and regulations that govern us. It seems to have become the overriding belief that keeps the administration in one piece, bringing the members closer together!        
	Affirmative action is welcome in a country ridden with disparities. What prevents the State from making sure that all children enjoy equal rights to education? The answer is simple  there was never a true political will or an administrative machine which believed that affirmative action was a priority. It is as though all the administrators wanted the larger vote-bank to remain where it was because in that position it was easier to exploit and manipulate it. The word populism took on negative connotations with this terrible neglect of what had once been seen as genuine intentions.                
	Widening gap        
	Today, the exploitation of sections of the society for votes continues in a perverse way. Pass bills to please the public but never follow them up by enforcing them because to do so would necessitate adherence to honest operational procedures and a fundamental respect for the Constitution and the law of the land. In this day and age, to reserve seats at the level of higher education means nothing if there are no reserved seats at the primary and secondary level. Once again, the system of reservation in India smacks of a superficial addressing of the problem. Without basic educational grounding for all, academic excellence will falter, the less privileged in our society will be deprived, and irreparable divides will be created at a time when we need them the least. Only our government is to be blamed for this regression.        
	With regard to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, the State is making a mockery of the issue yet again. It is creating a huge divide between the tribal and other marginal communities, a divide that could become volatile by pandering to the demands of the one and ignoring the other, till things get out of control. The passing of the bill is an example of the unthinking, non-inclusive, politically and ideologically motivated actions that have destroyed modern India.        
	Governments and their institutions should be made fully accountable to deliver the basics to all, to ensure a safe, clean and dignified life for all. The law and order machine needs to be cleansed of its warts, municipalities need to be purified, education and health need to be made the priority. If the exploitation of the people by the State ceases, India will not need any affirmative action. It is a nation of self- respecting entrepreneurs. Give them a chance.

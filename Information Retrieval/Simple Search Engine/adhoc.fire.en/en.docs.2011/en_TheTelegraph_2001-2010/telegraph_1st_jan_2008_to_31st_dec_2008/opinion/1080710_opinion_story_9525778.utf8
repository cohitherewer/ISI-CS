The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Where have all the pretty frocks gone?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WHERE HAVE ALL THE PRETTY FROCKS GONE?                                  SMALL TALK      The market for childrens clothes is full of miniature versions of item-girl costume                                                  
	While surfing channels recently, I caught a few minutes of a dance reality show for children on a Bengali satellite channel. A dance performance had just come to an end, and it was judgment time. One of the judges was chiding (quite gently, though, dont get me wrong) the contestant  a girl of nine or ten  for not choosing the correct size of inners. The inners, I gathered, were the strange, flesh-coloured bodysuits, over which the girls wore even stranger, strappy or strapless, slit or contour-hugging, midriff-baring costumes. A lot of skin seemed on display, but technically, not an inch, other than the hands, feet, face and neck. Yet it was important to maintain the illusion of showing skin, and so the inners had to be the perfect size that would not crease as the young bodies bent and swooned.        
	Just to jog your memory, we are talking about children here. Girls and boys whose bodies have probably not grown yet to fit snugly into standard-size bodysuits. If the reality-show business keeps growing at the current rate, then the market for petite inners will no longer be a niche market, but a wholly profitable one. It is easy to foresee such a future from the way most ensembles worn by Bollywoods item girls are available in miniature versions these days  perhaps for the little girls entering these dance shows.         
	A blog-writing mother was lamenting recently that childrens dresses adorned with smocking, puppy-appliques and floral embroidery for girls and sailor-collars and piping for boys have all but disappeared from India. She can only find these styles now in Fabindia, or in foreign brands like Next, but at prohibitive prices.         
	Seema Puri, who heads the design team of the childrens store, Lilliput, insists that she and her store would never create dresses that could make children look vulgar. But how can a seven-year-old possibly look vulgar? she asks, explaining that children, since the beginning of time, have loved imitating their parents ways of dressing. While it might appear entirely natural for a little girl to want to wear her mothers sari or a boy to knot a tie like his father (or the other way round), isnt there something scarily odd about mothers picking out halter-neck tank-tops and low-rise denims for their daughters? And why do boys clothes need to be full of attitude? (Dont boys have enough of it already?)        
	So I walked into a shopping mall full of childrens stores, meaning to find out the trends in childrens fashion. And before long, I had salesperson after salesperson telling me eagerly that halter-tops and dresses were the rage among girls and rap-star ensembles among boys (short-sleeve shirt over long-sleeve T-shirt with oversize cargos). On the shop walls I could also see violent vests (We will get you was written on one of them), see-through tops to be worn over spaghetti-straps and an overdoze of beads and sequins. In all this, however, footwear seemed to have remained childish, with pink, yellow and blue still the dominating colours.        
	This is not an Indian phenomenon, it seems. A recent New York Times article reveals that Americans  after all, they invented reality shows  are equally distressed about eight-year-old girls wearing push-up bras. There are even websites selling adult baby clothes. These virtual stores attract plenty of buyers. The bizarreness of the adult-baby oxymoron does not bother them much.                    SREYASHI DASTIDAR

	Steely resolve                          
	Sir  The worlds largest steel-maker, ArcelorMittal, is planning to enter the Indian steel market in a big way. Hence, L.N. Mittals comment that Singur should be treated as an isolated incident is on expected lines (Mittal shrugs off Singur effect, Sept 10). No investor is willing to court controversy when the business stakes are especially high and Mittal isnt an exception. Contrary to what Mittal said, the problems that the Tatas are facing in Singur should be treated in all seriousness. In fact, influential industrialists such as Mittal should come together to combat challenges that are political in nature. Otherwise, such hurdles will continue to exist. The captains of the industry should also raise their voice against an irresolute government that is accustomed to talking in two voices.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bibhash Mohanty, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Sir  It was baffling to note L.N. Mittals observations on Singur, considering the fact that he had complained about his own Indian ventures suffering on account of political disturbances on an earlier occasion. Most industrialists have been unanimous in their disapproval of the Singur imbroglio. Hence, Mittals belittling of the Singur crisis is nothing short of an irresponsible act. It was expected of this Calcutta-educated entrepreneur to be critical of Bengals traditional opposition to industry He has disappointed us on that score.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Suman Biswas, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Mohandas Pais assessment of the Singur issue is completely erroneous (Bengal terrifies investors, Sept 9). Pai, director (human resources), Infosys, has wrongly blamed the Opposition in West Bengal for demanding a better compensation package for farmers. Ratan Tata was led to believe by the Left Front government that there was virtually no effective opposition in the state. Unfortunately, he walked into the trap without realizing that it was not fair to keep the farmers in the dark about the nature of the agreement. Now that the deal has run into trouble, Ratan Tata is busy blaming Bengals political environment and it seems that Pai too shares his views. The people of West Bengal have high expectations of the Singur project and hope that the deadlock will be broken soon. The Tatas would have been spared their troubles had they decided to deal directly with the farmers instead of putting their trust in politicians.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Siba Prasad Shom, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The contradictory statements issued by Mohandas Pai and L.N. Mittal, within a short span of time, has confused the peoples minds even more. Pais remarks are certain to give rise to pessimism, but Mittal may also be accused of raising false hopes. Mittals declaration that Singur will not stop him from investing in India will, however, gladden the chief ministers heart as it seems fairly certain that Mittal will not shelve his business plans in Bengal despite the problems in Singur.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Jiben Basu, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is time Mamata Banerjee paid heed to what industrialists across the country are saying about Singur. Her illogical position regarding the small-car project in Singur is not only jeopardizing the future development of this particular area, but also forcing investors to have a rethink about setting up business in West Bengal. Mohandas Pai of Infosys has recently made known his companys reluctance to enter Bengal. The software giants maiden venture in Bengal was supposed to generate almost 5,000 jobs. If Infosys is to withdraw from Bengal, Mamata Banerjee should be ready to shoulder the entire blame. While economists around the world are repeatedly stressing on the necessity of agriculture to give way to industry, Mamata Banerjee seems content to stall Bengals economic progress for petty political gains. Not even the imminent exodus of corporate houses from Bengal is dissuading her from her dangerous mission.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore

                
	Sir  Complaints regarding West Bengals business milieu are pouring in from industrial quarters. Hence it was a bit of a relief to read L.N. Mittals message in which he declared that problems regarding the acquisition of farm land, such as the ones in Singur, are common all over the world. Many businessmen have blamed Bengals inherent apathy towards industry and work, and made plans to retreat from the state. Mittals candid acknowledgement will hopefully revive their confidence. Mittal had earlier conceded that his own projects in Orissa are facing similar hurdles. It is pertinent to note that Orissa is one of the states that has extended an invitation to Tata Motors to relocate their small-car project there. Perhaps Mittals experience in Orissa will compel Ratan Tata to change his mind and continue with his operations in Bengal even if the recalcitrant Opposition does not relent some time soon.

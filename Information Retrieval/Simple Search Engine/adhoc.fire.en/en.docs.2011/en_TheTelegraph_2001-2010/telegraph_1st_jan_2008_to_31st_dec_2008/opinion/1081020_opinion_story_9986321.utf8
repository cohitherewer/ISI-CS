	Two men and their morals                  
	Sir  I agree with Ramachandra Guhas view that L.K. Advani poses a threat to the integrity of India (The Hindu Jinnah, Oct 11). The horrors of the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992 and of the carnage in Gujarat exactly a decade later, are still vivid in the memory of Indians. It is opportunistic Hindutva-mongers like Advani who provoked the worst civic unrest in India after Independence. Even after all the bloodshed, Advani, far from being repentant, described Ayodhya as an instance of cultural nationalism.           
	However, Guha did not have to condone Mohammed Ali Jinnahs acts for making the criticism of Advani harsher. Jinnah was no less dangerous than the Bharatiya Janata Party leader. In fact, Advani seems to be doing in the name of Hindutva what Jinnah had done in the name of Islam six decades ago. The ghosts of Partition still come back to haunt the subcontinent in the form of communal riots. Jinnahs Direct Action ran for about a year and a half, only because his mission of creating a Muslim State was accomplished within this time. Guha seems to be somewhat favourably disposed towards Jinnah. Could it be because Jinnah is no more, while Advani is still around and carrying on with his communal agenda?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

                
	Sir  While suggesting that L.K. Advani is instrumental in unsettling the socio-political equilibrium of India, Ramachandra Guha indulges more in speculations than in factual history. The comment, Had Advani not embarked on that ill-advised march, there may never have been an Indian Mujahideen, disturbingly echoes Lalu Prasads irrational comment some time back that had there not been the riots in Gujarat in 2002, Islamic terrorism would not have existed in India. Does this mean that outfits like the Indian Mujahideen are not offshoots of the global terrorist network? Is Guha justifying the secessionist agenda of Muslim jihadis by blaming the Hindu extremists? What about the failure of government to uplift the minority communities socially and economically? Moreover, in laying the blame squarely on one man, Guha unwittingly allots more historical significance to Advani than he deserves.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Abhigyan Prasad, Guwahati 

      
	Sir  The parallel drawn between the ideologies of L.K. Advani and Mohammed Ali Jinnah by Ramachandra Guha is quite apt. Many may remember that on his visit to Pakistan, Advani called Jinnah a great man, to the shock and horror of Indians, and of his own party colleagues, in particular. It is thus hardly surprising that he should imitate this great man in politics. However, Guha should have remembered that Jinnah drew up the plan for a systematic division of communities, while Advani is simply a traveller along the same path. The latter is yet to reach Jinnahs stature.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas diatribe against L.K. Advani is a manifestation of his prejudice. The sole purpose of writing the article, it seems, was to paint Advani as an unscrupulous murderer, single-mindedly working towards the extinction of Muslims in India. If there is no proof for the claim that the majority of Indians demand the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, then there is no proof either for the other extreme, that absolutely no one wants the temple at the holy site. Advani is criticized for bringing on all or most of the catastrophes that have befallen India in the recent past. Some of Guhas conclusions  such as Advanis rathyatra being the reason behind the growth of Islamic terrorism in India, or the BJPs victories being a result of the communal riots provoked by the party  are oversimplified. It is true that the saffronites are not fond of the minorities, but that does not make them culpable for the terrorist attacks on India. In fact, this global menace is too large to be explained by an argument based on Hindutva.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Rajprabha Dasani, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Terror attacks have become the staple of our morning news. And it has become the BJPs practice to blame the Centre for failing to tame militant Islamic elements. But it is the BJP leaders, particularly L.K. Advani, Narendra Modi and the Shiv Sena chief, Balasaheb Thackeray, who have, in their own ways, contributed to the unprecedented rise of terrorism in India. It is these leaders whose communal policies have enraged the minorities who, in turn, have started seeking revenge through violence. Leaders like Advani must leave aside vote bank politics and try to unite all communities through the promise of equal treatment while there is still time to act.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The West Bengal government gives the least attention to pollution control these days. The major cause of pollution in Calcutta is the emission from public vehicles such as buses and autorickshaws. Often, government vehicles emit noxious fumes as well. The Telegraphs coverage on the use of adulterated fuel by auto drivers raised a storm, but Pollution Control Board officials were unmoved.           
	Pollution is not a matter of concern for the judiciary alone, though it has to step in every now and then. But judicial orders are, most often, enforced only half-heartedly. One can see how the Calcutta High Courts ban on katatel is being flouted with impunity till this day. A passive authority is a bigger threat to Calcutta than increasing levels of pollution.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

	Cricket, despite the many changes and distortions introduced by the one-day variety and Twenty20, retains certain rituals and protocols. One is that when the captain of a fielding side is for some reason  injury, illness and so on  unable to lead the team, the vice-captain takes over. In a home series, when no deputy is specifically mentioned, the seniormost player dons the mantle of leadership. The Indian captain, M.S. Dhoni, broke this convention when he asked Sourav Ganguly to be the captain towards the end of the last Test match in Nagpur. Presumably, Mr Dhonis motive behind this act was laudable. It was Mr Gangulys last few minutes as a Test cricketer, and he wanted Mr Ganguly to exit as a captain, and that too of a winning side. Cricket, however, has its own ways of reasserting its traditions and conventions. The last wicket of the Australians could not be secured under Mr Gangulys leadership, and he was forced to hand over the captaincy to the appointed captain. Thus Mr Dhonis gesture came to nought, which is as it should be.        
	What is at issue here is not Mr Dhonis motive or even the graciousness of his gesture. The selection committee has appointed Mr Dhoni the captain of the Indian side. This does not mean he has the right, whatever be the circumstances, to hand over the captaincy at his whim and fancy to someone of his choice. To do that is to commit an act of irresponsibility because it means the captain has overstepped the limits put on his role. In cricket, there are set norms for paying tribute to a player saying farewell to the game. One practice is for the visiting side to doff their caps. Lovers of cricket will recall the picture of the English side under Norman Yardley saying goodbye to Don Bradman. (It is said that the sight so moved the Don that his vision was blurred and he missed the googly from Eric Hollies.) The home side usually allows the departing player to lead the side out. Or a guard of honour is formed and the player walks down the aisle. These are the standard and well-known ways of saying adieu to a cricketer. Indeed, the last of these was followed by the Indian team on the last day that Mr Ganguly came out on the ground. After that, what was the need of any other special gesture? In cricket, at any given point of time, there can be only one captain on the field. Mr Dhoni will do well to remember this since it is probable that other veterans will retire while he is still captain.

	Sole search                  
	Sir  I strongly condemn the action of the Iraqi television journalist, Muntadar al-Zaidi, who threw his shoes at President George W. Bush during a press conference in Baghdad (Sole of unpopularity in size 10s, Dec 16). I find it strange that Americans have not yet broken out in protest against the incident in spite of the fact that Bush has done his best for the United States of America during his tenure as its president. It is because of Bushs efficiency in handling terror that there has not been a single attack on the US after 9/11. Although high alerts are sounded in India after each terrorist strike, hundreds of Indians continue to die in terror attacks. This is because Indias politicians are more interested in blaming one another than in thinking of the countrys security. Had India possessed a leader of Bushs stature, who could garner the support of the people as well as of the opposition leaders in his fight against terror, we would have been saved.           
	The way Bush was treated in Iraq reminded me of the fate of the late prime minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi. He made an earnest attempt to help Sri Lanka. But the people of Sri Lanka considered him to be their enemy and he was eventually killed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Prior to that, he had been attacked in Sri Lanka while accepting the army salute with the countrys prime minister. Bush, too, became the subject of the Iraqi peoples ire even when he was trying to help them.           
	It is unfortunate that shoes were hurled at Bush when he was trying to bring an end to the reign of terror around the world. It is even more shameful that the scene of the insult happened to be Iraq, the country that Bush has freed from its dictator, Saddam Hussein, and the one to which he continues to provide military support.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Agartala 

      
	Sir  It is not surprising that shoes have been hurled at George W. Bush by Muntadar al-Zaidi. Al-Zaidi must be considered the representative of thousands of Iraqis who are unwilling to forgive Bush for the destruction of their country. Perhaps no Iraqi, except the prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, supports the American president. Bush has himself admitted that some of the intelligence reports he relied on to get information about the weapons in Iraqs possession were false. Yet, he had attacked Iraq on the basis of these reports and caused countless deaths. Saddam Hussein might have been a tyrant. But was Bush justified in devastating a nation because of the policies of one man?           
	Yours faithfully,       
Serajuddin Khurram, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Muntadar al-Zaidi has overnight become a hero in Iraq. I was a little confused as to why a journalist should commit such an act since his job requires him to suspend his judgment about the events he is covering. I later understood that even a journalist is entitled to emotions, since he is only human. Moreover, al-Zaidi must be united in his anger against George W. Bush with the majority of Iraqis who find their motherland ruined after the wars. The American invasion did not benefit the Iraqis in any way. On the contrary, they have had to start from scratch to restore the country to its original glory, so complete had been its damage during the war. However, we must appreciate Bush for the way he ducked the two shoes thrown at him with agility. It would have been a great embarrassment for Bush had even one of them landed on any part of his body.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  By throwing shoes at George W. Bush, the Iraqi scribe has invented a harmless yet effective weapon to use on selfish politicians. Even if the shoes miss the target, the purpose of insulting the subject will be served.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                
	Sir  Muntadar al-Zaidi should be punished for assaulting the US president. It is good that he had the sense to apologize to the Iraqi prime minister later.           
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala 

                
	Sir  Bengalis feel gravely insulted if shoes are hurled at them. But now we know that at least one man, who is also the head of the only global superpower, actually feels amused to have shoes thrown at him. Bushs sportsman spirit is truly praiseworthy.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Anil Kumar Choudhury, Kalyani 

      
	 n Sir  The episode of shoe-throwing in Baghdad should not be taken lightly. It is surprising that the security guards of George W. Bush could not prevent the attack. Although the incident has been brushed aside by Bush, it should serve as a warning to the US security system to revamp itself before the president-elect, Barack Obama, takes over in January.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The former chief minister of Maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh, proclaimed just before his unceremonious exit that 59 lakh jobs will be created in Maharashtra through the 131 SEZ projects sanctioned for the state. Now that Ashok Chavan has taken over, he should hasten to complete all these projects at the earliest. He can use his experience as the industry minister of the state for the last four years. The number of unemployed in the state is over one crore, it is suspected. Therefore, Chavans burden is likely to be heavier than that of his predecessors, and 2009 is an election year too. But politics aside for a moment, Chavan should concentrate on bringing investments into Maharashtra and on building a solid base for the states development and progress.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Alka Balan, Mumbai

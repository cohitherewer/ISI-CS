	It is neither new nor special to India, but it is now gaining enough popularity to excite comment. Women attending religious tutorial lessons, or duroos, and debating the issues that come up, attract attention, especially if those conducting the lesson, or dars, are erudite women. Women of the minority community have become, willy-nilly, a routine part of the international discourse on Islam, and are cited, in India for example, either as illustrations of the way all religions devalue women, or as victims of the oppression practised by the male religious hierarchy of the minority community. But by making increasing use of the traditional system of duroos, Muslim women in Bhopal, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Delhi and other cities, are exercising their agency, not only in order to understand their faith better but also to explore issues, such as divorce and family responsibility, that touch their everyday lives. These are, ideally, spiritual as well as intellectual exercises, containing within them the potential to question and balance the patriarchy that powers the religious organization of their lives. These are networks and support groups too, by virtue of which women can articulate their intimate concerns on a comparatively impersonal plane. In India, where Muslim women are already questioning, even protesting against, the ban on their praying in mosques, and where one woman, with the support of hundreds from her community, has been struggling to build a mosque in Tamil Nadu, the value of an active dars system cannot be underestimated.        
	There can be fears that lessons based purely on religion would lead the community towards ultra-conservatism. The embittering context of the war on terror and the invasion of Iraq has given to identity politics and the delineations of different faiths a hard edge of suppressed violence. Yet, it would be a mark of the same self-defeating myopia to impose preconceived notions of reform on a distinctive community, without allowing it space to explore its own potential of change. Dar ul-Huda Islamic Academy in Kerala, for example, demonstrates how change can work within the system. At the moment, it is enough to celebrate that the women in the community are seeking to meet, learn and debate. Not every dars group can be expected to go the same way. But no one can tell what the future might bring.

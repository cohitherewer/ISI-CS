	In the 17th century, when Galileo Galilei looked into the night sky through his telescope, he knew he had enough evidence to refute the geocentric view of the universe, but he could not have imagined that some three hundred years after his death, machines made by human beings would be travelling across space to distant planets and human beings too would be circling the earth in satellites. The conquest of space is one of the wonders of modern science, just as the discovery of the heliocentric universe was one of the marvels of science in the early modern world. The conquest of space has been possible, in large measure, because of the research done in and initiatives taken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  popularly known by the acronym Nasa  which was set up fifty years ago. It began operations with a staff of 80, spread over four laboratories. The agency now employs 17,000 people and has 15 facilities.        
	The most spectacular and popular achievement of Nasas many projects was in July 1969, when Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon. The memorable claim made by Mr Armstrong on taking his first step was that this was also a giant leap for mankind. In one sense, this was true, but in retrospect the claim may have been a trifle exaggerated. The real benefits for science and mankind accruing from the many moon landings made under Nasas Apollo programme remain debatable. The focus has shifted to smaller robotic missions to Mars and outer space. Nasas many outstanding successes were also marred by unfortunate accidents  the early tragedy of Apollo 1 when the rocket caught fire on the launch pad, the hatch door would not open and three astronauts died; the two shuttles, Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003 were lost with their 14 astronauts; in 1999 went two craft, the Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander. However, research done in Nasa has directly contributed to the development of the hand-held vacuum cleaner, better golf balls, Teflon-coated fibreglass and many other items of modern life.        
	Nasas silver jubilee might pose different kinds of challenges than the conquest of space. The agency currently receives $17 billion from the government of the United States of America. Reports suggest that at current funding levels, Nasa would be unable to meet some of its important goals by 2013. The lack of funds will be specially galling with the rising demand to fly people to the moon. To do this, Nasa will need a new rocket, to pay for which the agency must cancel all future space shuttle flights. From 2010, Nasa will actually be dependent on the Russian Soyuz to get into space. Somewhere  in outer space perhaps  the spirit that drove Nasa and its pioneering conquest of space has been lost.

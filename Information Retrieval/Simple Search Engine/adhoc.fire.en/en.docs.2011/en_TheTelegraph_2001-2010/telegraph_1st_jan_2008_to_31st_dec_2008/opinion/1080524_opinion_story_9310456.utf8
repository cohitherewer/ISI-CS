                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WEALTH OF THE NEIGHBOURS                                  THIS ABOVE ALL - Khushwant Singh                          Rich and famous                                        
	Farrukh Saleem, a freelance Pakistani journalist based in Islamabad wrote an article comparing the rich in India with those in Pakistan. It was published in September 2007. Amir Tuteja, based in Washington, sent me a copy. I quote a few excerpts:        
	The two Ambani brothers can buy 100 per cent of every company listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange and would still be left with $30 billion to spare. The four richest Indians can buy up all goods and services produced over a year by 169 million Pakistanis and still be left with $60 billion to spare. The four richest Indians are now richer than the forty richest Chinese.        
	In November, comes Neetas birthday. Neeta turned forty-four three weeks ago. Look what she got from her husband as her birthday present: A sixty-million dollar jet with a custom fitted master bedroom. Bathroom with mood lighting, a sky bar, entertainment cabins, satellite television, wireless communication and a separate cabin with game consoles. Neeta is Mukesh Ambanis wife, and Mukesh is not Indias richest but the second richest!        
	Mukesh is now building his new home, Residence Antillia (after a mythical, phantom island somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean). At a cost of $1 billion this would be the most expensive home on the face of the planet. At 173 meters tall Mukeshs new family residence for a family of six will be the equivalent of a 60-storeyed building. The first six floors are reserved for parking. The seventh floor is for car servicing and maintenance. The eighth floor houses a mini-theatre. Then theres a health club, a gym and a swimming pool. Two floors are reserved for Ambani familys guests. Four floors above the guest floors are family floors all with a superb view of the Arabian Sea. On top of everything are three helipads. A staff of 600 is expected to care for the family and the family home.        
	For the record: Azim Premji is the richest Muslim entrepreneur on the face of the planet. India now has more than three dozen billionaires; Pakistan has none (not a single dollar billionaire).        
	Saleem ends his article by asking: Why, when Indians and Pakistanis belong to the same races, eat the same food, speak the same languages, is there so much difference in their bank balances? He answers it himself by asking another question, What is it that Indians have and we dont? and answers: Indians elect their own leaders.                
	God bless all sneezers                
	Everyone sneezes once in a while. Even animals sneeze. I am a great sneezer and have been sneezing all my life. I am not sure what brings on a sneeze; perhaps it is irritation in the nostrils. You can ward off that kind of sneeze by rubbing the back of your neck. Sudden change in the temperature, allergy to something, as in hay fever, or a warning of something worse to come, like a common cold, could be other reasons. From my life-long addiction to sneezing I have come to the conclusion that if you have two sneezes in quick succession, there is not much to worry about; but if there is only one chhoo, take it more seriously and promptly swallow a few tablets of vitamin C. In the last few years, a new pattern of sneezing has evolved in my ageing body: I get bouts of sneezing, sometimes consisting of nearly a dozen with short intervals between them. This usually happens soon after I have had my evening meal. So far I have thought of it as part of the process of ageing but I may be wrong and it may be more than nothing to sneeze about.        
	People associate some kind of malevolent spirit with sneezing. No sooner a person explodes with ahkisshoo than someone will invoke divinity: with Sikhs it is Satan, with Hindus, Jeetey raho  long live, with Christians, Bless you! I am not sure what Muslims say: perhaps Bismillah. I know Germans say Gesundheit.        
	Sneeze is onomatopoeic, a word based on a sound, like cuckoo for the bird which calls coo coo, or sizzle, the sound of something coming to boil. It is the same with our languages: in Punjabi it is nichh, in Bengali acheu, in Hindi and other languages of the northern half it is neechh. God bless all sneezers.                 
	Job satisfaction                
	R. Srinivasan, who represents Durex, the condom manufacturers, in India, held a press conference in New Delhi where he announced new employment opportunities for men only. He said: If you are over 18 and male, and wish to combine business with pleasure, then the post of condom tester may be the job for you. We are currently planning to recruit 1,000 men to test our products. So why not sign up for what is probably the best job on earth?        
	In 2007, a study of Indian Council of Medical Research concluded that international condom sizes are too large for most Indian men. So Durex have responded by manufacturing a new range of snug fit condoms and its these that we are asking Indian men to test. Durex received a tremendous response when it staged similar campaigns in Malaysia and its not just pleasure that is on offer. In return for providing us with detailed feedback about product performance, all volunteers will receive sweeties, gift vouchers and iPods. Furthermore, one lucky employee will win an all-expenses paid holiday for two at a romantic getaway in Pune.

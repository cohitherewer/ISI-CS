	Prices are rising. So with it are political tempers; they are making things uncomfortable for the Central government. It has taken plenty of action, such as making imports cheaper, exports more expensive, and banning futures. But the frantic measures have brought no relief. This is only the more sensational of the bad news. The economy is slowing down. So with it will the rise in incomes and employment. Some industries will get into more serious trouble. If they can muster the political clout, the government will take short-sighted measures to help them. Altogether, economic news cannot bring the government much credit.        
	This is all the more embarrassing since the government is headed by an economist of great renown. He is credited with the miraculous transformation of the economy in the past 17 years. It is not just inflation that is at issue; it is his reputation that is at stake. Unfortunately, there are no solutions that can act quickly and be effective. There are longer-term solutions; but they may not help the government since elections are at most little more than a year away. And while bad economic news keeps pouring in, affairs like that of gas for T.R. Baalus son tarnish the governments image. After riding cheerfully on top of a wonderful economic boom, the prime minister risks taking a tumble.         
	His best strategy may lie in the political rather than in the economic field. Almost at the same moment when Indias economic fortunes turned downward, Pakistan saw a revolution. Its elections were won by a pair of parties which joined hands and formed the government. They appointed a prime minister who looks younger than his 56 years. He may not be remembered, but he visited Delhi in 1989 with a delegation of the Pakistan Association of Travel Agents. The time has come for the prime minister to invite him for another visit to Delhi. It does not have to be the kind of serious, boring meeting that heads of state specialize in. As Manmohan Singh enters his last year as prime minister of this government, he can afford to start taking off the heavy robes of responsibility and enjoying himself a bit. He should take a lesson from his predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who went off to Manali on the least pretext. He should take Yousaf Raza Gilani to Kalimpong, walk in the woods with him, and talk to him about everything except affairs of State. If he cannot muster small talk, he should take along Rahul Gandhi. The government is very fond of talking about people-to-people contacts between the people of India and Pakistan. It should practise such contacts at the highest level. India should get away from the stiff, formal, wooden, introverted style its government has developed in dealing with Pakistan; it should start treating Pakistanis as people from anywhere else.

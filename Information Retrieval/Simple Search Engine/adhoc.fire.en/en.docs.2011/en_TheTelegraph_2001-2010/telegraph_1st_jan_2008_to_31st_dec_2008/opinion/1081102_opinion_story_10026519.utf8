	To catch a falling man                  
	Sir  The authorities in charge of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco plan to suspend a safety net below it to catch would-be suicides (Bridge net to stop suicides, Oct 14). But will that stop people from taking their lives? The report narrates the case of Olivia Crowther, who crossed a continent just to jump off the bridge. So it seems that apart from being a possible eyesore, the net will only push potential suicides to seek ghastlier ways to end their lives. The authorities would thus be better advised to live and let live... er, die.          
	Yours faithfully,         Tapan Pal, Batanagar
        
	Run amok          
	Sir  The state transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, might have suddenly got all righteous and declared that auto-rickshaws of Calcutta will have to switch over to liquefied petroleum gas as fuel by December 31, but there is grave doubt as to whether his diktat will be carried out (Gas in the air, Oct 26). A few days ago, while heading towards Ahiritola ghat in an auto-rickshaw, we got caught in the signal at the Hatibagan crossing. A number of auto-rickshaws billowing black smoke stood alongside ours. I asked the auto-driver whether he was planning to change over to LPG. Disgusted at my query, he roared that he and his brethren will go by the directives of the leaders of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions rather than by the dictates of the transport minister. He added that there can be no alternative to katatel, which is cheap and yields the drivers good returns. If such is the mindset of most auto-rickshaw owners, nothing short of a miracle is needed if we are to breathe in clean air in two months time.           
	Since the Lok Sabha elections are round the corner, it is unlikely that the Left Front government will take any step now that might reduce the number of its prospective voters. As such, doubt remains on whether Chakrabortys command will be implemented with any rigour. The minister will probably plead helplessness at the end of December and the polluting auto-rickshaws will ply as before. Chakrabortys assurance, however, will keep all parties happy. Calcuttans will feel that government is struggling to reduce air pollution, and the interests of the auto-owners will also be protected.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan 

      
	Sir  As the editorial, Gas in the air, points out, there are several illegal auto-rickshaws plying in the city. Most autowallahs do not care for a permit and go anywhere and everywhere in Calcutta. They squeeze into narrow bylanes, stop in the middle of the road, cause avoidable traffic jams and put the lives of commuters at risk. Disregarding the perils of carrying more than four passengers, auto-drivers regularly accommodate five or more in their vehicles. Two, sometimes three, passengers hanging on either side of the auto-driver do not make for a pretty sight and do not say much for the condition of the public transport in the state and its capital. Much more than a switch-over to LPG is needed if the auto menace is to be contained.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Manabendra Bhattacharya, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Vehicular pollution has reached an alarming height in Calcutta, and dreaded diseases caused by it are on the rise. The state pollution control board obviously has no say in the affairs of the transport department and on the Citu, which controls the auto-rickshaws. Subhas Chakraborty periodically announces measures to control pollution that are never implemented. As such, there is a bleak possibility that Chakrabortys recent reassurance of all auto-rickshaws switching over to LPG by December 31 will be acted upon.                    
	Yours faithfully,

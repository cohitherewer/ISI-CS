	There is nothing more amusing than a blame game. In politics, the Left excels at this game. The Left is never to blame for anything; it is always someone else. So it is not surprising that Prakash Karat, whose intelligence has been completely eroded by the dialectic, has blamed the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, for the present political crisis. Mr Karat has, of course, nothing to do with the crisis: he can therefore stand on a lofty ideological ground and pass judgment. If truth be told, Mr Karat has the least right in a democratic polity to pass judgment on anything. Beyond student elections in Jawaharlal Nehru University (which he once lost), Mr Karat has never sought any kind of popular mandate. But this point apart, is it justified to say that the Left has nothing to with the present crisis?         
	The Communist Party of India (Marxist) is an ally of this government of which it is not a part. Yet, it has blocked every important policy initiative of this government. It has stood in the way of the progress of economic liberalization, and has therefore prevented the reduction of subsidies. A reduction in subsidies could have helped in controlling the inflation. To take the other aspect of the crisis. The comrades are behaving as if Mr Singh sprung the Indo-US nuclear deal as a surprise on them. The entire world knew that Mr Singh was negotiating this deal with President George W. Bush. It was also known that the deal involved a specific and tight time-frame. In the negotiations, the Indian side did not give in tamely to the pressures and demands from the American side. On the contrary, the Indian team won important safeguards, some of which had, in fact, been demanded by the Left. Thus the prime ministers commitment to the deal, the negotiations on the deal and the time-frame were all common knowledge. It remained for Mr Karat to suddenly wake up and say that the deal could not be supported; if the deal went through, the Left would withdraw support from the government. Thus, it is the Left which has precipitated the crisis. If an individual has to be blamed for this, then there is none other to blame than Mr Karat himself.        
	What is the reason for this opposition to the deal? It is nothing other than the fact that the Left believes that it will bring India too close to the United States of America, so close that the comrades feel that India might lose her independence in the realm of foreign policy. In other words, it is the sheep of the Lefts anti-Americanism that is being dressed up as the anti-nuclear deal mutton. Mr Karat and his comrades have little of substance against the deal, so they are beating an antique drum. It is too much to expect that dogmatic communists will engage in soul-searching. It is also unreasonable to expect that the CPI(M)  enjoying as it does power without responsibility in New Delhi  would own up to its own share of the blame.

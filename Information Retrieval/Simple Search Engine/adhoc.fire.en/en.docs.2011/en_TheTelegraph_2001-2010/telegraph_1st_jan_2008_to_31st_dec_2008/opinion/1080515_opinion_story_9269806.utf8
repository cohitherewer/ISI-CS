                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       LITTLE TOO LATE                                                    
	With sixty-odd people dead and more than a hundred injured, the tragedy in Jaipur is the eighth in a sequence of blasts since the one in Delhi on October 29, 2005. More than 300 people have been killed in these eight incidents, in each of which there has been a series of explosions. Apart from Delhi, the other targeted cities were Mumbai, Varanasi (twice), Hyderabad (twice), Ajmer, Faizabad and Lucknow. If Mumbai 93 and Coimbatore 98 are counted too, then the number of the dead goes up by more than 500. That makes it a little more than 800 people killed in ten incidents targeting nine Indian cities. These are grave and shameful statistics. Grave because of what they tell of the efficacy of non-violent and democratic solutions to cross-border conflicts; shameful, since they show how intelligence failure has become the chronic malaise of the Indian State. The State failed the innocent in two ways in all these instances. First, by being unable to protect ordinary citizens from terrorism. Second, by subverting the process of justice in the way suspected terrorists were tried.        
	A standard script, with rules for what to do and what to say, promptly comes into play after each such incident. The Central and state governments, together with their various agencies entrusted with intelligence or law and order, are now experts in post-facto deliberations and conclusions. They detect trends and patterns, give precise descriptions and interpretations of the nature of the explosives used, pick up clues, witnesses, informants and suspects, and follow leads and hunches with an expertise that would have been most reassuring had it not been demonstrated invariably a little too late. Union ministers of state for home drop dark hints about neighbouring countries (there are several to choose from); these countries then unanimously condemn terrorism; names of terrorist organizations float about in the air, and theories of how they might have combined their forces; the Opposition parties blame the ones in power of being soft on terrorism (with an eye to imminent elections of some sort); the prime minister asks everybody to stay calm and doles out money to the victims families from his fund; and the president declares that it is despicable and dastardly to kill people with bombs. The police sit up straighter everywhere for a while, and then that alarming thing called normalcy is resumed again.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       SUFFER IN SILENCE                                  CHINA DIARY -Neha Sahay                              
	Within hours of the earthquake, whose tremors seem to have been felt all over the country, Premier Wen Jiabao was reportedly talking to people trapped under the debris.        
	The French supermarket chain, Carrefour, announced a 2-million-yuan donation. And a leading, outspoken columnist had written in a Guangdong weekly about the need for the authorities to be open with information.        
	Somehow, everything happening in China now is connected to the Olympics, Tibet, and the protests around the Olympic flame. Carrefours prompt generosity was aimed at wooing back customers after its outlets had been boycotted across China over the last three weeks. The boycott was provoked by an ugly incident in Paris in which pro-Tibet protesters attacked a Chinese athlete in a wheelchair and tried to snatch the Olympic torch from her. There was also a rumour that Carrefour supported Tibetan independence. If Carrefour was slow in responding then, it more than made up for that now, after the earthquake.        
	At one anti-Carrefour demonstration in Hunan province, some youths attempted to assault an American who came out of the supermarket. They began taunting him, and the crowd took up the taunt. But other youngsters in the demonstration escorted him through the hostile crowd into a taxi, which, too, was attacked. The American, a volunteer teacher, was only saved by the police.        
	Chang Ping, a journalist, was the earliest voice of reason after the outburst, mostly by young Chinese, against Western media coverage of the Tibet riots. Accepting that the Western media had indulged in prejudiced reporting, he argued that the Chinese media would be able to counter the Western lies only with the help of greater access and freedom. He also likened the Wests sense of cultural superiority towards China to the attitude of the majoritarian Han Chinese towards the Tibetan minority.                
	The need to know        
	Chang Ping was denounced as a traitor and a running dog and removed from his post as deputy editor, but his column continued. Now, immediately after the earthquake, he has called again for a free flow of information. He was personally affected this time, he wrote, for his relatives were in Sichuan, and he needed as much information as he could possibly get. Unable to get through to them over the phone, he began to send information to friends, hoping for feedback. As a journalist, he knew that much of the information he sent was unverified. He could thus be accused of spreading rumours and jailed. But he had to do it.        
	Surfing the internet, he came across reports about an earthquake being predicted by various people a few days earlier in the very areas where it had struck, and a clampdown of such predictions by the local authorities. How true were these? There was no way to tell. Nor was there any way to find out whether the figures being quoted on the internet reflected the actual death toll or not.        
	In fact, the government spokesperson was asked at a press conference about warnings on the internet before the earthquake. He called this unreasonable speculation. Significantly, the Sichuan government website did have a notice put up by the Abeizhou Seismic Bureau, reassuring people that the talk of an impending earthquake was just a rumour.        
	But within 12 hours of the earthquake, this notice had disappeared. This flow of unverified information wasnt a malicious attempt to spread panic, wrote Chang Ping. The police, he suggested, who are on the lookout for people disseminating rumours, should realize that this only reflects the peoples fierce appetite for information when faced with a public event. If this need is met immediately, the rumours will cease.

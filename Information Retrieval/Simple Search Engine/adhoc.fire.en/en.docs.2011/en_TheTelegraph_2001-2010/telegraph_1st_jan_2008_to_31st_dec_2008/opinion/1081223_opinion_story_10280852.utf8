	Pot shots                  
	Sir  It is annoying to find the Union minister of minority affairs, A.R. Antulay, playing into the hands of Pakistan (Antulay gives Cong red face, Dec 18). By hinting that there was something more than terrorism behind the death of the Maharashtra anti-terror squad chief, Hemant Karkare, he has merely given India-baiters in Pakistan ammunition to use on us. After Antulays remarks, it is going to be easy for them to deny that the masterminds of the Mumbai terror attacks belong to Pakistan.           
	Antulay, also a former Maharshtra chief minister, had been sacked in the Eighties on charges of corruption. What he is trying to do now is divide the country along communal lines. The Congress has not shown itself up as a spineless party by failing to discipline Antulay (and accept the resignation that Antulay claims to have offered). The party has betrayed the secular ideals that it claims to stand for. Its fondness for vote-bank politics might even make the Congress mollycoddle Antulay and pander to his divisive tactics.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Nitin G. Gokarn, Mumbai

                
	Sir  Not only has A.R. Antulay raised suspicions of a communal hand in the death of Hemant Karkare, but he has also refused to retract his comment. The charge is a serious one, that could stoke communal tensions in the country. One can only hope that Indians are intelligent enough to see through such cheap vote-bank politics. Why the Congress president and the prime minister are silent remains a mystery. To this may be added the absence of any statement or action from the party. Shoving the issue under the carpet might prove costly for the Congress in the forthcoming elections.           
	Yours faithfully,       
K. Venkataraman, Mumbai

                
	Sir  If A.R. Antulay suspects that Hemant Karkares death though the Maharashtra ATS chief fell to terrorists bullets  could be linked to his investigation of the Malegaon blasts, the charges should not be brushed away summarily. The minority affairs minister has only demanded an inquiry into Karkares death, in the light of the investigation he was leading that had resulted in the arrest of Pragya Singh Thakur and Lt Colonel S.P. Purhohit. One must remember that Karkare was a highly-trained officer who had dealt with terrorist situations in the past. It is also, perhaps, important to note here that just before the attacks, Karkare had pleaded for a transfer from the ATS, citing pressure following the Malegaon blasts probe. An independent and impartial inquiry could solve a few mysteries about the untimely death of a top police officer.           
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Sir  It is shocking to see some people supporting the views expressed by A.R. Antulay. And that too, after enough evidence that Pakistani jihadis were behind the Mumbai attacks. This only goes to show that some people can never look at things without passing them through the prism of religion. It is doubly shameful that no political party in the country will come out and directly condemn such elements, for fear of losing a potential vote bank.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

                
	Sir  When will we try to understand that we must work together in order to defeat the twin enemies of recession and terrorist attacks? Mumbai seems to have sparked off a competition of sorts among politicians to make controversial and insensitive comments  most notably, the Nationalist Congress Partys R.R. Patil, the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s V.S. Achuthanandan, and now, the Congresss A.R. Antulay. Antulay is entitled to his doubts about who sent [Hemant Karkare] in the direction of the Cama hospital. And as a minister, he could easily have raised the question in cabinet meetings or before the prime minister or the United Progressive Alliance chairperson, Sonia Gandhi. By choosing to speak to the media, Antulay has put a question mark against his real motives. If the Pakistani leaders met him, they would never forget to thank him. The Bharatiya Janata Party has done its bit to criticize Antulay, and demanded an immediate clarification from the prime minister. But the same party had mounted a brutal attack on Karkare after the latters probe landed some well-known saffronites in jail. There is very little difference between the political games played by Antulay and the BJP, since both serve to strengthen the cause of the terrorists.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  Like A.R. Antulay, I too have lived in Mumbai for over four decades, and I know south Mumbai as well as the minister does. So I can try to offer an answer to Antulays question about why Hemant Karkare and his colleagues had headed towards the Cama Hospital and not the Taj Mahal hotel or the Trident. Cama Hospital is hardly a few metres away from the CST, the first target of the terrorists on November 26. When Hemant Karkare got the news, he must have rushed there. But by the time Karkares team reached, the two terrorists had probably left and must have been on their way towards Metro Cinema, which is hardly a kilometre away from CST. When the polices Qualis van, in which Karkare and the others were passing Cama Hospital, was spotted by the terrorists, they must have fired blindly at the vehicle, killing the officers and constables inside. It seems unlikely that the terrorists knew about the identity of the officers travelling in the van. It was unfortunate that Karkare and the others were at the wrong place at the wrong time. But the real question to ask here is whether they had to lose their lives because of sub-standard bullet-proof vests.          
	Yours faithfully,      
V.P. Ramnath, Secunderabad

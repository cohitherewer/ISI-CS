                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       RUMBLES IN THE EAST                                  CHINA DIARY -Neha Sahay                              
	The anti-West fever is on a high here, thanks to the continuous protests against the Olympic Torch. The French supermarket chain, Carrefour, has hastily shelved its 50 per cent discounts planned for the May-Day holidays in the wake of huge demonstrations against its outlets. The provocation? The belief that Carrefour supports the Dalai Lama, and the Paris incident where a protestor tried to snatch the Olympic flame from wheelchair-bound Chinese athlete, Jin Jing. Carrefour, which employs 40,000 Chinese across 112 outlets in China and stocks mainly Chinese products, has now issued a public statement that it opposes Tibets independence. Sarkozy too has written a personal apology to Jin Jing, but the calls for a boycott of French goods continue.        
	Dont be so CNN has become a popular phrase here, after CNN commentator, Jack Kafferty, described the Chinese as goons and thugs for the last 50 years and termed Chinese goods trash. His subsequent clarification that he was referring to the Chinese government didnt help. At least one hotel hosting an international conference here put up a huge board in its lobby announcing that CNN would not be telecast till it apologized.        
	CNN and the BBC have been revered channels for a section of Chinas youth put off by Chinese TVs official propaganda. Some of them feel cheated now with what they see as prejudiced coverage of the Tibet issue. Why dont Chinese demonstrators supporting the Olympic torch get the same coverage as those opposing it, they ask?                 
	Gentle advice        
	A former head of the CNN Beijing bureau has tried to answer this. CNN is unabashedly patriotic, he points out, when it comes to the United States of Americas foreign policy. Yet it can be totally critical of the US president. He explains this contradiction by pointing out that the invisible hands controlling the channel are those of its audience  the American people. CNNs news coverage from China is aimed at Americans, and anti-China news is what they want. In fact, the protests against CNN would actually convince American viewers that CNN was telling the truth in a society where journalists are jailed for doing so. The solution, he argues, is for the Chinese to stop advertising on CNN; and for the Chinese media to reach out to American viewers and show them what China really is. And a controlled media cannot do that, he points out.         
	Amid this turbulence, there are calls for restraint. Many intellectuals have publicly criticized the Carrefour boycott as self-defeating; in fact, on a TV programme, one nationalist academic supporting the boycott was shouted down by the others. The novelist, Han Han, has some advice for those comparing their present protests to the May Fourth movement of 1919, when Chinese students had marched on the streets against the Treaty of Versailles at the end of the First World War (the treaty handed over German-owned territories in China to Japan). This is what Han Han had to say to them: The two situations are totally different. Right now what we need is stability. Hold back your passions and show a gentle face, accept different voices. Its not yet the time now.         
	Violence, students are being told, will put off potential visitors to the Beijing Olympics. In fact, those instigating the youth to smash Westerners property are being perceived as part of the international conspiracy against the Beijing Olympics. In an unusually personal article, written after the Olympic Torch run in London, the Chinese ambassador to Britain, Fu Ying, hoped that after all this, Chinese youth will not grow totally disillusioned with the West.        
	Tailpiece: Workers at a Guangdong factory stopped work on an overseas order when they found that what they were mass producing were Free Tibet flags!

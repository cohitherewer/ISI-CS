                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             WORSE SERVED                                                    
	Thanks to the intransigence of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the outgoing parliament has passed little substantial legislation. That is not such a tragedy. There is at least one bill that, it is to be hoped, will never pass, and will indeed be buried and forgotten forever. It is a bill to amend the Post Office Act. It seeks to give the department of posts a monopoly of carriage of packages up to 300 grams. The post office wants to snatch this business away from couriers. It obviously thinks that it cannot compete with them. This is strange, since couriers charge so much more than the post office. The post offices speed post is a really speedy service; and it is no more unreliable than courier service. The post office does charge too much for additional weight. But on the whole, it carries letters more cheaply and at least as fast as couriers.        
	Why, then, do customers prefer expensive courier services? A major factor is that couriers have many more outlets in business districts. Most businesses have a courier round the corner; and many couriers offer to come and collect letters from the senders home or office. A sender has to find a post office, go there and queue to get a letter sent by speed post; he has only to ring up a courier, who will come and queue outside his office to collect the letter. The other factor is the effort put in to deliver a letter. If a postman does not find an addressee, he will leave a chit telling the addressee to collect the letter from a post office that may be miles away. There the addressee would have to persuade lackadaisical postmen to fish out his letter from the piles of undelivered mail. A courier, on the other hand, will leave at least one telephone number; once he is contacted, he will offer reasonable arrangements to reach the letter. It is no use trying to phone the post office; even if an addressee gets it on the phone, he is unlikely to get any further.        
	Thus it is the quality of service that makes the courier so superior a competitor to the post office, and it is this quality of service that the post office wants to deprive the customer of. It is not surprising that it does so; any hopeless competitor would like to wipe his betters out of existence. But it is a thoroughly retrograde move in todays world. In any other country, such a second-rate service would be pulled up by the minister; and if it can do no better, the government would privatize it. Indias caring government would not do that, since it places the welfare of postal trade unions before that of customers. But at least it must not kill the private courier service to assuage the trade unions.

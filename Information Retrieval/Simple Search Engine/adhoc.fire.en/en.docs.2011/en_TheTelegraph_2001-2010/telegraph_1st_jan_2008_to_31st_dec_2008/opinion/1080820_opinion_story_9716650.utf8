	Not an industry  A clerk-cum-typist at a remand home was dismissed from service due to alleged misconduct. He approached the Labour Court. Later the Bombay High Court held that a remand home for destitute children and orphans was outside the purview of the Industrial Disputes Act as it was not an industry. The home pleaded that the Labour Court ought not to have entertained the complaint in the first place. The Bombay High Court also added that the home worked in consonance with the Geneva Declaration, 1924, the Children rsquo;s Rights as ratified by the UNO in 1960, the World Summit and Convention of Children rsquo;s Rights, 1989, and the National Charter for Children, 2003. It ruled that the activities of the remand home were not commercial and that the provisions of the Bombay Children rsquo;s Act and the Juvenile Justice Act governed it. (Sarjerao Bhaurao Ekal vs S.K.

	Birth right  As a result of an anomaly in his date of birth in the service record book, a roller driver under the sub-divisional officer, PWD Rangla (National Highway), remained in service for two years beyond the valid date of his superannuation. His employers wanted to recover from him the salary and benefits that he had earned during the period he had allegedly overstayed in his job. When the petitioner approached the Gauhati High Court, it held that since he had worked during the period, his employers could not deprive him of his salary and proportionate benefits.

	Electricity dues  The electricity board filed a suit for the recovery of its dues from a sick industrial unit before the civil court at Hoshiarpur, Punjab. The company resisted the claim, citing Section 22 of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, which said that the consent of the BIFR (Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction) was necessary before a suit could be filed against it for the recovery of money. The Punjab and Haryana High Court maintained that Section 22 of the Act did not protect the company against the electricity board rsquo;s claim as an electricity bill was neither a loan nor an advance as defined by the Act.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FROM PROMISE TO PUZZLEMENT                              MUSIC      Fauzia Marikar                                                
	Something Old  Piano Classics, by Alistair Braganza, said the caption to the first part of the programme on August 30 at the Calcutta School of Music, featuring the debut of this young and promising pianist. The CSM has always provided a platform for young musicians during the monsoon season and this was the second of its kind this year. Alistair had chosen what promised to be a beautiful and well-distributed programme including works by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Bartk and Chopin. He began Beethovens Sonata in E Major, Opus 14, with an impressive display of technical dexterity, unfortunately interspersed with wrong notes and harmonies, occurring too often to be overlooked. Mendelssohns Rondo Capriccioso, the Rumanian Dances and Ostinato by Bartk and the Revolutionary tude by Chopin were played with similar despatch.        
	With Alistair, there is still much to be learnt (or taught) in the way of pedal usage, phrasing, the use or misuse of rubato and general attention to detail. All this is still at a stage of early development. He also has to learn how to relate to his audience. His approach showed a Michelangeloesque coldness that is not yet earned. His encore was the exciting Flight of the Bumble Bee by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. A few scary moments here, but it was carried off smartly. From winning gold medals at examinations to the lonely and frightening responsibility of a stage performance is a traumatic transition. This audience will look out for his development as a serious artist.        
	What can I say about the second half of the evening but that it was a puzzling, hastily-put-together presentation of a new department that might have done well to remain under wraps for a while longer? Thiri Poshaw was the genial and articulate compre of the demonstration programme, intended to explain the new computerized techniques, now used at the CSM, that are meant to add ease and power to teaching music students in general and singers in particular. The live singers gave the impression of being only just, and their performance had the tepid impact of amateur party entertainment, while the pianist, Saibal Sen, was in a different opera altogether.        
	The most musical element of the programme was the audio CD consisting of the counter- tenor, tenor and bass voices of Diganta Choudhury with the precise and expressive piano accompaniment of Avijit Kundu. Poshaw rather unnecessarily rounded it off by singing three love songs, again futilely accompanied by Saibal Sen.

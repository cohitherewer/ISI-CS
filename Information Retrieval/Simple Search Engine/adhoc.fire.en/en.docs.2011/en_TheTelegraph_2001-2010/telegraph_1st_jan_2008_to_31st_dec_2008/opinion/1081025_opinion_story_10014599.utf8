	Twelve children were killed and more than ten severely burnt in a Rajasthan village while making crackers illegally. This did not happen in a factory where they were hired as illegal child labour. They were all at home with their families  but they were working too. And this work was deemed unlawful, not because they were children, but because it is illegal to make crackers at home. This is what made it so easy for the district collector to deny the child-labour aspect of the accident with impunity, even when Rajasthan has the third-highest number of child labourers in the country.        
	Those who make laws and policies for children have an image of them doing hazardous work in secret factories after having been lured away from their homes by greedy middlemen. So the idea of rehabilitation, to restore them to their homes, is central to these laws and policies. It is also assumed that on returning home, they would promptly start going to school again. So the police make moving spectacles out of rescuing children from garment-making black-holes and taking them back home, assuming that they begin living with their families happily again. Yet the home is the place where the childrens work often takes the most relentless and invisible form. In a cruel travesty of the participation that the international discourse of childrens rights advocates high-mindedly, children from desperately poor families are treated as equals in their homes, where they are taken for granted as direct or indirect economic contributors. Families that farm or make bidis  both common in Rajasthan  often engage their children actively in this work, and at the expense of their schoolgoing. Little girls are sometimes spared certain forms of labour, but are then relied on to take charge of things at home so that their elders can go out to work. They have to do every kind of household chore round the clock, including childminding and grazing cattle. This is also work, too ubiquitous and banal to be noticed (though often hazardous as well), and it just as effectively prevents girls and boys from going to school, even when they are not actually being sent out to work in a way that the State would recognize.        
	In some rural communities, the home is also where the familys traditional skills and crafts, which are its means of livelihood too, are handed down to the children, for whom this ends up being work as well as education, but also something that could keep them out of school. The problem arises when the legal definition of child labour punishes the family for this, depriving it of a source of income and making it sink into worse poverty. Not all the work that children do at home is as dangerous as making crackers illegally. Some kinds of work can be made part of locally-adapted forms of education, bringing together community, home and school. Such models of combining education and work could point towards safe, practical and sustainable alternatives to the subjection of children to dangerous and exploitative labour on the one hand, and to ignorant and wrong-headed rescue missions on the other.

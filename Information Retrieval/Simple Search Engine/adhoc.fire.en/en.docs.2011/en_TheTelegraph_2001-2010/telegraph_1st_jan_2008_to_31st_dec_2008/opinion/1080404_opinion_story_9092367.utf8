	Agent Zigzag By Ben Macintyre, Bloomsbury, Rs 395        
	Fiction has not, and probably never will, produce an espionage story to rival in fascination and improbability the true story of Edward Chapman [picture], whom only war could invest with virtue, and that only for its duration. This was written by Robin Tin Eye Stephens who ran the principal interrogation centre during World War II. He couldnt have been more right. The life and career of Eddie Chapman, told here for the first time by Ben Macintyre with great brio and an enviable depth of research, is stranger than any work of fiction that even John le Carr could have imagined and crafted. This book reinforces the old clich about truth being older than fiction.        
	Chapman was arguably one of the most deceptive double agents of World War II. What is remarkable is that he recruited himself for the MI5. Before the war, after a tough childhood in the Durham coalfields and a brief stint in the Coldstream Guards, Chapman became a full-time and successful crook in London. The war found him in Jersey from where he was arrested by the Germans and sent off to a Nazi prison in Paris. Anyone else would have surrendered himself to fate, but Chapmans spirit was indomitable. He offered his services as a spy to the Germans. The German intelligence community, eager to sabotage the British war effort, accepted Chapmans offer, and the latter was lucky to enough to have found a powerful patron in Stephan von Gronning.        
	After his training, Chapman, on a December night in 1942, was dropped by parachute into the Cambridgeshire countryside. The first thing that he did was to surrender to the MI5. To his interrogating officers, among whom was Tin Eye Stephens, Chapman offered a treasure trove of information about the German spy establishment. It was decided to play him back into Germany as a double agent. Thus was born Operation Double Cross run by the redoubtable John Masterman, a Christ Church don, who ran the operation from his London club. Chapman was codenamed Zigzag.        
	He made his way back to Germany where he was hailed as a hero among spies and awarded the Iron Cross. He was moved to occupied Norway, from where he was infiltrated back into Britain. Till the end of the war, the Germans believed that Chapman was their agent. MI5, or the officers who ran him, often found him exasperating, but seldom doubted his loyalty and his courage.        
	Chapman had oodles of charm and was a compulsive womanizer. He left behind him a trail of women most of whom had no idea about his real occupation. Indeed, very little was known about Eddie Chapman till the MI5 opened its papers in 2001. Macintyre has mined these papers. He has an unerring eye for details and anecdotes. The writing is racy but not without deep analysis. This is a gem of a book and a must for all who are interested in the world of spies and espionage.

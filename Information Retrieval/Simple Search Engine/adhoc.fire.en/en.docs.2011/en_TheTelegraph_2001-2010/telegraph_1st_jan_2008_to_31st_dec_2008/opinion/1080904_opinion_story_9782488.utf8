	John McCain is a man of surprises. He came across as the perfect maverick when he hinted at Joseph Lieberman  the Independent Democrat from Connecticut endorsing him for the presidency  as his possible running mate. Faced with outraged Republicans, he relented, but with another equally contentious candidate, the 44-year-old governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. Mr McCain was possibly playing truant when he suggested Mr Liebermans name, but choosing Ms Palin as his running mate is nothing short of recklessness. At a glance, Ms Palin seems to be the hardcore conservatives poster girl: pro-god, pro-life, pro-gun. Of her five children, her eldest son is serving in Iraq, while the youngest is just a few months old. She is committed to fighting wasteful expenditure, corruption and earmarks. Before taking up the governors office, she was mayor of an obscure suburb, but did her job with righteous gusto. Her biggest accomplishment as mayor was to increase sales tax to build a hockey rink; she even banned certain books at the local library. Her politics is directly endorsed by the Almighty. As she said in a speech in Wasilla, it was Gods will that the federal government give her $30 billion for building a gas pipeline in Alaska. Fervent Christians should be pleased to see that Ms Palins heart is in the Right place.        
	If Mr McCains reason for choosing Ms Palin is to appease the Christian rightwing, he need not have tried so hard. In the 2,000 primaries, it was this vote bank that had chosen George W. Bush over him. But Mr Bushs pitiful debacle at home and abroad has weakened the Christian conservatives  Mr McCain could have well kept a dignified distance from this path of appeasement. Ms Palin is more of a liability than an asset for his party. Given his relative inexperience in politics, Barack Obama took a shrewdly calculated decision by having Joseph Biden as his running mate. Apart from his seniority and wide experience in Washington, Mr Bidens understanding of foreign policy is exceptionally sharp. Ms Palins ideas, in contrast, sound risible, even a bit fanatical. The war in Iraq, she said, is a task from God, just as the pregnancy of her 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, is probably another divine gift. But this is a gift Mr McCains party would have been better off without. The US vice-president might have a nominal role, but choosing the running mate is the first executive decision that a presidential nominee has to make. Mr McCain has shown a singular lack of insight at the very outset.

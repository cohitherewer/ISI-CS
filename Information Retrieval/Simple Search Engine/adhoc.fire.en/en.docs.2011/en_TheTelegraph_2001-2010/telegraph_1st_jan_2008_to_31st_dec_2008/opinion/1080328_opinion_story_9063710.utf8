	Range of ailments                  
	Sir  Here is an interesting chain of events: On February 18, 2008, the minister of state for defence, Rao Inderjit Singh, asked for a national debate on the entry of middlemen into defence deals. In doing this, Singh went against the governments stand. On February 29, the finance minister, P. Chidambaram, proposed a 10 per cent hike in defence allocation for the financial year 2008-2009. The revised sum of Rs 105,600 crore is more than twice the amount spent by the government on education and health. It may be a coincidence, but soon afterwards, retired army bosses were noted writing in national dailies on the nitty-gritties of arms procurement and emphasizing the need to procure early.           
	On March 9, the Central Bureau of Investigation arrested the arms dealer, Suresh Nanda, and his son, Sanjeev, along with a deputy director of the income tax department and a chartered accountant, blowing the lid off the arms procurement nexus (Arms dealer, son in CBI net, March 10). On March 10, we learnt about the grounding of the ageing fleet of the INS Viraats Sea Harrier jump jets. On the same day, the defence minister, A.K. Antony, put deals with Israel for Barak missiles on hold after the CBI arrested the Nandas.           
	Let there be some clarity and transparency in our defence deals. Why not include representatives of the comptroller and auditor general in committees to ensure that there is no foul play in matters of national security?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is surprising, to say the least, that INS Viraat, a functioning aircraft carrier, is without a single combat aircraft at present (Aircraft carrier without aircraft, March 10). Unless a country has long-range strategic interests and the military strength to back it up (as the United States of America does), a single aircraft-carrier in a navy is just a showpiece. India may be the fourth largest military power in the world according to certain statistics, but it is unlikely to make war thousands of miles away. Combat scenarios at sea and in the air have undergone enormous changes in the past few decades. Aircraft carriers by their very nature have to be heavily escorted and defended by other combat vessels, since a single strike that could sink a carrier would mean the end of that battle groups air arm. However, INS Viraats being without a single combat aircraft would have been alarming news had there been tension between India and its neighbours in the high seas right now.           
	Also, it may be asked how far it is necessary for India to have an aircraft carrier when the possible airstrike targets in hostile countries are well within the capability of land-based IAF aircraft. The same goes for the defence of strategic targets in India. Given the advances in stealth technology in submarines and aircraft, and high Mach cruise missiles that can be deployed at sea, the aircraft carrier by itself is more vulnerable than before. It is more of a curiosity. That is also why it makes no sense to keep it flying with the help of vintage jets, especially when these claim the lives of young cadets every year. Buying another satisfies the ego far more than it does the requirements of the army. Reports say that Viraat will be decommissioned as soon as Gorshkov is delivered. So there would be just the one carrier, not two or three, that would, theoretically at least, cover the western, eastern and southern seas of India. Increasing the fleet of stealth submarines and surface vessels like destroyers and missile frigates would be the most cost- effective way of securing Indias strategic interests.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Thought for food          
	Sir  I strongly believe that speculation in the commodity market is pushing the price of food articles upwards. It cannot only be because of the use of edible oils in car engines, as Dipankar Dasgupta suggests. But using this as an excuse, some traders are speculating heavily and the result is the common mans suffering (Links in the food chain, March 17). I would have been happier had Dasgupta provided statistical data showing clearly the quantity of edible oil diverted for transportation all over the world. We could then have been able to figure out whether the inflation in food prices matches the sudden upswing in edible oil consumption in cars.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Rahul Sengupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The rise in the price of foodgrains has caused severe hardship to large sections of the population across the world, particularly those in the underdeveloped and developing countries. Agricultural produce is always contingent upon natural calamities and other environmental factors which are beyond the control of man. Countries like India need to develop their agricultural infrastructure to meet the growing demand for food. Adequate production of foodgrains and proper storage and distribution facilities are foremost among them. The new slogan for developing countries should be Foodgrains for everyone, at reasonable prices.                     
	Yours faithfully,

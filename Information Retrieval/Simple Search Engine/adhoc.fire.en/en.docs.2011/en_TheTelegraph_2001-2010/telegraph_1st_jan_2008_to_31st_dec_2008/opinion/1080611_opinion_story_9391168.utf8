Diplomacy - K.P. Nayar                                                  
	Clinton will be missed. Bill that is. The saddest loss to American politics as a result of Hillary Clintons exit from the presidential primaries is the likelihood that her husband, Bill Clinton, will exit public life, perhaps never to return to the centre-stage.         
	A day before the last Democrats voted in the primaries, the former president said as much, in the strongest hint till then during his wifes 17-month-long campaign for the White House, that her bid for the most powerful job in the world was about to fold up. I want to say also that this may be the last day I am ever involved in a campaign of this kind, he said in a speech in South Dakota while stumping for his wife on June 2. I thought I was out of politics, till Hillary decided to run. But it has been one of the greatest honours of my life to go around and campaign for her for president.        
	There is no reason for Bill to remain in politics. After all, he earned more than $50 million from public speeches in the eight years since he left office. Even after his successor, George W. Bush, had completed one full term in office, Bill was in such high demand as a public speaker that in 2005, he had a speaking engagement during 352 out of the 365 days of that year. On a single day when he was visiting Canada, he made two speeches and received more money from those two addresses than what he had earned in a whole year at the White House.        
	What is truly amazing about the 42nd US presidents continued attraction as a speaker worldwide is that during the calendar year that he made one speech every day, as much as 80 per cent of his income from public speaking was given away to public causes. Imagine the personal fortune that he could have amassed if only he had decided to add that 80 per cent as well to his personal income instead of donating it for charitable purposes. It is highly unlikely that Bush will be in similar demand when he ceases to be president next year. But that is beside the point.              
	As Hillarys presidential campaign takes stock of what went wrong, the Clintons have compulsions that will force the former president to return to speech-making  and perhaps book-writing  instead of continuing to tinker with politics. The campaign has amassed a debt of $21 million as of April-end. A final figure will be known only by the end of this month. As it is, the April-end figure represents the largest presidential campaign debt in the US ever. The Clintons, it would seem, like to make history in whatever they do. They dont emulate others  not even their own peers.         
	To illustrate the contrast of the Clinton campaign with those of the others this year, Rudy Giuliani  Hillarys one-time rival for the Senate seat from New York, who suspended his presidential bid not very long before John McCain became the successful Republican nominee  has a campaign debt of merely $3.6 million. Besides, Hillarys $21 million debt has been the result of personal loans from her to the campaign to the tune of $11.4 million. If nothing else, recouping their personal money and paying off the campaign debt are reasons enough for Bill to return to the public speaking circuit as soon as possible.        
	For Bill and Hillary Clinton, having to make money  instead of relying on family wealth, as in the case of very many US politicians  to get them out of dire straits is nothing new. Bill was born into a poor family in Hope, Arkansas, and Hillarys early days in Illinois were modest. They were not rich  unlike the Bushes, for instance  when they came to the White House, and they left 1600, Pennsylvania Avenue with legal bills of about $12 million caused by Monica Lewinsky and other scandals, many of them persecutory at the instance of the American Right. In a sense, their huge, unpaid, legal bills forced Bill to write books and aggressively tap the speaking circuit. He may once again be forced to do so at the expense of any public role because of Hillarys failed presidential bid.        
	There are many who believe, of course, that it is premature to write Bill off, especially since Hillary could yet become US president, if not in 2009, then four or eight years later, depending on a variety of factors. The film producer, David Geffen, who made an unsuccessful bid for the Los Angeles Times last year, was an early supporter of the former president when he aspired for the White House in 1992. Geffen has switched support from the Clintons to Barack Obama this year. Geffens comment about the Clintons last year  everybody in politics lies, but they do it with such ease, it is troubling  finds an echo across America and many people, therefore, have concluded that anything Bill or Hillary may say in public about their future must be taken not with a pinch, but with spoonfuls of salt.        
	It remains a shadow over Obamas candidacy that he triumphed over Hillary with one of the narrowest of margins in US presidential politics. As of now, his majority over Hillary in the number of nominating delegates at the Democratic National Convention is very small indeed.        
	It does not augur well for the presumptive Democratic nominee at the August convention in Denver, Colorado, that Hillarys supporters  who believe that she lost only because she is a woman  are not yet reconciled to Obama as their president. Americas feminists are threatening to effectively boycott the presidential election in November by writing in Hillarys name in the ballot, marking their ballots present instead of casting a vote, wearing T-shirts emblazoned with a NObama sign or re-registering in election centres as independents instead of Democrats.              
	If all this negativism forces Obama to make Hillary his vice-presidential choice, Bill will continue to have a prominent role in the campaign during the next five months. And if an Obama-Clinton ticket is successful in November, the former president could yet be an un-elected co-vice-president for the next four years and an influence on Obamas White House. A big dilemma for Obama is the dire need to appeal to supporters of the Clintons in the coming weeks and months without appearing to co-opt her into his candidacy. Making her his running mate would go against one of the foundations of his presidential bid: changing the ways of Washington. Bill Clinton, despite his signal achievements as president  especially in social welfare and humanitarian programmes  reminds Americans of the moral decay in Washington, and a nadir in ethical standards in their national politics.        
	Yet, one thing is certain. Hillary can be counted on to be one of the storm troopers for the Democratic partys all-out bid in the next five months to capture the White House as well as to retain and increase the partys majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. That is the only way she can remain relevant in 2012, assuming that the Republican, John McCain, defeats Obama to become Americas 44th president. That ambition to set her sights on 2012 may be the reason why Hillary laid herself open to further rejection and humiliation by offering to be Obamas vice-presidential candidate in the dying hours of her presidential campaign. Another bid by Hillary for the White House will, of course, bring her husband back into politics, but as of now that is a very long shot.

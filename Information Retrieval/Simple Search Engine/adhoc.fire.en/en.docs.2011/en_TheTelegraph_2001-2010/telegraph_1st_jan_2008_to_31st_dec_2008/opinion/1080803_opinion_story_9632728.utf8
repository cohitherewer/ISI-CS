	Have money, will attack                  
	Sir  The recent assault of two security guards at the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture is not an isolated incident (Youths beat up RKM guards, July 27). Rich young mens audacious disregard for the law has been threatening civic concerns in the metros and in small towns. The alleged misbehaviour of the RKM guards with the wife of one of the attackers needs probing, but that is not a strong enough reason for such uncivil conduct. Wealth and social status should not be allowed to overturn the rule of law.           
	Yours faithfully,        Prasun Banerjee, Calcutta
        
	Dark days          
	Sir  The death of any young person is tragic. Ishmeet Singh was a talented singer who had won many hearts with his melodious voice and gentle manners. His sudden demise marks a big loss to the Indian entertainment industry. He was still in his teens when he won the Voice of India contest the year before last.           
	After Voice of India, Ishmeet went from strength to strength. His rise in the entertainment world could well have posed a challenge to many in the cutthroat world of Indian popular music. One can recall here the murders of T-series proprietor Gulshan Kumar and filmstar Divya Bharti. These murders have already proved that the film industry is no bed of roses.           
	Rumours are flowing thick and fast after Ishmeets death. Some of the quotes of the officials of the Maldives hotel where Ishmeet was found dead in the swimming pool are contradictory. Add to these the comments by Ishmeets family members about the singers reluctance to take a bath, and one grows suspicious about foul play.           
	Maldives is an international tourist hot spot. Ishmeets death is sure to hit the tourism industry there badly. Perhaps the hotel authorities and the Maldives government could do an independent probe to get to the bottom of the affair, and restore the image of the country.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

      
	Sir  Ishmeet Singh emerged as a rising star in Indias music scene after he won the Star Voice of India contest. News of his death, at the prime of his life, was shocking, to say the least. Delhi schools run by the Sikh community were closed to mourn his death. The gesture should have been taken up by all the schools in the capital, because the young singer had crossed the barriers of religion through his singing.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  It is amusing to read the advertisements of BSNL featuring various alluring schemes to draw in more customers. Does this public sector behemoth think it can fight the private telecom companies only through billboards and newspaper ads? When it comes to the quality of service and public relations, BSNL is perhaps the worst telecom company in India. The subscribers of Kharagpur Telecom Circle perhaps know this better than anybody else. It takes five attempts on an average for its CellOne and Excel subscribers to connect to a local number, and then the connection usually snaps after a few minutes. There has been no improvement in the situation over the last two years.          
	The BSNLs dial-up internet connection, NetOne, which is widely used by students for purposes of education, does not work most of the time. When BSNL officers are informed of this malfunctioning, they do nothing. It is this lack of accountability, among other things, of the BSNL personnel that is directly helping private operators to extend their business at the cost of BSNL. Cant the state of affairs be improved so that peoples faith in the public sector may be restored?                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A deeply personal expression
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A DEEPLY PERSONAL EXPRESSION                              Jayatsen Bhattacharya      MUSIC                                                
	Two things vie for attention in every Madhav Chari concert. His instructional fervour and, of course, his talent. Happily, his talent usually wins. This tussle was again evident during his solo effort  The Great American Songbook  at The Calcutta School of Music on June 21, under the joint aegis of CSM and the Public Affairs Office of the US Consulate General, Calcutta. While his martinet-like intolerance for shutterbugs amuses, it also bespeaks his abject devotion to his art.         
	Chari flagged off with Gershwins Embraceable you  a tame choice for a concert-opener, which immediately showed his scant regard for formula as well as his famed interpretative prowess. At times he galloped, and at times hugged, the rhythm with some non-urgent phrasing. A similar treatment greeted another time-tested standard, My funny valentine. It was a parallel exercise in toying with the tempo and chiselling the melody. For someone who will wager his last penny to prove that improvisation, constant and continuous, forms the DNA of jazz, small wonder that each piece in Charis repertoire becomes a sure exhibition of this credo. The song is you  a jewel from the Kern-Hammerstein oeuvre and a pet in most of Sinatras concert selections  represented a plucky interplay of robustness and tonal elasticity, though the song begged the mellowness of a Steinway grand rather than the efficient digital piano preferred by Chari.        
	The same was amiss during the genteel I didnt know what time it was, where again Charis unfettered passion fell short a tad primarily because of engineered, rather than natural, acoustics: plastic, it appeared, was no match for ivory. Of course, no such deficiency was remotely evident by the time Chari decided to chronicle the advent of Latin-American elements in the increasingly secular grammar of jazz. Porters iconic Love for sale revelled in a performance marked by outstanding consistency of tempo and melodic extravagance. Again, during an Ellington classic, In a mellow tone, Chari mothballed his usual professorial aura, indulging in some welcome showmanship, deftly controlling a strain that equally courted the ploddy and the delicate. And delicate, too, was the choice of his succeeding composition, one that has, over the years, straddled the hugely engaging version of the hyper-energetic Manhattan Transfer and the starkly sober effort by a presbyterian Nat King Cole. A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square is indeed unique in its ability to beckon and haunt  and at different times.        
	This Sherwin-Maschwitz masterpiece countenanced a Chari who stayed shy  thankfully  of tinkering with a disarmingly unusual melody, but not without fting the piece with a stoically undulating lilt that was clearly expressive of one belief he holds most dear  jazz music is simply a deeply personal expression.

	As a report card on the economy, the Economic Survey for 2007-08 tabled by the finance minister, P. Chidambaram, in Parliament on Thursday is an objective document. The key messages of the report focus on the two factors that have been at the forefront of policy debate for the last few months: growth and inflation. To take growth first, the annual review of economic trends verified what has been known for some time: the growth rate for 2007-08 will not be as high as the 9.4 and 9.6 per cent recorded in the last two years respectively, but will be lower at 8.7 per cent. Falling exports, rising commodity prices and a global economic slowdown have all contributed to the deceleration in growth. The finance ministers report acknowledges that on the fiscal side, reforms are needed to ensure greater agricultural output, given rising food prices. This will involve resolving supply chain management issues in agriculture: reducing waste and more public investment in building agricultural and other infrastructure, from storage to logistics and transport. The focus of fiscal measures and reform will be on improving agricultural productivity, a challenging task.         
	On the inflation front, the survey also tacitly acknowledges the limited influence that the government has on monetary policy, and appropriately so. Reducing interest rates to boost growth may not be the answer. The estimates of inflation as measured by the wholesale price index included in the report appear a little low, probably because the report has been prepared a few weeks ago. Inflation has been on the rise, and consumer inflation has risen more rapidly. The leeway for reducing policy interest rates in such a scenario is narrow. So it is unlikely that come April, the Reserve Bank of India will reduce them, as many in corporate India hope. The additional challenge of managing the capital flows and their impact on the exchange rate, as the survey notes, are a further complication.        
	The Economic Survey has, however, left some things out. The finance minister reiterated his intentions of containing the fiscal deficit, but he has not been specific on how he is going to do it. The Sixth Pay Commissions recommendations are due very soon, and if accepted, their impact on the government expenditure bill is likely to be significant. The report is also silent on the fiscal impact of the redemption of the first set of oil bonds starting in 2009. The government has capped fuel prices, raising the cost from 1.8 per cent to 2.7 per cent in the last 12 months, even as global crude prices went up by 61 per cent to $102 a barrel. The chances of achieving the targets laid out in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act seem remote. How Mr Chidambaram addresses these challenges as he presents the budget today will be closely watched.

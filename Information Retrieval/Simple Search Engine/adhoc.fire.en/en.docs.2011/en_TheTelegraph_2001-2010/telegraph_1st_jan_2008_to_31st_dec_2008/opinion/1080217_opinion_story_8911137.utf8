                                                                                                                 STATE OF THE ART                                                          
	Would todays state-of-the-art cinematography have made Rashomon or Pather Panchali a better film? This is one of many questions that might be asked in the wake of a stimulating little speech made recently by Robert Redford. The 71-year-old American actor was speaking at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. People from all over the world meet here to debate the future of the mobile phone industry, and Redford seems excited about linking this future with the future of emerging and independent voices in film. He admits to enjoying watching films on his phone, and had launched a project a couple of years ago to make short films for mobile phones. Yet, Redford seems firm about not abandoning certain perennial benchmarks for cinema as art. According to him, YouTube and stuff have democratized creative audiovisual communication. But one should still be able to distinguish between real films and junk, and do so on the basis of nothing other than quality. So, rather than seeing art as being revolutionized by technology, he is unusual and thought-provoking in seeing technology as being driven by art: The more art blends with technology, the more it will drive it.        
	This primacy given to art in Redfords statement sees technology as the means to an end, the quality of which ought to be determined by aesthetic and intellectual, rather than technical, criteria. In cinema, extremely sophisticated technical resources and skills would come to nothing if the film itself is not properly thought through and imagined. What Redford is highlighting here are intelligence, imagination and creativity, rather than cleverness. It is possible to argue, though, that technology itself is a kind of Modern Art: the most state-of-the-art computer is also a triumph of creativity. This is not merely because the computer looks beautiful, but a certain kind of thinking  brilliant, inspired, even visionary  might have gone into its creation.        
	But to turn the tables and imagine technological sophistication as being inspired and compelled by art remains an important claim for the abiding value of the latter. It is an idea that Leonardo da Vinci would have immediately understood. Think again of the cyberworld. So much of what is strikingly innovative in it  the games, for instance  have been thought up by people whose grounding has been in the arts: artists, designers, storytellers, musicians. And then, think of Beethoven. It is because he was literally battering down the traditional harpsichord with each new ground-breaking sonata, that the pianoforte, as it is made now, started being manufactured in the early half of the 19th century, with a greater and sturdier range of sound. So, did technology drive Romanticism, or Romanticism technology?
